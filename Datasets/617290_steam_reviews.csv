The main story is just a mess, with nothing too clear for you to go after, you just go on and on about different places fighting enemies, and this would not be a problem if the movement of this game weren't so clunky and slow. The game also doesn't have enough loot to get apart from killing bosses. The theme I just think it's too generic and all over the place because of the game story.

The combat itself is not bad, it has some flaws with the hitbox, but that itself does not make up to the whole game being good. 

I just did not enjoy this game enough for me to like it. So this is my crappy review

the visuals are weak and uninspired artistically though very pretty. many of the areas are very open and empty. the lack of music while not in combat makes the whole thing feel lifeless. I can understand if they wanted you to feel lonely, but they didn't get the details of that right and instead it just feels empty. that's one reason why playing with a friend improves the experience so much, their voice fills in that void that was perhaps unintentionally created. 

there's also an overreliance on breakables being your main source of income. smashing them is a tedious endeavor but if you skip over it you won't be getting much of the game's central currency, scrap.  

finally the game's class system is a bit mis-representative. every character you create can eventually have every trait and every weapon, the classes are really just what you start with. it's more ""starting gear"" than a ""class"" and it would help assuage some complaints if it had been labeled as such. 

now for the good parts: 
the gunplay is immensely satisfying and the AI is very good, they occasionally dodge shots and run for cover if they're ranged. some enemies  teleport around just to confuse you. the weapon variety is amazing, with most of the standard rifle and shotguns covered, but also including things like a laser sniper that shoots black holes or a bee gun that shoots swarms of insects. 
side note: it's not really a looter-shooter per se, because you only get one of each gun and you upgrade them through farming materials. you also don't get drops, you find weapons out in the wild in the same place each time, or craft them from boss parts that you're always gauranteed. that is where the dark souls comparisons come from (well that and the dragon hearts and crystals).

the structure of the campaign is unique, it's not a roguelike but has elements from them (although one of the DLCs contains a classic roguelite mode). instead you are given one of a few modules during your playthrough and you can reroll these at any time, but you have to start from the beginning. this means your second playthrough may be wildly different from your first if you get all different modules.  each dimension also has it's own enemy visual variety with earth having the tree inspired Root, and other places having more humanoid obstacles. it really lends an air of quality and polish that the enemies don't stay the same throughout. 

all in all I enjoyed my time with a game that put a fresh spin on some concepts that are starting to grow a bit old like the soulslike estus flask and bonfire systems and procedural generation. I look forward to trying the sequel after I've exhausted this one to it's bones. I just hope there's less barrel smashing in it.",1708883041,1708883041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm glad i got it on sale, cause it is not worth the $40 price tag. The difficulty is inflated by throwing more and more enemies at you per encounter instead of any meaningful, mechanical changes like you'd expect. 

The gun play, world, and story are all great, but it feels hollow. It feels like there should be more to the game and it just doesn't satisfy that soulsbourne itch. The game is trying to be too many things at once and doesn't have enough meat on the bone to really hook me.

Minuscule amounts of customization. New weapons and armor are rare to come across and your options are very few. Its fun to play with your friends for a few hours but nothing long term. It's designed to be replayed many times over to be able to experience all of the different dungeons and events, but it was difficult going through it once. (It was boring as hell)

The end of the game is abrupt and left me stunlocked. I really wish there was more to it. Maybe Remnant 2 will be better, but i'm going to wait for it to be on sale like its prequel.

Before I begin, it's worth noting that I didn't try playing the game in co-op. I did some research beforehand and found some enthusiastic people claiming that the game was excellent to play solo.

That being said, i played solo and with very low expectations.

The only thing I had in mind was that the game was marketed by fans as a ""Dark Souls with guns,"" and as I am a reluctant fan of the studio's old games (when it was called Vigil), i knew it would likely be a somewhat uncreative mishmash of various other titles, presented competently but without much personality (I was correct on this point).

I played for a few hours, and what I saw didn't make me want to continue playing. But it's not a bad game in the practical sense. The gameplay is responsive, the combat is well-balanced (for co-op), the performance is great, bugfree, and it has a relatively competent visual style.

For all intents and purposes, it's a functional piece of software.

But it's also a lousy game to play solo. And no, this is not ""Dark Souls with guns.""

So...

This game gives a very bad first impression.

You are introduced by a tutorial as subtle and unintrusive as a jackhammer at 5 in the morning (which I recommend skipping right away). It takes a while to get started.

You can smell the overblown AA budget in the first few minutes.

Darksiders has always been a shallow melodrama, but at least it had a kind of mythology giving texture to the game's fiction. It also had charismatic characters and a playful comic book tone. Good music. Various elements to enrich what would otherwise be a forgettable Zelda clone. Remnant seems more empty and soulless than a game made by Ubisoft.

I'm genuinely puzzled about how ""Dark Souls with guns"" became something. Has no one ever played Dark Souls before? It's as if the game is just a handful of mechanics and not a carefully curated single-player experience with planned encounters with varying difficulty, a strong emphasis on enemy variety, level design, atmosphere, and a implicit storytelling structure that emerges through the player's experience and that can be enriched by their curiosity.

No, my friends, just like any other game previously made by this team, Remnant is a hodgepodge of copies of other games organized cohesively and without a drop of originality. And it doesn't take the best from its influences. Just a thing or two. 

It could be worse, of course, but everything I saw, just made me want to play the games that served as the foundation.

Remnant seems to alternate between a poor man's version of The Last of Us, with its generic post-apocalyptic visuals, less attention to detail, and less personality than Darksiders 3 and its repetitive, closed, procedural setups of tunnels where you are relentlessly harassed by waves of harmless enemies.

One moment you explore wide and empty streets with simplistic, artificial ambiance, exploring destroyed buildings and shops to collect resources, killing a minimal variety of enemies practically unable to deal with you.

Afterward, you go down the tunnels. Basically labyrinthine dungeons with different flavors, also infested with repeated enemies, but implemented even more randomly than on the surface.

I basically progressed, encountered a strong enemy surrounded by small enemies, dealt with them, walked a few meters, and the same random setup appeared again. And again. And again. Sometimes the stronger enemy was different, but mostly not. This five or six times until the tunnel exit, where i arrive at another section of shallow exploration in the streets and buildings... To then arrive at the next section of tunnels with the same enemies and the same random combat set-up... 

I did this three times.

Above, the loop's pace is enjoyable, even if the combat lacks dynamics or any sense of structure. You simply walk and kill enemies thrown in your way without much consideration. Below, it's just tedious.

Sometimes a stronger, spongier enemy appears, and then you have to be a bit more careful, but it's nothing noteworthy. Nothing that feels planned or out of the ordinary.

I played quite relaxed on Nightmare, and if it weren't for the tremendous damage dealt by enemies per hit, I don't think I would have died even once until the point where I stopped.

You also don't feel like you're discovering your way, nor do you feel any apprehension when you reach a new place and don't know what you'll have to deal with. The design seems so simplistic and predictable that it's genuinely hard to be surprised or have any sense of immersion.

After three hours of playing, I had already killed hundreds of the same type of enemy and faced a boss (which was basically a slightly stronger, but red, version of a normal enemy) with an incredible arsenal of [i]three different attacks[/i] for me to learn and that would be considered a complete joke if not for the artificial tactic of inflating difficulty with ads.

After five hours, I was still killing the same enemies, walking through the same underdesigned spaces, using the same weapons from the beginning.

Well, this game doesn't compare to Dark Souls in practically any aspect. And frankly, even Darksiders 3 did a better job of copying.

Some mechanical elements were directly taken from From Software's design (just like in Darksiders 3), but in practice, Remnant is simply a common third-person shooter with a generic integrated RPG system and stamina management to limit dodge abuse.

Shooting enemies that pose no threat to you doesn't have significant appeal beyond a few hours.

Melee has that sense of weight and deliberation expected from a ""Soulslike,"" but it's so dispensable that I barely felt the urge to use it outside of specific and convenient situations.

As a cooperative experience, it has brainless, loose, and uncommitted design to avoid confusion. It seems deliberately simple and mediocre so that social interaction fills the gaps that would be filled by good game design in a purely single-player game. 

It's a game made to be played with others, so I don't recommend wasting time with it if you don't plan to do so. It's not the worst thing in the world, and it could, being very optimistic, improve later on, but without a doubt, it seemed like a waste of time to me.

So... for those planning to play solo, I don't recommend it.",1707950036,1707962987,False,27,6,0.591918468475341797,0,True,False,False

They tried to make a soulslike but added ads to almost every boss fight.
They tried to make a mix between melee and ranged but melee is hardly viable above normal.
They tried to make a gear upgrade system but they linked it to mobs level effectively canceling eachother out.
To their credit they did make survival mode which is really fun but mob leveling there is linked to time passed alive, which basically punishes you for exploring turning what should be an endurance marathon into a speedrun.
Levels are random, which sounds good but it almost never is executed correctly, such is the case here having random garbage spawns with a bad spread, you have half the enemies jumping you at once a lot of the time and then just run like an idiot because there's nothing anywhere near.

The game is for the most part, pretty good. But I don't recommend single player.

The main reason I recommend against buying this game is that Melee is an option.
I went through the whole game as melee, I kicked serious butt. Basically every enemy fell to me like they were nothing. It was brilliant.

So what's my problem with the game? There are two boss fights that cannot be done as melee. One in the middle of the game and the last boss. 
I got help for the middle of the game one, but my friend no longer wanted to play Remnant for the last boss, so it just couldn't be done.

I went through the entire game, only to not be able to beat the last boss.
Why is melee an option, if you cannot complete the story as melee. The last boss is flying, cannot be melee'd.

If you have no interest in melee and enjoy multiplayer, definitely give this a go, it's worth a shot. But if like me, you enjoy playing melee and charging enemies head on, this game is not for you. It was a TON of fun getting to the last boss. But getting to the end and not being able to do it really sucks. It's like watching a great TV show that gets cancelled. You're left on a cliffhanger. Super disappointing.

Things this game does right:
Shooting, the guns all sound good, they feel good to fire, it's great.
Outfits, though you cannot transmog, there's some wonderful looking gear in this game.
Multiplayer, the game ran super smoothly when I multiplayered it, it was good fun to play with a friend.
Replayability, you will be grinding the same levels multiple times, there's different bosses and loot you'll find each time, there's actually a super useful website I'll drop into the comments if I can remember it. The website checks your last autosave and tells you what loot you'll get, this is amazing for time saving!

Things this game does wrong:
Replayability, did I list this twice? Yes, it's great for the first while, but without the aforementioned website, you're going to find yourself repeating things a lot, this can burn you out.
Melee, as I complained about before, there are two bosses (Technically three) that cannot be melee'd, this is hugely disappointing.
Scaling, this is a huge one. Enemies eventually get ridiculously strong and it's based on how much you upgrade your gear, which is super weird. You upgrade your gear to take less damage, so the enemy starts doing more damage to compensate... this makes no sense. It's to stop you becoming OP, but it's still super bizarre. They have a redit post explaining it, I'll link that too. But I feel like if you have to explain your enemy scaling in multiple paragraphs on reddit, then your level scaling is convoluted.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the game more than I did.",1625255644,1707601004,False,4,9,0.471551686525344849,1,True,False,False

The problem with this is we had to keep backtracking to the beginning of the map each time. Unfortunately, this made the game unplayable. It seems to be a relatively frequent complaint by people from looking online. You would not expect this to happen, especially given the game uses P2P (peer-to-peer) connectivity (so, no servers), but we have played a LOT of P2P games over the last decade and have almost no disconnects ever (like, maybe 1 or 2 times a year?). We were even having disconnects while connecting via LAN. Our computers are extremely high end, so it isn't a resource issue (64 GB of RAM, 7800X3D and RTX 4090).

Coming from the Dark Souls series and hearing here and there that Remnant was a souls like but with FPS, I bought the game with hopes high and fell from high. 

Bosses are uninteresting, their difficulty only comes from the tremendously high amount of ads they spawn. Areas repeat themselves to the point where you recognise patterns and places, and can even tell that you are at the end of a dungeon just because it's the same tileset repeating. 

Had multiple bugs too with immediate death or a restart of the game being required.

Also, after trying here and there weapons I found, I ended up doing the entire game with the starting weapon of the class I chose because nothing really... fit. Boss weapons felt meh, forced to have a mod as well which makes custom mod that you get utterly useless.

Anyway, the game it self isn't that bad, it's just disappointing for me, and not very enjoyable in the end because of ad quantity spawning, as well as uninteresting boss fights (especially last boss which was a HUGE letdown).

I did the entire game in coop with a friend and we had a hard time just JOINING each other. Session wasn't found or appearing, had to restart the game more than once or going back to main menu, it once took us almost half an hour just to be able to play together.

Note: I DON'T own the DLCs, which apparently add quite a few weapons and armours on top of the base game.",1707219782,1707220012,False,3,0,0.50455009937286377,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is fun for the most part, but I really do not think that the game utilises difficulty settings correctly. All they seem to do is inflate enemy damage and health numbers, to the point that even when not on the hardest difficulty you'll be cut down in just a couple of hits, even if you're going for a tank build.
The way the world can be randomized for repeated runs of different worlds is an interesting idea and works well enough, but when you need that one item it can really feel as if you're just running through the world. This could've been implemented better if there was some sort of system that told you the items that you could find for the run, so you can at least know it's there and enjoy the journey a bit more.

- While it lacks skippable cut scenes, it effectively blends Dark Souls challenging game-play with a shooter twist. 

- The procedurally generated maps add both complexity and replay value, with bosses and items rotated through RNG. (use Remnant world analyzer for god sake! will save you time.)

- Bosses are unique with some bearing resemblance to Dark Soul bosses. (you'll know when you see it, trust me.)

- Co-op makes all the difference with synced progression, omitting one particular achievement that is host-locked so be warned. (Other Voices)

BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS BEYOND. This is the definitive Gun-souls and Co-Op-Souls game. Controls are tight, weapons are cool. The adventure mode is a really interesting and cool take on things.

Everything went well for the first impression. The intro, sorta tutorials and stuff was really decent and kinda immersive even tho i entirely dislike the basic lore. The gameplay is AMAZING. Its honestly like way better than any other soulslike ive played, better than every entry in the Souls Series. You can play this game just perfectly with mouse and keyboard and thats absolutely dope. Movesets, weapon mods and such are fun and theres always lots of weight to hits. Dodge rolling and vaulting is very smooth and reliable. Bosses are unique enough and offer a nice challenge. So i really enjoyed all of that...

Now here is the FUNDAMENTAL issue this game has which is gear variety. 3 bioms deep into the game im pretty much still running around with my tutorial loadout. I found an entirety of 2 boss weapons and 1 armor set in three entire bioms when exploring every little bit of it carefully. This has gotten very frustrating and honestly just boring and dull. Running around with always the same stuff. Also just got a single amulet which was easily missable. Rings drop a ton tho, got like 10 or 15 of those and theyre cool and useful but theyre the only gear type thats in the game for some reason. Bosses only got a single option to forge out of their ressource, a single weapon, no choices. And 75% of bosses only ""drop"" a weapon mod on top of that. Its hillarious.

That issue basically makes character progression kinda non existent. The ""level ups"" offer so few impact on your actual char that they dont really matter apart from hp and perhaps endurance. The only thing you actually progress is leveling up weapons and armors with mats in order to higher their stats, which is satisfying ill give you that. So overall there is no char progress at all, no loadout-ing at all in this title. If you combine that with the randomly generated maps and dungeons, which also get repetetive quickly because few assets, the entire thing makes you lose interest quite fast. Literally the only reason that i kept playing for was because the combat was so good and i still had a bit of hopes up that something would change and i could actually get my hands on new gear. Hell even the trader in the hub only sells like 2 or 3 basic weapons and never restocks. Oh man..


Couldve been a really solid, really good game but i dont know for whatever weird reason devs decided to make you play through the game with kind of a single loadout.

Despite its foolish and predatory RPG mechanic of always making enemies scale slightly higher than your gear score I was able to use brutal cunning and the power of google to reason that the crossbow which fires 5 bolts is pretty deece when paired with the completely overpowered starting set for hunters (reduces spread, increases ranged + weakpoint damage), and more importantly it is very funny to impale your enemies' skulls and torsos with sharpened fence posts. Somehow a weapon the size of a light crossbow is able to fire these. I am amused.

The game's bosses (except for the Subject DLC) are awash with artificial difficulty (the antichrist of soulslike games), for example random unavoidable roars which can and will stun you into exploding adds, or bosses completely lacking weak points or who may stand afar of the arena in order to hilariously invalidate any weapon that isn't the assault, laser or hunting rifles, the first of which [spoiler]you will never acquire[/spoiler]. The developers laugh hysterically at those who bring shotguns and melee builds, which they put into the game as a trap, [spoiler]and you fell for it, you fool, you utter buffoon[/spoiler]. The Subject blahdeblah DLC's bosses are more fairly designed but also ridiculously much easier with several of them spending too much time setting up Dance Dance Revolution positioning mechanics and forget that they could clean you up in 5 seconds with a few lazy melee swings. Still pretty fun though.

One less important feature which I nevertheless find interesting is how the game still puts a machine pistol into your hand at the start of one of the boss fights despite the devs being perfectly aware that nobody has ever enjoyed this 'feature' in the last several years. To their credit they repeated this supposed foolishness with great deliberation in the Subject DLC. I intuitively understand this to be a purposeful troll in order to make the thousands of peasants who play their game confused and incredibly angry and so I am therefore 100% behind this impressive work of tomfoolery and wish them luck in future japes. Capable pranksters are they.

If you are wondering how all of this this criticism (or is it?) adds up to an enjoyable game, it may have something to do with having modded the game for double ammo and a first person viewpoint. The first change makes it so that you don't have to ration out your ammo between two weapons which ideally have applications for different situations (I mostly used long range crossbow for long range + dps and the Defiler for personal defence and burst weak point damage), which is a boring and stupid thing to have to do. The second transforms the game into one where situational awareness is necessary rather than automatic, due to no longer having a clownishly large over-the-shoulder POV (which works against you in tight quarters or when fighting large bosses you have to look up at i.e. most of them), and where sound cues are more important - and therefore you actually listen to the game's impressive sound design - and I find it to be much better that way, especially when the sound of launching a dark souls great arrow out of a pistol crossbow triggers right next to your ear. If I'm being honest that probably made up a disproportionate portion of my enjoyment, so your mileage may vary slightly. Uhh... while I'm at it, not all of this game's mods actually explain whether to put their .PAKs in the PAK folder or a ~mods folder in the .paks folder, so have fun figuring that out through trial and error.

I bought it with friends a while ago. But the game didn't land and technical issues convinced us to refund it.

Years later I decided to give Remnant another go since it was free on Gamepass and some YouTubers talked highly of the game.
And boy oh boy. It is just not fun, I felt like I played it to kill time more than anything.

First are foremost, its similarity to Souls starts and ends with a dodge roll and stamina bar. However, nothing but rolls and sprinting use stamina, so there is no pressure to manage it. Beyond that there is nothing souls like to speak of.

The graphics, art design, and areas are well done, I can give it that. Every place looks pretty, and feels like it could have been interesting.

The plot, and characters are one-dimensional. I skipped a lot of spoken dialogs except tree mother, the immortal, bug lady and found logs in Ward 13. Most characters have no clue ""what's going on"" so you don't really get much from them but small talk. I won't spoil the story but imagine a very cool universe and your job is to explore and inquire nothing of it. Shoot some aliens.

Gameplay-wise wise you travel within several biomes fighting their respective 3 or so enemies. Each biome has unique enemies but all enemies fall into a few archetypes with near-identical move sets, AI & roles. Guys who rush, attack twice, and wait for you to retaliate. Guys who maintain a distance and shoot. Guys who rush, throw exactly two projectiles, then rush more, guys who explode. Different looks but it always feels the same. The maps themselves are randomly generated as I understand but there is no point in exploring save to grind upgrade materials. Don't expect any lore or meaningful experiences off the beaten path. Occasionally special enemies spawn in to fabricate some challenge or variety but they generally don't do much unless they catch you with your pants down. Despite travelling to new areas you always feel like you're doing the same thing, I never needed to adjust how I played with the exception of a handful of boss fights. While there is a variety of bosses you can fight they all follow the same formula. Fight to x% life, spawn wave of enemies, fight to y% life, spawn a wave of enemies, fight to z% life, etc. There are rare exceptions, a moth boss and the last boss which played a little differently. That was it. No boss fight is interesting or memorable. 

The game also suffered from some wild difficulty spikes. Obviously it's intended to be played with friends, I know that's a big hook, but I played alone since mine didn't care to try it again.

Mobs are harmless and just make you get from point A to point B slower. Special enemies require your attention before you mop up mobs and if you get an unlucky spawn they can end you quickly. I had a pretty OP aoe healing skill that could out heal most incoming damage but certain seemingly plain attacks can instantly kill you and it feels unfair. Or not telegraphed well enough. 

The bosses were hard but manageable even for a solo player- however- there are some bosses who fly. Rip melee builds. I kept pretty balanced in my build but those bosses were very un-fun fights. Imagine if souls popped in a boss you could only hit with bows...


I never needed to change my armor, I went through the entire game with the starter set and the same two guns. You can upgrade everything with iron and because this is about 'achieving big numbers' simply upgraded and stuck with the largest digits throughout. Traits are a cool concept but felt mostly meaningless, I understand they can affect certain bosses or story beats but I don't feel like there was any such boss or beat that mattered. Many traits and skills felt kind of useless but that might just be me.

Remnant is an attempt at a 'soulslike with guns' by people who utterly failed to grasp souls likes in the first place. Enemies are the stars of the show in souls likes. The user changes in order to win. Remnent gives you a tidal wave of the same mob and if you die you just need to grind some iron for bigger numbers. They had a cool idea & world but execution killed it.

I also tried the starting sequence of the sequel Remnant 2 on gamepass but dropped it immediately.

The gameplay is identical. Comically so. Starting Remnant 2 after beating 1 feels like I just booted up a graphics mod and continued. Remnant 2 has nicer models and textures but you start in the same place, same enemies, or close to it. You also get a sidekick who adds what could be called a ""Marvel Phase 4"" flavor to the game which took the game from just boring to simply annoying.

The thing that absolutely sucks is in multiplayer survival mode if a player dies they have to wait for the other player to beat a boss to be able to be revived.  That would be fine if you didn't randomly just die from walking down stairs or across uneven ground.  People have said this glitch has been around forever so will most likely never be patched but it is beyond frustrating to have a good run going and then just die for no reason at all (and not be revivable with a dragon heart).  I wish they would fix that like don't let latency/lag excuse exist I get it thinks you fell off the world but you just were walking on the stair or down a sloped hill.

Now I understand that these kinds of games aren't my type but somehow, I like Remnant a lot more.

While Dark Souls and Bloodborne worlds are more diverses and rich of lore, Remnant offers a different approach to the genre. I personally like the graphics, the world design, the gameplay, the resetting feature and the ability to play coop. 

My main complain about this game is that I usually play solo and playing solo is boring at times, a lot repetitive and quite tough when fighting bosses. Sure the game is rewarding but something's missing. You can choose to play public and let other players join your game but honestly, I've played the game for 12h and only one player join my game once! I hope the devs fix this feature by adding an option to ""call"" for other players when needed because otherwise you are forced to beat the game solo.

The length of the main story even together with DLCs is pretty humble and probably the result of budget constraints. Instead developers put their bet on replayability of small self-contained parts of the story called adventures. And it kind of works, especially if you are a goal oriented person that enjoys collecting gear pieces you are missing and trying new builds.
Most bosses are really well designed and executed with the exception of few lapses in creativity, where cool moves and abilities were replaced with endless minion spawns. All attacks worth their salt are telegraphed very clearly and completely avoidable. Rolls feel good and fair, perhaps even forgiving.
Arsenal is not enormous, but supports enough variety of playstyles to have something for anyone's taste. And that is further boosted by build enabling armour sets and swappable mods.

Having a really hard time with this game, but I'm enjoying it. The combat is responsive and satisfying, the levels are challenging and full of stuff to find, and the story takes a surprisingly cool surreal and interdimensional turn a few bosses in. 

I thought this was gonna be another AAA Souls-like that falls short of its premise, but it's actually pretty good. I only played solo so far, and I'm aware the game advertises itself as co-op focused, but I have yet to encounter a boss I can't defeat after trying again and again and again (which I'd say is in the spirit of things for Souls-likes).

The one problem I have with the bosses is that, while they're definitely well designed, my ADHD arse has a hard time focusing on minions and the boss at the same time, so I kinda wish bosses had fewer minions. I mean, the minions are there for two main reasons, I believe: to give you ammo pick ups, and to give a party of cooperators stuff to shoot at. In other words, the reason why the minions annoy me is because I'm not playing the game as intended, so I can't really complain. Beating bosses never stops feeling like an accomplishment, but it does knock the wind out of me and make me feel like stopping for the day.

I also quite like the character writing, especially ol' Mud Tooth, the lovable old man living in the 'helocolopter'. The lore is fascinating, the whole interdimensional stuff is cool, and yeah.

Hmm, what else is there to say? I don't like that the one way to get certain pick ups is to just sweep the same spots in the same maps over and over, but that's also par for the course, so I can't complain too much about it.",1703815106,1704684081,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It makes for a frustrating experience and culminates in the final boss which is the worst offender. With the wrong loadout, it is borderline impossible and because of how the upgrade system works you would have to farm for hours to try scaled up alternate weapons.

Skip this and go buy Remnant 2, which refines and fixes virtually every problem this game has. It's more varied, more fun, and far better balanced.",1700899789,1704605155,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My old review simply didn't do this game justice, so rewriting this at 100+ hours. I received this game for free on another launcher, but after one playthrough liked it so much that I invested in a copy on Steam, if that tells you anything. 
I've since played through the game on higher difficulties, completed the 2923 expansion, tried my hand at Survival mode, and as of today, I beat the main campaign on hardcore for the first time. 
All of this, and I am still yet to acquire all of the items and achievements - talk about replayability!
Lots of reviews are critical of the story, however I've come to really appreciate the worldbuilding in this game. Whilst it does have weak moments, the depiction of apocalypse following aggressive multidimensional hivemind is really cool. 
Gunplay is excellent, build variety is top notch, coop is super fun, and bosses are satisfying to learn.

An I missed this game so I was able to get my Xbox save file to work and ported it in. But it unlocked the last few achievements. So be warned if you want to hunt the achievements not to betray yourself. 

This game is a lot of fun. Feels like there are multiple games rolled into one package. I really enjoy playing it online. When this dropped it was so underrated. I feel that it‚Äôs a game that is still underrated and should be played if you like some guns in your souls games. Some of the weapons feel underwhelming and there are clearly better ones. But just about everything is viable in here.

At some point you will just be playing Fashion Remnant because you will know the attack patterns and what is coming. So you will easily be able to dodge and survive most things.

Current Favorite Build is
Labyrinth armor 
Galenic Charm or Soul Anchor
Spirit Stone/Burden of the Follower or Soul Link
Then I just throw summons on whatever weapon I'm feeling at the moment. Beckon &Iron Sentinel. But if you want to just use something like SWARM or anything else you could too. This is a easily tweaked set up. I'm use to playing as a tank so this game play has been refreshing.

The game runs well and coop is a smooth experience. No bugs encountered. I'd give it a solid 8/10. 

My biggest complaint is that the campaign is on the shorter side (10 hours for a first play through). The replay value comes from their level design being semi-randomized, so in order to fight every boss you either replay the campaign, play in a mode known as ""adventure mode"" that allows you to fight bosses quicker, or jump into online coop with randoms/friends to see if their world contains bosses you have not seen.

But there is really a one thing that makes playing this ""game"" rather a painful grindy experience and that is the pure randomness of items being dropped. If you want a specific item or boss fight you have to reroll and search through everything over and over again.

But the main reason behind this negative review is that you are required 2 specific items to get a platinum trophy on ps4 and that is reggies ring and aces coin. These two items never ever drop. I have rerolled the game dozens of times and no luck.

That being said, the game is not really enjoyable without the use of third party tools such as world analyzer.

There is such a huge potential to the game and it's mechanics but the game offers very little of content. So far as I can see, all of this stuff seems to be fixed in Remnant II.

1. Enemies and even bosses attack hit-box vs animation is very different (this could be caused by multiplayer, haven't tested it), but you could be a couple meters away from an enemies melee attack and it still hits you, which can be very annoying.
2. Projectile spam, many enemies if they get even slightly away from you will begin throwing projectiles, while by themselves this isn't bad, but when you get a hoard of enemies, especially in a boss room, it gets very annoying and tedious.
3. going off my last point, a lot of bosses are gank fights. The boss itself could be easy, but they spawn an INSANE amount of enemies or just spam projectiles, and it just makes some of the bosses tedious. Not to say they aren't fun, but when you constantly die to swarms of casual enemies in a boss room it gets very irritating.",1703327768,1703327768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A fun experience alone or with 1-2 other players. Very replayable with randomly generated map layouts and loot finds/events, and challenging in the RIGHT ways (Friendly to casual/non-souls players, but still offers you a challenge in the right places), but not overly if you don't want it to be. Worth the price in my opinion.

___________

The Full Review: 
[b] Solo/Co-op: [/b] This game is very fun both alone and with friends (even just one other person). Sorry to your four stack, however, this is a up to three player experience. I went through with my best friend and myself, and we had a BLAST. We loved the lore, the fights, and just exploring together. And don't worry about what class you choose, you can always swap everything around if you want, and if you both want to be the same thing, go for it. You can customize quite a bit of your loadout to compensate for having similar abilities (that you can swap out for others as well as you unlock new ones).

[b] Replayable/Difficulty: [/b] It's something you can just dive into and replay over and over as the maps are randomly made and you won't see everything the first time through. Eventually, yes, you'll have seen everything, but that's when you can challenge yourself by upping the difficulty and trying different strats to defeat certain bosses to see if they drop different loot. (And if you're nervous about the souls-like tag, don't be, it's a challenge at some parts, but there's difficulty settings and whatever you face, you can overcome with a little determination and learning about what you're against.) This game is incredibly friendly to those who are not souls-like vets, but it's also a good fit for those vets as well as they can enjoy the game on harder difficulties if it wasn't challenging enough. For more casual players, you might find yourself wanting to challenge yourself down the road and I couldn't recommend it more as it's quite satisfying overcoming that one boss who kept beating you for two days straight because you learned the attack pattern and made a strategy.
*note: I have found, personally, this game is a bit more forgiving in some cases than an official Souls game, so don't stress too hard about dying in this. You get to get back up and try again with no real consequence for your failure than just a few steps back at your last checkpoint. No biggie. It might be less friendly on harder difficulties, but for normal difficulty, it wasn't so bad.

I can't think of much else to say here because I don't normally review games, but this one? This one deserved me at least giving it an attempt. I have very fond memories playing this with my best friend, and we're soon to set out to play the sequel. Neither of us were souls-like gamers, and both of us are picky about what we enjoy, and we came out of this game with smiles on our faces (and a sense of accomplishment after beating one of the last bosses in the game (vets, you know which one)). We fully enjoyed this game and found that this game just got the formula right for casual gamers and souls-like players. Even if you hate Dark Souls (or love it), you'll probably enjoy this.",1703273136,1703273136,True,5,1,0.578581333160400391,0,True,False,False

2. Mobs spawn all the time. There is no using care and intelligence to clear a level. The level will never be cleared. Making this very much not Dark Souls like.
3. Probably because of this, there is no penalty on death. None.
4. Mobs level is generated when you enter a new area based on your gear level. I have always hated this. Mobs should have a static level.
5. If you play on keyboard and mouse, turn every setting having to do with your mouse sensitivity down to 5. The default settings are way too high and will make you dizzy. Its not you, its not your mouse, its the default setting of the game.
6. Upgrading your gear does NOT make you more powerful, as the enemies scale with your equipment level. This has been confirmed with the devs.

I played this with a friend my entire play-through because, at least for me, the main draw was that it was a soulslike game with an emphasis on co-op. We also played on Hard difficulty for our first playthrough, which the game doesn't recommend but it ended up not really mattering (more on this later).  First time we played was fun, combat was smooth enough,  environments seemed pretty nice (I at least liked the derelict city in autumn look), the guns had some good weight to them, and the lore was fine. Second time though we started getting weary of some of the design choices. We had reached ~5 hours by this time, and it felt like we hadn't progressed much at all. We were still in what we originally thought was the starting area, and it lost its luster quick. This is when you start noticing that they reuse a lot of the same assets, and since this is also when the it begins bearing on you that the game is incredibly linear, all the sections in this one area feel like unnecessary padding. We also hadn't fought any bosses that had any unique design from the regular enemies you fight normally. Our third, and last, session we were supremely disappointed, and ultimately, bored. When we asked each other what we thought of the game, our initial responses to each other were ""I'm the most neutral I could be towards this game."" This was apparently a lie, as we sprung into an airing of the grievances towards the end of our playthrough. We had FINALLY reached a different area after our 7th hour or so, and it wasn't getting less linear. To top it off, the PTSD I got from serving two tours in Resident Evil 5 kicked off when this area immediately greets you with a prostrating middle-eastern woman and shooting people who are actually chucking spears. A nitpick, I know, but it was a funny note to end it on for me.

I'm currently 76 minutes in so I'm hoping and praying that I'll be able to get a refund. In the extremely depressing event that I can't, I'll be back to do a more thorough takedown.

You do not need an Epic Games account unless you plan on playing with friends who have Epic Games.
Just join your steam friends directly through steam instead of using the in-game join feature.

Note: Spoilers, so beware.
We have reached the last boss and decided to stop playing the game.
The entire game we were built up to believe we could make any class combination we want. Husband went for a pure melee build while I went for a shotgun/flame weapon build. We had no issues. Every boss fight was a new challenge that made us think.
Dungeons were fairly easy as they were cramped spaces and with our melee / shotgun builds, we were easily able to get through them.
Upon reaching the final boss - it was unkillable with our builds. After doing research, we discovered that you need a Sniper Build to be able to take out the final boss. As it is to high off the ground for melee or for shotguns to do proper damage.
This completely discouraged us from wanting to continue the game. We don't even want to beat it now. We would have to either grind to get enough materials to upgrade and respect into sniper builds or restart the game.

I am adding this note in as a warning to anyone who plays this game. The final boss is a massive disappointment that ruined our experience with the game. I would still recommend it, but this is your warning.",1701222367,1701463062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Gunplay is incredible, each of the weapons feels different and fun to use, specially if you take in consideration the many mods you can apply to your weapons, you can use a laser beam covered in fire, fire your sniper rifle from inside your shield bubble or one shot almost everyone with your sporebloom",1701277164,1701277164,True,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

bosses are kinda mediocre + every fight is a gank fight and some of them are just straight up hordes of simple mobs. last boss is [spoiler] really awful for close combat playstile, and it also has some stupid ass hp draining mechanic so even if u have not got hit ever in the fight u still lose a lot of hp due to some ""very fun and interesting"" fighting mechanic [/spoiler].
for some reasons developers also decided to make some bosses and locations nd items random, so in one playthrough you wont fight some bosses explore some locations and get some items just because the map didnt spawn it. and also for some reasone you cant turn of toggle sprint, just why??

Honestly, the game isn't fun at all. I came here from Dark Souls and Elden Ring, because this was described as ""Dark Souls with guns"", which is ironic because it seems to be missing a part - SOUL. This review will be separated according to the aspects that really killed it for me.

[h2]Controls[/h2]
Firstly, I understand this is a gun game on PC, and many people will prefer to use mouse and keyboard. That's great for you. To me - this type of game plays best on a controller, the Dark Souls elements are literally begging for it. Unfortunately for Dark Souls players, the inputs for the controller are not able to be rebound. Don't like your healing flask being left bumper? Too bad. Don't like what is essentially your weapon art to be right bumper? Also, too bad. I don't think its too much to ask to want controller input that can be rebound. If you try to treat this like a shooter and go mouse and keyboard, I think you will find the controls to be... cumbersome.

[h2]Character Design[/h2]
Every enemy is grey/black and red. I can excuse this to an extent, but when enemies are copy/pasted in large packs, it gets really old, really fast. Enemies seem to have one or two moves, but that's it. Most fodder enemies will be perpetually stun locked if you shoot them, so just lay it on and walk on by. The first boss I encountered was a physically larger, bullet sponge version of a slightly uncommon enemy I had already encountered repeatedly. I beat said boss by rolling around him, 2 inches from his face, shooting him until he died. Bullet sponges do not equal difficulty, they are annoying.

[h2]Cutscenes[/h2]
There are way too many. The beginning of the game feels more like a movie with occasional gameplay segments. The tracking on the characters mouths when they are talking is so uncanny it pulls me out of the cutscene entirely. I also didn't feel very compelled by the story, so cutscenes really felt intrusive.

[h2]Weapons and Combat Feel[/h2]
Guns feel and sound nice to shoot. The designs were very awesome looking and evoked a western / WWI vibe. However, melee was painful, especially when compared to Dark Souls. The melee combat can best be summed up as Minecraft ""swing a sword until it dies"".  There is hardly any variation in moves, and it was so excruciatingly boring I found myself only using it on occasion to shake things up, as again, the stun lock means you really don't need to melee. The guns have mod slots, into which you can equip what are essentially power ups. The game equipped me with a heal power up that was so strong I didn't need to use a flask. Ever. It also seems the power up regenerates(?) making flasks useless. The awesome guns could have saved the game, however there are a total of around 28ish guns. Not a whole lot.

[h2]Atmosphere[/h2]
The world that I was able to experience before the end of the refund period was very grey and red, much like the enemies. This is supposed to be a game revolving around ammo conservation, however I found that the only way you could run out of ammo was if you literally kept clicking non stop, even with no enemies on screen. Most fodder dies in 1 to 2 shots, and drop what feels like an entire magazine worth of bullets. You could never touch your melee and be just fine. The audio was okay, but never really hit an air of exploration or even horror that I would have liked, it just felt generic. I thought the camera angle was way too close, and with no option to pull the camera back it became kind of annoying. You can increase the FOV, but it begins to look like you are looking through binoculars really fast.

[h2]World Structure[/h2]
When I was walking around the world, I couldn't help but feel that the levels were poorly laid out, and empty. I kept asking myself, ""Why would a dev design a room like this?"", ""Why is this here?"", ""This environment is so bland, it needs more details."" I only found out afterwards that everything is randomly generated, and then it made so much sense. It looks so bland because they are generic tile sets stitched together randomly by a computer with no sense of atmosphere. Areas looked so similar it was hard to tell where I was going at times. ""Oh, this area is all brick"" ""Oh, this area is all concrete and rusty pipes"". You get the deal. Most of the rooms don't feel like there is any story to them. I can't look at a building and say ""Oh! This must have been an Office/Hospital/Mechanic! Look at all the Papers/Medical Supplies/Auto parts spread around."" The areas just have no story to them. They feel like empty halls designed for a shooting gallery, which really ruins the immersion this game is trying to create.

[h2]Multiplayer[/h2]
This game would have been saved with an invasion feature, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really care for them in the Souls games. The enemies are just too easy, and having an actual player be able to arrive in my world, at any time, gunning for me, would have spiced up a lot of otherwise boring stretches. I can't comment on co-op because I was the only one of my friends to go out on a limb for this game, but I can only wonder how easy the game would be with multiple people to keep enemies suppressed.

[h2]So... Who is this game for?[/h2]
It's hard to say. It almost feels, at least mechanically, like a combination of Dark Souls and Gears of War, which is awkward to say the least. I hate to keep comparing it so heavily to Dark Souls, but the similar elements are just too close. I saw someone compare their enjoyment in this game to the enjoyment they got out of GoldenEye 007 in a different review on google, and I think that helps to paint some of the picture. You would probably enjoy this if you barely had any exposure to games, game only in small intervals after work to cool down with friends, are not very skilled and enjoy cruising through gameplay, or are ancient (when compared to the average age of someone who plays games). If you've ever booted up GTA 5, only to drive in circles while talking to friends, this is the epitome of that atmosphere, except a little more dull. Other games have executed these elements far better. If this isn't your first foray into gaming, I suggest you try one of those instead.

For the sake of full transparency, I have refunded this game, and my experience of it is reflective of what is playable within the refund period of 2 hours. My opinion is just that - an opinion. If you loved this game and purchased it 5 billion times so you could replay it on your Nintoaster, that's great, it just wasn't for me.

[h3]To me, it's probably worth about $10[/h3]",1701081091,1701082067,False,1,2,0.488749653100967407,0,True,False,False

Simply NOT FUN and you will obviously feel how sloppy the game is.

Enemy AI too boring - they can't make good boss fights, they just spam minions and scale up one of them to be the boss every time.

Bad environment design - you always find brand new wooden doors and cupboards in rotten buildings, and they don't put other things for interior. They don't do LOD, buildings from far away just pops in when you walking.

Bad animation - that splint vaulting animation is a joke, wrong speed, wrong height, just like they are using canned royalty free assets on the game market.

1. Played with friends to mitigate any shortcomings with the design.
2. Played on the easy difficulties (Normal, Hard).
3. Didn't really think much about what they were playing and just enjoyed the fact they were playing a co-op game where the shooting felt good and the environments are cool.

-Level-scaling. What this means is when you reach a certain area or upgrade your gear, the zone levels up with you. You never 'progress' - you will always take 5 shots to kill that enemy with your pistol at level 0, and with a gun at level 20 shooting a level 20 enemy, the same is true. It is kind of baffling why they even bothered with this system at all when they could just remove the levels and nothing would change
-Some of the worst bosses I have ever seen. EVERY boss spawns adds that swarm and attack you from offscreen, sandbagging the fight, and making an otherwise easy to kill and dodge boss an annoying headache. Every boss that is not an act or 'main' boss is the same model and attack pattern of regular elite enemies you fight in the overworld, except now they spawn adds and have a particle effect phase 2 gimmick. I SINCERELY cannot stress how awful EVERY single boss is. The other reviews and comments here cannot do it justice.
-Difficulty is horrendous in its design. You have two difficulties: Normal/ hard (you will fall asleep, one-shotting every common enemy with unupgraded weapons, breezing through levels, never coming anywhere close to death, and beating bosses on your first try. Nightmare/ Apocalypse (You will die in 1-3 hits from any boss or enemy attack, even with hp maxed and wearing heavy armor. Bosses have an enormous, spongy amount of health. You will die randomly and not make 'progress' learning a boss, you will instead get lucky that they didn't spawn adds because the game bugged out, or the ads spawned from a different door so now you can progress. Or you get grazed by a stray hit because you were dealing with the 5 enemies who leap 15 feet offscreen at you and die instantly because you didn't perfectly dodge everything with all the insane variables at play.

Remnant FTA is a very good game. On its own, it boasts a ton of replayability, gameplay variety, and endless grind. Here's what I love about it so far:
- Performance on PC is fantastic, very smooth experience on lower end rigs (unlike R2's poor optimization with UE5)
- More lighthearted and ""fun"" (R2 is very much doom and gloom)
- Main story is solid and interesting to follow along in the campaign
- Every weapon feels great to use and most weapon mods are useful; one of my main gripes with R2 is that there are a select few weapons that are clearly stronger than the rest and only a few weapon mods are actually fun to use
- Scrap and materials are plentiful and allow for much easier leveling of gear 
- Unlimited trait points allow for much greater sense of progression and less hesitancy spending trait points
- Armor set bonuses offer unique ways to buildcraft and are much more interesting than DR/weight class in R2
- Co-op system is much more refined and less tedious than R2's awful multiplayer
- Survival mode offers endless replayability after you finish collecting everything
- Armor skins provide somewhat of an endgame for players who enjoy farming

FTA isn't better than R2, however. Here's a list of things I didn't like about FTA:
- Very little buildcrafting with only 2 ring slots and no archetypes 
- Melee is just really bad in this game, R2 has much better melee combat
- Constantly running out of stamina while free roaming is one of the worst things about this game
- The worlds and dungeons are much smaller, which made campaign playthroughs feel a bit too short
- The lore of the individual worlds felt a bit lacking and uninteresting (except for the Wards - they have some fantastic storytelling)
- Majority of the boss fights were very underwhelming and lacked interesting mechanics
- Boss fights also tended to spawn a ton of adds which made some fights extremely annoying; it feels like the add spawns were added to compensate for the relatively simple boss patterns
- The cartoon-ish visuals can make important decisions feel less impactful and forgettable
- R2 definitely has better procedural generation, secrets, and hidden items/interactions


Overall, I really enjoyed this game and know that I will be playing it for many more hours. I would not consider R2 to be a direct upgrade to R:FTA, but more of a sidegrade. Both games are fantastic in their own right, and you should definitely pick up both if you enjoy souls-likes.",1700847742,1700858319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Co-op is fun so far you can play solo, with a friend or joining public matches (random players).

It does not include archetypes like the second game does but you can play around with different armor sets which provide certain bonuses to your build.

To me,  this game is pretty fun and has lots of replayability potential since worlds and dungeons are randomly generated and each playthrough is slightly different than the one before.

If you're a fan of the Remnant II, then I definitely recommend you give this game a shot. Steam runs a pretty big sale on it anyway, so you might wanna wait for that.

You're playing through levels, with no real idea what you're doing or why. Lots of stuff is teased and then not properly explained. Out of 20 hours of game-play, maybe... 2 hours was actually plot relevant? The rest was dungeon crawling and boss fights.

""Remnant: From the Ashes"" isn't just another entry into the souls-like genre; it's a shining example of how to do it right, and it takes the experience to a whole new level with its seamless cooperative play.

At its core, ""Remnant"" presents a post-apocalyptic world overrun by otherworldly horrors, a backdrop that sets the stage for a challenging and deeply immersive adventure. What sets this game apart is its successful integration of the souls-like formula with a cooperative multiplayer focus, making it not only a thrill to play solo but an absolute blast in co-op.

The souls-like mechanics, characterized by punishing difficulty, strategic combat, and intense boss battles, are executed with finesse. Every encounter is a test of skill, demanding thoughtful approaches and precision in combat. The procedural generation system adds a layer of unpredictability, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same. This, in turn, significantly enhances the game's replayability, providing a fresh challenge with each new session.

What truly elevates ""Remnant"" is its cooperative play. Joining forces with up to two friends adds an extra layer of enjoyment to an already gripping experience. The synergy between players, strategic coordination, and the shared triumphs over formidable foes create a camaraderie that few games in the genre can match. It transforms an already intense single-player adventure into a cooperative masterpiece.

The customization options for characters and weapons add depth to the gameplay, allowing players to tailor their experiences to their preferred playstyles. The variety in weaponry, coupled with the ability to adapt and modify, provides a satisfying sense of progression and personalization.

The visuals and design are praiseworthy, painting a vivid and atmospheric post-apocalyptic world that's both haunting and beautiful. The attention to detail in the environments and the menacing design of the otherworldly creatures contribute to the overall immersive experience.

In conclusion, ""Remnant: From the Ashes"" is a souls-like done right, offering an engaging and challenging adventure that gets even better when shared with friends. The cooperative play elevates the experience, turning an already standout game into a must-play for fans of intense action RPGs. If you're seeking a world to conquer with friends, where every victory is hard-fought and immensely satisfying, ""Remnant"" beckons you to join the fight. It's a cooperative delight in the challenging realm of souls-like mastery.",1700262822,1700262822,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

If you don't have a decent story with interesting characters and ""bear""able storytelling, why bother? Just do it like FromSoftware! (Even though that's because of Miyazaki's childhood trauma but you get what I mean). Don't waste the player's time because Remnant's story certainly didn't help the rest of the torturous experience. 

If we get right to it, Remnant has a horrible level design with repetitive dungeons with the same layouts. The gameplay is so bland and nothing new, and it certainly doesn't feel like a souls-like, it feels and plays like an ordinary TPS. It's a shame since the mechanics actually work okay. 

Exploration is really weak too, since enemies and environments have generic and unimaginary designs. Boss battles are disgustingly bad, since all of them are dealing with little annoying mobs while fighting the boss. That's Remnant's way of making the player struggle, since, without them, the bosses themselves are, in fact, really easy. I guess they need to learn how to design bosses that are legitimately tough but fair. 

This game made me refund my Remnant II pre-order. Even though I was going to play it with my friends this summer. That's how flawed this game is. I wish they focused more on the experience itself rather than focusing on how to make this game longer and longer with looter shooter concepts with absurd level scaling. Such a waste of time and effort. I hope they can fix the issues on their second try (there are so many more, I haven't even mentioned here, so I seriously doubt it)

So, here's the thing: this game changes almost every typical element of a soulslike.

The maps are separate, are randomly generated, have barely any shortcuts, and split off into several optional ""dungeons"". The bosses are also randomized (well, most of them), so you can never fight every boss in just one playthrough. The combat is focused on ranged weapons, and not just any ranged weapon, but firearms (with a couple of crossbows and more exotic weapons thrown in in mid-to-late game). You don't lose anything (but progress) when you die. You don't level up your attributes by using ""souls"", instead, you get a rather eclectic collection of traits (ranging from something typical such as ""increase critical hit chance"" to something asinine like ""increase the speed of your character vaulting over obstacles"") that you unlock either by finishing a certain objective, slaying a certain boss, or just doing a certain action enough times. Almost every boss has regular mook minions appearing throughout the fight. The co-op [i]doesn't suck[/i] (well, reportedly, I personally haven't tried it).

On the other hand, there are certain similarities to be sure. An unstoppable, world-ending threat that is slowly rotting the world (or worlds, in this case), the last bunch of survivors hoping against hope to stop it, focus on boss fights, crafting equipable items from slain bosses (although you can get two mutually exclusive items from most bosses, depending on some of your actions before or during the fight), etc.

The game has a very odd difficulty curve, not helped by a somewhat arcane system of difficulty scaling: while each world has its own minimum level, the enemies can scale up with you based on your equipped gear. In my personal experience, as long as you keep upgrading your weapons and your armor in roughly the same proportion, you should be okay for mid-to-late game, but early game can be VERY tough. Though a lot of the problem is that the first world has possibly the worst boss mechanics of the entire game (a lot of them being just ""fight a bunch of guys in a cramped room"").

After that, the game gets its groove, so to say, and becomes a lot more manageable, so if you're at all interested in it, I'd recommend you to try and tough it through the beginning. There are some tough spots here and there later on, but none should be too frustrating.

A smaller issue you will start noticing is grinding: you main resource ‚Äî scrap ‚Äî is plentiful and easy to obtain, but to upgrade your things you need two other resources, metal and crystals, which are a lot rarer, especially the latter. You should have just enough if you stick with just a few weapons and armor sets, but if you want to experiment, you'll have to go through the same worlds over and over again (which is luckily made to be pretty convenient).

All in all, if you wanted to try out a soulslike with less sword&sorcery in it, that might be something for you.",1699334079,1699334079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

‚Ä£ 6/10 ‚Äì Where‚Äôs the ashes at?

‚Ä£ Thoughts: Remnant took a few attempts to fully grab my attention. It was definitely not a game I would‚Äôve completed alone due to some unfair balancing issues and a dry story. However, with a buddy this was quite a blast and an enjoyable brainless shooter to bash out in a week.

Gameplay wise, Remnant is essentially a souls like with guns. There‚Äôs a dodge button, enemies that deal loads of damage and optional exploration that usually ends with a boss fight. Overall, I found the gunplay quite enjoyable and impactful. No guns felt like BB guns or pebble dispensers and there was enough weight to them to keep me engaged throughout my 8-hour story playthrough. I will say, this game is pretty challenging while playing alone, but splitting the enemies AI with a partner made the game basically a walk in the park on normal difficulty. So, if you are planning to try this game out, play on a harder difficulty, because you will not be able to change that mid-campaign without restarting your entire progress.

The weapon and gear system have sadly been a big letdown. Upgrading weapons is expensive and rather grindy, so you are forced into choosing one weapon and sticking with it in order to keep your power level optimal without replaying certain areas. Most boss weapons seemed interesting, but their upgrades were too costly to exchange an already maxed out beginner weapon that couldn‚Äôt be de crowned by any other item found. Essentially the weapon you pick in your first hour will be the weapon you‚Äôll use in your last boss fight. Same goes with clothing gear. The more you upgrade your starting set the less inclined you will be to try other armor pieces, especially when there‚Äôs barely any to find or buy. Overall, the system is enough to keep you exploring, but the rewards you get won‚Äôt be better then what you start with. Rings and amulets are probably the strongest part of your arsenal variety.

Lastly, this game has a story and that is all I need to really say. If you pay attention, you might grab on to something that interests you and keeps you entertained. However, the way most story is given to you rivals the generic lore dumps Bethesda loves to do but does it in the dullest way possible. So, for me the story was something I just ignored and kept in the back of my mind.

All in all, Remnant is a pretty decent co-op souls like shooter that has a great variety in enemies and locations and challenges you when it is necessary. But don‚Äôt expect a narrative masterpiece with incredible gameplay depth.",1699302614,1699302614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

#1 Positive for me: The level design is out of this world you feel like you are conquering each maps, zone and levels.

#1 Negative for me: enemies get stronger the more you upgrade your gear which affects the difficulty when you re roll the campaign which is okay but I would rather re roll all geared up and find the game easier and if I want more difficulty I choose to re-roll in hard and higher difficulties myself and not the game.

#1 Advice from me: Start the campaign in normal mode not hard listen to this you will hit a wall eventually do start at normal and re-roll normal and/or then go to hard and up.

The DLC's are very good and worthed.

The game took 10 hours to complete on co-op, and could have been even less potentially (my friend kept dying), so it is a pretty small game as well.

Pros:

1) The worlds and creatures seem pretty interesting, and the different biomes we get to see are fairly different from each other.

2) The weapon selection and weapon mods allow for different combinations that can keep things interesting.

3) Mechanics are responsive and feel good, which is important in a game of this genre.

Cons:

1) The story is....there. It seems half-baked, and they definitely ran out of budget towards the second half of the game, leading to the plot being shortened and simplified, just to conclude the game. It definitely felt underwhelming when the credits started to roll.

2) All the characters you meet are flat and boring personality-wise. They have one or two default lines to spout when you interact with them and that's about it. This makes the game feel quite dated.

3) Character classes largely mean nothing and you can just do whatever you want regardless of what initial class you choose.

But the important thing is that this is all PART OF THE BASE GAME. No seasons passes, no stupid live events, no awful MTX, and the DLCs the game offers actually pack a ton of content.

Sure it's ""Dark Souls with guns,"" but it's also a complete experience where all of the fun stuff is baked in and not broken off and sold back to you as obnoxious and expensive DLC or MTX.

This is also a banger of a coop game, so fun, so challenging, and really lets each player differentiate themselves with the diverse amount of builds you can come up with. The coop mechanics are also decidedly NOT like Dark Souls so you directly join and play with your friends without any goofy summon signs or secret passwords which is also very welcome.

Just one other thing, the narrative in this is not great. I mean it's not awful, but the game is less about a compelling narrative experience and more about slowly accumulating items to make builds and refine them so you can take on increasingly tougher challenges. It's about running the content to get resources or new items that let you increase the effectiveness of your builds or even create new ones based on what you find. People who are disappointed with the game raise the lackluster story as a frequent item of disappointment, but if you can just not let that bother you it's otherwise a fantastic experience.",1698597487,1698597757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can acquire new weapons and armor and upgrade them as you go along. You also earn traits and level those up. You pick what you want to concentrate on depending on your playstyle. There are lots of different weapons you can acquire, and you can equip one pistol and one rifle. You also have one melee weapon.
The game is set up to run on UWS and its very nice. No mods needed! The graphics are quite good IMO and the sound is great also. It had very few bugs and glitches and overall ran very well.
I played on normal difficulty and some of the bosses are pretty tough, but if you co-op with someone you can beat them without too much trouble. One boss took us about 10 tries I think because he kept knocking us off a bridge! There are optional bosses as well, and those are extremely hard to beat. One boss is nearly impossible, but you dont have to fight her to win the game.
Controls are good using  xbox controller. The game has no block ability, and so you roll to avoid getting hit. There is a stamina bar that will deplete, but you can train some traits to make that last longer.

Another tip for the new players, don't listen the guides. They will tell you something like 'the main Earth both is +5, so lvl your equipment to it'. Man, I got to +6 only for the final both during my Normal game and I DIDN'T UPGRADE ONCE (except the traits, of course) during the whole Hard re-roll. 

The only guides you can check is a boss mechanics. So far, I had to check 3 bosses for all my three game walk through. I simply missed some small details, which you can find by yourself. 

Now, when I re-rolled my world to the Nightmare difficulty I do upgrade a lot. But still, I am +10 in the third world. Nightmare and Apocalypses difficulty is no joke even for my character, so please don't start with it. The game is pretty challenging itself, so don't play a tough guy. 

Interesting story, various enemies, fun to re-roll once you finish it. Basically everything in this game is well done and interesting to experience. I really love that I can't use the same weapon for different enemies. Sometimes you need a full auto with bullets, sometimes you need a beam of radiation, and sometimes you need a single shot shocking rifle.

You also not limited to the class you chose. You can take any gun, any armor and any traits after you choose the class. Class only gives you the first equipment.",1698128187,1698128634,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a lot of content in this game. There are two gamemodes: Campaign and adventure mode. Campaign: pretty self explanatory. Adventure mode lets you choose a world from the campaign with a couple dungeons and bosses. The purpose of adventure mode is to look for and earn more gear, scrap and xp. The worlds and dungeons are procedurally generated which have its pros and cons.
Pros:
 - This offers a lot of replayability in both gamemodes.
 - It extends the game, since it's random what bosses, dungeons and random events you get.
Cons:
 - It extends the game, since it's random you will have to rerun adventure mode until you get that specific boss or dungeon to get that last item you need for your build.
 - It gets really repetitive after a sertain point. 

The adventure mode makes a great alternative if you're playing the campaign on a harder difficulty and get stuck on a boss since you can play adventure mode on a lower difficulty without losing any progress on the campaign. This allows you to acquire better gear and level up before returning to the campaign.

The combat is really fun but can feel clunky in some situations, mostly in close quarters.
You get a ton of different weapons and a lot of different weapon mods which offers a great variety to character builds. There are also many traits to complement your builds and I absolutely love that you're not gonna get level capped so you can level up all traits. When writing this review my character is in trait level 824 and you can put up to 20 points in each trait (you get a point for each level). I love being able to change build whenever i feel like it and this game really gives you that freedom.

One really important thing you should know is that the campaign doesn't have an end. In order to play through the end of the story you'll need to buy the subject 2923 dlc. That is a big negative on this game. You shouldn't have to get a dlc to complete the main story. With that said, that dlc is actually really good imo. I just wish it wasn't a dlc... maybe buy it with discount.

Oh btw, don't get swamps of corsus dlc unless it's discounted. It only adds one of the campaigns worlds to adventure mode with some additional gear, adds skins to armor (don't worry, no micro transactions) and adds a new gamemode: survival mode.",1697625797,1697625797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is like the souls games you'll see but with guns and perks. The enemies are general and look alike most of the time but there are different ones that have different movesets which makes it feel better. There are mini boss options in some areas that add to the experience (though some people think that is the first boss and die without any plan). What this game adds compared to the dark souls games is it does have a difficulty setting with a hardcore option added in. I tried the game on hard but it just isn't for me with how much of a bullet sponge a lot of enemies are. The auto generated areas might seem bad for a lot of people, but it does mix well with the small areas the devs built so it doesn't feel odd or too strange most of the time. It does add reply ability to the game. What really adds to the reply offers is that items are randomized. You might get the best ring for your build early on or you could get some pretty strange rings you haven't seen before. That touch is what adds more rogue like fun I do enjoy.

The keyboard controls are strange but not hard to learn. Space is used for a lot of things that it isn't normally used for and the B key is to go back or end a pop up window. ALT is crouch when normally it is CTRL. F is for your special when I normally like it bound to Q. The controls are pretty strange but you can change them or get used to them, so not too much of an issue.

The trash adds are a bit much at times. They were until I figured out that the melee attack deals with them so much better than my guns. With those that don't recommend the game because of the trash mobs in boss rooms or in areas, try melee. It is faster than shooting and doesn't waste your ammo.

It is a pretty fun game and they added the most desired features to it like having a rando built in. The NPCs and story just feels like a cardboard but hey, at least I can go about and collect things.",1654517905,1697546583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Watch the video. It tells you all you need to know. It is the tl;dr version of this review. What follows below is visceral.

Great campaign! Garbage everything else.
9.2 hours in one day. I can tell you right now, don't bother with Adventure Mode unless your build desperately needs a specific item. Even then, be ready for something that is harder than every FromSoft Souls-Like game combined, with all the random instant deaths and pitfalls of Kingsfield.

Why exactly? Because Adventure Mode is entirely imbalanced. Coming off of the Campaign I had just finished the first World/Chapter. The standard enemy went down in 3 Pistol shots. The Dragon went down in 2 attempts flat, with a tail break for a nifty fire sword. I decided I wanted maybe a little more challenge, so I hopped into Adventure Mode on Hard because I wanted to fight the other bosses.

Enemies took 4 Pistol shots instead of 3, and dealt way more damage. It messed with my flow, so I started a new one on Normal. Immediately, going from Hard mode to Normal mode, enemies took double the amount of shots to kill. Every normal enemy was replaced with torn open tree guys. They dealt normal damage, sure, but they took 8 shots to kill. I know for certain I didn't put it on Apocalypse difficulty because my save says Normal.

I fought my way through the area eventually, and made it to the first boss. Riphide is his name. If you ever come across this boss, pray. It's all you can do. He splits himself into 2 identical copies, which both are the boss. Unlike a Pinwheel or Four Kings, both of these guys take damage to the one health bar. So, fine. Twin boss. Can't kill them one at a time.

And then they split again into 4 guys. Name one other Souls-Like that throws 4 bosses with 1 health bar at you in an enclosed space. Moreover, give those bosses a shockwave attack that has infinite reach, as well as a ranged attack that takes 40% of your health. Oh right! And then let them self-heal. The closest you can find is what happens when you sit around in the Four Kings boss room. Though, not even they as one of the highest damage bosses in Souls, deal as much damage as Riphide.

But it gets worse. They can split once more into 8 guys, and up to 3 of them can heal at a time. One of these guys was a challenging enough boss. They're aggressive, they hit hard, and some of their attacks are genuinely mean. But 8 of them? And it's not even something you can prevent. They do it when you get them down to their last chunk of HP, and then immediately start healing themselves.

Complete and utter crap. Unfun, imbalanced, and above all else... it was an Earth Area 1, Normal Difficulty, Sub-Boss. A random enemy turned boss. Not even a complete unique boss like Singe was.

If you feel so inclined to defend this game from my horrible unfair accusations, I was enjoying the game until what should have been the lowest level, lowest difficulty, starter area became worse than every end game FromSoft boss I've ever fought. The way I finally beat Riphide is 100% cheese, and has left me drained of all satisfaction. Dark Souls from the start has known that the only way you can make something so frustrating, difficult, and draining be enjoyable is to have a satisfying victory. A pop-off. An ""OH MY GOD FINALLY! HECK YES!"" moment. This moment never came when fighting Riphide.

Edit: The first fight in this video, is BUGGED. In the final phase of the fight they started healing, and one of the healers is still moving around attacking rather than doing the healing animation. Yet, they still healed. This boss became unkillable and I didn't even realize.",1697102888,1697103389,False,0,0,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

Anyway, I'll review without the modding in mind, of course.

Great game. Flawed, but great. Definitely planning on buying Remnant 2 at some point too just because this one's so cool.
I can never really decide if it's a soulslike or a shooter, or an RPG or whatever, it's some kind of mix of all of them, though the lack of a death penalty might ban it from the ""soulslike"" label.

I guess it kinda depends on how you build your character, my tank character plays like a Souls character, dodge rolling, whacking stuff with swords and hammers, wearing a chunky suit of armor (side note: the heaviest armor set doesn't let you roll at all, you just kinda ""belly flop"", and you're so heavy that it actually is a pretty great, high-stagger attack!)
My current character is a... ""mage""? A crit-heavy ranged glass cannon dude, and the game plays far more like a shooter as I summon a dog to help me fight and sometimes I'll activate a special that turns my bullets into fire bullets. This build's doing okay, but I'll 100% need more equipment, I don't have much of a build going yet.

Weirdly, something that puts it differently than most other shooters/soulslikes/RPGs is that each run through the game has some randomization. Different bosses, different paths, different side areas, different side quests, heck I had one time on like my seventh run through one zone where I accidentally got a shopkeeper killed and her body was all gross and infected with an ancient evil I let loose, and I haven't seen that event prior to that or since.
Don't like the run you're on, or you're trying to find a specific event? You can redo the whole campaign over at any time, turn the difficulty up or down, then run it again and end up finding some crazy new thing you've never seen before, or find a weird puzzle that requires a key you get from a different run, that kind of stuff.

Anyway, the bad stuff:
-Being later in the game, or on higher difficulties tends to make enemies a bit bullet-spongy
-Intentionally farming to try to get a specific thing is a pain since you're dealing with RNG of RNG of RNG, or rerolling for a boss that might be 4 hours into the game and it's the wrong boss.
-You spend WAY too long in the game without many options for equipment. My first character was using her starting armor and sword for literally the entire first playthrough because I wasn't finding much and what I did find wasn't a good fit for her. DLC/modding helps, but that's still a shame.
-One of the game's shops is run by someone who the devs absolutely wanted you to hate the hell out of, and it works, she's even back in the second game, still insufferable. One of the things she does is scoff like she's annoyed at you as you so much as pass her shop, and basically every word out of her mouth is to insult or berate you, or not believe anything you say. 100% of players who play this hate her, but she's got a very useful shop, so she's unavoidable.
-Basically no plot. The entire plot is that Earth is taken over by interdimensional wooden tree creatures and humanity is 99% dead. You're looking for a guy who might know something. You travel across dimensions. You find him just kinda sitting there. He has a key for a machine back in town. You activate the machine. You fight a boss. Credits.
-Kinda glitchy.
-Weapons with built-in skills make the slottable skills irrelevant, and most of the good weapons have built-in skills, which limits build variety
-Armor sets discourage you from mixing equipment, encouraging you to wear the full set. Mixing-and-matching simply isn't a thing 99.9999% of the time
-Melee weapon selection is varied, but limited. Like, 8 different combat styles, but only 1 or 2 of each, like I think there's one fist weapon in the game?

We played through mostly on hard, until dropping it down to normal for the final 1/3rd in order to just get it over with. Then we made it through one of the DLC too.

Something has to be said for EVERY boss leaving us with the feeling that it was the worse one yet. Whether it was janky hitboxes, poorly telegraphed attacks, or asinine design - there was always something. And quite often all three.

Don't buy this, ever. It's not worth the money.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Review:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A decent idea held back by unfun design.

Note: I played this entirely in coop with one other person on hard difficulty.

I had this on my wishlist until Yahtzee gave it as close to a recommendation as he gives.  As a fan of Dark Souls and coming on the heels of another Bloodborne playthough, I was looking for something to scratch that itch.

The story begins with your world being invaded by some evil root and you have to find some way to fend it off.  Eventually, you start invading other worlds while looking for the one guy that apparently holds all the answers.  Hardly anything that happens plot wise gets referenced in your home base.  The NPCs introduced as having some character during the tutorial immediately lose it once you start actually playing the game.

The opening areas, albeit a bit plain to look at, were promising with decent enemy variety, new weapons being acquired at a decent pace, and challenging but not too frustrating combat.  All bosses spawned additional enemies, whether they be the same boring foe you've been fighting or incredibly  bland orbs.

As the areas became more alien, the enemy variety tried to follow.  For the most part it succeeded, but at the cost of competent AI.  Oftentimes they would attempt to go after my partner or me very slowly while the other one of us shot it.  

What finally drove me to want to stop playing were the later bosses.  The biggest offender being a scenario where you have to destroy three rather sturdy orbs while fending off a never ending horde.  My favorite part of this was where the mechanics just straight up stopped working.  I had equipped an ability on my primary weapon to create a black hole which would suck nearby enemies (and myself) in.  I also had an aggro drawing ability that would create a plant to draw enemies toward it.  Without fail, each time I used it a good half of the mob would straight up ignore it and run towards to either of us.  After realizing it was an optional boss, we decided to attempt the final boss and enjoyed watching the cutscene between its forms while trying to figure out how to damage it since that was unclear too.

Some glitches also reared their beautiful heads throughout our stalled playthrough.  Once I got stuck in a tree after attempting to roll while dodging an enemy attack.  My partner had an NPC just decide not to spawn in at one point.   Both of us had NPCs at the home base refuse to talk to us until we went to our own worlds.

The sad thing is there was a lot of promise in the early parts.  You could get different weapons by picking them up in the world but after the first few hours, new ones could only be obtained from bosses.  Traits giving specific bonuses to hit points, stamina, damage reduction, weapon ability charge rate, etc was a nice idea marred by incredibly poor execution.  We received an increase to weak spot damage and then proceeded to go through area after area containing enemies without a weak spot.  There were equipment that increased critical hit damage, but nothing until the last leg that actually increased the chance of a crit.

Don't buy this anywhere near full price.

I don't like replaying games, even if it adds a new content in NG+.
The only reason I do this is if it's required for the 100% completion.

This game is different, you actually start playing after your first play-through, once you understand the game mechanics.
You just want to replay and replay and replay to find new gear and try new builds.
Once you like the build, you want to perfect it by finding the build specific gear and it makes you to play again and again and again.
You eventually become stronger and want to try harder difficulties that may reveal flaws in your build and it'll make you play the game even more to improve the build and your skill.

The guns feel great, the gun mods are interesting and fun and you'll have to play a lot to get and try all of them.

I get this kind of question a lot and I feel that I have some light to shine on this topic and how it pertains to Remnant: From the Ashes. To put some context on the first point, I need to go back to about 3 months ago when my dog died. I was heartbroken. It was not even my dog. I was holding a mop and I was a janitor at a hospital. I had a fanny pack and in it was a gun. I pulled it out and looked down the shaft to see if it was loaded - shockingly enough, it was. I tried to suck the bullet out of the gun but it wouldn't work.


The second thing I feel is needed for a game to be good is that it is able to make you feel something. When I went to Vietnam, I was constantly given orders and had to follow them. There were times where it started raining and it didn't stop for hours, but I passed the time by hiding my C0Ck inside my 2LT.


The last thing you need to make a good server to get to know the people who have been fighting for many years is when you make enough rounds going to the other end of the dark side of the particular object that you might have been talking about for a certain amount of time. It is actually quite heartbreaking. This combat has something that makes you want to come back for more, but R4PE.",1567124076,1696210974,False,1,2,0.220279723405838013,0,True,False,False

to everyone coming from remnant 2 to play this. first off you fucked up you should have played this game and/or chronos first. if your coming into remnant from the second game expecting the same masterpiece you've got the wrong idea bro. this game is extremely good IMO. the replay-ability is off the charts. the bosses are going to be for the most part similar. most of the mini-bosses are going to have summons just like most bosses in both games. the mini-bosses just like in the second game are going to be stronger versions of elites. world bosses are going to be spicy. you'll see people complain that remnant 1 was built poorly. no your just mad cuz bad or lack understanding of the game. this game is my favorite of the 2 k. in this one i feel fairly at home in ward 13 saving the world. in the second game i feel like the time travelers wife. in both games i have soaked up as much of the story as they have given us. gone over every computer log, read every book, gone through every characters dialogue all the way thru, etc(yes even through the DLCs). i truly do recommend this game just don't go into it thinking its the same master piece. it definitely felt like when i played remnant 2 the mechanics that were touched on in the first game were greatly expanded upon. the real difference is remnant 2 is remnant 1 overhauled like a mother fucker with a story line that takes 20 years later and with a much larger budget. either way both are amazing games and remnant 2 just doesn't feel the same without playing remnant 1 first. my friends when we beat the final boss in remnant 2 the loudest sentence ive ever spoken i said then and all it was is. YES!. then i nearly cried during the credits cuz i loved the journey from the first game all the way thru the second and how well everything tied together. remnant 1 was definitely more focused on world building and story than remnant 2 same goes for chronos more focus on lore than anything from what i can tell. remnant 2 is nearly the grand finale of the game series. tho i cant wait for remnant 3.",1671152655,1695962882,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best thing about this loop in Remnant is that you lose NOTHING when you die. You died - you got more ammo, go and try again! If you keep dying, go upgrade your gear or look up a strategy for your specific boss. Or go farm more skills and/or gear in Adventure mode (repeatable random chunks of campaign world that co-exist with your campaign).

The game offers a wide selection of unique gear (weapons, armors, trinkets, all have unique effects), large pool of skills (mostly +10-20% to some stat), decent selection of monsters and bosses, and the goal is to go out there and kill stuff. There are several ""biomes"" (zones, worlds) with different styling, so things are somewhat varied.

The game has a number of difficulties if you are up for a challenge. The game runs well, plays well, is better with teammates (up to 3 players in a single ""world"").

Not a masterpiece (it gets repetitive after a while and there just aren't enough unique encounters, unique boss/monster mechanics to keep playing), but will keep you occupied for a while. Especially if you have friends to play with.

There's also ""survival mode"" where you start with a pistol, have a number of shops with VERY limited selection of gear and try your best to kill as many bosses as you can. But the longer you play, the harder the mobs get! And at some point they get too hard for you, so it's not infinite. And it offers 28 bosses in total (there are campaign-only bosses in the game, they're not present in survival). It's pretty hard but manageable. But you need the first DLC for it. Second DLC adds a small campaign and a new map and a few new items. And is required for all achievements. Both DLCs are OK, not awesome, but OK.

Overall, it's quite entertaining if you like souls like games (with large, strong bosses than do a whole ton of damage but who also have slow, well-telegraphed attacks, when you have limited healing items and rely on perfectly dodging the attacks). Except it offers guns on top of melee weapons. Most of the guns have different mechanics, and there are ""mods"" to further add variety (special effects tied to weapons, like summoning helpers or grenade launchers with area of effect attacks or damage-over-time effects, this kind of stuff).

The game has a good number of ""secrets"" you will only find by accident, or by looking them up online. I recommend playing on ""normal"" difficulty ""blind"" first, and only looking something up if you can't progress. You can study ""meta"" after you beat the main story, if you're still interested in continuing.

Some limitations: the grind gets boring after a while and despite ""procedurally generated"" worlds, there's a lot of repeating parts. More than that, in order to play through everything, you need to play the game multiple times. Bosses do not respawn, you need to ""re-roll the world"" for it. And every time you get a limited selection of those in each world, so you may end up rerolling a lot to get all the items the game has to offer. The second large limitation is that the worlds feel stale. There's just nothing happening. There are almost no NPCs, other than traders and story-related NPCs that... just stand there... you don't make any choices, you don't affect outcomes, the plot is linear, and the bits and pieces of lore, while entertaining, are quite limited.",1695849675,1695849675,True,2,0,0.502589941024780273,0,True,False,False

It used to be good but things had been nerfed so hard they no longer work as intended.
E.g. devastator is good because it shoot 5 bolts and works with bandit set that grants 35% of extra shot w/o reload per bolt. After nerf the 5 bolts is considered 1... and made it no different from using a crossbow. in fact it is weaker than a crossbow because the spread makes it unusable for range sniping.

e.g.2. devouring loop only works 5% of the time WHEN CRITTING, it used to interact with the catalyst trait that can raise it to 15% (after nerfed) ... but then they decided to nerf it again to not let it work. In that case i rather use 10% range damage increase ring.

I basically beat DS3 and ER but not officially, and I've played a bit of DS2 the original DeS. I have between 500 and 1,000 hours in all the Souls games. I'm not bad at those games, but I am by no means an expert.

Let's just get this out of the way: this is NOT a looter shooter. Remnant 2 was recently brought up in the context of the release of Diablo 4, being a supposed alternative to that dumpster fire, and I've often seen the series in general described as being ""looter shooters."" That is a gross misrepresentation. You do acquire a number of weapons, mods and armor throughout the game, but this occurs at fairly fixed points. You are not getting new gear and replacing old gear as it drops from monsters or chests. All you get from combat is upgrade materials and currency. That's it. So don't go in expecting ""loot."" You will be disappointed. I beat the game using my starting shotgun. Each weapon is viable as long as you upgrade it. There's no trash loot. All of the gear has its own strengths, weaknesses, and identities, which is honestly better for a game like this than endlessly raining stat sticks. 

With that out of the way, I am giving this game a thumbs up, but I have mixed feelings about it. 

On the one hand, it is an very fun indie souls-like shooter with some great combat and a solid presentation. Grinding for upgrades to my character and weapons/armor is more compelling than it should be. There are mods that you can apply to each weapon that add alternate fire modes that can change how you play fairly significantly. The special weapons have pre-installed mods that you can't change out, but they're fun enough that I don't really mind. Cycling back and forth between your two guns, their mods, and your melee weapon makes for exhilirating combat at times. There's solid level/enemy variety--better than a lot of AAA games. I really did appreciate that. It starts off pretty basic and boring at first, but it gets more interesting as it goes on. The graphics are really solid for what it is, as is the sound.  The voice acting is surprisingly good for a lot of characters. There are duds here and there, but there are also a lot of really solid performances that help sell the world a bit more. The soundtrack, while usually barebones and generic, has a couple epic tracks. It's good enough. It often does its job during boss fights and the like. The lore, at least as it's presented early on through text logs, is actually really interesting and made me care about the world a lot more than I would have otherwise. It's not incredible or anything, but it's better than it needs to be. It's weird and unique and msyterious and really makes you want to see what the game has in store.

Unfortunately, Remnant really is a mixed bag. While all the aforementioned things are true, it also suffers from a lot of problems. First and foremost, the boss design in this game is some of the worst and most frustrating I've ever seen. Most of them have a trick or two to their mechanics that you need to figure out, but until you do, they just feel unfair and annoying. Almost all of them feature endless waves of trash mobs. They provide you with additional ammo, but there could have easily been a different system implemented that served that purpose without being so god damned annoying. You're fighting a boss and constantly having to deal with anklebiters swarming you. And sometimes they explode! The bosses would be 80% easier if not for the endless spawning adds that get in your way. Some of the bosses are interesting, both aesthetically and mechanically, but even the best are kind of mid in the grand scheme of gaming. I can't really fault it for that, as it is an indie game by a young developer, but I can't forgive the lazy design of throwing waves of trash at the player to mask simplistic boss design, nor the terrible final boss. The final boss is absolute garbage. It's essentially impossible to beat until you figure out a very specific gimmick, and it's set up in such a way that the player has zero incentive to actually figure it out. I imagine 90% of players bash their heads against a wall and give up. I just suggest you look for a guide on his second phase, honestly. It's not rewarding enough to figure out on your own, and there's a high likelihood that you never will. It's just badly designed. Maybe bash your head for an hour or two, but do not feel guilty about looking up the solution, because the game does nothing to help you. All of that being said, I would be lying if I said I didn't feel very satisifed after killing some of the bosses. Multiple times during my playthrough I was swearing and calling the devs talentless hacks and saying how much I hate this game, but after finally beating the boss, I would say, ""I love this game."" That back and forth kind of sums up a lot of the game. The general exploration/combat gameplay is a solid 7.5-8/10 experience with a lot of soul, but the bosses are mostly dooky.

The story is pretty lame overall. The lore is cool, great even, but the actual plot is as basic as it gets. What's frustrating is that it seems like they ran out of time or money halfway through (as seems to be the case with 90% of video games nowadays). For example, early on, the NPCs in the hub would comment on your exploits as you defeated certain bosses or accomplished objectives. I looked forward to checking in at regular intervals and getting a bit more story content. But at a certain point it just stops. They never say anything new. Even after you beat the final boss, it's as if nothing happened. Early on, their comments made it feel like a real place with people reacting to events, but once it stopped the whole thing just felt a lot hollower. It's also straight up missing a final level. The final boss is thrown at the player way too quickly after getting the macguffin (which was also an unceremonious affair after the journey to it), and his location should have been a level of its own. I don't think it needed to be as big as the other levels, but it needed some kind of large dungeon-like area leading up to the final boss. After beating him, the game just sort of ends. Nothing really happens. You technically destroy the thing you wanted to at the beginning, but you don't see the consequences of it. It just happens and fades to black. The credits don't even have any music, which was very odd. The whole thing just felt like it fizzled out.

I haven't played the DLC yet, so I can't comment on its quality or if it rectifies some of the main game's shortcomings. I imagine it's decent and adds some more content, but it's separate from the main campaign and you have to access it through a menu, which is kind of lame. I highly doubt it does anything to make the main campaign's story feel any better.

On a side note, the game also features procedural generation for its dungeons, which leads to seeing a lot of the same areas repeated over and over again. It's jarring to see the exact same hallway or arena with same debris/destructibles placed in same locations that you saw a few minutes ago. It really breaks immersion, which the game can provide to a pretty decent level,  but the combat within these areas is fun enough to distract you from it, and the randomness does occasionally provide the freshness it's supposed to.

I know that's a lot of criticism, but I do genuinely recommend the game. I wouldn't care so much about the shortcomings if I didn't love the rest. It is fun and does feel special. The combat is great, there's a solid selection of weapons and playstyles. Upgrading is just inherently enjoyable. The enemy and environment variety is on point. The worldbuilding is good. There's a lot of replayability if you want to max out your stuff. If you like finding overlooked gems, check it out.",1695268041,1695268497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Where the game differs from Dark Souls by quite a lot is the absence of player messages, the addition of drop in co-op and the focus on traits for builds. The story is told partially through lore and also through interactions with the various NPCs.

To begin, my favorite part of this game is the world building. The worlds you visit outside Earth are varied and fun to explore. The developers made these various places familiar yet alien at the same time. Looking around in the environments can tell you a lot about what kind of aliens/people live there. There is an element of environmental storytelling here that I appreciate and the exploration that pays off in itself rewards you with immersion.

The gameplay is a lot of fun, particularly combat. There are a lot of ways to build your character thanks to weapon mods and traits (essentially attributes and passive bonuses). I ended up running a companion build with a dog and turrets to back me up in combat dealings with adds while I can keep myself occupied to focus on bigger targets with my own weapons. It was an incredibly effective strategy, and Remnants accessory and armor bonuses helped me flesh out the playstyle I wanted just right.

The story itself was engaging, but you do have to explore and dig around to find the finer details, mostly hidden in logs throughout the hub, Ward 13. Having lore hidden in something like computer logs can be a turn off for people, but even for those sorts of people I can say that it isn't the equivalent of reading a Harry Potter book. The logs themselves are short and sweet, they don't overstay their welcome and provide what you want out of them without extra fluff some lore entries in this format tend to have.

My only caveats with Remnant are that, first and foremost, it is quite short. I'm chalking part of this up to the difficulty I chose, that being Normal, and the build I went with through the game ended up making me quite a force to be reckoned with. I breezed through most bosses because of it, and so I'd like to suggest that any first time players who come into this game play on the next step up, Hard. If you are looking for a more relaxed experience and not the souls-like one, go with Normal. Souls fans, go with Hard. My second caveat with Remnant is quite smaller, and that's just enemies being a little samey. While their designs are intriguing, most enemies you run into have the same exact move set. Elite enemies can be fun to fight and I find are more varied.

I'd say Remnant is indeed worth a try picked up on sale. At the time of this review it is $13.99 and that is an absolute steal. I enjoyed my time quite a lot despite its length and I can absolutely see myself doing another playthrough in the future on a higher difficulty.

[i]I had to beat this game on the Microsoft Store after buying it here, so I bought this game twice, only because you cannot play with Xbox players in co-op through Steam. First time I've ever heard of this, and absolutely infuriating.[/i]

[h2]The Good[/h2]
There are very few positives to this game, but I do want to highlight them. Remnant is well optimized, moving through checkpoints back and forth is a quick process, co-op is well done and meaningful, and I never suffered any disconnects or stutters. The gun play itself is pretty satisfying, hitting crits and getting snipes definitely feels good. 

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
BORING!! Level after level of the same poorly designed layouts with a ""go-straight ahead"" mentality. There's no reason to explore anything, there's barely any chests, and very little of anything you find is of any consequence. I ended the game with the gear I started with, no loot development, no gear additions, no new weapons, a useless repeater pistol and an overpowered sniper rifle is what I started and beat the game with. 

Even the gameplay loop just feels old and meaningless. Go through an area beating the same 3 mobs, get to a boss and beat that boss with the same mobs spawning again. Worse yet, each mob in any new area is just a reskin of another mob with a slightly different weapon. I could tell you that going through some areas was mostly asking, ""Have we been here before?"". Everything feels the same, nothing is unique.

Leveling doesn't really matter. Adding points to anything doesn't have much effect, because I one-shot everything already with a sniper. Outside the bosses, mobs are a total annoyance and not a threat ever. I never even went down once not fighting a boss playing the game on normal. 

The story is a joke, I think I skipped every dialogue and cut scene I could, badly voice acted with generic nonsense that doesn't attach you to the world or the characters at all. It's surface level information more than story-telling. 

[h2]The Ugly[/h2]
My buddy and I beat the game in 2 sessions, maybe less than 10 hours. We get to the final boss, we figure out what we need to do, and we just don't care, after 20 minutes in the battle and the final boss only at 50% health, we just turned off and uninstalled the game. The final boss isn't difficult, it's tedious. 

The worse part is of course micro-transactions and paid DLC to get weapon skins.... what a joke! 

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]

The story is okay, but settings take the cake(abandoned overgrown cities, Afghanistan, Florida, and etc)
Remnant is fairly challenging alone when fighting bosses but a well balanced single player game. However it is very fun with friends exploring and labbing against difficult bosses(IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS IS A 3 PLAYER GAME). there is a comprehensive arsenal to start out with but as you explore and beat bosses you can unlock new weapons to try. There is an rpg leveling system where you learn traits over time that you can put levels into to improve certain aspects of your character. There are also slots on your 2 ranged weapons for mods that can give you a unique buff in combat (summons, heal auras, damage, and status buffs). As a shooter fan the gunplay is very clean, fair, and each gun gives a good positive feedback response.

The chapters that you roam around have minimum levels for enemies but does not have a maximum level limit for them, so if your gearlevel is 20, the enemies are 21-22, if your level is 15, the enemies are again as powerful as you.

Thus grinding does not make the game easier, there is no sense of progression regarding loot. In dark souls series, you can grind and after a while you can one-shot enemies or make them kneel before you, this game has the same upgrade path mechanic (increase the amount and quality of material that is required to upgrade and one rare material to max the item level) but you can't get the same benefit because of level scaling of enemies...

Let me start by mentioning that I'm not much of a fan of the whole Souls-Like genre out there, and hence I was skeptical about getting this game. I am so glad I did though, not only did I enjoy this game, I couldn't put it down either. But I think that's more to do with how much I started to enjoy this game once I got into it and less to do with the fact that one simply cannot be done with this game in just one playthrough.

The story was alright, but nobody ever plays a Souls-Like for the story anyway, It's all about the gameplay and Remnant: From The Ashes has so much of that, probably more than I can find words for. Amazing in-game atmosphere, the weapons are awesome and feel good to use, the mods are great and very effective, the controls are smooth, the Enemy A.I is great, there are some amazing Boss battles, even the  online co-op is great and I personally enjoyed the procedural world, which made every playthrough unique, challenging and fun in it's own way and didn't feel repetitive.

Keep in mind that this is not exactly a looter-shooter but does require a little bit of grinding for items and resources.

In this universe, an entity/infection called the The Root has taken over multiple worlds and it is our job to try and rid the world of the Root by killing the World Guardians. 

Although From the Ashes is the first game in the series that was released by Gunfire Games, it is actually the second game from a timeline perspective:

- Chronos: Before the Ashes
- Remnant: From the Ashes
- Remnant II

All of the games in the series tell how the Root was brought to Earth and then how you go about clearing it away. They are also all Souls-Like Action RPGs where there is a level of difficulty that should be expected, there are ""bonfires"" throughout each world and the majority of the lore is told through found items and not through actual storytelling. 

This game was the first Third-Person shooter based Souls-Like that I had ever experienced and I definitely enjoyed it a great deal. The only real negatives that I have to say about the game were around the world design and the lack of character build options. All of the worlds, with the exception of one, were very muted and felt like they were the worst version of themselves. You understand why because of the story, but it just meant that there was not a lot of variety in world design in my opinion. 

The are only three classes to start with and then the only weapons and armor that are available after that first selection are either through a limited set from a vendor or come from creating them after killing a boss. I played as a Hunter and stuck with long-range whenever possible and never regretted my decision. 

All weapons and armor can of course be upgraded throughout the game, just like any good souls-like, however, this only means that you are upgrading the damage. No other stats within the guns are upgraded, which gets very frustrating from an ammo perspective. 

When it comes to positives, there are a number that I do want to call out: 

- The combat mechanics felt excellent. I played on mouse/keyboard and the responsiveness was incredible
- The addition of mods for each weapons was really nice and then quick slots for consumables was a nice twist on the consumable piece of these guns
- The armor actually has an effect on gameplay and you do need to upgrade it. You will not be doing an SL1 run of this game. 
- The boss designs, especially in the latter half really made you think. They were more like puzzles to solve. Rather than only needing to figure out roll timings and attack patterns, you also needed to figure out when you could do damage or where best to deliver damage and learning weak points were very key. 

I really enjoyed this game a great deal and am looking forward to doing some Hardcore challenge runs of specific worlds as well as the Subject 2939 DLC. In addition, Remnant II has released and once a couple of the DLCs, I will definitely do a ""Professor Plays"" for that game as well. RATING: 7.5/10

For context; I played solo, no co-op experience, and with a controller.

[h2] TL;DR [/h2]
I personally love this game; from it's story and lore entries scattered around the levels, three different main modes of play (campaign, adventure and survival (DLC)), to the satisfying gunplay and combat that are complimented by a solid customization mechanic revolving around numerous weapon mods and a linear upgrade system to give a sense of progression. Traits play a huge role in the combat and gameplay, giving the player the choice of which to upgrade without missing out because once you unlock a trait, you have the minimum of bonus it can give.
Great controls, several weapons and armors to choose from, all with their own benefits and drawbacks. Break things to get more scrap (currency) and materials for upgrades.
Unfortunately, as a solo player, some bosses and encounters can feel unfair and very difficult, like bosses with endless waves of little guys that chip away at your health, making the main boss almost seem like the side piece. That paired with a short story (minus the re-rolling of campaign and adventure mode) can leave one wanting more. Despite it's shortcomings, I find myself coming back to it.
To avoid a decimal rating, I give Remnant: From the Ashes a solid
[h2] 7/10 [/h2]

[h3] Longer Review (minor spoilers) [/h3]

[b] Story [/b]
Without spoiling anything major, the story focuses on a traveler from an island who is tasked with finding a fellow member of the village who set out on a quest to defeat a Dragon (Chronos: Before the Ashes tells his story. Very different game, but good lore tie in). This Dragon is actually the main antagonist; The Root, and it's your quest as the player to destroy The Root and save the world. Still without spoilers, you find Ward 13 and meet the lovely people that reside there. Then your quest really starts.

I really like the story, the writing is great (mostly in the lore journals found throughout the levels) and the world really feels like it's on the brink of extinction. People are scared, hope is hard to find and The Root is everywhere. The story kind of falls flat when interacting with people in the Ward as the game continues, no one really mentions what you've done (except for the last thing on the first map) and post final boss, people say the same things, but the merchants (Mud Tooth and Wud being my favorites) offer more insight into their respective worlds, which is nice. Interacting with the Ward folks though, bears little in the way of lore, and the main story is pretty much all you get. For more lore, be sure to read terminals and journals, all very well written and help add context to the narrative.

[b] Combat [/b]

Folks call it a souls-like with guns, and I can see it ([b] but you lose nothing when you die. Enemies respawn, but you keep all currency, no run back [/b]). You got melee (some variation in there makes it fun to try new weapons), stamina consuming dodging/sprinting (melee doesn't consume stamina, but halts it's regeneration while swinging), and guns, some of which don't have much reserve ammo, and there's no way to increase how much ammo you can have on hand. Guns are the better option for primary engagement, but be mindful of ammo. Some enemies drop ammo (long gun and side arm, so no weapon specific ammo), but ammo boxes will be your friend in the later portions of the game.
Gunplay can be broken down into weak spots and critical hits doing the most damage, while body shots and hitting armor do the least. Melee is pretty straight forward, just be aware, special enemies, as their known (bigger and accompanied by a music cue) rarely stagger when hit with melee, they will hit back and hit back hard. Thankfully, most smaller common enemies will stagger and can be dealt with using melee, saving ammo for the special guys.
Combat can get repetitive, depending on the boss or enemy type, but I personally find it satisfying to land a critical and see the enemy drop. [b] Be wary of groups of enemies, especially in tight spaces and as a solo player, this can be maddening and lead to death. [/b]

[b] Bosses (Minor Spoilers) [/b]

Like any souls-like, the bosses are often the highlight and this game has it's fair share. The bosses in the first area are good, fun and well thought out. From arenas to movesets, I found myself able to beat most of them after a try or two. But that's not to say they're all good.
*Spoilers (and minor rant)*
[spoiler] Oh my god. The Harrowing on Rhom (second area) is not fun, at all, I hate it. He has an instant kill move, endless runts spawning, a horrible arena and does that ""retreat and reappear to ruin your day"" crap. This isn't a boss fight, this is padding.
Then, on Reisum (DLC), these damned RATS spill out of the ceiling forever until you frantically rush to the spawn crystals and smash them. That's it, that's the boss fight, that's the whole fight. Yaesha (last area) did something similar in a ""random event"" in which if you look at the wall, no joke, endless undead will vomit forth, becoming increasingly more powerful, until you destroy the even stronger crystals.
Seriously, listen, if you look at the floor the whole time (except looking up to break the crystals), and use your map as navigation, the undead won't spawn and you can win easy (thank you Wiki, bless you). But I couldn't find the hint that told me that, so I was frustrated for two hours before finally finishing it. [/spoiler]

So, aside from some bosses better off being played with another person, they felt good to fight and very satisfying to take down. Kind of a bummer, but you can't skip boss introduction scenes. You only see it once when you fight them, so it's not like you see it several times while dying/trying again, but if you do adventure mode or re-roll campaign, you've already seen the introduction but can't skip it because it's like you're encountering them for the first time, if that makes sense.

[b] General Atmosphere [/b]

Graphics, sound, level design, music (Ward 13 and menu tracks hit nicely), all give off the post-apocalyptic vibes you'd expect. Eerie when needed and some actually gorgeous locals, all of which have items you can break for more scarp or items, but [spoiler] Rhom [/spoiler] has too many, some breakable pots being on shelves that you have to waste ammo to get to, and even then the scrap isn't guaranteed.

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]

I really like this game and the story it tells. I like the combat loop, the looting without weight limit, the traits system, adventure mode, and even survival, to an extent (even though the timer that dictates enemy strength ticks down as you're waiting to return to the main hub, meaning you lose around 12 seconds just getting back from a run). Aside from some things holding it back, and how much more fun it probably is with another person, I still find this to be a great solo experience worth giving a try.

Very low amount of weapons (Infact 3 types of weapons).

Cheap bosses with ads because otherwise it would be too easy when they have like 3 attacks (Infact one boss is only about killing the ads).

Weapons feel alright.

Very grindy and unrespectful for the players time.

Multiplayer is dead - probably even more now after Remnant 2.

Maps are way too big or way too empty depending how you look at it... Nonetheless you spend more time running than playing.

It was a bit more grindy than I would of wanted, especially the 10 waves on survival and 40 cosmetic ones, but I eventually got it and feel I can now write my review for the game.

I think this game is stellar, I still remember getting it free on the Epic launcher and thinking ""why not"" only to easily dump 100+ hours into the game. I hadn't even played a Darksouls game before so when my friend told me it was a ""souls-like"" I had no idea what he meant, but I quickly found out as I almost rage quit on my first boss. I definitely think this is the perfect game to kick start someones souls-like career since it has the punishing aspects of one...but with guns, allowing for someone to deal consistent damage from afar and avoid needing to be up close and personal with the enemies.

I will say though that about half the boss fights weren't as fun as they could've been, in my opinion, since they spammed you with adds on top of the boss attacking you. This meant you needed to try to dispose of the adds as quickly as possible (who can be pretty beefy on higher difficulties) or else try to somehow avoid a half a dozen attacks at once. I am very glad that they toned back the add spam in Remnant 2, as well as made the game less grindy. My only other complaint is that the difficulty scaling is quite sever, going from 165% HP and Damage on hard to 300% on nightmare was way too big of a jump to make me realistically play above hard until I painstakingly maxed most of my offensive and defensive traits. I feel like a difficulty between hard and nightmare is needed for those that want slightly more of a challenge than hard but don't want to be 2 shot on nightmare. Sadly this is also an issue in Remnant 2, but atleast in Remnant 2 I feel like the game is more forgiving both grind-wise and build experimentation/variety wise. 

Overall I feel like this game was a hidden gem, and although I am glad it got the recognition it needed for a second game (which I personally enjoy more) I think the first game is still good enough to stand out on its own and is definitely worth a try.",1693449629,1693449629,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

If someone finds a gun and 3 crafting items during play, everyone will have them in inventory afterwards -- Remnant rewards cooperation and exploration rather than sabotaging / trolling your friends.

Even normal mode is a good challenge. The game does a great job of letting you fight, die, and learn. You grind for that first boss kill, and are rewarded with your first really cool upgrade which helps you take out your second boss for your second upgrade, etc. You have to work for your accomplishments and so they mean something when you get them.

While Remnant is not a bad game, it is far from being good. It's very rough around the edges and feels empty at times. It might be fun at the start but you begin to find the cracks deeper you go. Certainly not a ""Dark Souls with guns"", it doesn't even feels like a souls-like.[/b]

[h1]The Good[/h1]

+ Some environments look nice.

+ Guns change visuals depending on what mods you slot in them. Thats cool.

+ Shooting feels fine. Can't complain there. Gunplay isn't bad.

+ Finding keys and opening doors with them in the hub is a good idea. Makes it interactive.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

- Story, in its core, is not that bad but writing is a big question mark. You don't feel anything for the characters. They are just there. Apart from that, Remnant keeps introducing new characters and factions but none of it is explored nor explained. Nothing memorable for me except the mute guy.

- You pick a class in the beginning but it doesn't matter much. They have one class trait and one weapon mod which you can get with other classes too. They have different weapons and armor aswell but you can buy them from the vendor later.

- Progression and gameplay variety are almost non existent. No feeling of improvement other than giving points to basic traits which gives you +5 hp, +%2 crit etc.

- Melee ""builds"" are usually useless on boss fights. It is not rewarding nor satisfying to play. They are good for killing normal enemies throughout the map IF your teammate is using melee aswell. Otherwise he/she is going to kill them before you even reach them.

- Most bosses are just awful. No exciting designs to see here. They have the same mechanics. They take damage, they spawn mobs, you kill them and damage the boss until another wave spawns.

- For first playthrough, hard difficulty was too easy, we just ran through it except that stupid three orb fight. Nightmare, being designed for later runs, was too hard for a fresh character so there was no middle ground.

[h1]Survival Mode[/h1]

[b]This game mode had potential but it's all wasted.[/b]

- ""Builds"" you make doesn't feel much different at all. You play almost the same everytime. Unique armor skills are not varied enough. Existing ones are not fun nor game changing. Apart from that, despite game having lots of different melee weapons, melee ""builds"" are mostly useless.

- While you are picking up traits from the ground, you can't see what buff they give. You can only see their assigned names which you have to memorize to know what it does. Very basic QoL to implement imo.

- You can't save while you are playing survival mode. If you quit the game in the middle of a run, you lose all progress. What year is this?",1690469438,1692448281,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I usually brush off any comparison games make to the FromSoft formula because most of them disappoint, however, this title truly delivers.

When playing solo, there is a sense of isolation and the game has so much more immersion. When you get to party play, it becomes more like a co-op shoot-'em-up, which has its own charm and allows you to progress much quicker through the zones and allows you to replay them many times.

The whole principle of the game is to go back into the same areas to get different events/bosses and level up your character.
It gives the campaign kind of a weird flow because when we reached the final boss (base game), we had to go farm for the first time because of the difficulty spike and no npc lets you know it's how it works so we got kinda frustrated with the fight.

I should probably start with saying that I played it on hard difficulty with a partner.

We genuinely tried to play through it with a friend, but it only gets worse as you go further into the game.

Terrible game design. Progression is meaningless because enemies scale to your equipment level anyway. Traits are weak and take 20 levels just to max one out, even if you get them relatively quick.

Most boss fights are awful. Bosses themselves are too easy to deal with, except they flood the arenas with millions of trash mobs in almost every fight, which makes things more annoying than challenging. And some bosses have bad design, plain and simple.

Weapons in the game are... nothing special. Some are okay, others are just not effective enough to justify using them. And you can't get many of them simply because certain bosses didn't spawn in your world/playthrough. So you must find them elsewhere or reroll the world if you want to get something specific.

I don't really have anything good to say about the game. It's difficult to understand why this game has so many positive reviews. The visuals are alright. But everything else is... mediocre. Enemy/boss designs aren't that good, some enemies from different worlds share the same attack patterns/animations, the story is just there.

Almost everything is forgettable. Except for the awful gameplay that feels super outdated.

The gray filled color schemes of the early screenshots and the chunky armor designs just didn't hit for me. Being someone who gets grabbed by aesthetics and visuals first and foremost, I put it on my ignore list and moved on.

So imagine my shock when I see a trailer for Remnant II and realize it's the sequel to From The Ashes. And this trailer showed worlds exploding with color and life and adventure and featuring planar travel, a theme I didn't know the game centered around. A theme I don't see all that often and actually love wholeheartedly.

 Knowing the new game wouldn't be out for a bit, I picked up From the Ashes and dove in and then felt sadness, because I realized I was getting into this experience right at the tail end of it's life-cycle. Not nearly as many players to explore with, so I pushed through on my own with three different characters. 

Even at only 24 hours of play before moving to the sequel, I was stunned. Diverse environments, tight shooter controls and intense battles, as well as bizarre alien planescapes that nonetheless felt vaguely familiar. Influences ranging from Fallout, to Alien, to Hellraiser, to Black Sun and more, all of them somehow both tight and linear and claustrophobic, yet expansive and beckoning you to explore all at once.

The game has it's shortcomings, like any other. Charms and upgrades felt really narrow and a bit too simple, NPC models sometimes looked a bit too recycled and yeah, this game is best played with friends and if you don't have anyone else join you, it can be a lonely and difficult struggle to the next checkpoint, but I can also see how much love was put into this game and it's setting and I'm really glad it I picked it up.

Just to say too, the sequel improves on pretty much everything and I'm playing that now, but if you're looking for a focused, fun and unique adventuring experience, both this and Remnant II are great titles and well worth exploring. (My only complaints about the sequel so far are that it's got some spawning glitches and it's graphically more intense, so I can't run it on max settings like this one), but again, definitely worth giving From the Ashes and Remnant II a go!",1691526217,1691526217,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

DO:
Play with friends. Yeah, you can solo the game just fine but the real magic happens when you have somebody else shooting up the apocalypse with you. It's honestly something special when you and a buddy make two meme builds and find out none of the enemies are laughing because they're a lot better than you would've thought.

Take your time. This game has a LOT of RNG, so there's going to be a long, hard grind. Take things as they come and enjoy the ride, you'll get what you're looking for eventually.

Read the wiki. Look, it's fine to complete each zone a few times without looking up anything to get the blind experience, but between the many, MANY obscure unlockables and the ungodly amount of RNG this game has you're gonna need to check that wiki.

Remember you have a melee weapon. it may seem stupid in a shooter, but there are a lot of enemies that don't deserve a bullet. Save that ammo, my friends.

DON'T:
Take the story too seriously. Look, the devs tried to make a Dark Souls style ""fill in the blanks"" story and they clearly didn't realize how hard that is. There are a lot of parts that don't make any sense whatsoever, so just enjoy it for what it is and shrug off the bits that the devs didn't think through. 

Be afraid to experiment. The starting kits you get are all solid, but the fun part of this game is cooking up wacky builds and finding out they work a whole lot better than expected

Be discouraged when you fail. Failure's mandatory in this game. You're going to die a lot while you figure things out and when you're working on new  builds, so just shake it off and get even with whatever eldritch monstrosity just disemboweled you. 

Waste your simulacrum. They're a pain to grind, so spend them on dragon heart upgrades and weapons you 100% know you'll use a lot.",1691446678,1691446678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gunplay was alright, but it didn't really matter since the core gameplay does not change at all as you ""progress"". New weapons and armor are extremely rare to come across unless you go out of your way to look for them or get lucky. The maps are pre-generated using cells so lots of the environments lack any detail and remains stale. There was a point where the same cell showed up until my friend and I finished the level and I swear my brain was melting. These cells are also generated upon starting the campaign so you cannot even farm certain equipment if you are unlucky with your campaign and have to restart to unlock those items. All enemies really boil down to either charge with melee or spam projectile and only look a bit different. Bosses are simply designed and are often just variants of the minibosses or overworld enemies. Every single boss has an ads phase without, with the end boss even having it as a core mechanic. The traits are not anything cool either, as they are just stat increases like crit chance or revive speed which progress at such a slow rate, that if you do not invest multiple points into them they feel negligible.

I got this game because I was interested in Remnant 2, but I didn't want to be lost in the story so I figured I'd play through this one before. 

I actually picked this game up originally for free through the Game Pass, but didn't really spend too much time playing it. I think not long after that it was removed from the Game Pass. Ultimately, this game is good, but I wouldn't go as far as to say its great. I'd give it a 7/10. I'm also not much of a Souls-like fan - I play them if they're accessible to me. This game really is perfect for people that want a challenge but also don't want to die on the same boss 15+ times. 2-3 good runs and you generally figure out what you need to do, that doesn't mean its ""easy"" but combat feels very rewarding and when I did die, I never felt like it was something beyond my control. 

Like most souls-like games I encounter, the movement mechanics can feel a little clunky, but for the genre this game is actually really good comparatively. I absolutely love the gunplay in this game, feels very smooth on either Keyboard or Controller. 

I know a few games from Gunfire, and I don't remember the graphics looking so ""dated"". The game was released in 2019 and honestly, I would have expected it to look a little nicer. The textures are kinda basic, some things look cool but some worlds can feel a little empty-looking. 

The UI is not the greatest, the mini-map is like trying to read blueprint schematics and even on a 4k monitor its really small and hard to see the details of what corridors lead to where. 

The leveling system is ok. It's pretty simple. Knowing what I know now about Remnant 2, it makes this one look a lot worse in my opinion. 

Those are the only real complaints I have and they honestly don't detract from the game as a whole. The game is fun and Im having a really good time playing it. It's great at keeping my attention. I recommend this game for sure, but if you are thinking about getting Remnant 2 and you don't care about the story - that game is just objectively better in almost every way.",1691145500,1691145500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is no way to give a ""Neutral"" review at this point, so I had to be extremely nitpicky and ultimately decided I would not recommend it even though I personally enjoy it. While there are a lot of things the game does well, there are ultimately 2 fuhdamental issues that really hold this back from being an incredible experience.

Let's start with the good:
- Graphics are fine, not outstanding but certainly adequate. The World Design however, is gorgeous.
- Controls are generally responsive, for the most part and animations seem adequate as well.
- Gunplay is satisfying and Weapons (especially Boss Weapons and Mods) are extremely diverse. Hundreds of fun and effective builds to try (though saved loadouts would make this even better!) 
- Seamless Co-op Experience is always an objective plus, but the solo experience is (mostly) fine too!
- General Gameplay Loop, Killing Mobs/Elites, Exploring for Loot and Searching out / Killing Bosses is all fun. Adventure Mode is a great way to add replayability to areas you've already explored in campaign without having to re-roll your entire campaign just to hopefully get the combo of loot drops you wanted.

Now, let's talk about the headaches: First and most irritating is Boss Design. I will give credit that many of the bosses pose unique alternative kill prompts to unlock different Loot. This is a very cool idea, sometimes it is executed very meaningfully (such as destroying a body part of a boss prior to killing it) and sometimes it's barely thought about or implemented at all (one boss you literally flick a switch to determine which loot you get). Almost every boss in this game is composed of a handful of attacks, a phase of summoning mobs/elites to swarm you, some more attacking, rinse and repeat. Bosses typically will have some sort of super move or equivalent that does extremely high damage and can either instantly kill you (especially on higher difficulties) or a flurry of attacks that stunlocks you to death due to the swarming mobs they call in. In general, Boss Fights in this game left me extremely unsatisfied, both because of how repetitive they were and how little diversity there is among them, but also because more often than not, deaths don't really teach you anything other than if you get hit by that attack it's an instant death or to manage the swarming mobs better. This was really disappointing because I felt like there was a lot of diversity among regular enemies between worlds, but the boss design really felt like the same boss that pounds on you, then runs away to summon ads to swarm you with a different core mechanic thrown on top. Certain bosses that possess these nasty, one-hit-kill-even-with-maxed-traits-moves honestly didn't even feel fun and left me hoping they'd just be over. All in all, the gameplay experience is great, but the boss fights are low in quality for a Soulslike.

Lack of Content/map diversity: While there is an overabundance of equipment and content you will need to grind for, realistically, there are 5 zones in the game and between 7 and 10 bosses per zone, many of which are elites reskinned as bosses. That's it. While it will take you ages to grind out every piece of equipment, every armour set, every ring and trinket, etc. It's not going to be super satisfying because you'll be repeating the same map layout every time in adventure mode with 3 or 4 of the 10 dungeons/interactions available to the map. The RNG for which events show up is so unforgiving that the commonly accepted meta is to use a save editor to scan your game for events and keep resetting until you have the desired event. This grind started of fun in adventure mode, but quickly becomes a slog when you have collected about 90% of everything and you're waiting on that last weapon, last ring, last questline, etc. to spawn and it never does. This could be really bad luck as well, but almost all of my map generations look the exact same and have extremely similar layouts. 

These two issues ultimately lead to a middling experience in moments that should be the climaxes of the game realistically, as well as a general slog through the core gameplay loop as you try to farm out gear and mods and items in an extremely repetitive map generation with extremely unforgiving RNG for random events. It's really a shame because this game is EXTREMELY fun and I thoroughly enjoy it in the overwhelming majority of situations, particularly the open area fights and exploration, whether solo or cooperative . . . except when I do not.",1690966665,1690966665,False,2,0,0.504519462585449219,0,True,False,False

I think that you are supposed to grind stats and fight on high difficulties but to me the whole increase x stat to be able to be strong enemy who's difference is a stronger x stat, isn't good game design or fun to engage with.

That's not because the game wants to be a souls like, that's because the difficulty isn't natural or rewarding. You can see that they tried to incorporate some tactics with SOME bosses, but a majority of them don't feel special or unique. The game favors hordes instead of tactics while making sure the AI gets a hit on you despite perfectly dodging the enemy that already locked you in. At times your input can feel off or slightly delayed, as well as completely ignored. The game can be fun if you're playing with a friend (I suggest multiple, if you have them), but I would probably advise against playing the game solo. The game is not balanced very well and I've already addressed it's favorite way to engage the player.

Anyways, it's a thumbs up because it's better than most of the games that are released these days, and as I said, with friends the game becomes much more enjoyable.

Putting a stagger mechanic for players, but not enemies, into a shooter game with melee combat just makes melee untenable. As does having poorly set hitboxes and collision detection.

I would call this less of a souls-like and more of a souls-inspired. It honestly feels more like a diet Destiny experience to me than anything else. Though there are a lot of things ripped straight from Fromsoft, even to the point of one whole boss making me wonder if I booted up the wrong game. Fighting in an area that's too small to handle? Check. Boss attacks intentionally designed to knock you off the edge instead of actually fight you? Check. Annoying mechanic where the boss moves away into a position where you can't damage it as much? Check. Unnecessary double boss fight where the second boss adds zero interesting mechanics? Check. I mean come on guys, you just stole Moonlight Butterfly and accidentally hit ctrl+v one too many times. 

There are so many interesting concepts and ideas here that are really cool and fun to explore. The traits system is pretty cool, though it is one the slowest and least impactful (per level) leveling systems I've used. Unfortunately my biggest issue with this game is with the way leveling and gearing up works with how the game balances. The developers have confirmed that the game sets the difficulty of the area you are in by the gear you are wearing when you enter the area and how leveled it is. They use a formula that hasn't been made clear to weight pieces of gear differently. This means that the game actively punishes you for grinding and leveling up your weapons and armor. You can inadvertently make the game more difficult at random points by upgrading, which makes the flow of the game feel really strange. I only played on normal, so at no point did it become overwhelmingly difficult, but the difficulty went back and forth from a walking simulator to enemies completely filling the screen and taking entire clips to take down (with a fully upgraded weapon). I fully upgraded myself at the end of the game and all it seemed to do was turn all the enemies (including the most basic ones) into bullet sponges. The game didn't necessarily get more difficult, just more annoying. 

The game was very obviously built with co-op in mind, but if you're lonely like me and have no one to play with it can still provide a pretty fun experience.",1690676513,1690676513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What it gets right: 

The gunplay: The shooting and the movement is tight and precise and it feels like you are in control all of the time. Despite being ""Dark Souls with guns"", the game is challenging but fair and if you play carefully, you can overcome every obstacle. Yes, the single-player mode feels harder (because all of the mobs focus on you), but it will never make you feel frustrated or angered or rage-quit. 

The gameplay: The gameplay is pretty straight-forward: You either clear mobs in a semi-open environment, or you clear mobs in a dungeon or you fight bosses. The mobs are easy but they can be challenging when they swarm on you (so you have to prioritize) or when they combine range and melee attacks. The bosses are a challenge, mostly because you have to switch constantly between the boss and the boss. It's fun and it works. It doesn't do a lot of things, but the one-two things it does, it does perfectly

The traits and the gear: The gear is scarce, so it is not a looter-shooter. Also the gear is upgradable, so you can finish the game with your original gear from level one - if you upgrade it constantly. The same applies to the guns. I finished the game with the sniper rifle I had from the start. There are some interesting weapons with interesting mods (like summoning adds), and you can upgrade them easily by running adventures (random generated content). The traits are plenty and they really help. If you are on single-player, focus on the glutton trait, mostly because every consumable takes 3-4 seconds to activate, so if you consume an item, you'll probably die before you get full health. 

What doesn't get right: 

The story: While the idea is great (the rot taking over the worlds) and the multiverse is interesting, the story is  non-existent as it doesn't have any plot, any characters, any tension or anything at all. The game doesn't need them, to be perfectly honest, but it is such a missed opportunity. 

The lack of pause: Yes, even if you are single-player offline, you can pause this game. If something happens and you need to leave, you might as well quit, because the mobs will come and get you eventually. 

Generally, I recommend Remnant even to the players that don't play souls-like games in general. It's a good game, but the lack of an engaging story deprives it of being a memorable game into a just enjoyable one.",1690636720,1690636720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You've got your reusable Estus, Bonfires that respawn non-boss enemies, unlockable shortcuts, etc. Some big differences: there's melee, but this is really a shooter and while melee-focused builds are possible, they're probably for experienced players; you don't loose anything upon dying (you don't even need to recover money/xp from your corpse); maps and bosses aren't fixed like in Dark Souls, but shuffled for each playthrough. If you've played modular boardgames like Zombicide you probably have an idea: each region is made of tiles, with dungeons, bosses and events being drawn from a pool to make a 'unique' playthrough. This is a game to be replayed and you can't get everything in a single playthrough.

To help with this there's Adventure Mode, which let's you roll a specific world in a smaller version compared to the campaign, which is great for farming and getting specific items. There's a roguelike mode called Survival too.

I love this game, especially for co-op. I love the visual design, the music is nice, many weapons/powers, diverse worlds ranging from post-apocalyptic to sci-fi to fantasy...but it has its issues. Bosses tend to rely on too many mobs to make them harder, which can be frustrating and my complaint. It can however be offset by playing with others or just familiarizing yourself with the game. 

For a new player the game can feel like it doesn't offer many options or that builds aren't really a thing: your first character will probably be a mess of whatever you found along the way. As you get familiar with the game you'll be able to actually build a build and those can be intensely satisfying. Again, nothing new for soulslikes, they rarely have smooth learning curves.

Speaking of which, this game has a stupid scaling system that it doesn't bother explaining. Just don't upgrade your weapons too fast, keep all your gear balanced and you should be fine.

So, for my future self (should I be spared, and for anyone who happens to be passing by)  this game is quite fun, with a reasonable progression through the first part. The last time I played this I really didn't understand the mechanic, or the nature of the grind, so I cheated by using an invulnerability mod and played all the way to the end. 
There's a campaign mode, and an adventure mode. The adventure mode is optional, except that it isn't really.
The adventure mode is a great place to grind, so that you can get all the goodies that you didn't get in the campaign. The campaign is random, and you can replay sections, but if you don't get an item that you know should drop in that level, then you go into adventure mode and grind until you get it.
BUT the grind will also give you lots of currency (scrap & iron) which you can use to upgrade your gear. The only problem with that is that levels are scaled to your gear. That's right, as you enter each new level the game reads your gear, does a calculation and sets the difficulty level. So, levelling your gear early will make the current level easier, but the subsequent level harder, and since you cannot sell or otherwise get rid of your gear even gear you're not using is going to count against you.
Ah, then why not keep the same early gear so that the game remains at the same difficulty level? Good idea superhero in the rubber suit, but then you have bosses. Of course you do!
Bosses. I. Hate. Bosses. Especially these ones, some of which are nearly impossible unless you play in co-op. To beat the bosses, guess what you need to do? Get tougher! How do we get tougher? Upgrade our gear!
Admittedly, there are ""traits"", which affect your physical abilities, and these are not used for level scaling, but it will still take you an age to get tough enough and traited enough to deal with any particular boss.
And these bosses are really, really unrealistic. Hide behind a pillar and see the boss dead-drop you from the other side, ignoring all those pesky bricks and concrete. Stay at what looks like a safe distance and be amazed as the boss's reach is seemingly invisibly extended beyond its corporeal body. Run away from the boss and go all stealthy and stuff, only to marvel at the ability of the boss to spawn additional enemies that act like homing missiles, heading straight to a location they cannot see!
Is it all worth it in the end?
No, not really. The problem is that there are no big ""souls like"" rewards, no magical vistas or amazing locations, just more grinding, which means lots of the same thing, which would be OK if the game was like Borderlands, where grinding is fun and colourful, and you get to loot like a woke New Yorker. But this is just more of what you're desperately trying to leave behind you.
So, it's a ""no"" from me on this one.

Very often i click rmb to use my ranged weapon, and the character just stands there doing nothing. Even worse, if i trust the controls and after holding rmb i click lmb, the character would just melee and not switch to ranged weapons. Same goes for melee. You dodge you opponent's attack, and want to immediately punish, mash that lmb, but your guy just stands there looking at the mob, missing the window of opportunity.
This game wants you to study enemy attack patterns, especially considering it has a melee archetype. But then it simply screws you over with these amazingly numb controls. It is extremely frustrating.

Narrative is shit. It's just gibberish. NPC open mouths and start to spit out random words. You can make nothing out of it. Who would've thought lore from equipment would be much better.

It's not (very) difficult game. World is pretty empty and uninteresting to explore, but here and there several beautiful sceneries to be enjoyed.
Bosses also have some nice animations, but again, challenge-wise nothing close to Souls games. Almost all bosses have one same recipe - adds swarm. And accordingly the strat is the same - kill adds, shoot the boss and it's weakspots, repeat.

I didn't buy any DLC, you can check Mixed reviews on your own and in vanilla version there's almost no armor. We've completed the game and had maybe up to 5 armor sets, 3 of which for sure wasn't suitable for the class (game style) you play. Situation a bit better with boss weapons, but unfortunately you needed to somewhere grind the resource to be able to buy them all, because same resource is being used for upgrades. I've got most weapons, as always some may be fun, but not enough for your purposes. Low amount of ""class weapons"". I've played with Sniper Rifles and there's maybe 4 of the in the all game. It has 20-30-40 times less gear than the Souls games.

I was baited in this project with all the Souls talk and expected good amount of content. This game is pretty short ~15 hours. For gameplay (not story) oriented game it's nothing.

This project need so many QoL features. Maybe they've made work on mistake in the next game, but I'm not really interested. Maybe someday at -75% :D

That and the level-scaling being on the level of upgrade of your equipment mean you are never really stronger or more resistant.

After 38 hours in the game, I can say Remnant is worth playing for the well-written story and inventive world most importantly, but also for the co-op fun factor. And everything else.

STORY: Amazing. So inventive. Very few, if any, writing flaws that really bothered me. I've not had a game story this good in a while! It's rare to find good writing nowadays, so this story was really satisfying. I can happily say I did not skip any dialogue in this game. Ever. There are also some parts of the story that are affected by your choices, which is really fun! If you really wanted to, you could just say ""fuck it"" and kill the dude you were helping, or help someone you were meant to kill instead. Super fun to have that agency.

WORLD: Again, SO inventive! It's sci-fi and fantasy wrapped up in one. I'd liken it to the creatures & world travel of Star Wars mixed with the apocalyptic atmosphere of Fallout + some unidentifiable magic dust that makes it so unique. It's unimaginably fun and intriguing. I found myself wanting more of the lore and worlds. Gods, if I could come up with this kind of stuff, I'd be a bestselling author.

CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION: Could use some work. There aren't many options here, either for appearance or for gear. In general though, it's not bad, and I made a character I really liked looking at the whole game through. At least they have curly hair!! Aesthetically, I do like that we wear backpacks - so much more realistic than most post-apocalyptic games out there.

UI: Very clean and clear. Nothing's in my way, though I wish I could see my health a bit easier. The map isn't great, but I usually didn't really need it too much.

GAMEPLAY & CONTROLS: Pretty smooth and intuitive. Feels a little like Outriders, actually. A lot of the weapons feel amazing to use, especially the sniper rifles and crossbow. Some of the gameplay is very difficult, which is super satisfying to beat, though some bosses are just incredibly hard while others are way too easy. However, sometimes dodging is a little slow and you're sitting there spamming the spacebar trying to get out of an impending AoE, to no avail.

GRAPHICS & SOUND DESIGN: Beautiful game! It's not AAA but it looks gorgeous, especially all the alien races.

NPCs & MOBS: Amazing. Never got tired of them. There's a wealth of diversity in this game that is beautiful to see, because you know someone put a ton of effort into designing all of them - not just their appearance, but also their culture. Every race we encounter in the various worlds is unique. The people we meet along the way are also interesting characters (not just the human ones!).

CO-OP: Very fun! I don't think I played the game solo, even though that was fun too - it's just so much more exciting to discover these worlds and vanquish these foes with a friend. It's a little weird to get it running, but once it goes, it's nice and smooth.

BUGS: Not much to say here. There were a couple glitches, but nothing important enough to recall or care about. Definitely nothing game-breaking.

OTHER: I also played this game in French since I'm learning, and it was wonderful. The French voices sound just beautiful, and it's really rather easy to understand. Bravo, Gunfire team!",1689978032,1689978032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My complaint was mainly that the movement was clunky, combined with some un-fun encounters early in the game that led me to refund the game since I was already unsure of it going in.

Recently, however, I was convinced to give it another shot after having picked it up free on EGS at some point, and I'm actually having a *lot* of fun with it. Not just ""glad I picked it up for free"" fun, but ""I've been missing out"" fun. So I'm here changing my review, even though the new hours I've put into it won't be shown here. It's a very fun co-op game, just try to go in without any specific expectations. I had those, and they led me astray, but the game in its own right is pretty great.

Update: I've finished the game now and there's some serious caveats I need to add to this review. First, the game is *way* too short to justify its price. There's some replay expected to bring up the count a bit, but I'm at only 20 hours after finishing the story and all the dungeons my brother and I encountered, not counting the DLC. Second, the story doesn't really have an ending. You kill a boss with only a little bit of story build-up, and then the credits roll. There's no resolution, and there's not even any new voice lines for the NPCs. If not for the fact I'm playing the game for free, I'd feel more than a bit cheated right now.

I am casual to the core, insomuch that I rarely set a game above normal difficulty. This is a problem because I like Soulslike games; they are accessible to the casual gamer like myself and I always get my money's worth. The problem is that I never finish any of them because there is always one boss that stands in the way of progress. I spend about 50 times trying to kill one, look up strategies online, try those strategies about 100 more times and then ultimately quit the game, which is sad because it leaves me frustrated and feeling like I wasted time.

But the fact is, I won't, and I don't want to turn into the type of person that does git gud and then repeat that sentiment to others, so  I am hearby swearing of Soulslike games.

Then I heard that there's a sequel on the way and I was intrigued and decided to pick this up while it was on sale and give it another try, and boy do I regret not sticking with it back then.

I'm nowhere near completing this game but I just wanted to write a quick review because of how the story and the lore hooked me instantly this time around. The game is very linear, the enviroment looks more repetitive than anything I've played really and the gunplay is fun enough to keep me busy but the lore, oh man. 

I guess the similarity of this world and the world of Darksiders is what got me hooked while exploring and reading every single journal I came across. The backstory is pretty obscure but it's still so interesting - I'm looking forward to discovering more of ""The Founder"" than the actual game. Just following the story of this one man and how he tried to find out how to stop the ""Root"" that is the antagonist of the game (far as I know as of yet).

In preparation for said sequel I've been replaying this game in anticipation and I'm so happy to say it still holds up. 

So what is remnant? Well it's like if dark souls and resident evil 4 had a baby, sounds like recipe for disaster but not only does it work it works well.

Pros 
- fantastic gunplay, this game feels good to play with weapons that feel punchy and control well. This is one of the most important things you need to nail in a 3rd person shooter and I'm happy to say this game delivers.

- weapon and armour variety. We have lots of cool guns and sets to play with and whilst most meta builds demand certain guns and sets the amount we do get are staggering and inventive.

- decent build variety, it's fun to make builds in this game and you can make some pretty powerful stuff. The only issue being you will see the same meta builds endgame and this does weaken build options. Thankfully it seems this has been fixed in the sequel.

- varied biomes which have randomly generated events and quests which can be re-rolled for more replayability. The game is quite short and you can finish it in about 25 hours on your first run but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't re-roll the campaign a few times or mess about in adventure mode, the story is short but the gameplay is long.

- lore, it's not great and a bit cheesy compared to dark souls but it still invites mystery and it is fun to unravel. 

- really good dlc offerings and post game support 

Cons 
- builds are determined by armour sets as skills are tied to sets and the optimal choice is to stack critical damage meaning you will see lots of people running the same sets. Look it might seem silly but not being able to express yourself through fashion is quite a detriment to me. Seeing all these cool sets and knowing I won't use them because the skills they have suck ass is a massive shame, thank god this has been fixed in the sequel.

- graphics and voice acting aren't as polished as you'd expect. They certainly aren't bad but some npcs don't sound amazing and the small amount of voice lines your character has really get old quick, this isn't an AAA game so it's completely understandable but it is something that bothered me a bit 

- no hip fire, this isn't in the sequel either and I'm a bit annoyed about that. I really feel it would improve the game but I suppose the devs don't agree, fair enough I'm not a dev and I don't know if it would be op in a game like this but I do miss it's absence.

Conclusion
I really love this game and if you enjoy souls likes, 3rd person shooters or just looters in general then this game is an easy recommend. Is it perfect? No, but it's pretty damn close.

Now bring on the sequel.

Why didn't I try again?

Because I spent the entire game fighting easy bosses that had their HP padded with never ending waves of enemies spawning in to back them up to make up for how on a fundamental level they're poorly designed bosses. It was a tedious game to play all the way through and the final boss was the most tedious one by far. I was sick of the game at the end and the thought of playing any longer no longer appealed to me, so I stopped and uninstalled the game.

I came back to play it in the lead up to Remnant 2, hoping that after years of balance changes the game would be less a slog. But no, it's actually worse now somehow. Or maybe my tolerance for ill thought out design has just lessened.

My advice? If you buy the game don't play it solo, or don't play the harder difficulties. They're doable, you have all the tools to beat the harder difficulties solo. But you will not have fun.

I can see a decent game in there. The controls work well, the guns are nice. It feels like they managed to pull off a double A game on a single A budget. But their commitment to making the enemies unbearably tanky and spawning in endless adds during boss fights makes it real hard to recommend. 

Every boss fight I wished the boss itself was more aggressive and dangerous in exchange for not having to deal with the adds. Most of the time the bosses hang around doing the most basic easy to dodge attacks imaginable, they'd be absolutely no threat at all if not for the enemies spawning in constantly. It's like the devs made the bosses, realised they suck and even if they one hit you they're no threat so decided rather than make them more engaging, they could bandaid it with minions instead. So you spend 95 percent of the boss fight dispatching weaklings to buy you breathing room to shoot the boss.

I hope they change tack for Remnant 2.",1689794463,1689794463,False,3,0,0.487843573093414307,0,True,False,False

The player starts off with just a melee weapon, showcasing the awkward melee combat, but once the player has a gun it presents itself as having very engaging and involved third person shooting. The controls handle well and there's a satisfying impact to the weapons in general. Even from the start enemies are very aggressive while pressuring players constantly, giving the game a nicely balanced sense of challenge overall.

There's a lot of variety to the enemies and locations, although there is a lack in variety for the various set pieces the world is made out of. It being randomized does still make the game much more replayable then it would otherwise be but there still is a distinct limitation to the layouts. There's a nice amount of weapons and customization options that players can unlock steadily while they progress, with every item being unique it does give a much stronger sense of meaning to finding things. Having them randomized through the layouts so players aren't guaranteed to find the same things certainly makes it much more exciting to find stuff; and also encourages multiple playthroughs or joining other games.

Although there's a fair amount of items in the game, many of them just aren't very useful compared to more flat and obvious benefits others provide. The consumables are overly tedious to get and or aren't worth using due to how small the buffs they provide are

The boss design is generally hit or miss, there are a lot of great looking bosses with great base concepts to their fights but it's potentially spoiled by blatantly unfair elements. A lot of bosses can just instantly kill the player and a lot of bosses have gimmicks that require trial and error to not die to. Otherwise many bosses spawn more enemies during the fight, which sometimes is completely fine but in certain fights it just turns things into an obnoxious mess. It is the worst in singleplayer where some bosses spawn more enemies than it is objectively possible for the player to defeat without dedicating all their time to it; yet the boss just never stops spawning more. Some of the special enemy variants, like the mages that just endlessly spawn area effects ontop of the player with no cooldown or need for line-of-sight, are also frustrating to encounter.

The matchmaking is quite fast but pretty bad in terms of how it works. It matches players up with any game it chooses, and if that game is in progress players just have to sit in spectator mode until the team gets to a checkpoint to spawn them in. So you just have to keep joining and leaving games until you find one that is actually at a checkpoint already so you can play instead of waiting five to twenty minutes. Players who have joined also don't get loaded in until the team specifically touches the checkpoint, which is never explained; so some teams get confused waiting around for the player to spawn in because they don't know you have to trigger the checkpoint for it to happen.

It would also be great if controller players could turn off aim assist. Because currently you can't. Setting the ""aim snap"" options to off does nothing. Sometimes the aim also favours the left side on certain weapons which makes it extremely awkward to hit things accurately. Having to individual pick up every little thing on the ground is also quite annoying and unnecessary. 

The way the game presents you with quotes from real people talking about death whenever you die in-game is quite ridiculous. Since those people are talking about actual death, not death in a computer game.

The game does have a story but it's very inconsistent, sparse and cryptic; to the point of it feeling like there's almost no story at all.


As listed it certainly has its rough spots but these are more just situational frustrations than actual detriments to the game, the actual core of the experience is exceptionally enjoyable and well constructed. It definitely manages to create a more compelling gameplay and cooperative experience then the thing it's based off.

Really saves time for a workaholic guy like me  since I have less time to play these days.  

Hope Remnant II gets more publicity and I'm very excited to play it soon! 1st time pre-ordering a game too and you guys deserved it!",1689739234,1689739234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

completed it on PS5 and PC (100% trophy completion on PS5)
Tons of replayability through the campaign/adventure mode/achievement or gear hunting,
Great moment to moment gameplay both single player and co-op.
The co-op play is brilliant, and there's just something about it which feels great when you join someone else's session and help them progress or when someone joins you in a public game to help you progress in your campaign or objective. A game that you can just switch on and jump right in, and play for 30mins at a time or 3+ hours and it feels great either way. 
The biomes are beautiful. 3rd person gunplay is on point. Bosses, Randomisation and Mob density is great.
A very underated game overall, that not many seem to be aware of.
Can't wait for Remnant 2! Releasing July 2023

If you're interested in the game enough to read this review, get it! (campaign first playthrough takes anywhere between 10-15 hours, I stopped, came back to the game and realised how much more there is you can do, collect, and play in different ways, so I then went for 100% completion due to how fun it was). 

Technical summary console vs PC:
- PS5 version runs nicely, but you can't turn off things like motion blur and you get much lower FPS than the PC version (standard for all games). I assume similar will exist for Rem 2, hopefully the console players are given more vid options. 
- I bought this game on the PC, to test out the vid quality, PC controls, gameplay and co-op play in prep to decide what platform to buy REM 2 on. It is definitely a much better experience on PC for me personally. I'll be getting Remnant 2 on PC. Personal preference due to playing on PC for years now, used to be a console gamer back in playstation/xbox 360 era but I struggle to play on console these days due to lower FPS and controller use vs what I'm now used to with a mouse and keyboard. It is a great game to sit back on the couch and play though...I just can't play console games for long stretches these days due to low FPS and camera movement giving me vertigo.

Everything after the first area is honestly meh in layout and design, wears you off quick unless you got friends to play with.

It was pretty refreshing. Barebones concept appeared to be functional, however game really lacks some ""meat"" on the bones. Locations feel pretty generic, monsters feel same. Some guns are WAY better than the others (which leaves almost no choice from efficiency perspective). Difficulty of bosses is all over the place. Replayability is almost absent.
Lore was surprisingly interesting (especially some diaries), however story was pretty weak (although it's OK for such type of games IMO).

Hoping that sequel will UP level and enemy designs, add more guns (that actually differ).

With the sequel just around the corner I figured now was as good a time as any, so I jumped in with a friend - and while the game started out a little slow, awkward.. perhaps clunky? What I found was one of the better attempts at the 'souls-like' genre.

At first the lack of build paths seemed concerning, and I found myself struggling to find any decent loot. What I didn't realise was that the game was meant to be played through multiple times. Each play-through will differ slightly - the path you take through each world may look similar, but the dungeons and bosses/events surrounding you will change. You'll encounter different stages which will offer their own unique loot, your traits list will expand as you play, and your builds will open up.

I went on a roughly 3 week journey with this game, playing mostly with a friend, but also playing solo at points. I came out the other side with another 100% achievements gathered, and an excitement for the sequel that I didn't think I'd gain during those early few hours of play.

The game puts you in an unforgiving map with bosses that cant just be killed by going around them ,it takes constant action to kill the boss and not die in an instant. The melee is fun but basically unnecessary as you tend to get swarmed quickly when trying to melee. There is three starting classes but it truly doesn't matter as any class can use any weapon, you can buy the other starting class mods too. Its not a typical looter shooter in a sense that you just do a mission and get random loot. This game has a set amount of weapons and armor, and its by finding and defeating the boss of that level to get the armor or weapon material. Sounds simple but this game does a pretty unique thing where the map is randomly generated, so the layout and paths are changed from your last play through. This is the true randomization of when and how you'll get loot. Some play troughs, you will not see a certain npc and will have to reroll the world.

Spoiler warning

First miniboss -shade- was pretty cool, i didnt understand why i was bothering summoning it earlier because it didnt have any noticable change in the actual boss fight part of it, i ""love"" when it teleports away

first boss - dragon - was alright, nothing really too specially, kinda a bullt sponge but not really hard to beat

2nd area miniboss - fart fucker fly cunt - I love the irradiated mechanic, dont allow me to dodge, i love when i melee the ADDS that they explode and punish me for meleeing, i love that they punish me further by irradating me too, i love how they spawn endlessly and for half the fight the boss is doing a stupid fart attack where he summons more, summons homing projectiles and is fucking immune to damage so when he's not you're dealing with his stupid summons

I love the 2nd area skulls how they just dodge for no reason, theyre not hard, theyre just annoying

the 2nd area boss ghoul thing just made me stop playing, seeing those shitty ads again and him doing a ""lol i run at you try dodge idiot"" attack just made he have such little fun and become so frustrated i genuinely never wanna play this game again

I was not playing on a hard difficulty or anything, the gunplay isnt fun, the melee is punishing, the stupid fucking elite sound is cool at the start but oh my god i KNOW there's a dude nearby shut up with the same stinger

And Great Weapon Variety (Guns like you'd see in Ratchet and Clank's old games. like Up your Arsenal ... or dreadlocked, two personal favorites  of mine.  and all honestly... some of the creatures here do have ratchet and clank old school vibes. (really one thing that rubbed me wrong in newer R&C games was the lack of cool planets, weapons, and enemies for the placement of kid friendly gameplay. ughh gets me down to the day.... missing my days of R&C UYA's sweet pvp modes and sieges... sorry getting off topic..)    

I look for games that catch my eye, show uniqueness,  might be underrated or weird, but they gotta be good games in my book. 

Remnant from the ashes is a great game.  from my days on ps4, to my days on pc. I'd come back here and there for this game... but with the arrival of Remnant 2 and all those unique enemies and weapons. I could blush...  color me excited. cause several games of late have gotten me thinking we might actually be in a good period of gaming again.


I must recommend this game along with the dlcs.. sure its a bit buggy but that's more like a bug just rarely showing and vanishing..  when it happens it annoys you a bit. but you get over it to enjoy it.  I can say I just wish we'd see more games like this and Remnant 2... were the enemy variety isn't solely just humans. or humanoids. 


on another note. I  must recommend Evolva as well... as unrelated. it's what got my gears crazed and oiled for years of waiting for games to drop these boring ass human enemies in favor of  say what games in the 2000s did more. from wildlife like bears,  bees,  skunks,  to alien life like sandworms, sand sharks,  mutants,  pit tendrils,  shadow creatures (Heart of darkness? was it? )  eitherway.

If nothing else, Remnant: From the Ashes is undoubtedly something you've never seen before: no one would correct you if you named it a souls-like, a third-person shooter, or even a roguelite or RPG to some extent, as elements of all are present to differing capacity. Naturally, there can be issues in treading new ground: these borrowed aspects don't always work, and I think, for me, most of them didn't, at least not to the potential they could have, but supporting the entire experience is a combat model that is so exceptional in every respect, that it's hard to envision a world where Remnant could even come close to failing.

[h3]Procedural Generation and Exploration[/h3]

Remnant's use of procedural generation is a novel idea: each player's campaign will follow the same structure, but the precise layout of the world can see some considerable variation, along with the scenarios and bosses that inhabit it. Level design and exploration, however, are miserable as a result: in the name of making the experience malleable, to feel 'different' every time, the building blocks that make up the playable space are tragically basic and lifeless: there's almost nothing of interest to see or find, no hidden, enticing side routes, no intention behind enemy placement and, although they're built this way to aid in creating unique campaigns, they're [i]so[/i] simple that they have the opposite effect; the procedural generation degrades Remnant to a corridor simulator with a semi-random boss at the end of each one.

Furthermore, as almost everything is up to RNG, there's very little in the way of guaranteed loot and your build, for the most part, comes down to simply using what you find, regardless of whether or not you want to; there's every chance that you'll never find a weapon that suits you, or create a build that fits your desired playstyle. With Adventure Mode, separate from your campaign progress, you can freely make new instances of worlds already conquered to see new scenarios and the loot they offer; however, there's no guarantee you'll roll anything different from the first time you explored that world, there's often an unpleasant grind involved should you be looking for a particular item, and, the real issue, as I've already discussed, the procedural generation simply isn't robust enough to allow these replays to feel unique, interesting, or worth the time invested.

Finally, many optional questlines aren't entirely present. For example, early on, there's a chance you can meet with Mud Tooth, an elderly fellow living in a downed helicopter who'll offer you a pocket watch after listening to his stories, all the while informing you that he had intended to pass it along to his son Brabus one day. A less obvious quest there never was; however, it's all too common for a world seed to, despite including Mud Tooth, never house the boss encounter against Brabus, in which you can give him the watch to de-escalate the situation, skipping the fight while earning unique rewards. Worse yet, your seed could include Brabus but have the battle occur [i]before[/i] meeting his father, resulting in obtaining the watch after having already fought and killed the intended recipient. Adventure mode allows you to eventually roll the remainder of your incomplete quests should you wish, although this approach suffers all the same pitfalls outlined earlier.

[h3]Combat[/h3]

Very damning so far, I know, but in truth, Remnant's phenomenal combat mitigates many of these issues, at least enough for them to be tolerable: they're still there and very much noticeable; however, it's easy to forget how bland and lifeless the playable space is when you're so eager to get to the next fight, and failing to find the particular weapon you're looking for stings considerably less when every gun shoots like a dream.

So why is this combat model as brilliant as it is? I could go on and on about the superb sound design, the hefty, powerful weapons or the precise and dextrous controls, though as good as they are, it's the finer details that really shine: it's the thoughtfully designed enemy variants that compliment each other impeccably, keeping every encounter intense, it's the perfectly tuned stagger in each bullet that allows even the precision weapons to feel viable controlling the crowds at close range, it's the elegant consumable economy that offers the satisfaction of thoughtful preparation, yet keeps itself slim, not overwhelming with dozens of highly specific and hardly usable concoctions; every facet of battle feels meticulously scrutinised and subsequently optimised.

All except one, however. Remnant's boss battles are not at all consistent: on the one hand, you have original, multi-phase fights that deliver a fair and rewarding challenge; on the other, you have essentially reskinned elite enemies with two attacks that rely on sending a continuous, overwhelming stream of adds to mask the inadequacy of the boss itself, all the while making the encounter a nightmare for a solo player. Once again, we have another victim of the procedural generation; there are far more bosses than you'll ever see in one playthrough, and, unfortunately, there's an obvious case of quantity over quality here.

[h3]Character Progression[/h3]

I love what Gunfire Games went for here: there's a trait system offering quality-of-life improvements and increases to core stats after allocating points earned as you kill enemies and complete quests. Fairly standard so far, but not all of these traits are available to a new character: some will unlock after specific boss encounters, but more interesting are the ones that unlock based on the way you play or how your character has progressed; the 'climber' trait, for example, becomes available after vaulting obstacles fifty times and, as you might expect, increases your vault speed with each point allocated into it.

It's a great system on paper, moulding your character based on their experiences and one of the better aspects of the procedural generation; however, trait points feel slow to accumulate, and each one allocated provides little to no value. Take that 'climber' trait from earlier: you get a point roughly every ten minutes, and what can you do with it? [i]+1% vaulting speed[/i]. Other examples (per point) include: +2.5 health, +0.75% ranged damage, +1% weak spot damage, +0.5% elemental damage resistance; [i]you get my point[/i]. Sure, these upgrades add up, but they're so useless on their own and feel like a waste of time to allocate; this is something I should be looking forward to doing, but I so often found myself letting points build up to spend in bulk in the hope that I could feel any sense of improvement within my character outside of the relatively standard gear upgrades.

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]

Despite my criticism, I've generally started each section on a positive note, and with good reason: Remnant's innovation is a breath of fresh air within the souls-like genre that, at this point, is infamous for its formulaic and static mechanics found in every title trying to emulate Fromsoft's masterpieces. However, outside of the brilliant combat, I'm not yet convinced whether these new ideas are the next big thing for the genre or whether they should have never seen the light of day; the potential is certainly there, however, and, as a game I already recommend, I'm very keen to see how Remnant improves in the sequel later this month.",1689021120,1689030424,True,115,1,0.891191780567169189,2,True,False,False

It is pretty obvious that boss fights were designed with multiplayer in mind and that's rather unfortunate that there doesn't seem to be any scaling with the amount of players. 

The moment to moment gameplay is fun, shooting feels good, the progression system is fun (Although I am not a fan of level scaling, at least it doesn't scale with traits) and the setting is interesting. That said there are a few flaws that completely ruin the game for me. For one exploring is boring, there aren't really anything worth finding other than the occasional tome and whatever you get from the purple items, rings, a lot of scraps, etc. Monsters don't drop anything except for scraps, crafting mats and ammo so there's 0 incentive to run a specific instance to fight the normal mobs, only things worth target killing are bosses, even the elites don't have unique drops. It makes it very boring because there's no surprise, you're not gonna get a lucky rare drop from a monster like you'd get one in a Souls game or Elden Ring. There's no  surprise Baldr Straight Sword drop in DS1 that would completely shape your playthrough for instance, or monsters that drop cool consumables like weapon endows or throwing weapons.

Then there's the issues of the bosses. They are awful, most of them revolve dodging ads waiting for that small window where you can actually attack the boss, if you can figure out where he went as you were running around of course. Some people argue that adds are necessary as a way to replenish your ammo. This is bullshit, there are tons of ways they could've approached that aspect without using adds. For instance just make bosses drop ammo every 20% health, their health bar is already segmented for god sake, at least those segments would have meaning. Most bosses would be a massive joke without the adds though, which to me kind of highlight that the adds were a cop-out for not being able to design challenging boss fights without them. 

Then there's the scaling, that's a very personal opinion but I hate scaling, it ruins games for me, if I spend time to get stronger I want to actually benefit from it, I don't want the world to scale with me to invalidate my progress. To be fair in this game the scaling only depends on your gear score and not your traits, so you can still progress in some ways, but don't expect to over-upgrade a weapon to get past a tough spot, that will NOT work.

And finally my last issue is with the difficulty levels, you have 4, Normal, Hard, Nightmare and Apocalypse, the latter 2 are not meant to be played on a fresh file but you totally can, and my issue is this one : Apocalypse would be much better if you took the same amount of damage (basically getting one shot by everything except the weakest of mobs) without turning everything into a bullet sponge. Nightmare has the same issue to a lesser extent, and Hard just feels too easy because not only do you one shot everything hitting weak spots (good) but if you mess up you're barely punished (bad). There might be a mod to fix that but I didn't care to look for it. 

So there you have it, ultimately the game isn't bad, but I can't in good faith recommend it if you wanna purely solo, the boss battles feel cheap, not challenging.",1688955592,1688955592,False,1,0,0.520766794681549072,0,True,False,False

My first impression was that the game was a decent 3rd person shooter that I could recommend - provided you're okay with it NOT being a AAA game in terms of graphics, voice acting, and controls. Your character's movement animations are janky and you inexplicably do EVERYTHING slowly (reload, take healing potions, etc) in the middle of combat. This was in keeping with the Dark Souls style of gameplay - which some people dodge and roll simulators. 

Well, there is one annoying game design choice that has made me abandon this game: the ENEMY SCALING TO YOUR HIGHEST LEVEL GEAR. Enemy scaling is a lazy idiot's design choice. You see, when you do not know how to properly design and balance a game, so that players feel challenged throughout, or you are too lazy to take the time to design a proper game... lower IQ game devs rely on a simple.. and I MEAN SIMPLE formula that just looks at your gear, and levels up the enemies accordingly. 

Enemy scaling renders your gear leveling and crafting system moot. In fact, you should NEVER level up your gear until enemies feel slightly hard. When they do, you know that you're in an area where the minimum level is higher than your gear. This makes the whole point of collecting loot, and crafting resources, absolutely meaningless. 

Since the game is linear, it might as well be a 2D side-scroller which, come to think of it, would probably have been more fun. Anytime I see auto-enemy scaling, I will always tell folks to NOT play a game. I wasted my time and money.

-Character customization... enough to feel like your guy is unique but not excessively complicated. 
-Gearing... rewarding but not so confusing that you need a calculator to make a decision.
-Maps... big enough to feel like there's things to explore but still linear enough to not feel confused at any time.
-Gameplay... holy shit. It's a souls game with guns. I'm ~3 big boss fights down and the last one caused me to pause the game and come write this review.

All fights are a massive gank with never-ending adds, 3-6 constantly on-screen with the boss no matter how many you kill. Plowed through on hard and then decided to quit playing solo after reaching Totem Father. Only thing that made it bearable until then was the gun mods that created two ally spawns and a shield for projectiles. 

Also highly recommend against choosing the close range class. Initially you will be satisfied, but there are large sections of the game where a shotgun + melee build are heavily punished. There are forced range boss battles and getting in close for a good strike on all other battles will get you two shot. When playing solo, this only added to the frustration, as there was nobody to pull aggro or pick me up. It would be cool if they had a mechanic where you had a companion similar to Bosco in Deep Rock Galactic that could attack, heal, revive, etc.

The souls games comparison couldn't come close to what type of experience this game delivers. While it is a fact that the game does feature souls like mechanics all over the place, Souls games are well know for its 1V1 combat while being extremely flawed when trying to handle multiple enemies at once. For Remnant this design perspective is completely flipped, mostly intentional i would assume. Remnant shines the most when you're getting pressured by fighting multiple enemies at once. Individually most enemies can be dodged simply by side stepping and they easily get stunlocked and killed (playing on hard), but you'll find yourself being constantly overrun by enemies from all directions, some bossfights are almost puzzle like where you have to use the right tools you have to get a better outcome/easier time. 

I heard before hand that the game had a bad build variety, but up to this moment i think pretty much the opposite about it, Remnant is not afraid of giving you huge bonuses for using certain pieces of equipment, nor really strong alt fire modes for special guns that cannot be customizable (and they feel reaaally good to use).

The biggest flaw that Remnant suffers from is the randomized loot that is locked to the seed you generated your world on. For an example, there is a Magnum in the game, only 38% of the players got the magnum, which is less than how many people have beat the game, the magnum can be found extremely early on in the first map, but the event it appears on is randomly generated, and even after multiple attempts of re rolling your seed you can just not get what you want. I understand that the system was made like this to encourage replayability, but even while replaying the campaign/adventure mode (shorter campaign) you can still be unlucky and get a very similar seed to the one you've already played, which is bad. The game would benefit way more for having ""Sides"", like campaign side ""A"" and ""B"" and ""C"" with respectively hard coded loot instead of randomized.

By the way, last but not least, if you're here to play coop with randoms let me tell you that there is no way to sort matches by ping, so it is very likely that you'll end up with an extremely lagged guy from the other side of the planet. To make it worse, your iframes and bullets work on Host side, this mean that you're relying on low ping to dodge and hit attacks, which is really really bad, making so a lot of times you have to dodge at the ""wrong times"" to evade an attack, and as you guessed, some attacks just wont be dodgeable.",1687840641,1688737087,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The world imo is barren and I wasnt really immersed in the whole world. The characters were alright at best, the weapons were so and so. I literally stuck with the starting weapons pretty much my entire playthrough because I found the most effective. I chose the mid range character guy (I forgot the name). Final boss is where I finally was like. ""Yeah no I'm actually bored"" and I stopped playing at that point. Also maybe its just me but the character feels stiff? Like in terms of movement, it feels very limited for me.

Overall, dont pay full price for this game. I paid 10 dollars discounted and I still would say that's pretty worth it. Hopefully Remnant 2 will improve in the overall game's feel because if I feel it is still valid if a player doesn't even feel bothered to finish a game which happened to me.

This game is just simply, [b]fun to play[/b]. Thats it all. Inspired from Dark Souls but with Guns, makes it looks like its not a your typical 1:1 clone. Rarely any games make me want to play them everyday once i get back home.

Playing this game, doesn't feel like you have to sit on the chairs with nails. Unlike other souls-like games. Game is not designed to punish you, it was made to give you a ""casual"" fun.

First, character [b]movement feels very smooth and natural[/b], it does not have a weight of a prisoner with chains.

[b]Boss fights? Are absolutely great,[/b] they feel fair, their animations and hitboxes are responsive. You can clearly see what their weakpoints are, their attack patterns are clean and don't try to bait you out ( aka their attack slow down to bait you into post-end roll animation ). [b]Dying to bosses, doesn't feel like a cheap death.[/b]. It also applies to all common enemies, great sound cues, fair animations etc.

All bosses usually take 2-5 tries to figure them out, [b]they are not hard but that doesn't mean these are not challenging[/b] ( butterfly boss or undying king ). And of course in coop they get bit easier ( tiny bit, cause there is someone to revive you )

[b]This game has RPG choices too[/b], quests have few branching options and each one usually comes with some unique item or reward. Hence why gearing is quite fun, its not a shoot & loot [b]its a shoot & explore to find loot[/b]. Hidden in places among the maps, behind events ( that have branching paths and randomized ).

By [b]defeating each boss, you get unique gun[/b] , mod or melee weapon. And some bosses have breakable parts that also unlock new stuff or you have to kill them in certain way. Not to mention all weapon feel fun to use, and mix& matching with mods brings out quite [b]a ton of different build setups.[/b]

[b]Story, starts slow but it gets quite interested.[/b] It does not show you with tons of informations, story is there and with [b]fantastic environment design[/b] in later stages. Its gets extremely comfy with loreness.

[b]Co-Op is perfectly done here.[/b] If not only Remnant 2 is around the corner, i would simply spend few hundred in this game alone. [b]It offers at minimum 2 playthings[/b] if you want to experience all events and bosses that spawn in random patterns.

It was [b]quite fascinating game experience[/b] for me, i would put it on the shelf among my Gothic 1, Nioh2 but I will await for Remnant 2 with that. Cause I don't wanna burn myself out with gameplay, especially when sequel is soon to be released.

The areas and dungeons are incredibly boring to me. This game has no memorable moments. I actually could not believe it when I defeated the final boss, I audibly said to myself ""That's it?!"". Well, technically, no, because this game is designed to be beaten multiple times on different difficulties and different modes, but that would mean I have to suffer through those worlds and dungeons again. Sometimes it can also be quite confusing where to go next which adds some extra frustration.
I just hated the main hub of this game. The setting is bland, the NPCs are bland, it was just depressing to run through the hub so many times to upgrade or buy stuff. And why do they have to put the ""stations"" where you can upgrade your gear so far away from the spawn point? I don't know how much time I wasted just running around in that butt ugly hub.

The bosses in this game are perhaps even more disappointing than the level design. I honestly can barely remember any of the bosses anymore. I thought some of the various elites in each world were more interesting. It is just such a massive difference to the Souls series and it makes you appreciate those games even more. The bosses are quite easy throughout, the only difficulty is to avoid the mobs that are spawned in almost all fights. Off the top of my head I only remember one boss that doesn't do this. It's just weak.

The gunplay is fun, you can upgrade your gear of course and add some special abilities to your weapons. I liked playing around with different setups and that is the best part of the game.
It also runs smoothly and I did not experience any bugs.

I wish this game motivated me enough to try other difficulties and experience some other randomly generated enemies and so on, but I just could not bring myself to keep going after I finished the first world for the second time.

And just a warning to those people who have the unstoppable urge to collect ALL the loot: the breakables (pots, crates etc.) have a very high chance to give you some scraps or upgrade materials, so you will often find yourself rolling around for a long time to collect everything in each area. I am one of those people and it was just ... tiring.

The third-person looter shooter and soul-like gameplay are very well designed on this one. Regardless of the difficulty, frustrations is there all the time due to very challenging enemies and bosses. Grinding is very easy, unlike other souls-like games, if you die, you die along with all of your looted items and exp, not on this game. If you die, you'll re-spawn back to the latest check point and you get to keep everything you've looted with exp. and no penalties, monsters will re-spawn aswell.

Co-op multiplayer is so much fun, the good thing about co-op is the loot progess. It is shared to all players. One thing to take note about co-op, enemy damage and health will scale depends on how many friends you have invited or joined the game.

And last but not the least, about the story. It is not that great, at some point you will find that the story is out of the line and too many questionable aspect but it's alright. That is the only downside of this game. Remnant 2 is coming out this July so, don't miss Remnant from the Ashes to give it a try then get ready for the next one.

First 3 hours consist of just re rolling mob spawns for first boss over and over till I do enough dmg to kill him because you literally cant upgrade anything else. Why even put difficulty if you cant even enjoy the game on highest difficulty. Played fps my whole life. Seriously since I could pick a controller up I been shooting shit. Im 24 now tune it down Jesus. PS Mouse and keyboard 100% more accruate so why all the controller support if your going to tune the difficulty suppppper high. Makes no sense its like the dev didnt even play the game on that high of difficulty to actually tune it properly so why make it. This would of made the game way more grindy then 3 hours I already put into it but why not just new game plus.

Typically, I don't feel good about purchasing a game twice, let alone a game and all of its DLC twice.

This, however, is an exception. Because this game is good. It is a breath of fresh air in a series of grindfest live-service shooters that are all about player retention.

Gameplay-wise, it's great. While it's difficult- especially some of the first bosses, as you won't have the HP or healing to brute-force them- it's more challenging than it is hard. The shooting mechanics are a lot of fun, and build customization is pretty decent. There's lots of variety of weapons, and the aesthetics of every world- while not the best graphics-wise- are jaw-dropping. Each one is distinct, and while they may all have a set of similar types of enemies, there are enough differences to make each of the worlds fun and interesting.

Plus, there's a lot of secret quests and hidden items, as one would expect from a Souls-inspired game. Armor sets, perks, weapons- exploration can be a lot of fun, even if you might need to look up a guide for a handful of the more obscure things.

But when it comes down to it, the best part about this game is that it can be finished. That doesn't sound like high praise, and there are people who likely still keep playing the game even to this day. But it is high praise, because knowing when to end something is the hardest part of the creative process. As much as we all love long-running shows or games, the truth is that gets exhausting because they keep compounding on each other. Remnant isn't that. While there's NG+ and plenty of other ways to keep progressing after beating the final boss, it's not needed to have a satisfying experience.

Now, story-wise, it's not great. Lore and worldbuilding is interesting, especially for the locales that aren't Earth, but it's mostly just ""hey there's an ancient evil, go shoot it in the face"". And you know what? That's good enough for me.

[b]TL;DR: I highly recommend this game if you're into third-person shooters. it's not exactly the most-polished, but it is a lot of fun, and it's a solid 30-40 hours with DLC, which I'd say is more than enough bang for your buck. In an industry focused on monthly concurrent users and player retention, Remnant is a more back-to-the-basics approach of creating a fun co-op game (that can be done in singleplayer) and letting the sales speak for itself. It's not exactly AAA, but it's not budget game, either. It's a nice, comfortable middle ground. It's great we're finally getting a sequel, and I can't wait to see what else we might encounter.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game, but I‚Äôm still going through the good things first, in case there is someone curious.

The first time I got a hold of this game, its loop really got my attention. You travel across the land, collect a simple set of material while killing enemies and bosses, go back to the base and try to craft weapons and upgrades. This is really well made, with sections that are not too long to become extremely tedious and a pain to backtrack, but aren‚Äôt too short to kill off all tension. If you aren‚Äôt ready, you gonna get trampled.

The crafting of new objects and upgrades is not overcomplicated with a thousand different types of resource (although it falls apart from other side). There are simply 4 grades of iron and a set of ‚Äúunique‚Äù objects that might be added for crafting.
The ‚Äúboss weapons‚Äù as the game calls them, are weapons crafted from materials exclusive to a boss under certain conditions (kill them before X, kill with Y), which adds a nice dimension of challenge to every boss and gives a nice closure to their presence, as weapons sometimes reflect one of their attacks or the challenge that was fulfilled to obtain the required materials.

You get a main weapon, a side one and a melee. Then three pieces of armour and three accessories. Builds are simple to discover on your own and, as every bought or crafted weapons is permanently added to your inventory, to swipe around. It‚Äôs nice being able to lose against a boss and just switch your build form the checkpoint to try out a new strategy.
Both ranged weapons have also access to what are called mods. These are abilities that you charge up as you deal damage to enemies, to unleash at some point some kind of special power: Healing in an area, seeing through walls, getting a caustic shield to damage enemies that get too close‚Ä¶ Even sometimes the special powers allow to use special types of projectiles that are a weapon on their own. These are also quite interesting to keep in mind during builds and, honestly, they can make a great difference. There are some enemies that don‚Äôt give enough breathing room for healing, or some are better to face while having a decoy, against some other you just need the edge of the auto-revive ability‚Ä¶

Again, regarding experimentation of builds, abilities and such, this game is really great.

Another positive is the atmosphere. Not always, but most of the time is worth a second glance. I really enjoyed this depiction of a post-apocalyptic earth being consumed by the huge trees of blood. It was a nice change of pace from the deserted cities of nothing but sand and nuclear waste around the streets. The visuals of the lush jungle and the swamps. Exteriors in general. They are very neatly put, while interiors usually fall a bit uninteresting.

And overall, the game feels well enough as an experience to play it. Gunplay is serviceable, the character might feel a bit too slow but compensates with a side-roll with immunity frames, damage dealt has good feedback, damage received has‚Ä¶ Sometimes too good of a feedback.

So, what does fail? Well, these good mechanics aren‚Äôt really put to good use.

First, the whole build system. It‚Äôs really nice conceptually, but it's horribly exploited. The thing I mentioned about having no more than 4 types of basic resources is because from time to time I‚Äôve fallen into a game that requires you to manage a stupid amount of different resources for the most basic of upgrades or uses. This is of course common for games that sell these very resources, to force ‚Äúlazy‚Äù players into buying them, cause they would rather pay to get them that to go through a thousand loops to get a 10% chance of getting a 3% of the resources they need for something. It‚Äôs underhanded, but it‚Äôs obviously effective. I don‚Äôt approve it, but I can make a sense of it.

Now this game doesn‚Äôt sell anything (hey, another plus for it) nor does require 80 different types of resources. Yet the way you get the builds feels so unrewarding‚Ä¶ First, given how every enemy drops iron almost always, one begins to wonder why do you even have the resource in the first place; at the point the game is, it feels like there wouldn‚Äôt be a real difference for the first 19 upgrades (now I‚Äôll say what happens with the 20th rank) if you just -bought- them. Second, every rank adds the same bonus every time. It‚Äôs linear and not that interesting. The whole upgrade system turns into upgrading whatever you can, usually going for your most recent upgrades to build on the already performed ones. There is no strategy or sacrifice. I guess you can play around with the bonuses linked to the armour sets themselves, but I really didn‚Äôt notice these special abilities in particular.

And that segways to the third big issue with the upgrades: They don‚Äôt really feel that impactful. I guess that once you‚Äôve upgraded to the max level there would be a difference between having it on and not, of course. But as only stats are increased, very little, always the same amount‚Ä¶ It gives of the vibe that you don‚Äôt really improve.

Speaking of the max level‚Ä¶ What is up with the surprise material?

The last upgrade for any piece requires a special material, which goes the complete opposite way. Not only it is extremely rare, but only 4 appear for each run of the campaign. 

And if the 20th upgrade rank was something special. If it added some new ability. If it changed the skin. If it added a bigger amount of stats than the previous ones‚Ä¶ I could understand its existence. But it‚Äôs just the same, for everything. It‚Äôs so pointless. The only reason I had to upgrade gear to the last rank was to stop seeing that 19 in the menu.

On other issue, we‚Äôve got the story. The setting itself, is interesting enough I‚Äôd say. The lore and design of the enemies. Not bad, I guess‚Ä¶

But oh boy, is the dialogue so shallow, so stereotypical. It takes absolutely no risks, the characters have absolutely no personality. How can every being in this universe be the same kind of ‚Äúintense‚Äù and ‚Äúwise beyond knowledge‚Äù type of character. I got so bored of being spoken to in bloody prophecies. I swear it, I would rather have a completely silent race instead of what we got. And the overarching story, which is looking for the founder of the stronghold that serves as your base, is all there is to it. You follow him around 3 different planets, do some ‚Äúside‚Äù mission, meet him and face the final boss. End of story. There is very little changing or happening and the stakes feel pointless because anyways back on Earth humanity has been already almost wiped out.

This ties into the bosses, which in themselves are a ‚Äúneutral‚Äù point for the game. There are some quite interesting to fight and there are some that are cheap and unrewarding. But all of them have in common that they barely tie into the story. They just protect the next area, they serve as obstacles, but you don‚Äôt know about them until literally the second you start fighting them and, if it wasn‚Äôt because of the aesthetics, they would have been interchangeable.

And last, but not least, this ties into the common enemies. Some are interesting on their own, but this game relies way too much into ‚Äútribeperson‚Äù type of enemies. Most of them are physical and besides special enemies that rely on ‚Äúenergy‚Äù projectiles, only one weapon is used by a single enemy in the whole game. The way the enemies fight doesn‚Äôt feel very engaging.

So, to sum up, I feel like this game was a great wasted opportunity. Like they had the basics for a nice game figured out but got cut during development and left a cask of a game. It will get repetitive for most people. There are probably better alternatives. Not the worse, but not a game you ‚Äúneed‚Äù to try out.",1687970670,1687971047,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I love souls-likes and the idea of Dark Souls with guns fills me with excitement. After replaying the first bit of Remnant I remembered why I hadn't thought about it in so long: It's repetitive and boring.
Maybe it's because I'm playing solo but I found it very unenjoyable and didn't want to play the game at all. Enemies felt spongey the controls feel arcadey and this may be unpopular but death should feel more like losing something. In Elden Ring you lose your runes and Nioh is the same, but this game you don't lose anything you keep everything but the enemies respawn. I find this makes me not feel like there's any stakes  which does hamper enjoyment for me. I could go on but I don't feel like this game deserves a in depth analysis no offense to the devs it runs absolutely perfect on Steam deck so I applaud them for that however it's the core game which is what I dislike.

only complaints i have

Game is buggy but still mostly works one of my boss weapons magically vanished from my inventory after meeting Ezlan 
Some bosses are Excruciatingly difficult to solo or literally require a buddy
Melee is not very well implemented melee feels very weak and useless compared to guns unfortunately 
when you play with friends you don't progress in your own world only in your friends world 
story is pretty goofy and gets thrown in many random directions 

other than that its a pretty good game and i definitely agree that most souls players would enjoy this game.

I hope remnant 2 fixes most if not all issues of the first game. and if so i think remnant 2 will be a masterpiece

Controls are smooth and accurate. Fighting is enjoyable. ( Especially with a BIG hammer.)

Remnant can easily be summarized by ""Man, this is really good and really hard. I wish [X] was better designed, though.""

There aren't things like classes. You pick a gear loadout in the begging of armor/gun/melee/weaponmod which can easily be bought early as well. This makes a pretty linear experience especially noticeable in multiplayer as there isn't much reason to use much different equipment. There are ""traits"" you buy as you level which increasing random stats but they are essentially universal with maybe less than a handful of reasonable methods of what to buy into. Range Damage fall off feels a bit more punishing than it should be and the fact there's an item to enhance this seems weird. There's also a variety of items, guns, armor that can easily be be categorized between ""cool"" and ""not useful at all"". I could go on, but these are all things worth looking passed as the actual game is very enjoyable and the first playthrough is like no other. There's also a sequel and it looks and I HOPE it remedies all the issues I've personally had with the game.

Also, I hope bosses are better designed than they were in this game. I warn you now, almost ALL bosses except a few are designed to be difficult solely by flooding you with mobs in some kind of way. For the fights themselves as well as the game as a whole being a majority about grand boss fights was probably the most hurtful aspects as throwing droves of enemy types at you while you whittle health bars is not only unfun, but there is a major imbalance of difficulty as some FIRST LEVEL bosses are dramatically harder than some of the end stage bosses.",1687729840,1687730104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You run for miles and when you die it puts you back to the crystal checkpoint so you'd have to go do more running again.. just nope.

4 biggest downsides are the amount of ""secrets"" (aka almost every single piece of every armor set) being locked behind replayed campaign loops and random chance it appears at all. it is more tedious than enjoyable. 
Melee combat is virtually useless even with a full focused build.
Survival mode can be quite long and all progress is reset if you need to save and exit mid-run. 
Enemy scaling is never done right, in any game, EVER. This one is no exception and sadly I expect Remnant 2 to carry on with scaling. The stronger you get the weaker you are and the combat just takes longer - also if you didn't begin and stay playing from the start with a co-op friend goodluck with the multiplayer scaling.

For the less completionist types out there a single run thru is enjoyable, the Subject DLC is basically required to finish the storyline however the DLC's first zone has a TON of backtracking with very little combat and was the least fun map of the entire game.

The Gun/Mod selection/variety and fps combat is nice and probably the best part of the game which is thankfully front and center for your entire experience.",1687719042,1687719042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In Dark Souls series bosses and their arenas were thoroughly designed, almost each boss had it's own unique moveset and fights felt hard and fair, and victories felt well-deserved. It was achieved with unique one-on-one fights (mostly).

In this game every boss fight I encountered so far was plain bullshit. You get boss alright, but you also get endless swarms of fragile enemies at the same time, they constantly respawn.

I put the game down and didn't try again until recently due to the new game coming out soon.  It actually is pretty good.  It kinda reminds me of resident evil 5 and 6 where you kinda had a more action oriented game and that third person, somewhat clunky control and also the ability to kill everything in melee.  I'm not 100% sure why it triggers that feeling but the general slow movement and rolling and everything doesn't hurt.
Regardless, it gets a lot more fleshed out as you play and unlock new mods, weapons, rings, etc.  The adventure mode is extremely good for that purpose as its a bit faster and more contained.
Overall, I'm glad I got it way back when and I really should have given it a chance sooner as it scratches that progression itch.",1687382357,1687608434,True,2,0,0.5120391845703125,0,True,False,False

Remnant for the Ashes is a Action Shooter Rpg Rogue-like. With my 33 Hours on record I have successfully leveled myself up to the degree that I no longer fear fighting bosses. I have leveled my perks and gear to near max and have re-rolled my campaign about 3 times. 
On the start remnant feels a lot like a ""souls-like"" Action Shooter. The class option is deceiving unimportant with only the starting equipment a perks being changed. The game play was responsive however the movement always felt a little slow and clunky. 
Running through worlds felt engaging with constant exp gain and level ups keeping a sense of progression. Fighting enemies was Very fun. Building your character correctly to Steam through a horde of enemies was satisfying enough to keep me hooked throughout. Finding new gear and upgrading it was massively rewarding and worth the experimentation.

The Story of Remnant is its largest flaw. I rarely understood or cared to know what was going on. The characters in the game are significantly un-chatty, Leaving the story empty and just a formality for running through a town and mowing down the inhabitants.

There are some non-boss areas that are REALLY hard but it's not the norm.
The bosses vary in difficulty but eventually, after enough tries, you start to see patterns in how they behave and you can exploit them.

What I like most about the game is the gameplay itself.

I finished the game on Hard solo. Played a bit of DLCs and the campaign on higher difficulty after that.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
This game has good bones. Shooting is fun and there's a good variety of weapons and enemies, especially for a budget title.

However the choice to make every boss an obnoxious group fight and worthless level design sets it back a lot.

I can only recommend this if you are done with other, better Soulslikes, like The Surge or Mortal Shell. I don't think you are missing out on much if you decide to never play Remnant at all. I decided on a ""not recommended"" verdict, because I don't feel fully comfortable recommending it - it's very likely you will not enjoy it.

[h1]Description[/h1]
While this game is clearly taking inspiration from Souls clones - it doesn't have some typical elements like losing XP on death.

Remnant is a third-person-shooter-adventure game set in the future when the world is being consumed by an enemy called ""Root"". You will go through semi-linear levels, shoot enemies, fight bosses and upgrade your stuff along the way while trying to find out a way to destroy Root.

Your character can equip 3 pieces of armor and each piece of armor belongs to a set that gives you more bonuses the more pieces you equip. You can also equip 1 long, 1 short and a melee weapon. Both ranged weapons can also be equipped with skills that you unlock mainly by killing bosses. These can be offensive, defensive or supportive abilities, from self-guiding projectiles to protection buffs. Using a skill requires a charge, which you get by dealing damage with the weapon the skill is equipped on. Finally you can equip 2 rings and an amulet, all of which have some passive effects on you.

Killing enemies rewards materials and XP. Collecting enough XP will level you up, giving you 1 trait point o allocate to a passive stat, of which you only get 3 at the start of the game, but you unlock more by progressing through the story, killing specific enemies, or even performing specific actions enough times. Stats can be as typical as HP or much more specific like % decrease in stamina costs. Each stat can be upgraded up to lvl 20. There are very few stats that affect the damage you deal, most of your damage comes from your gear upgrades.

Stamina is used only for running and evading. Melee attacks don't cost stamina. Evade has a typical Souls roll animation and invincibility frames.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Gun sounds[/b]
Punchy and nice. I would have liked more ""normal"" guns instead of the many ""magical"" ones that shoot beams of energy or whatnot, but what's here sounds good.

[b]+ Decent weapon variety[/b]
I have not found 2 weapons that would feel the same to use. They are fun to experiment with, which is a bummer when the game needs you to upgrade your gear with materials that require farming.

[b]+ Combat is enjoyable[/b]
General enemy design aside from bosses is very good. Some enemies will reward rushdown strategies, others will be the ones to rushdown you. You have to aim well, manage your stamina and HP and use your weapon skills to fight efficiently.

[b]+ Random ""events""[/b]
Each time you start a new campaign or reset your current one you will get different dungeons and chance for different weapons, mods and armor.

[b]+ Last boss[/b]
It has 2 main phases, the arena is large, the enemies he spawns aren't too annoying and it has clear weakpoints, but also there's a trick to defeating him. It's fun, engaging and rewarding to fight him.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Bosses[/b]
Every cocksucking boss has an unlimited amounts of trash mobs that will constantly spawn until you win. The game is designed in a way that has you take a few seconds to kill a trash enemy since most weapons can't deal enough damage quick and the ones that do will be 1-shot and reload kind of guns. This means that fighting bosses is rarely about efficient and accurate shooting - it's about desperately trying to position yourself in a way to be able to deal damage to the boss while also prompting said boss to attack you in a way that will hit and kill his ads. It's a war of attrition and an endurance round at the same time.

I think there's only 1 boss in the game that doesn't have trash with him, but even that one clones himself mid-fight to make you fight 2 of him.

This alone would make the game incredibly annoying, especially since many normal and elite enemies are actually FUN to fight in normal areas. There was only 1 boss fight that I genuinely enjoyed, thankfully or not - it was the last boss. Thankfully because there's at least 1 that's good, and not because it's at the end of the damn game.

[b]- Level design[/b]
I'm not even sure if levels are randomly generated, but they all look so similar they might as well be. Some levels are needlessly complex for how little points of interest they have. The worst of which were ancient-futuristic temple-like buildings in the second chapter, which had multiple levels of interconnected corridors that wind around and fold in on themselves, creating a spaghetti that's difficult to navigate. Worst of all - there's almost nothing to find by exploring those areas properly, but they still contain SOME items, and can contain pretty important ones, so you still HAVE to visit every single strand of this delicious meal. Hope you are packing some pasta sauce, cause exploring this dish is going to cost you a lot of time and won't be fun in the slightest.

[b]- Linear equipment upgrades[/b]
I believe most Soulslikes should not have weapon upgrades. Hell - many Souls games shouldn't have them either, especially Elden Ring. It creates more problems than it's worth. Here the fact that you need to upgrade weapons to make them usable means that you need to invest a lot of time into farming if you find a new gun you want to try out. One might say that it extends playtime, but is it really rewarding? I think not. The actual result is that you will most likely pick a weapon and stick with it for the entire game. I don't think this plays to the game's strengths.

Upgrades should improve weapons in other ways. Maybe have modifications that turn damage into a specific type, or have some sidegrades like different aim-sights and whatnot. Simply having linear dmg+ isn't fun.

[b]- Bullet sponges[/b]
Some enemies take far too much damage to kill, especially on higher difficulties. There's no way I'm putting myself through that.

[b]- Designed for co-op?[/b]
I feel like most of the issues I have with this game would be mitigated in multiplayer where players could divide and conquer enemies and explore together to cover ground quicker. However this is not advertised as a multiplayer game, so I take it as a huge flaw.

[b]- Absurd hurtboxes[/b]
Some enemies have phantom-hitting attacks, that is hurtbox doesn't match the animation. There are thankfully only few enemies with grab attacks, but all of those grabs will gladly teleport your character model into them even when you visibly dodge the grab and most of them are 1-shot kills.

As a hardcore souls-like games fan and a fps/third-person shooter game player I thought this would be an amazing combination and be more soulsy. People say that this is the souls game with guns. I disagree, just because it has a dodge roll and a very, very minimal dodge roll at that with i-frames at that doesn't mean its a souls-like. The combat and gun-play is... fine. Just mediocre. The ""melee"" combat is uninspiring and not used often, frequently just hitting m1 a few times and then going back to your gun, and melee combat also doesn't make it a souls like.  The sniper rifle and shotgun are satisfying to use, and you do feel the power behind each shot. The weapon modding system is interesting and added some variety to combat despite the generally low amount of different guns in the game. The amount of traits you can level up is interesting, but has its flaws. I believe that there are too many traits, while they add for genuine build flexibility, I started to feel like I couldn't focus on an area that I wanted to revolve my build on without directly harming myself in the future because I was losing other traits to level up, when I believe they should have just been a constant across all characters only maybe being modified by charms and armor.
The areas in the game are also fine. Not super interesting but not necessarily boring. But I dislike the overall level design in this game. It is the same shit over and fucking over with no variety between worlds. One small arena with some enemies, a boss, a small arena/maze with some enemies, a boss... etc. over and over until you get to a portal/some method to go to a new world. 
The bosses in this game are ass. The dragon in the first world was an interesting fight but then nothing else makes up for it. I know I haven't experienced every boss since each world is a different seed with different bosses, but I feel like if the boss isn't as good as another, I'd rather have no chance between getting different bosses, and just rather have the better one. The final boss is boring and easy as hell. The trial and error to figure out what to even do was just boring, and once I finally figured it out, I just asked myself, why?
I played this game with a friend, which made it significantly more bearable and on rare occasions, fun. I cannot recommend this game if you do not play it with a friend. If you do want to buy this game, do it on a big sale. Also the game takes like six hours not including dlc if you are even halfway decent; which I do not think is worth more than $15.

Campaign without farming is 8/10 cause of the co-op, shared loot, etc.

Finding armors, weapons, weapon mods, traits, etc. is a 4/10 because of the RNG grindfest. 

I gotta start with the CONS:

- Grindfest if you are looking for basic armor sets, specific traits and specific weapon mods. Why? RNG of course, randomly generated worlds that need to proc specific events/places. You have to reroll, reroll, reroll and reroll until what you are after spawns. 

- Puzzles you can't figure out on your own unless you look up a guide online. Armor sets and such are locked in puzzles or RNG. Don't think you can change your look even after visiting the next world.

- Huge beautiful environments but there is no point in exploring them since most are empty, you think you are going to find secret stuff? Nah man you only find a set amount of items like: trait book or a random item the spawns in that world (if you picked it up before it becomes money automatically). The beautiful huge environments are misused and I feel very bad for the 3D artists. Basically the environment feels empty. Even Fortnite Zero Build has better environments with NPCs and loot.

- You don't know where to go next, `Find Ford's Trail` you have to go to the next area, go back, next area, go back. There is a lot of annoying back tracking.

- Cosmetic change of the same armor (just a different color/texture) needs a specific resource called Glowing Fragment which is VERY hard to farm. Good thing there is workaround on the PC :D I feel bad for console players. 

PROS:

- Shared loot, you don't have to race to the item to get it first.

- Up to 3 players co-op and it's such a fun adventure since all of you can die and feel the danger of enemies.

- You can go to the DLC worlds even if you have the base game but you can't get DLC specific items, hop into multiplayer to find out.

- Enjoy the Campaign but don't enjoy hunting for armors, items, weapons, bosses, etc. That RNG is very bad.

If I were told that there would be a game that is; souls-like, shooter which I'd opt for playing with KB+M instead of controller, I'd say that would be a bad game. But Remnant proves me wrong so much and I'm happy for it. I'm even amazed of the fact that the Devs were able to sell this idea, because I think a lot of people/publishers would brush it off.

So what is Remnant, well it's a game that copies pretty much every Souls mechanic (bonfires, upgrading items, bosses, anything you can think of except invasions) but being a shooter. I think it gets really fun to play with friends, yes you can play it solo, but I think what the Devs had in mind that this game is sort of supposed to play co-op. On higher difficulties it becomes really necessary unless you're using really optimized setups. In souls games, co-op trivializes the entire game, the levels, the boss fights, but I can't say the same thing for Remnant. I don't know if it scales difficulty if you're playing co-op but I know that my friend and I struggled through Nightmare and Apocalypse difficulty settings (maybe we should git gud at Remnant). So there's challenge if you're looking for it.

Replay value is I'd say high, as it has some kind of weird world creation mechanic that makes the maps and item placements sort of random, and boss placement differently. There are plenty of weapons and builds you can play with, even your starting gear is so good that I finished the game with them (of course upgraded them too).

It doesn't have true co-op really (progress in your world STAYS in your world, your friend's world is different) BUT you can pretty much do co-op in one world and your cooperator would get every item/skill/level and achievement as a part of your world. It's very seamless, if you're planning to play through the game as a duo or trio, go for it, you simply connect to same guy's world and progress. You don't need to progress in each world as if it's DS3 or ER(you can though), one is enough to finish the game.

It has DLC's that I really recommend getting with it (I got all during a sale, it was a bargain), it adds new levels, one of them is pretty long (Subject 2923) and fun.

From before games became second jobs that you had to pay for? But seriously, Remnant is one of the very few games I've played recently that I actually constantly feel the urge to [i]go back and play again after I beat it,[/i] and not even for 100% achievement completion, but just because I LIKE it!

While it's not a perfect game (the story is rather half-baked and a few of the gameplay systems, particularly the way enemies actually OUTSCALE your equipment, could do with a second draft), it's an ideal blend of 3 different genres: soulslike RPG, 3rd person co-op shooter, and roguelike. The procedural generation elements are probably the cleverest innovation, creating a largely linear single-player campaign that always hits the same [i]core[/i] points (major story beats, some of the world bosses) but has details that vary in each playthrough- sometimes you have to defeat Singe to get off Earth, sometimes it's the Ent instead, sometimes you get a chance to obtain the Beam Rifle on Rhom, sometimes you don't but you get a chance to get to reactivate the Ancient Construct and acquire the Iron Sentinel mod instead. The ability to replay a segment of the game as a self-contained ""adventure"" any time you like is the icing on the cake, letting you instantly roll up a new randomised mini-campaign to try and face some of the bosses or find some of the dungeons you never got a chance to before. Honestly, this is probably the #1 source of the replay value I mentioned before- while I wouldn't necessarily like to sign up for another entire campaign run, I can do adventures for [i]days.[/i] And if it's more challenge you're after, the multiple difficulty settings (and the popular Apocalypse mod) will keep you occupied for months.

The 3rd person shooting mechanics are perfectly solid, with perfectly balanced dodging and instant melee attacks giving combat that nice soulslike flow, and the vast array of equipment (long guns, small arms, 3-part armour sets and 3 accessories) and the VAST variety of traits give you a huge amount of customisability for your character. Best of all is playing in co-op, which is easy and satisfying, with a small but great community of helpful players.

With Remnant II coming up soon, there's still time for you to get into Remnant and find out what the fuss is all about and fill yourself in on the backstory before a new set of worlds (as well as corrupted old ones) open up before you.

2. Poorly designed boss battles. They aren't fun, interesting or too hard, but there's one damn thing that always annoyed me. One thing, that all bosses shared. It's the waves of minions/common enemies. You're trying to focus on the boss, but his gang attacks you from all sides. There's no spawn limit. I thought that other players will kill the minions, while I will kill the boss, but many players died fast.

Remnant: From the Ashes is basically Dark Souls, but with heavy focus on ranged, gun-based combat. There is close combat with melee weapons as well, but it is not very useful in every situation or boss fight.

The co-op in this game is amazing. It has a much better co-op system than Dark Souls. You can play up to 3 players in a party. If you plan on playing through the whole game with a couple of friends, you don‚Äôt have to replay every area and boss for the other player in their own world in order to progress and keep playing together, like you have to do in Dark Souls. You can do everything in the worlds of your friends that you can do in your own. Like upgrading your gear, rest at checkpoints together, fast travel, you name it. You even share all loot, so if your friend picks up gear and other stuff, you will also get it! You can stay in your friends game as long as you want to, you don‚Äôt get automatically thrown out after you have killed a boss together like in Dark Souls.

The environment is beautiful and varied. With the DLCs included, which I recommend you buy, there are 5 very different worlds in total. After you have completed the campaign/story, you have only killed about 1/3 of all the bosses, and I‚Äôll tell you why soon. The story is very bland and uninteresting, so I did not care much about it.

This game does not have New Game+. Instead you can reroll your campaign with new areas and bosses. This will reroll every world in the campaign though. You can also play something called Adventure Mode. Here you can choose which world you want to reroll and play again, with randomized areas and bosses for that world. This way you can easier farm specific items, weapons or traits that you are looking for. You also get to choose which difficulty to play at when rerolling a world; Normal, Hard, Nightmare or Apocalypse.

A few things that I hope they will improve for Remnant 2 that bothered me a tiny bit is the map and the inventory. Every world consists of several areas. On the map you can only see the area that you are currently in. You can not do much with the map except seeing where you have been and where your friends are. If you open up the map between dungeons, and want to know which entrance is which and which exit is which, you can‚Äôt see that on the map. You have to go back into the dungeon in order to see which dungeon it is, which is a bit annoying. You can‚Äôt really interact much with the map. Your inventory is endless and can‚Äôt really become full. This can be a bit annoying as you don‚Äôt have a stash where you can put things you don‚Äôt need at the moment. Let‚Äôs say you want to change rings before a boss fight. You then have to scroll through the whole list of rings that you have before you find it and can equip it. Then after the boss fight you might want to change back to the ring you had before, you have to start scrolling again. Maybe you want to change your amulet too? Start scrolling. It‚Äôs just nice to have the option of putting things in a stash that you don‚Äôt really want to throw away, because you might wanna use it later on.

[b]All and all, Remnant: From the Ashes is a fantastic game that I strongly recommend. Especially if you are looking for a game to play in co-op with some friends![/b]",1685554664,1685554813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like customization this game benefits from that sort of play style, making builds enjoyable and so satisfying once complete, almost all builds are viable (results may vary though). The character customization isn't that heavy though with limited options (if you care about that). The world is very nice and it doesn't feel like Remnant is trying to be something it is not. There are very few cons but they are kind of niche from my playthrough: Bosses/minibosses seem to rely on ads to make them more difficult, for example, Gorefist in himself is not that hard, but when the ticker-like enemies begin to appear it becomes 10x harder, that applies to most of them (excluding those like Ixilis). Another distaste I have for the game is the loot system, the only way to reliably get loot is by using a world analyzer online, before me knowing of this it took me a while to the items I needed.

the most unique feature is that the Map layout is completely randomized everytime you play, from the special events in them to even different final bosses of the areas (minus the final boss of the campaign), meaning what loot you get is also randomized, but the game features what's called ""adventure mode"" which allows you to replay different area layouts without resetting the campaign progress whether you wanna loot or just experience a certain area/dungeon once again

Story is nothing all too riveting, the whole story as you go from what seems like a simple post-apocalypse world with some eldritch weirdness to uncovering inter-dimensional travel is intriguing but the story goes by really quick and it doesn't feel that fleshed out sadly, but if your a gameplay first story second I suppose it wouldn't be an issue

as for the gameplay loop it feels like a looter shooter but really isn't as something like Borderlands or Destiny where you pick up a large amount of weapons with varying stats that get replaced as soon as you start earning legendary gear you get from bosses, the game instead has it so every weapon you get is special in it's own way from the boss gear to the ""standard"" gear you get
and I put standard in quotation marks as even they have their own quirks and can become customizable with a wide array of secondary attacks, really does good at giving variety of weapons without having the whole grindy aspect that can draw people away from looter shooters

good solo but most people reccomend you play with friends, which can be hard as the player count isn't the highest and if you get connected and you have bad lag it pretty much means death, as since this is souls-inspired reaction time with your dodging is KEY and lag can really kill it, especially since the lobby browser contains no connection stability notifications

* For a game that was released back in 2019, it truly is a hidden gem. A gem with a few flaws while the beginning of the game strikes a strong plot through narrative and cutscene moments alike this quickly fades into the go from objective A to B and stop for C if you want formula that is the crutch of randomly generated campaigns this, however, isn't inherently bad as it provides a good alternative to a new game+ system where instead of playing through the same encounters over and over again it gives you the chance to experience various encounters and bosses that may have not been in your initial playthrough. While no one's first experience playing through the campaign will be the same as yours there are points at which your experiences will intersect for key plot points. Sadly these going around collecting everything in each 'world' the game seems to lose the sense of urgency that the opening setup portrayed. After beating the game for the first time you can choose to play on a harder difficulty earning currency that allows you to buy cosmetics and further level up your character to defeat new bosses or old ones in different ways for more rewards. Past that sadly there is not much else to encourage a further playthrough. There are also some weird quarks with the game from stiff mouth animations from talking NPCs and a few cases of unhuman-like fast movements from some of the local base inhabitants. The only 3 major faults I can give this game are; 1. If your game crashes you will be set all the way back to your last 'bonfire' save losing all progress since that point 2. There doesn't seem to be enough content in the core game as by the time things finally start to ramp up in the story it's over, like running off a cliff 3. The ending cutscene is very underwhelming and after it, no one back at base seems to acknowledge the magnitude of what you just accomplished/uncovered. Making you question if, in the end, you beat the game or you missing something.

Co-Op issues: The game has many issues when it comes to the co-op aspect sadly, since the game is so centralized around co-op. Issue stemming from no party chat to Peer to Peer hosting makes playing with random members sometimes frustrating depending on their skill level or knowledge of the game or different boss mechanics/kills

Some of the bosses are extremely surprising - at first blush, they are tanky and hit hard and you have no idea how shooting for longer or dodging 99% instead of 95% of their attacks is interesting -  as you understand what mechanics you could use to gain leverage over them, some of them become downright fascinating; intrigues of game design.

Some of the fights you can tell are scaled for three people, and doing them with two is difficult but rewarding.

I played the last 2/3rds and the expansions via online coop with strangers and realized this game is meant to be played exactly like Diablo 2. You join games and quest with randos, but you also often will help them with a quest that you do not have and vice versa. This leads you to discover NPCs and areas in a region (which will be located differently in your game-world, each person's being randomly generate - some NPCs or areas may even be absent in exchange for another) which you may not have found yourself, and you establish some piecemeal comprehensions of future quests which you may endeavor. 

The feeling, later on, of working in parties and sometimes knowing (without any language - there is no viable media for written lingual communications implemented in the game) what quests others are on, sometimes realizing that they know what quests you are on (and how they should be done, when they step into a guest leadership mode and rush you along the key events) is wonderful. 

When the piecemeal comprehensions come together finally - you spend an hour or two doing a quest, and you see a few familiar items or NPCs or locations, and suddenly you understand what other events were related to those items or NPCs - the sense of satisfaction is very strong. When it begins to happen more frequently, as you have several pieces of several puzzles in your knowledge - It completely changes your opinion on what the game you are playing *is*. You change from a vacationer & a follower into a custodian & a leader as you hit the three objectives you now know were related. You understand the NPC dialogues and cutscenes that you have already seen as they slot into your newly enlightened perspective. 

Because of how this works, it is not for those who demand to know everything up front. This is a lot like Diablo 2 - you want to do boss runs for loot, you want to run with groups for safety - and in so doing, you accidentally discover foundational narrative perspectives & significant questlines. 

There is also not so much going on that you are not given the opportunity for insight; the size of this game is a perfect one for the Diablo 2-style, experience-minutiae-as-a-follower-first, emergent comprehension of the broadest picture. thirty or forty hours of play, mostly playing coop in regions you are in (and thus often helping people a little ahead in one of your quest lines), with some play with significantly higher level people in unknown regions and some showing people below you how to proceed, results in a total experience which is magical. You have insight into all possible worlds - being RNG, you need to play coop to understand this - and understand leading & following in each region and along each questline.

It is hard to say what the best way to play this is. It's good private co-op with a personal friend, wherein the outstanding part is how fun a shooter it is and how good some boss fights are, but I recommend it foremost as a solo online experience akin to Diablo 2, with a balance around 3:1 guest-host world experience.

With its unique blend of post-apocalyptic world-building, deep character customization, and dynamic gameplay, it delivers an exhilarating experience that will keep you engaged from the first bullet fired to the final boss encounter.

The game's atmospheric setting immediately draws you in. As a survivor in a shattered world overrun by menacing creatures known as the Root, you embark on a perilous journey to restore balance and uncover the mysteries of this dark realm. The world-building is masterfully executed, presenting a unique and captivating post-apocalyptic landscape that begs to be explored. The game's attention to detail, from the intricate level design to the haunting ambiance, adds depth and immersion to the overall experience.

The combat in Remnant: From the Ashes is where the game truly shines. With its tight controls, satisfying gunplay, and intense boss battles, every encounter feels exhilarating. The game offers a diverse arsenal of weapons, each with its own distinct feel and playstyle, allowing you to tailor your approach to combat. The challenge is substantial, requiring quick reflexes, strategic decision-making, and teamwork if you choose to embark on the cooperative adventure with friends or online players.

The dynamic nature of Remnant's gameplay is a standout feature. The game's world is procedurally generated, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same. This not only increases replayability but also keeps you on your toes as you encounter unexpected events, randomized enemy encounters, and hidden areas. The game's generous loot system rewards exploration, providing an abundance of weapons, armor, and enhancements to discover and upgrade, further enhancing your character's abilities.

Character customization is a key aspect of Remnant, allowing you to create a unique playstyle that suits your preferences. With a robust selection of traits, armor sets, and weapon modifications, you can tailor your character's abilities and adapt to different combat situations. The progression system offers a satisfying sense of growth and improvement, as you gain experience and unlock new skills and upgrades.

Visually, Remnant: From the Ashes is a visual treat. The game features detailed environments, stunning particle effects, and atmospheric lighting that add depth and immersion to the world. The hauntingly beautiful art design, combined with a superbly crafted audio landscape, sets the perfect tone for the game's post-apocalyptic atmosphere.",1684786001,1684786001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, this game falls far short of its lofty ambitions, leaving players frustrated, bored, and longing for a better experience.

One of the biggest issues with Remnant is its lackluster storytelling. The narrative feels disjointed and uninspired, failing to engage players on any meaningful level. The characters are forgettable, their dialogue uninteresting, and the world-building is shallow. It's as if the developers simply threw together a mishmash of tired post-apocalyptic tropes without bothering to add any depth or originality.

The gameplay mechanics in Remnant are equally disappointing. While it tries to combine elements of third-person shooting, action RPG, and survival gameplay, it fails to excel in any of these areas. The combat lacks impact and finesse, with clunky controls that often leave you feeling disconnected from the action. Enemy encounters quickly become repetitive and predictable, making every battle a dull slog.

Furthermore, the game's progression system is poorly implemented. The RNG loot system is frustrating and unfair, often leaving players with underpowered weapons and gear for extended periods. The reliance on luck rather than skill undermines any sense of accomplishment or meaningful character growth. It feels like an artificial way to extend the game's lifespan, but instead, it only serves to drain the enjoyment from the experience.

The technical aspects of Remnant are riddled with flaws as well. The graphics are unimpressive, lacking the polish and attention to detail that one would expect from a modern title. Frequent frame rate drops and glitches further detract from the overall experience, causing unnecessary frustration and immersion-breaking moments.

Ultimately, Remnant: From the Ashes is a disappointing and forgettable game. It fails to deliver on its promises of an immersive post-apocalyptic adventure, offering instead a lackluster narrative, uninspired gameplay, and technical issues that hinder any enjoyment. There are far better options available in the genre, and I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money on this lackluster title.",1684709994,1684710077,False,1,1,0.456486701965332031,0,True,False,False

If playing with a controller, the aim assist is pretty much spot-on.

The enemy numbers and AI seem more balanced around multiple players and it can be really annoying with caster types able to create explosions you have to dodge from outside line of sight and some of the bosses can be a right pain since they were really meant to be able to split focus between them and adds on multiple players.

Not impossible, but you'll probably have a few ""Really?"" moments when playing the game.

The character tends to get hung up on the edge of corners for some reason so be aware if you are closely kiting enemies.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is struggling to survive against an ancient evil known as the Root. Players must navigate through dangerous environments, battle deadly monsters, and gather resources to upgrade their weapons and equipment.

The gameplay is challenging, but rewarding. The combat system is smooth and intuitive, with a variety of weapons and abilities to choose from. The boss battles are particularly impressive, requiring strategy and skill to overcome.

But what sets Remnant from the Ashes apart is its emphasis on replayability. The game features procedurally generated levels and randomized loot, ensuring that each playthrough is unique and challenging. This is a game that rewards perseverance and skill.

In conclusion, Remnant from the Ashes is a game that embodies the spirit of our struggle. It is a game that challenges us to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and emerge victorious. I highly recommend it to any gamer who is looking for a thrilling and rewarding experience.

this game is one of the most repayable shooters as its impossible to face all the bosses and collect all the loot in one run which are purposefully short at about 15 hours to Finnish a campaign. 
ok so there are two dlc too this game, the first is the swamp of chorus expands a rather dull or under baked area in the first game, it feels like the devs held back a bit with the intention of selling the other half in the dlc. so it got some deserved criticism, but i think of the two dlcs its the better one, why? well one word, rougelike. the dlc adds a rouglelike game mode where you start naked and have a randomised shop to buy your guns armour etc. you then leave the shop to go through a dungeon on a random world and then the boss you would find, beat the boss and go back to shop and repeat. with one twist is that enemies get stronger over time so you have to be fast while also getting as much loot as you can, very akin to risk of rain, I think this mode justifies getting the dlc as when you finnish the campaign a couple times being able to create new build and use weapons that you would not in your main campain is fun and fresh and its really challenging, getting far in this mode will also unlock items to use for all your characters in the campaigns. this dlc also adds more bosses and quest lines in teh chorus dlc i dont like how that content is added as it feels clunky and most people will have to google how to get to it as its not obvious at all, but it does add one of the best bosses i have experienced.
dlc 2 electric boogaloo, this dlc is a short campain that just extends friom the main one it adds a new world that has the same structure as the otehrs with npc galore puzzles and bosses and cool new weapons and gear to collect, however my one complaint is the world boss. the boss itself is good and an enjoyable encounter my only issue is though is that all the worlds in the main game has two world bosses and you only get one in each play through which means you have to re roll in order to see everything, but this dlc only has one world boss, don't worry too much as it add all the side bosses and dungeons that you would want its just disappointing having enjoyed the structure of the rest of the game.

I haven't written many reviews like this so i hope it reads well and is helpful my spelling is atrocious, i would whole hardheartedly recommend this game to everyone, i would also pick up the first dlc just for the game mode and i would only get the 2 dlc if you really want new content. but i am eagerly awaiting the sequel which looks to improve everything",1613738851,1683800433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After previously getting humbled on nightmare, I decided to play on normal to farm a few different guns and armor sets to max, or near max level. Then I decided to try apocalypse and see if I can at least finish Earth biome.

EARTH

It was very difficult, but I could see the difference when you have proper gear, full traits and weapons. Even Riphide, that made me give up on my previous attempt, was beatable once I acquired AoE guns. Shroud, Riphide and the Ent were defeated after many attempts (especially Ent, that had way too much unpredictable damage from many sources).

RHOM

Rhom is possibly my favorite world so I decided to try that out too, and somehow I got to the final boss of the area, after cheesing Shade and Shatter by inviting myself in their spirit igloo and donating bullets to their faces and millions of attempts on Scourge. I was really hoping not to get the Harrow, but sadly I did, and after many many attempts, I managed to block him from fleeing by keeping a dangerously close distance to him.

CORSUS

After Ezlan humbled me, I decided to comply with him and go to Corsus. The Unclean One seemed easier downstairs on paper, because of no ads, but I had trouble learning its one-hit-KO ground bash patterns, gave up on the long travel to that point, and tried upstairs. Very easy, to my surprise, probably the easiest fight in the game. If you dodge in areas without vases, you will get almost no ads, and once he starts spinning, he kills the ads too. Barbed Terror was not too bad either, seemed like I finally got lucky with a biome as it was by far the easiest dungeon boss. Not to mention I dodged the hellish dungeon that is like a cave with wooden structures. That one is hard on any mode! Then came my nightmare with Ixillis. Found it impossible to break their focus with two shotgun shots, so I decided to risk it all and wear the admiral's ring to boost that damage, since a hit from them would kill me anyway. All I had to do was to accurately shoot the wisps. Behold, after another way too many attempts, passed that. Decided to fight Ezlan anyway because I got a severe power trip, and managed to do it. It's a surprisingly squishy boss, as you can net a 25% on headshots from a hot shot sniper.

YAESHA

Then moved on to Yaesha. I was dreading the rebellion fight the most, as it gave me a lot of trouble on hard. The ranged dudes just chunk you too much. But I stayed upstairs, and the devastator put in a lot of work. Eventually, with the help of a very good boy, I managed to kill the elite trio that ends the dungeon. The next dungeon was another survival, in which turrets and my newly leveled up Ricochet gun really put in all the work while i was rolling like wild. The next Boss was Onslaught, and he actually had a pretty easy pattern to learn. Most of my deaths were from ads. After that, Stormcaller really humbled me a few times, it was a shockingly difficult match, as my multitasking isn't my best skill. But I gave Ricochet Gun a last chance to shine, and it did put in the work. I needed a bit of luck too, as the ads are doing way too much damage. Finally... Totem Father. I saw it as pretty easy on normal/hard, so I was initially happy. But On apocalypse, the ads are brutal, and the totems take a lot of shots to break. Combining 3xBleed and 3xBurn from Devastator and Spitfire helped me machinegun this boss down, and it took maybe the most attempts of all bosses.

Finaly, The Nightmare was harder than I initially thought, but it's really easy if you do it methodically. Just takes a lot of supplies to play it ""safe"", kill only 7-8 root in the nightmare realm, then move on. After 5-6 trips it's done. I don't like this boss to be honest and it is neither interesting nor hard, just grindy.

A special thanks to my summons who carried me through the dungeons, nothing stood out as too hard, except the temple dungeons in Rhom. Special thanks to Sniper Rifle, Devastator, Ricochet gun, and Spitfire, that did almost all the work on their own. And Slayer set slays, as they say.

After each boss battle, my heartrate was through the roof, and the feeling of accomplishment was something I almost never experience. It was both a humbling experience, a test on resilience and patience, and a learning road, as I started experimenting more builds, more weapons, and getting some help from the amazing discord community. And special thanks to Esoterikk on youtube for being a light of inspiration whenever I felt hopeless.

Sorry for the long post but this was an amazing journey. This game is now one of my top 3, and I have a way too big collection of games. I am not great at shooters, so if I could do it, anyone else probably can. Keep trying! And thanks for reading.",1683502043,1683502043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the amount of replayability of this game is crazy. there are dozens of items with various properties that you can build your character with and dozens of different ways you can play it. in terms of both mechanics and skills, you can constantly improve yourself and add on top of what you already have

also, the game is so random that you can play it for tens of hours and still experience and enjoy it like it is a brand new game. sure, that makes it a bit annoying when you're trying to get a certain item for your character, but that really makes the game so interesting and rewarding at the end

whenever you want, you can re-roll your campaign progress (your character does not lose items) to experience new bosses and get new items, or if you do not want to re-roll the campaign, you can just play ""adventure mode"" that is shorter and more fit for focusing on a single biome to get that item you want

it can also be played co-op, and let me tell you: it is absolutely amazing to play with friends. yes, it does have a few bugs; however, they're really not those game-breaking bugs that make you want to uninstall and refund the game type

I'd suggest everyone who's into souls-like to get it and give it a try. who knows, maybe you'll come across your new favorite video game of all time :-)",1683484282,1683484282,True,40,0,0.766907215118408203,0,True,False,False

I advise you skip this one for PC and go find a PS4 copy if you want to play it as from researching the crashes that seems to be the least crash prone version.

If on the other hand you are determined to play this on PC try the following if you run into crashes:
Set all graphics settings to low in game. 
Cap the frame rate at 60 in game.
Set the game to offline in game.
Verify the games files.

If that does not work then a refund may your best option.

+ Optimization is solid good.
+ The Swamp-zone is great.
+ Music riddles yaaay.
+ Mudtooth rulez.

- The plot is bad, really bad. U absolutely do not believe in what is going on, and even does not catch why. No lore-giving basis (yes, there are some books and dialogs, but all dull).
- NPCs are total mess.
- Boss-fights are dull and repeatable. No unique mechanics. They also got some bugs.
- Procedurally generated world is not so procedurally-generated...if u know what I mean.
- Added some grinding...what for? Grinding in this game is really dull and u can't upgrade ur weapon to top without it.
- Melee is useless.
- Some ites do not work. Say hello to an amulet that decreases all incoming dmg, but doesn't do that.
- Mobs sometimes got stuck under the textures (seldom, but happened).
- Unreal-engine crashes.
- ANNND THE WORST - THE FINALE! The final boss-fight AND the finale itself are boring.

Boy, I was in for a treat. Imagine a Souls game with procedurally generated maps. Now add GUNS to it and you're starting to get a feeling what this game is all about. 

The coop can be played in a campaign, but only the host will advance in his game. However, this is not a problem, because, the way they did it, you can play a campaign with a friend while keeping yours, bringing all the levels, weapons and mods you get from their game. And even as a guest in the game, the story is still told as if you were the host.

It is not an easy game, but it's not frustratingly hard either. It will challenge even veteran players as you struggle to some mechanics: after that it ""clicks"" and you feel like a genius, beating bosses with somewhat ease (the twins on the bridge will still serve your rear end on platter, tho).

OMG it is Dark Souls with guns!

Pre-ordered the game.
Installed it.
Started with solo Hard difficulty run and after finished it I reset the campaign and started second run solo Nightmare difficulty.
Game kicked my ass (some times balls to).
Good game and it has co-op to.

Things I did not like:

1. Boss fights:

In this game more then half of them are just annoying because of mobs. Not hard but annoying.

While the bosses look cool themselves but when looking at them separately (their combat mechanics) from the mobs that they spawn in numbers they are not much of anything to write to home about.

Bosses in DLCs are a lot better made. A Lot less mobs to fight or even no mobs.
In this game sadly the mobs that come with boss are ""the real boss"".
So in short I would like to fight actual boss in the boss fight and not the mobs.

And before someone says ""Ooh but where will we get the ammo?"" I do not care.
It is a fantasy/Sci-Fi game they should figured out/made up some thing else how to get ammo.

2. Random boss modifier:

Random boss modifier is not bad if you fight only boss and it adds more challenge.
But boss getting random modifier on top of a lot of mobs that he spawns can make you fight against him a real nightmare on higher difficulty.

3. Armour bonuses:

I really wish they would make this removable from armour like they did with weapon mods.
Why you ask? Fashion. Wanna look good when I die.

But other than that I love this game. :)

My personal score for the game 7+1-1/10

All the core mechanics are pretty much perfect in my opinion. Movement is smooth and dodging attacks by rolling feels especially satisfying. Weapons feel great to use and you can feel the weight behind your bullets hitting the enemies. Speaking about weapons, the diversity and creativity of them is outstanding. A crossbow with ricochet shots, a burning sword, a gun that shoots mushroom spores or if that's all too boring just shoot your enemies into another dimension. You also have special abilities you can match with weapons which can be equipped together with your rings and amulet, which allows you to create your own unique build. 

The world design is visually appealing and randomized, offering a different experience with each playthrough. The bosses are also randomized, adding to the game's replayability. While the game can be challenging, the feeling of accomplishment after overcoming a difficult challenge is incredibly rewarding. There are only minor issues with the game I can think of. Some boss fights have an excessive number of adds, and the level design is not particularly interesting due to the world randomization.

Playing solo is already super enjoyable, but playing with up to two friends is even better. Amazing experience all around, I highly recommend.",1608477622,1682887236,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Story has potential but badly executed. Bosses are super cool but almost soulless, it's just becomes grind at some point.

But the weird, map/openworld setting is very unconventional. You almost immediately got lost in the game and it's not linear.

We accidently killed the final boss without knowing, turns out you have to explore every inch of the map before going forward. But you don't know which way is forward. So you go in random corners and dungeons and suddenly you are in another map. 

It feels very annoying to teleport back to the map you just cleared just because you picked the wrong door. And when you teleport back, all the monsters respawn, so it becomes a chore real quick.

And game won't inform you throughly about stats, mechanics, conditions, and stuff. You have to figure most of them by yourself or googleing. There are skins in this game, which we never unlocked because we didn't know where to find the ""Glowing Fragment"". 

Apparently, you have to play the game on Harder modes to find them. But to survive harder modes you need the weapon and armor upgrades. And to upgrade your gear you have to play the game. And when you upgrade your gear enough to deal with hard mode, you finish the game. When I googled how to get fragments, all of the tutorials I found was using either save-scamming or glitches.

Let's start with the good. The premise is pretty interesting -- apocalypse against eldritch horror trees that you need to traverse different realms to flee. Also, The art department did a good job with some levels (particularly the DLC) where the environment has a cool feel to it. 

Now, the bad. 

Everything mechanically feels awkward. Throughout the entire time I've played I could never get the sensitivity right and you are forced to engage enemies in a shallow mid-range which doesn't help because the FOV is kinda tight. You feel like you are moving through molasses the whole game because animations are slow, you move slow,  and you run out of stamina all the time running from place to place. Later, you can find upgrade perks to speed some things up, but it's pretty much useless to spend points there because there are way more useful skills to put your points into. 

As for skills, there are way too many of them that are completely pointless and only serve to clutter up the trait upgrade screen. I beat the whole game essentially only putting points into health and DMG increases, and really that's all you will have points for unless you re-roll the campaign a bunch of times or grind the areas. Though, I have no idea why you would do this as there's no real reason to and most of the perks are minimal improvements at best. You can get much better perks from the armor anyways.

The armor effectively renders class choice pointless as you can just buy the other classes armor sets in the shop once you get enough material. Though, even that is a bit pointless because you will get better armor not long into just going through the campaign and beating bosses. My friend chose the Hunter class and I chose the Cultist, and not far into the game we both just ended up choosing long range weapons and equipping armor that boosted long range damage, effectively making us the same class.

Speaking of the bosses, they are pretty disappointing. Pretty much all of them are just bullet sponges with one gimmick that you have have to work around. You'll probably die a few times figuring out the mechanics (because they are not communicated well to the player), but as soon as you do it will probably take you 1 try to beat any given boss. Many of the bosses can see clear inspiration from Dark Souls bosses or standard boss tropes, which does feel more like homage, but means that none of the mechanics are going to feel very novel. 

Overall, every area is the same: you show up, shoot a bunch of mindless ads in a looping map with ease, talk to an NPC, fight 3 bosses, and go onto the next area. The story is non-existent, and during my play through there was even a bug where the game would just cut off character dialogue mid-delivery -- It felt like even the game didn't care. And honestly, it's better that way because none of the parts that I did manage to track made any sense when I thought about it (i.e. why are we killing the guardians of the world if that's just going to facilitate more Root, and our objective is to destroy the root? etc.).

If you can pick this game up dirt cheap with a friend, it might be fun to mess around for a bit. But, I wouldn't buy it for what I bought it for ($20-ish), and certainly not at full price.",1682665785,1682666231,False,11,2,0.518862783908843994,2,True,False,False

Not a terrible game.
Not a great one either.

The level design is terrible : a bunch of corridors and stairs with nooks and crannies everywhere, but with rarely anything it there. But, as there will occasionally be a unique item in there, or an enemy waiting to ambush you, you still have to check every. Single. One of them.
That would be fine if levels were interesting to traverse. But they aren't : there's not verticality to the levels, there's no looping or inter-connectivity to the levels, there's no interesting way to move around. Your character being slow as hell doesn't help either, especially since you don't have infinite stamina outside combat.

The combat itself is fine. The weapons are pretty fun to use, and the mods make things interesting. The enemy design is also pretty solid, even if it sometimes feel like kinda random, lore-wise.

Bosses are... a mixed bag. Some of them are really good. Some of them are just okay. But. Every. Single. Bossfight. Is filled, FILLED with adds. There isn't a single boss fight, not ONE, without a shitton of adds. This not only make snipers and revolvers virtually unusable during a boss encounter, but also has the effect of making bosses incredibly similar : hit and run for a minute, transition, kill some adds, rinse and repeat. Bosses usually have 1 or 2 attacks, and 1 ability. And that's it. Incredibly underwhelming and frustrating.

The story and lore are okay. Nothing stellar, nothing horrible. It's just fine.

All in all, as a solo experience it is impossible to recommend this game. Maybe it's fun in multiplayer, but in solo, it's just incredibly tedious and frustrating.",1682582792,1682582792,False,24,4,0.503210365772247314,0,True,False,False

I can't get into this game personally, the world looks very nice and some of the concepts are cool. For me the game play felt too detached, I can't quite put my finger on it but I just didn't feel in control of the player character. I'm not going to down vote but wish I could neutral vote or even better abstain, I haven't played long enough to give a fair critique (although I have played for significantly longer than 1 hour!). All I can offer is my initial impressions.

I'm really confused why people are saying this is a Souls like but with guns, it very much is not, the only connection is that you fight bunches of enemies and sometimes they are hard to beat. Much like every action game you've played, ever! Anyway...

The world looks very nice although AA, but that isn't an issue. The atmosphere and mood is funny, on one hand the world has been ravaged by 'the root' (no dick jokes, please) as soon as you step outdoors you are greeted by these weird roid-rage Groot characters, yet indoors people seem to be getting on with things perfectly fine. The world excluding the root reminds me of Nier Automata, it is vastly different but I get the same vibe, make of that what you will. 

The gun play feels fine apart of the detached feeling I mentioned earlier, I picked the ex-cult class which had some nice starting weapons but it would have been good to have a fallback melee weapon. Stealth isn't really an option and I'm not sure if it is even meant to be, I was never able to sneak attack a single enemy, again maybe you're not meant to play that way?

The story-line is an acquired taste, the dialogue and scripting is.......sketchy, respectfully. You start the game attempting to rescue a dude  then get attacked yourself, these people drag you into their bunker and save you. When you wake you're told to clear out the basement and restore power, then immediately afterwards the head-honcho gives you this special key that her grandfather gave to her. The key opens a big ass teleport crystal..... I often find myself giving away family heirlooms after somebody has fixed the fuse-box.

I can see how some might like this game, it is a good effort for this type of game but it IS NOT A SOULS GAME WITH GUNS!",1682546914,1682546914,True,0,0,0.466975659132003784,2,True,False,False

It's not that Remnant is a bad game, it's just not a great one. The story and characters are just plain weird, the combat is smooth, but lacks any real skill other than aim and shoot fast. I think a cover mechanic (like The Division or Gears of War) would add massively to this game. The environments are about 2 colours per zone which gets dull fast. I spend a lot of time running around rather than fighting, but then when you do finally meet enemies it feels as though it's just a spam of adds.

That said, the RPG element is light but well done, the game runs beautifully, even on an older machine and the power up mechanics of each weapon is good. Plus the RNG of enemies in each playthrough differs, which is a nice touch.

Shooting is responsive and impactful, and each weapon has a distinct feel to it. The melee combat is serviceable if not basic, and was definitely intended to take the back seat.

The boss battles are a mixed bag. While some are great (Ixillis, Totem Father, Riphide), a lot of the time their design is basic, and to compensate they throw endless waves of trash mobs at you to divert your attention. It felt like a cheap way of raising difficulty, and is thankfully something they're working on reducing in the upcoming sequel.

The visual presentation is superb, and there were some set pieces in the game that were awe inspiring, namely when you first encounter the labyrinth.

The writing on the other hand lacks the same level of imagination. I completed the game yesterday, and if you put a gun to my head right now, I couldn't name one character, or tell you what the story was about. It's become almost a staple in souls like games, where every character has to be an eccentric loner that speaks in vague, cryptic metaphors. A little bit of mystery is good, but you have to give the player a reason to care enough to uncover it. You need emotional stakes to get people invested, themes of redemption, revenge, love etc. Without it, the story just meanders pointlessly.

Good gun play, a few RPG elements, rewarding exploration with a few useful trinkets to find scattered in the maps, and souls-like boss battles - including ""camp fires/crystals"" where you regenerate health and ammo. Though this can be considered carbon copy from Dark Souls, Remnant's take on the game mechanics feels fresh enough.

The main campaign is done rather quickly and is merely a linear story punctuated by the boss battle. These range from rather easy in the lowest difficulty, to unwinnable in difficulty settings above ""Difficult"" (or I am simply not talented enough). The design of these boss fights is not souls-like at all : whereas Dark Souls relied on good observation and quick reactions while you were fighting ONE or TWO bosses, the Remnant bosses summon ADDS to pester you. In most fights, you will die from the adds... A highly debatable design choice imho.

The so called adventure mode allows for quick and entertaining shooting parties, the procedurally generated maps prevent the game to become stale all to soon.

All in all, decent entertainment.

This makes every maps feel somewhat different every time you play it. Some events and boss fights also trigger in certain map re-rolls, and I really love that. 

I played the whole game solo (despite the game very much encouraging co-op gameplay), and I did draw on some conclusions on that. Seeing some reviewers on youtube, I felt that playing this game on co-op has a very different appeal to it, and completely apart from the feeling and sense of achievement you get when playing it solo.

This game is hard, really hard on some cases when u try to take on bosses and Adds at once; as in solo, all the enemy focuses on you. There were times when I was swarmed with Adds- all within close proximity, the boss charging towards me with ranged fire attacks while me burning and my armour corroded, and the surrounding with tar pools ablaze. It was hell.

This game requires heavy space management, and an attention; not only towards the bosses, but towards spawning Adds and environmental hazards. You need proper coordination and a sense of presence in the battle arena when you try to confront a boss. Playing solo in Remnant is tough, and feels very souls-like punishing if not careful.
These, actually becomes easier when you do the same runs on co-op. As in there people can focus on different aspects and manage to dish out damage to boss and adds administratively. The game becomes more organised, as teammates can heal, pull aggro and even revive; which is not possible in solo, as death there means restarting the boss fight entirely. Remnant in co-op actually holds much more resemblance to co-op shooter games  than souls-like ones, at least in my opinion seeing people play.

Overall,  I really enjoyed my time playing Remnant: From the Ashes, as learning the world generations, boss patterns, environment management and space creation between boss mechanisms was very rewarding. Playing this game solo was tough, not gonna lie, but it was worth it; as it was highly rewarding when I was finally able to fell world bosses alone on hard difficulties, able to make a character I have fun playing with, and a sense of awe every time I re-roll a map event I was not expecting.

Don't mind the plot. You don't play this for the plot.
Recommended as an action game.
Not recommended as a soulslike. 

Since guns are the main focus of this game, boss design has to revolve around that. Most bosses therefore have trash mobs spawning left and right so they can drop ammo. If you take away trash mobs, boss design is exposed as weak and too easy. The thing is there's already ammo boxes that you can consume to replenish ammo and consuming that would be enough to add to the hectic nature of boss battles without throwing trash mobs.
I heard that this was a common complaint among the playerbase and the sequel is said to address this so that's good.

World design is below average. It feels like a sequence of linear Skyrim dungeons linked by loading screens than a world once lived in and decayed. I can compliment the details and art direction but the map layout of the randomly generated corridors doesn't make the game's world feel engaging or concrete, another trait Souls games have excelled at. 

Item progression relies on your playstyle. You don't drop a weapon/armor because a better one dropped. It's all about upgrading and what feels good to the player. Some players might prefer semi-automatic fire, some may prefer fully automatic, etc. and trying out weapon mods that make the weapon feel better is up to you but you have to unlock those via boss fights.
Armor sets have their own bonuses and you can synergize that with your gun build.

Amazing art direction.
Great gunplay. Guns feel and sound impactful. Really. The animation of staggering enemies further enforce that.

Co-op is fun and great especially with friends but there are problems:
1. You don't see the latency so joining random hosts is a dice roll 
2. Boss fights might be considered spoilers because the host has progressed farther than you but you don't really play this game for the plot...
3. Friendly fire can be used to grief players

The last difficulty will be too hard for most people and will just drive you crazy unless you really like to grind then go for it.

This game has replayability because you cannot beat all the bosses in 1 play-through because the game will only give you a set amount each campaign run and if you want to find all the content the game has you have to reroll the campaign or do adventure runs to find the other bosses and side-quests that you didn't find the first time.

Huge replay-ability, as each game is generated differently - you might find different gear, visit different areas, even fight completely different bosses (with a whole set of alternate loot drops). Play through a full story Campaign and/or generate quick ""Adventures"" in the world of your choice.

The devs have really worked their ass off to bring this vision to reality - each world is truly unique and comes as an awesome surprise when you get there. I felt like I was constantly discovering cooler and cooler areas and enemies, not a single stage of the game felt ""phoned in"" or lazy, quite the opposite.

The DLCs are well worth it - one (Swamps of Corsus) expands on the Adventure mode and adds a ton of cosmetics and gear as well as a whole new ""Survival"" mode, the other (Subject 2923) adds an entirely new Campaign set in a completely new world, greatly expanding the lore and build progression. 

Another point for replay-ability is the co-op Online play, which allows you to help others, or invite your friends (or strangers) to help you. This is one of the most fun co-op shooters I've ever played.

Hardcore mode (permadeath) also adds a whole new set of challenges and rewards, which is great - it's not just a difficulty increase for the sake of difficulty.

The audio in the game is not too bad, but it doesn't stand out as particularly noteworthy. However, it doesn't detract from the overall experience. This game is best suited for teens and adults, as the difficulty may be too much for younger players.

Remnant: From the Ashes requires a fast PC to run smoothly, but it's not an overly demanding game. The difficulty is high, making it a challenging experience for even the most seasoned gamers. The game also features a significant grind, which may be off-putting for some players, but it adds to the challenge and longevity of the game.

The story is average, providing enough context and lore to keep players engaged, but it doesn't take center stage. The game time is long, providing a meaty experience for those who enjoy lengthy adventures.

Pricewise, Remnant: From the Ashes is worth its price tag, offering a challenging and entertaining experience for players. Bugs seem to be nearly non-existent in the game, allowing for a smooth and enjoyable experience throughout.

Overall, I give Remnant: From the Ashes a 7 out of 10. It's a solid game with challenging game play and a decent atmosphere, making it a worthwhile experience for action-adventure fans.

I'd like to mention that I am eagerly awaiting the release of Remnant 2. I hope that the sequel will expand upon the existing features and offer even more complexity in terms of builds and party play. Additionally, I'm excited to see how the developers incorporate interactive hidden puzzles to further engage players and add another layer of depth to the gameplay experience. If they can build upon the solid foundation of the first game, Remnant 2 is sure to be a hit among fans and new players alike.

It leans heavily on the souls genre, but focuses more on shooting than melee. It is not very open world, but I think it flows better with the adventure mode which allows you to play certain sections of maps outside of the story mode. That also works because the maps are randomly generated for the most part. Co-op is a plus over souls game because you don't have to keep summoning friends after bosses and they also don't have their health reduced.

It starts out really fun - the core combat flows well, all the weapons seem useful, and swapping between melee and your two guns feels very satisfying. So you start going through the first couple of areas. They look good, there's a nice amount of small-scale exploration for items and upgrade materials (though overall the design is pretty linear with some added side dungeons that put you back to the main path when you are done), the enemies are simple but fine, and hey, these are just the first areas. The red-and-grey color scheme overstays its welcome a bit but it's nothing too glaring. 

But then you get to the second world and... it's basically the same. The color scheme has changed a bit, but most areas feel very much like something you've seen before. The overall structure barely changed. And the same goes for the enemies: Yeah, they look different, and they aren't exactly reskins, but the same attack patterns are recognizable: you've got your small enemy that rushes at you and attacks but dies in two shots, you've got your exploding enemy that rushes at you and explodes, you've got your run-of-the-mill enemy with a simple ranged attack, you've got your caster-type enemy that spawns hurty bubbles at your position, and so on. And these enemies are then thrown at you in the same group compositions, with the order of the day being ""enemy spam"". No enemy is interesting enough on its own, so they just spawn them in in groups of 5 to 10. Carefully exploring to pick off enemies is a no-go since they just spawn in behind you anyway.

In fact, this game is so enemy spammy that even the bosses are enemy spam. Or, more precisely, there are two types of bosses:
1. Total pushovers with nothing interesting to say about them (except that there's some wonky hurtboxes on some attacks).
2. Enemy spam.
I finally quit on a miniboss that was spawning 5+ flying ranged attackers to shoot at me from all angles (in a game that, for all the field of view you are getting, may as well be a 1st person shooter) and then just spam-vomited barely-dodgable fire. It simply wasn't fun. In a game like Dark Souls I would have persevered through such a fight because those games always keep you excited about what will come after. But I realized that I wasn't excited at all anymore about what this game had to offer, because it had already proven to be a bunch of same-y enemy spam.

So far I've had a lot of fun just soloing so if I really had to nail the feel of the game-play it would be a hybrid of souls/diablo/destiny.

Simply put if your not a fan of the material grind and souls punishment this is not a game for you. However if your will to give it a chance and grit through deaths to learn the bosses it can be a pretty fun game with its lovecraftian theme which was its main draw for me.

Otherwise, it's a good game, if you enjoy shooting games. But the save corruption issue is still happening to others, so I'm leaving my negative review.

Update:

Finished the game with a new save after the previous one corrupted, and got most of the way through the expansion. My overall impressions are positive, but there were many things that bugged me in this title.

Getting the positives out the way, the shooting mechanics are the big strength of this game, as it can be quite satisfying getting headshots and working your way through hordes of enemies (when they're not in boss fights). But the game feels like it needed more attention elsewhere to help this aspect stand out more. 

There is a sense of polish, like the devs really did their best to get it down to a point, at least as far as they could, being a smaller studio. So there is a sense that care was taken with its development, particularly with how well the game was supported after launch.

The story is very unremarkable and I wasn't feeling it by 1/3 through, just being led by map markers and letting the dialog go through one ear and out the other. After the first main area it felt a bit convoluted. There were a lot of strange choices with certain elements, things that would often be built up, only to be forgotten soon afterwards. So I felt like I was being let down by the story cues, teased.

[spoiler]Things like the NPCs at the hideout, with their individual backstories and situations that you learn about through talking with them and notes and such found in the world. It felt like the father/daughter situation with the hideout leader fell through entirely. You're introduced to a couple different individuals and yet it never really amounts to anything.[/spoiler]

The gear and loot side of things was acceptable, but I didn't get much gratification from the role-playing aspects of the game. There weren't many items or item types, and it was seldom that I felt like trying something different, but I'd force myself to to mix things up. Particularly when it'd be unusable until upgraded further, which often made me opt for simply saving the materials for my current weapon. 

I did try a variety of gear and weapons though, as it would have been a waste not to, but ultimately I ended up sticking with the Hunter's starting gear and just upgraded it til game end. 

The stamina in this game is a pain though. I was still fighting with stamina later on in the game, after having upgraded it a ton, and using lighter gear. You have to do a lot of kiting and repositioning and it can be quite frustrating when you're constantly running out of stamina.

The game starts off quite well and makes a good impression due to the atmosphere and mechanics, but gets annoying at times due to poor difficulty scaling and frustrating bosses. Sometimes, due to the randomised levels/instancing, I'd find that I was encountering a strange difficulty spike, where it'd spawn multiple mini bosses at once, or you'd be at the end of a tough fight, out of health and resources, and right afterwards it'd play the sound to indicate a newly spawned mini boss and your only option is to run for a crystal to refresh and retry that section, in the hope that it doesn't do the same sequence on the next try (as it's randomized).

The levels range from relatively decent (for when it came out) like the vibrant forest region, to really ugly like the desert region, which felt like it needed a bit more time put into the biome. They did put a lot of work into the atmosphere though, and I still find it amazing how well the levels are pieced together considering they're dynamically generated.

I feel like the game would have worked better with a more linear, tailored experience though. But that's just me. It feels like it hasn't quite settled on an identity.

But I understand that it's more of an indie studio, or was at the time this was released, and it was likely a huge undertaking for a smaller team, particularly with getting all the different systems developed and in place for this type of game.

I played on Hard first play-through, and then tried... Nightmare? I think? the one after Hard. That wasn't fun at all and I got very frustrated. I soon realised after googling that the two last difficulties assume that you're on a New Game+ run or something, as they expect you to have good equipment and stats. So that put an end to that play-through and I re-rolled the world back to Hard. 

I do find myself returning to it every now and then just to shoot stuff, which is a good thing! But it doesn't always last long as I find too many of the bosses unfun to fight.

Hopefully Remnant 2 will resolve many of the issues I have with the first game! I'd say it's still worth the pick up as long as you realise it's more about the shooting mechanics than the role playing, story or overall polish.",1567457194,1681466081,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I tried the game on Apocalyse which was my own fault. I of course eventually hit a wall hard, and had to restart as I had no idea what I was doing and the difficulty wasn't balanced for a first time player.

It was at this point that I discovered Remnant doesn't have hand-crafted levels but a weird procedural system. Before long I could start seeing the seams of this design everywhere. The areas I repeated, although in theory different levels, had the same building blocks, a side street snapped here when it was there, an exit through a small shop on the left-hand side moved to the right, but it was still the same building, the same shop, the same exit.

But I was sticking with it, the game controls very well, switching weapons is quick and snappy, and the Hunter character I was playing as was fun for the most part...although I was starting to hate the sheer quantity of enemies I was facing.

I then hit my first boss, a sniper who teleported around an area with its own towers trying to get behind me. Perfect, just what I wanted! But no, the fun of a sniper duel was ripped instantly away from me as the game starts spawning infinite regular enemies, about 10 at a time, all sprinting towards me, all causing status ailments; a toxic mist that eventually causes your character to cough intermittently interrupting what you're doing, and a bleed effect that constantly drains your HP...and these statuses don't disappear until you die or rest at a bonfire.

But I grinned and beared it, got past the fight eventually, moved on to the next area and although it was slightly different with some living trees and new enemies with guns, the buildings all looked the exact same and I was getting sick of it.

I hit another boss, the same big enemy with a sword that caused me issues on Apocalypse, but now with the ability to summon 6 exploding one-hit kill enemies chasing you around leaving toxic mists.

Another sort-of boss (has a boss fog at least), defending a person stuck in a tree against an onslaught of the same enemies I've been fighting everywhere. Annoying. I get past this and I'm back in an underground train area that I'd already been in twice. I hated this area because they had so many enemies spawning in from seemingly nowhere but during the previous area I'd noticed some hanging from the ceilings and thought I was being stupid. But no, all a facade. Enemies do fall from the ceilings but they're much more likely just to be behind you because the game decided they were.

All those points I've been putting in to reducing enemy detection range to be sneaky? Utterly pointless since the game arbitrarily decides I'm in a fight. Some enemies just appear and start screaming, spawning more enemies that just chase you endlessly.

But I get past all this crap again and I hit my next boss, The standard tree enemy without a head where they split in two when you enter the room, and then into 4 after the first health bar, then into 8 after the second. During this each enemy decides to do either a heal (shoot twice to stop) or throwing a knife at you, or they'll do a pulsating growing full room AOE that you have to roll into. And they can all fucking do it. There's times when you're trying to avoid this AOE from 4 different enemies whilst 2 of them need to be shot to stop the heal. This means timing your roll, keeping an eye out on the others throwing knives which can stun you causing you to get hit but the AOE, doing huge damage. It was at this point I realised that the healing item is godawful taking like 5 seconds to activate.

I'm not sure what I wanted to see here. There's very few bosses like this that rely on adds in Soulsbourne. I'm trying to think of anyone other than Nito (there must be more) but as an example there's ways around the adds, you can get him to hit them, or you can use a holy weapon or you can kite them whilst you run around the edge since they are melee and fairly slow. But even then, just throwing more enemies at you doesn't make a fight more exciting. Genichiro and Isshin are 10/10 duels that rely on mastering mechanics not dealing with bullshit.

But it's hard to have that when you're fighting trees with no personality, and your bosses are the exact same enemy models but with more HP and a bunch of friends.

Mobs spawn behind you from a room you've already cleared, making it feel like  it's a ""cheap difficulty"". You get waves of mobs from around the corner that just run towards you. The only thing this has compared to souls-like is the dodge, which by the way has terrible iframes. You're on the middle of the roll and swords just hit you. 

Don't buy it, not even on sale.

Edit: After playing for another 5 hours the game's movement became more natural to me, so gotta be honest and say that it became a more enjoyable experience. I still think the dodge iframes are bad and don't match with the roll animation. The game keeps this idea of making mobs spawn in waves and coming from an already cleared room, which doesn't make the game hard, just cheap. ALso I found out about the gear score system which makes the game harder as you upgrade your armor and weapons, which is dumb. You're stronger at +0 than at +20.

Remnant: From the Ashes is a over the shoulder third-person shooter with plenty of RPG element progression. Remnant offers a lot of challenges that you may choose at your leisure and if you so wish you can even co-op with friends or random people which in my opinion is better than Fromsoft's souls games.

Rememeber while Remnant certainly takes inspiration from the Action RPGs that Fromsoft has made, due to the difference focus on gameplay (One focuses on Third-Person Shooting and the other being the traditional standard Action RPG that is more familiar with) the bosses and minions will function very differently from what you expect in the traditional sense. Such as needing a supply of ammo which is offered by killing minions in the boss arena. Many traditionalist hate this concept and want the main focus to be the boss, but the devs needed to solve the ammo issue and minions being added in the boss fight was the best answer that could come up with.

Besides the minions and ammo that makes the bosses nontraditional, the bosses themselves also add in replayability as most them have hidden gimmicks that can earn you a different reward if you know how to get it. So have fun finding and unlocking everything, getting a taste of everything that is Remnant: From the Ashes, before Remnant 2 comes out.",1680618196,1680618196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bosses. Essentially, there aren't any bosses in this game. There are things/scenarios you're meant to *interpret* as bosses (which is worse than just not bothering at all). In what's meant to pass for a ""boss fight"", you get one or more powered-up enemies. And they're surrounded by waves of regular enemies who are weak but irritating-en-mass (and far too often overwhelming-en-mass) just like they are outside of a boss fight. Instead of designing innovative bosses with actual systems of attack, and moves you can learn and master, Remnant just uses sheer numbers of enemies to mob and surround you. And that makes the fight undoubtedly irritating, and arguably somewhere from unreasonable to outright unfair. And every (tedious) boss fight is like that. At no point are you ever fighting just one, single, big, hard-to-dodge, hard-to-fight enemy (in the way that you are, constantly, in Soulsborne; and to the great credit of Soulsborne).

Parry/deflect. You should be able to parry/deflect the enemy's melee and/or ranged attacks (like you can in Soulsborne, Wo Long, Jedi: Fallen Order, etc.). Without that, there's a big hole missing in the player's ability to feel like they're really mastering a system. The game then devolves to dodging, shooting, hitting, and grinding to level up against unreasonable difficulty spikes (and against the ""boss"" problem mentioned above).

Penalty for dying. There isn't one. You don't drop your cash or experience on death. You lose nothing, which takes away 99% of the feeling of jeopardy, excitement, and suspense of playing. Instead, on dying, you gain the often valuable benefit of being teleported back to the last crystal you rested at, with all those nice resource-dropping enemies conveniently respawned (which is great when you're grinding, which I'd say is unfortunately necessary a lot of the time). And all of that makes dying in fact an advantage rather than a disadvantage. Which is, frankly, nuts.

The procedurally-generated nature of the game is also a problem. I knew to expect that in advance; so the first time I came to scenery I'd seen before, I thought oh, that's just a dupe of that other place. But to my surprise it turned out to *BE* that other place (I'd opened a gate back to it). But then every time it happened *after* that, it really *was* a different place that'd just been copy-pasted. It's bad enough having to see copy-pasted scenery over and over, but to have to go through the extra cognitive process of wondering whether it's a copy-paste OR THE SAME PLACE is really quite annoying. And in fact, this is just another facet of the budget nature and feel of this game. Instead of designing unique levels with intent and purpose, the developers just procedurally copy-paste borderline-meaningless stuff together to pass for content and substance.

A lesser problem (there are others) is the way this game steals/borrows (depending how charitably you're feeling) from Soulsborne, Doom, etc. I mean, flying skulls? Really? But, as you can infer from the above, Remnant steals none of the right bits.

I don't know whether they've fixed the above in Remnant 2; but if they haven't, then I'll be avoiding that, too.",1680552037,1680552549,False,4,1,0.491184204816818237,0,True,False,False

Look at the launch trailer image! The guy has roots on him - Oh nooooooo ... Yawn. I feel like this enemy choice killed a lot of potential hype for the game and is why it's more of a hidden gem.

The big gimmick is the procedural generation elements - with five primary areas to the game, and 3 bosses picked from an area-specific pool, the idea is for a unique experience every time you run through the campaign or reroll an individual area. What this actually means in gameplay is that specific weapons, armor pieces, and content are wholly unavailable until sections are repeated, with no knowledge of what's being missed and what's being potentially rolled for unless you check third-party sources. This means that particular build paths, well-optimized for some weapons and poorly for some others, can be shafted in the lategame by failing to randomly roll into getting something like the Assault Rifle (as though such a gun would be a non-guaranteed option in any other game anyways). Additionally, in trading for the procedural generation, the enemies and level design have been completely thrown out the window - differences in map layout on said rerolls amount to literally nothing, since the building blocks used to make up the environment are woefully generic across every visual set. Throw on top of this an anti-fun enemy scaling system (they get healthier as you gain more damage! exciting), an abysmal story, mediocre visual direction and (of what is available to you) a poor variety of loadout options, and you have a real stinker of an experience. The gunplay is decent and makes buddying up with someone mildly enjoyable, if just for having a PVE experience in the dreadfully weak co-op market these days, but solo the game is a complete pass. Hopefully the second game becomes more of what they were envisioning, because I can't imagine this was what anyone saw as the best case scenario.",1680131874,1680131874,False,2,0,0.493207305669784546,0,True,False,False

First of all, let me save you a LOT of trouble, do not, I repeat, do NOT go Scrapper. Every other class is totally fine but the shotgun is a NIGHTMARE to play against bosses and just isn't fun most of the time. I never would imagine there would be bosses that make it impossible to hit that perfect 7.5 meter range but not ONLY is there bosses that prevent this, there are mobs that also prevent this, at the VERY START of the game. As a matter of a fact, there isn't a SINGLE mob where the shotgun is actually useful against, not a single one. Even though as I played the game it quickly became clear to me (Even the second boss - Shroud its impossible to beat with the shotgun...) that the shotgun is the worse weapon in the game, my dumbass still upgraded it along with my scrapper gear hoping it would be better.

It got much, much, much worse. I constantly ran out of ammo, the pistol I had was garbage, some secret areas didn't properly spawn for me, changing my gear is now a multi-hour grind where I have to start from scratch. The coach gun or hunting rifle would have been a better choice hands down. The scrapper armor is USELESS. It has terrible damage reduction and for a tank based class, please explain to me why its got NEGATIVE RESISTANCES. 

So now I have to spend hours upon hours grinding and grinding to change my ENTIRE gearset. As this entire game is balanced around playing as Hunter. Thanks devs. Good balancing. Also, FUCK YOU.

This is some of the worse balancing I seen in a video game. Usually when I play a class it at least is viable to some degree but when I say playing shotgun is impossible, I really fucking mean its impossible. Try finding someone beat Claviger and Shroud with a fucking shotgun. Meanwhile every single boss can die to the hunting rifle when properly upgraded. As you play Scrapper you quickly feel like a Druid player in Diablo 4 beta, you can still progress but it takes at least 5 times (No exaggeration) longer.

Apart from the shitty balancing this game does on ranged weapons, this game is really fun to play. I did have fun playing with my shotgun even though it was more of a hassle than an actual joy.

But the problems aren't even close to ending here... THIS IS WHY MEN GO BALD.

The magnum did NOT SPAWN for me, even though its APPARENTLY 100% spawn chance. This was after going through the ENTIRE Earth map top to bottom not once but twice. I needed to relevel my entire character but I also wanted the magnum so I scoured the ENTIRE map and I repeat, the ENTIRE map multiple times. All the dungeons, all the crevices, everything. I googled it multiple times, watched multiple videos, you get it. I did NOT have the Magnum spawn, there was a corpse behind the fence, there was NO strange coin. I do know the maps are procedural generated and the spawn location is different, but I am telling you the goddamn thing did NOT spawn for me. At all. That's -1 sidearm that I desperately need as the repeater pistol is garbage.

The maps are procedural generated yet the game does a pisspoor job telling you which area is which. In order to even know what area you are in, you need to enter it AND run through it for a bit. Your map cannot be moved, your map does not even tell you the name of the location you are in, your map is garbage, the entire procedural generation system is GARBAGE. I am absolutely certain the devs did not properly test the map system to make sure everything spawned properly as well. The only good thing I have to say about the map is that the areas that haven't been visited yet light up differently but god forbid you forget where you are supposed to progress after entering an area and you spend nearly an hour figuring out where the fuck Claviger is. 

The amount external resources on this game is severely lacking. Multiple wikis are a WIP, it seems nobody really wanted to spend any time going over the map system, the locations of certain bosses, and so on. Because there is no information on how the maps generate, the location of each area, how to find certain bosses, and so on.

The bunker boss called ""The Harrow"" did NOT spawn for me. I searched EVERYWHERE for the bunker boss, I googled it, I watched videos on it, I tried everything and I checked the entire Romn map multiple times. I finally followed a video and saw the exact location where it spawns and guess what? I went to that EXACT area and IT DIDN'T FUCKING SPAWN. Hours of my time wasted. After further googling I found a random comment that says only either Claviger or The Harrow will spawn and both cannot spawn on the same world seed. Then I rechecked the wiki and it says, ""This is one of two possible world bosses."" and my desire to uninstall only increased. Thanks for the clear description wiki.

I got all the known secret locations and secret items apart from these two things. Which by the way as a reminder, -1 sidearm so the only sidearm I have now is the submachine gun, and -1 boss that allows me to progress in the story. So I hope you understand how pissed I am, justifiably so I think.

I only recently found out about the submachine gun. Complete game changer but I was so burnt out by the time I got it I just didn't care. Between having to remake my entire gearset, farm for resources, and find the claviger boss AGAIN. On top of not being able to progress because the alternate ""The Harrow"" boss which is better for shotgun builds didn't exist, the magnum wasn't spawning, and I felt like a Druid player in Diablo 4 beta. I wanted to uninstall. With prejudice. 

However, HOWEVER, even after the many upon many annoying issues I encountered, I still recommend this game. Yes, I am angry, yes I want to uninstall and never play this again, and yes I would like to punch whoever designed the procedural map system in the face. But I still love the game at its basis and I must say even full price this game is worth it. 

8/10 as long as you don't take the scrapper class. :) I repeat, DO NOT TAKE THE SCRAPPER CLASS.",1680023612,1680023612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hate Linear games, there boring as heck, this game had been drawn in about a 50/50 split and took time for me to warm up to, enough to stay around if not for CO-OP then I would have stopped playing the game.
Game world: Well designed at times, it has some really great art work created into it. However it get's a 4/10 for regurgitated copy and past over and over and over.
Combat: A bit clunky/bulky and could for sure be more polish, roll dodge needs some work. Balancing of health/stamia in my opinion. Getting stuck in stun locks,dropping off a small ledge or sidwalk could stun/pause you and during combat that is not ok to have in a game. 
Story: Pretty cool story 7/10, execution is very poor 4/10 basic old school design from the 90's early 2000's 
Ward 13 Base: Poor designed and poorly created. 4/10 does not drawl someone in and make them feel at home, needs more details and npc's need more life to them, felt void to me, like the dev team rushed a good portion of design in this game.
CO-OP needs better connection, issues with steam and in game. Overall CO-OP is 7/10 Due to being a linear game, with friends its fun though.
Biome's: 4/10 copy and paste garbage over and over. Sometimes they are created decent, just copy and paste = boring and trash.
Loot: Diablo style loot when you loot crates or destroy items, its gets old real fast farming/grinding scraps, materials for items, well bad design for crafting upgrades overall.

Overall single play I could hardly stand, Linear games are just garbage and boring. This game gets boring real fast. Changing the linear map each time you hit a checkpoint and go back to the ward to reset and change location does not change the fact that each BIOME is copy and paste the same, that to me gets boring real real fast and I lose desire and enjoyment to keep playing, CO-OP was the only reason I could stand to keep playing this game. With Remnant 2 coming out soon, I sure hope they have worked on some things, added more content and make some open world to it, I do not know yet if I will be getting Remnant 2 right away, there are other games dropping this year and I may not have time to get in, maybe if Remnant 1 was more interesting and fun to play solo, again CO-OP kept me hanging in with a thread.

The worst part and a big part of why my group quit is the map changes. The game is typically dark but you get a bright white screen when porting to another map. It doesn't fit the game and quickly becomes an eyesore. Most of the gamers I know gravitate towards dark mode so I was shocked not to see this in more reviews or the forum.,1679927184,1679927184,False,1,0,0.479467242956161499,0,True,False,False

The combat is dynamic and fluid; being able to seamlessly switch between guns and melee does a very good job of making you feel like a bad-ass :)
There's excellent potential for multiple types of playstyle, allowing you to make some very potent character builds once you get past the earlier sections but, you are somewhat limited in the early game as you'll be yet to unlock some of the traits needed for the more powerful builds - patience and perseverance are key here because you'll end up dying, a lot!! :D

Heavy encouragement is placed on exploration which is great for finding rare and cool items and the detailed lore of Remnant; from the Ashes is interesting, rich and imaginative.

I know most folks think of this game as 'Dark Souls with guns' but, I think that's kind of 'under selling' the game as it's more than capable of standing tall in its own right. Personally, I'd consider it more like guns with a strong Dark Souls influence, if you know what I mean!

I will say, it's not all sunshine and roses though!
The early game can be very overwhelming for new players and the game doesn't do a very good job at explaining some of the more subtle and useful mechanics but thankfully, there are plenty of Content Creator videos out there that can be incredibly helpful for tips and tricks.

On the subject of mechanics; I'm afraid I've always considered overly slow, locked animation loops to be an artificial difficulty modifier and it just feels kinda cheap and lazy, adding unnecessary frustration which sours the gameplay experience somewhat.",1679890215,1679890215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is designed to be played with friends, and it goes to great lengths to ensure you would! The randomized mechanic means that despite having the overall same levels and story no two playthroughs are alike. There are some bosses, rooms, rewards, and other things you'll miss when playing through just once, and that's what makes it interesting playing through it with more than one person - it always feels like there's still more game to go around. Even if you managed to kill a boss once before, killing it in different ways yields different rewards! While the environments and enemy designs are superb, this game shines in combat. There's a rather large pool of weapons that all feel distinct enough to make you experiment, and swapping out mods feels like just enough variety to not be overwhelming, yet involved enough to be impactful. Using all 3 weapons to slowly close the gap between you and the monster while avoiding its attacks gets you in a rhythm that's satisfying to pull off and doesn't feel tiring.It's a bit short, but it makes up for length with replayability.

And I'm not great at aiming with a controller and that's how I like to play soulslikes, so this game is very hard for me.  However, I like that.  Plus, if you have trouble with a boss, you can just switch to arcade mode without losing any progress and get more levels, currency, armor, weapons, upgrade materials, number of heals, etc.  How it works is, when you enter into a new area, the enemies, boss, and loot quality correlate to the average of your highest gear levels in each slot (3 armor slots and 3 weapon slots).  So you wanna upgrade, but maybe not too much unless you need to.  You can just play the regular story mode until you get stuck, switch to arcade where you chose the area you wanna run through until you get stuck there, then go back to the story mode right where you left off, then back to arcade where you left off, or just pick another area in arcade, periodically improving your gear as you see fit.  All the while, you're improving your character in plethora of ways.  The boss encounters are randomized a bit too, so you never know which one you'll have to face.  And they all drop a unique weapon mod, which are like special abilities that you can equip on any weapon.  That's how you make a ""build.""  Each armor type gives you a unique bonus to something, and the weapon mods do something uniquely crazy when you activate them.  You get xp, but there's no stats like in Dark Souls.  Instead, you invest these levels/points into different perks which are unlocked by just playing the game in different ways, like destroying enemies in certain ways a certain amount of times or talking to a specific character.  The perks are things like health, stamina, damage, crit chance, xp boost, etc.  Each weapon feels and sounds very unique.  It's very satisfying.

It was fun to figure out the puzzles and try to come up with build synergies.  I read several places that the last boss was giving people problems, but we absolutely dumpstered it.  Maybe because we were on Normal or maybe it was nerfed at some point but it was a walk in the park either way.  I see some potential for replayability at some point.  Not something we want to dive right back into immedietely but I could see us coming back to this in the future.

The writing and story are vague and so grandiose that I couldn't care. The weapons and armor are given so sparingly that rewards feel empty. Some enemies feel like they're just spamming AOE damage and status effects at you to where it doesn't feel engaging, making the dodge and melee mechanics feel underutilized.
Adding to that is you can only fire your guns when aimed down the sights with right mouse button, left mouse button will always melee. This leads to dozens of awkard engagements where your character doesn't do what you want them to and you get locked in animations for seconds at a time, taking damage that you can't easily recover. I also had massive input lag throughout the game, meaning I had to press the attack buttons 5 to 6 times in order to actually do something. This made the awkward controls and animations a nightmare.
I wondered what all the game had in it, then after 13 hours it was just over. And the final boss wasn't very good. Most of the bosses are reskinned enemies with more health or sometimes a decent fight with manageable damage. Then the final boss one shots you with every attack. On top of that, the story has you searching for an enigmatic character the whole game across multiple worlds, and then you meet him in a toilet in a basement and he says 4 sentences to you and then you never see or hear from him again.

[b]What It Is:[/b]
Remnant: From the Ashes is an insanely well made, well paced, and difficult shooter for the souls-like fans out there. While it strays somewhat far from the formula and more into the territory of a looter-shooter than a souls-like it does so in a manner that keeps you coming back for more.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Dive into procedural worlds where around the next corner monsters are waiting to eat your shins and smash your skull. Challenge yourself to find tons of unique weapons and armors, each with stat boosts and special abilities. Cast spells, summon turrets, and defeat an ultimate evil.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Somewhere between Bloodborne and DS3. Not soul crushing, but it should give you a challenge, especially the new dungeon mode.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
I honestly wouldn't have minded seeing them push this further, I think the graphics are good but could be better. The world is lost in a lot of muddled color sometimes, which is why Earth is probably my favorite zone.

[b]Audio:[/b]
It's not anything special, the cues are nice, and the voice acting is passable.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
Pretty high, with a myriad of weapons and armors to collect. Above that there is now the roguelite mode which is a whole other beast in and of itself.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
Its everything you could really want in a game like this.

[b]What I Don't[/b]
The DLC just wasn't that good in my opinion. I was pretty wholly unimpressed by it, and if it wasn't for the saving grace of the roguelite mode I could almost say pass on all the DLC.",1577761295,1679439276,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Warning:I think I am half way through the game. I have just gotten the beast heart 
OVERALL
This game is like dark souls but instead of swords there are guns. You have stamina management, limited healing items, classes, fodder enemies, and boss set pieces. It kinda sucks... 

Like the guns feel amazing to shoot the game looks good and I really like the style. The VA I chose for my character is Lee from the walking dead who also voices a NPC which is a little weird. but like it kinda sucks. Its really fun I am going to finish it but the common enemies are kinda boring and the level design bounces between maze like blehg areas that are really ugly and have nothing. To interesting areas with cool areas that flow and reward exploration. The lore is cool but kinda told through that dark souls manor where you have to read item descriptions and lore notes(not in DS but here)if you like it you like it. I personally don't really but I still am enjoying the story. The enemies again range from cool and interesting to boring and uninteresting to fight. Exploring the areas become extremely samey areas that are a slog to get through where you just wanna move on and see the new shit. It seriously sucks and I had to start watching something while playing because it got so boring. When I checked something online it implied that it was randomly generated. I am doing a blind play through so if it is, maybe don't do that. kinda sucks for the ""campaign"". 

THE BOSSES 

Man bosses are what I play souls games for. The feeling of fighting a huge impassible enemy that is imposing and demands your attention is amazing.  Especially when the game play matches the art design. Which it doesn't... I have fought probably 10 bosses so far. They range from bleh to decent. Its been a ranged enemy with minions that are annoying to fight or a big hulking tyrant that dies quickly. The boss moves suck and are unfun to deal with. The minion fights are annoying as the movement in this game is sluggish and not fun to play with. So fighting 5+ enemies at once is frustrating. I've moved onto a sniper build to try and wipe them out as quick as possible. which has moved onto a new problem. The boss have such low health pools. The bosses just overall suck. The only boss so far I liked was the fat boy whos weak point is that dumptruck he calls an ass, the swamp thing before the beast heart, and the tree was funny. 

THE GUNS
They cool, wish there was more. The mods,upgrading, the resources, its all very good. but the gun variety kinda suck doe. Maybe I am still really early on but the enemies don't drop guns. So you have to find them like armor but I have only gotten like 3-4 guns. There are boss weapons but they have been either melee weapons(useless IMO) or close ranged weapons. Its kinda lame as someone who uses long range weapon. I do fully explore so I shouldn't be missing them all. 

CLOSING 
This game, when its good,is awesome and I vibe with it. When its not I just get bored and give up. Seriously exploring the world being fed more money thats worthless cause the game is not hard enough to warrant buying items or upgrade materials that are worthless because the game has only given me 10 weapons that I already upgraded.

The goods
- Unlike dark souls the co-op feels pretty seamless and good
- The game runs pretty good as well ( on max settings i got 200+ fps consistently )
- Starting class does not mean anything past the first like 2 hrs so there is no worrying if the class is meta or what not

The bads
- The amount of copy and paste for areas is crazy, literally felt so confused and lost at times
- Insane amounts of reused enemies, sometimes a basic enemy will be a boss
- There really isn't much build variety at all
- Ridiculous amounts of loading screens, they cut up the map into small sections with ""gates"" or something that you use to go into the next area which leads to an insane amount of time using them

As far as positives go i can say the following; it looks pretty good and has decent art direction in parts while running reasonably well. The sound design in general ranges from solid to good and the voice acting is decent. That's pretty much it.

The list of negatives is much larger. In general maps are too big and barren for the amount of enemies in them. Exteriors are too flat looking and feel like someone drew a big plane in an editor and then just started plopping down assets without ever considering verticality (beyond prefab building interiors) or set dressing. There are too few enemies in general, too few enemy types as well. Pickup models are tiny and generic and the structure of map generation creates lots of laborious travel that would not otherwise exist.

The result is oftentimes long walks slowed down by the limitation of stamina regeneration only to find a lackluster fight and loot that isn't exciting, or most of the time, nothing at all. The entire game would have benefited from being scaled down by at least a third spatially (barring interiors).

For some reason there are multiple resting points where there are enemies so close by you either immediately enter combat upon leaving the bonfire or get dragged into a fight just as you're trying to rest and the procedural generation results in combinations between bosses and arenas that can end up being frustrating due to the lack of space.

In multiplayer only one player can access a vendor at a given time and co-op only progresses the campaign for the host.

There is never any sense of an increase in difficulty when fighting enemies, if the player goes along the expected path and upgrades their gear to the appropriate level of whatever part of the game they're in player damage and enemy health are always the same relative to one another, you never have the satisfaction of going through a previously difficult area and experiencing the fruits of your labor, clearing this area out with ease, experiencing the contrast between how weak you were and how strong you are now. Enemies nearly invariably either die in 1 to 2 hits (of a shotgun) or take an ammo dump. There is no in between. Resources are so abundant that you never end up having to revisit an area and never run into a situation where you feel the need to upgrade your gear. Nor would you want to revisit them considering how grating traversal can get.

 - There is no depth to the rpg systems beyond picking synergetic weaponry, mods and whatever bonuses can be acquired through sets and trinkets.

 - The UI has bizarre spacing issues, with armor set bonuses cut off in the shop menu and a mini map that is at times barely readable.

 - The ""you are dead"" screen looks like it was made in MS paint and appears for all of a second with deep quotes you can't read fast enough.

 - Melee and and rolling animations are sluggish and unresponsive.

The building blocks for an alright game are here, the idea, a sketch, but all the nuance of difficulty, reward and the resulting fun a game is supposed to have is lost except for few fleeting moments where the game throws a great deal of enemies at you because the balance between these elements that are supposed to work in tandem is all wrong, ironically for a game built on procedural generation this game comes out as though it was made by an AI as a whole.",1654633637,1679320840,False,1,0,0.478057295083999634,0,True,False,False

It feels as though the core gameplay was designed and the developers thought they'd just go back and fill in the blanks with some story telling...except they just never got around to it or didn't want to in the first place.  NPCs never had anything new to say.  I kept waiting for some sort of interaction or development and it just never came. There is *zero* character development.  And I mean zero.  You could remove all the NPCs from the game and just have the player interact with a magical console UI menu for items and I don't even think the game would suffer that much for it.  

I don't even think they stock any new items throughout the game, which makes me wonder why they even had vendors in the first place.  If an NPC is going to carry 3 items all game you might as well just give them to the player.  I kept waiting for the home base to feel more alive but nothing ever changes- it's just as boring as the moment you set foot in it in the beginning of the game.

The game operates like a souls game. Down to healing mechanics and stamina. However, the gunplay is still really good. You will need to dodge to avoid damage, as many enemies have ways of rushing or forcing you to move.

Visual design is really well done. Audio is weighty and stimulating. Designs are stylized, but still realistic enough where you know how things realistically function. One thing I will note on with design is that I love the way that weapon appearances change based on what weapon mod you have. 

The story's a bit meh, to be honest, but I don't play for that. I play to mess around in a sandbox of guns, weapon mods, and builds. The bosses are engaging and are each unique. Once you've faced them, you'll know which boss is which.

This game can be fun in both solo and multiplayer. If you want your achievements to track, though, you will need to set up an Epic Games account, and tie it to Remnant. I found out the hard way that if you don't... then you won't be able to get certain difficult ones.
There is a moderate form of PVP... sort of. You can shoot each other, and use mods against each other, but it's not really intended as a PVP game. There are some people who grief others by killing them over and over when they are clearly higher levelled... but they are the extreme exception. Not the rule.

Speaking of them, most achievements are tied to RNG. Like the one for Reggie's Ring, or Ace's coin. However, most of the difficult ones are a testament to time investment or skill, as with the Dominator and Fashion is Danger. 

The DLCs have their own unique additions that supplement the game. Each has unique armor (with their unique perks & playstyles) and plot relevance, which I will not spoil, but I will encourage you to get them as well. The only downsides to the Resium DLC is the fact that there is only one world boss and Clementine. 

There are three modes: Survival, Story, and Adventure. Story and Adventure are basically the same, with a few differences. Adventure is basically a mini story mode, gameplay wise. It sets you up with one world instead of going through them all. That way if you want something, you can farm for it.

Survival is a completely different game. It feels weird that they are in the same package. The gunplay and everything is the same, but it's a time trial. You are constantly against the clock, racing to level up your character by killing enemies, and gathering loot from chests (this is not how it works in the main game). You use what you have to beat the boss, and go back to the hub, restock, buy armor and upgrades you want, before continuing. It's the truest test of skill. Beating 10 bosses in a run is extremely difficult, which is why I practiced until I did. If you want to test yourself, that is how you do it.

Everything you do will eventually get you new guns, gear, traits and mods. These change how you play, and I am still missing some things. The Siphon trait is, frankly, really difficult to get.

That's where the biggest design flaw of the game is. RNG. Runs are completely randomly generated. Which can be good, as you'll get a new experience every time, but sometimes you're searching for one specific thing, and just can't get it due to the RNG involved. The Siphon trait is an example of this. You need to get two specific spawns in Resium to occur at the same time in a world, and I've never had that happen. 

Other than RNG, the game is your sandbox. And that's it's biggest strength. Whether you make yourself invulnerable through armor, steal health with siphon builds, make your explosives cause massive damage, freeze your enemies to a standstill, or build your own army of summons, you can do a lot. And that is what this game does for the player. Makes you, a normal souls-like character, but with guns and awesome powers.",1679219186,1679219186,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Remnant fails at most fundamental aspect of souls-like games: challenge. Don't get me wrong, content can be difficult, but it is difficult in extremely cheap manner. The way game creates challenge is by constantly throwing avalanches of enemies at you. It doesn't matter how systemic and methodical you are in cleaning levels out of enemies from floors, cellings, etc, 1 minute later swarm of them will materialize out of thin air anyway, likely behind your back, likely led by elite-damage-sponge. 

Now, ambushes in themselves aren't bad design. However, this game is huge conga line of ambushes, or ambush-fiesta, or Dark Souls 2 2, or whatever You want to call it. This results in very tiring and boring experience of constatly getting ambushed no matter what you do, where you go. As a result, level design, structure and enemy placement doesn't mater, because most of them will be just thrown at you from literal nowhere. The fact that less than 4 hours in you start feeling recycling of assets or entire level sections, doesn't help.",1679216295,1679216295,False,1,0,0.476190507411956787,0,True,False,False

I might have had a bit of a chip on my shoulder with previous review. Which I will leave below for historical purposes and entertainment value : )

----

This is NOT a souls game, in my opinion. A good souls-like game allows you to upgrade and/or use skill to succeed. It's a very fine point. I just feel like I have to keep dying to upgrade, or else it's impossible to pass. You can't possibly pass a level without constant ""LEVELING"". It's impossible. There's no skill in it outside of upgrading your character, and that doesn't feel gratifying because anyone can do that. 

Also, the first time I played through, the first couple levels were very hard, on regular ""Hard Difficulty"" but then at some point I just started walking through the whole game. It just got super easy and I killed every boss on the first try. 

Maybe good for children.

Is it fun? Yeah, ok.

Is it addictive? Yeah, sure.

Good graphics and art? Yeah, pretty cool.

The story is not that good, badly explained and badly narrated, and badly prepared. But I know the strong point of the game is not the story, but the gameplay mechanics and maps. So if you're into actions and exploring, this game is for you. Do not expect good story here. MINOR SPOILER!

Pros:
+Battle is good. You can dodge incoming attacks like in Dark Souls. Core combat is also good.
+Map Variety : Map is randomly generated, so no experience is exactly the same, just roughly different. 
+Different Loots: Since map is randomly generated, so does the loot - different for each map, so you can either play alone to explore map and loot, or join others to get loots.
+Boss battle is amazing! Fighting the boss on normal difficulty makes you adore the small stuff, like their attacks and rolls. Fighting them in harder difficulty proves a more challenging fight , but rewarding and very satisfying. So it's a challenging one!
+No weapons are too good / you can use any weapon that suits your playstyle, and upgrade them and use mods that fits your playstyle. Everything is roughly balanced. Sniper is strong long distance, but reloads everytime you shoot and bad facing multiple enemies. Assault rifle is mediocre, all around, good in any close-up general situations, but does not dish out damage as close-combat shotgun or sniper.
+Weapon MODS are good, they give special skill, like summoning minions, thunder storm rage, fire bullets, acid throws, and so on.
+Multiplayer browser is really useful.

CONS:
-Story is lame. badly explained, no clear ending, maybe it was explained bits here and there. But overall I am a bit dissapointed.  Story is short, however, so players can focus on the gameplay itself not the story.
-Maps too limited, like 3-4 themed maps (ruined earth, scorched dessert, magical forest). Please add more, and DO NOT MAKE THEM DLC like the swamp one! But if so, I dont mind purchasing since this game is awesome and I want to support it. Recommended map theme: frozen, another themed city, housing areas, etc. Please make also allied NPC to fight alongside of us, just to spice up the game, also not every map has them. make it a rare chance.
-More details to the environment, please. Such as posters, debris. Reference: Rainbow Six Siege, fallout 4.
-More NPC involvement, please. Such as: delivering items with NPC, NPC that was rude towards you -- then turned good after you finished the campaign. Unlocked additional dialogue on main NPCs after the campaign is over.
-Lack of additional after campaign content ; example: a room on your own, elevator in base fixed, base is upgraded/cleaner/brighter or more guards posted/more NPC, base gate is opened and you can explore a bit outside, and so on.
-Multiplayer lag / p2p connection is a nightmare. If you are connected to the person who has lag or high ping, you will have  a really hard time evading the enemy because timing is crucial in this game.

CONCLUSION:
Overall this game delivers the core-gameplay very good and executed beautifully, but needs more polishing on details (such as environments and NPCs, added small details) and story aspects (clearer information about what happened, or perhaps a narration at the end to explain what is going on). If you're looking a game focuses on battling enemies, good battle mechanics, action game, with a bit of exploring and looting, this game is for you.

Recommended to get on sale. Seriously. I do not recommend to buy at full price. Gameplay variety is very low -- you just shoot, loot and battle (basically 1 game type). In GTAV, you got tons to do.

one major flaw i think is the fact that 90% of bosses have some kind of ads, and half those bosses are basically just the ads. i know that you need a way to replenish ammo to the players, but there are fights without ads where ammo is given and it feels perfectly fine that way. plus the player enemy scaling makes the game way harder with multiple people, because everything one shots you, even the ads.

generally though it's pretty good. looking forward to remnant 2",1647389534,1677866683,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Watched some reviews and game play and I was sold. Bought it during a winter sale, vanilla game. Dark Souls meets a 3rd person shooter??? um......yes please.

The game uses the Dark Souls template. Stones (Bonfires), Dragon hearts (estus), exciting boss fights and some incredible settings. 

Pros-
-Game is at its best when you have a full squad of three (interesting I know). I did a run through solo and It was enjoyable but not anywhere near as fun with some mates. Things get more interesting like how teamwork and strategy actually make a difference because enemies hit a lot harder. 

-Multiplayer works. Simple and overlooked I know. But the formatting of menus makes finding friends or public games super simple. You can join them no matter where they are in the map (they do need to spawn you in so to speak)

-REPLAYABILITY. THIS. THIS IS WHAT MAKES THIS GAME AWESOME. The maps, bosses, loot, quests are constantly being changed and shuffled. Your walk through will be different then your buddy's. I'm just at the 40 hour mark and I faced several bosses that I had not faced when I jumped into a friends game. This was so cool to see and I hope to see more games take this approach. At roughly 40 hour I have done three walk throughs. One solo and two with a full squad.

Classic Customisation- At the start you choose one of three characters. There isn't a lot of difference between the three. Starting weapon, outfits and where a few traits (skill points, perks) go into. As the game progress you unlock more and more traits to define your characters roll. Want to be a tank and smash things with a hammer? You got it. Want to be a gunslinger who crits all day long? yup. Sniper? of course. Run and Gun? oh ya baby. Not to mention the weapon mods that give you ability's like teleport or load fire rounds into your weapon.

Controls- Controls feel crisp. Hard to describe. No lag, delay, animation wait. When you want to roll, you roll. When you reload you reload. Trivial I know. But this game plays amazing (played on mouse and keyboard). 

Cons-
Story- Welp................... there is none. This was heart breaking. The world your thrown into is amazing. Visually stunning. Many cool and interesting characters that fit into what I thought would be a narrative. As the game went on I realize that nothing was going to happen. That's it. Nothing happens from a story perspective. I could literally explain the ""story"" in three sentences.

Difficulty Spikes- Really weird. Some bosses are extremely hard and others are a breeze. Very little consistency. Playing one boss solo is easy, playing same boss same difficulty with a squad becomes and brick wall. Would recommend playing on normal or hard. But re roll campaigns and adventures to a higher difficulty

Boss formula is the same- After you have played the majority of bosses there flash begins to wear off. Most of the fights include big baddy who one shots you accompanied by mobs/adds. Forcing you to face trash instead of the cool boss.

Final rating is 7/10. Really fun game and am glad to have played it. Should it be in everyone's library? No, I don't think so. I could see how this game isn't for everyone. If you enjoy the souls format or enjoy an above average challenge, then yes it is worth playing. If your a strictly story driven gamer then stay clear at all cost because there is none. The setting, combat and gameplay are what makes this game awesome.",1611214063,1677622128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is difficult but not unfair, where your progression feels like a true accomplishment not a given. The story and enemies are wonderfully weird, boss fights are on a grand scale and exhilarating, with interesting mechanics - and there are so many! There are a few in depth systems to learn to really get the most from it, like any good action RPG, but this is at its heart a shooter.

Enemy and gear variety is on a scale rarely seen anymore, emphasising different builds and approaches to different biomes.

The visuals hold up really well, and performance is great. 

If you can get a friend or friends involved, all the much better - my only tip if you‚Äôre going to coop - is to do yourselves a favour and look up how scaling works in this game, as it‚Äôs a bit unique (abstract) as the upgrade system  scales your difficulty experience.

True random level generation and the ability to reroll your two gameplay modes: campaign and adventure mode (which mashes a bunch of levels in a biome to create a new series of dungeons) as you please, means endless replayability. 

I‚Äôm 30 hours in, playing mostly on Hard (the second of four difficulty levels) and I‚Äôm about 1/2 way through the campaign by all accounts, playing a mix of campaign and adventure mode with a mate.

If I had to describe this game in 3 words they would be: Uninspired, average, repetition.

Lets get more into it this time. The game is a bit of a knock off of a lot of things. But most of all Darksouls. Instead of flames and camp fires, you have large crystals, and literal crystal campfires. No shame in taking inspiration from something but this game feels like its best parts are all borrowed.

In the first level its a very uninspired world. Its like someone took the concept of the Fallout intros and mixed it with the ruined cities in darksiders. Although instead of demonic stuff taking over and destroying the city its just demonic plants. Not at all like they threw in a little of last of us. It also has sewer levels, very bland plain sewer levels and one of the bosses to this world is just a plant dragon. Again, really 'inspired' here.

So you might expect the next world to be more interesting. Nope. Its a desert, not dull at all. And its full of basicly humanoid mutants with a Mad Maxx vibe. And it has undead flying skulls as enemies, no explaination for it either. Again, not an overused generic idea at all. And then there is the navigation. I dont mind doing things on my own, but there comes a point when a game is just not good at indicating where to go. There is no order by which to do anything but you have to finish some parts to find keys or things to unlock more of the world. This can mean if you miss something or have been everywhere, its a nightmare trying to figure out where you are supposed to go or where you missed something.

Just to illustrate that again I just took the key from the boss and I guess I did not go in order because I ended up in the second to last part of the game. Basicly if you took fawns and put them in a forest with a wookie city from starwars thats all you need to know. I will admit they put more effort into this race than the previous one and I was interested for a while. But again after I explored everywhere, no idea where to go and you can only keep going in circles looking for where you need to go before you get bored. I wish they stole the Deadspace directions indicator but ironicly thats the one thing they didnt ""borrow"".

I looked into some of the other stuff and DLC and again, found it feeling like they just took a little from other people and just cobbled it all together. They have a rat race and they live underground with scaffolding and it in no way makes you think of Vermintide AT ALL. And the ending has a giant that looks like its straight out of Shadow of the Collossus. Now again, no shame in taking inspiration but when your game feels like a patchwork of other peoples games, its kind of shameful. They did make a few original things but the overwhelming things that are just blatantly lifted from other things is just galling. 

And the plot, super generic and they dont even try to explain it. They just keep you running around and drop some lore and references. So apparently... the demonic roots are some kind of.. eldrich alien thing that purges life. It was ""called"" to earth and our ""guardian"" was destroyed. But then you meet a plot explainer god who sends you on your way. The root isnt really on the other worlds as much though the inhabitants say it is. Its all just a jumbled mess and if your willing to turn your brain completely off and get back to the repetitive combat I guess you could enjoy the vauge little that is there.

The creatures you fight are also rather... forgettable save for like maybe one per world. I wont say the game is bad, but it isnt good either. Ive seen other games that do better with less, or have an original idea they run with but this game expects the pretty graphics to distract you from its many flaws. Originally I would have rated this 4.5/10 but after playing most of the game Id give it a 5.5/10. But even if it was 6/10, a 60% on a test is still an F.

I just dont feel like this game deserves as much hype as people are giving it. For every well done or original thing I found, the game managed to do 2 stolen ideas or bad work. And I didnt even touch on the very limited weapon selection, minimal character customization or minimal class selection. The levels looked nice and were well designed at least.

If your going to get this game, get it on sale and expect it to not really stand out much. And to the avid defenders of this game, you can still enjoy a forgettable game. But this game lacks any kind of soul. Its just a husk of frankensteined parts from other better games.",1677104366,1677474554,False,2,1,0.423276990652084351,29,True,False,False

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2811110984
Remnant: From the Ashes (Just Remnant from now) Is a pretty nice 3rd person shooter with great coop gameplay and hardcore difficulty ala a Dark-Souls-Like (i hate this therm tbh) game. It looks great, plays great but can be somewhat grindy sometimes...and unfair brutal hard...

[h1]If the forest fights back...[/h1]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894867855
Remnant opens up as Souls-like 3rd person shooter and you quickly learn one thing: you WILL die. No matter when or how, you WILL die - At the end, we talk about a game where you have to learn and basically ""learning-by-doing"" like nature teaches you how you play the game...the hard way.

Remnant is not an easy game though, if you only play the story mode it can be a short adventure...and on ""normal"" it can be actually pretty easy but i should add here to play it, at least on hard because than the game is actually fun and worth playing. In addition, i would also say go and try to play it with at least a friend (you can play up to 3) because than you can revive each other before someone dies. Though, the game will notice the number of players which means more enemies will spawn and do more damage or have a larger healthpool - this is noticalbe mostly at boss fights where bosses in single player mode can be actually done fairly quick (IF you know the patterns) but in multiplayer, some bosses can be legit a pain in the ass...

[h1]The Randomness and the problem with the grind...[/h1]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2811535093
This ""is"" kinda a problem with Remnant which i would call a double edged sword...
You see, Remnants world is all the time random. You have some ""core"" events happening, at least in the story mode, but next to this, nothing really is ""fixed"". Sure, you have world bosses but even those bosses CAN be random. This ALSO means: it is random what gear you get with your story and this actually forces you to grind on other, so called ""adventure"" runs to roll for items you ""might"" get if said event you might need for an item is happening - and sometimes, for some REALLY special things like weapons or armor, you might need even a world rolled which needs 2 OR 3 events to get just ONE thing you might want or need.

The word ""need"" might sounds wrong here though but than, some things for some bosses or enemies might help you a lot more than other things you do or ""dont"" have right now...and this is where i say it feels like a double edged sword because it can feel like a grind sometimes because some things are really hard to get, like really really hard and only with pur luck if remnant gives you basically a good world seed. 

But this also means sometimes, you might just stroll though your said world seed, another time you get literally nothing. It feels like this could be handled better and only ""extends"" the playtime for the grind but than again, with friends, it is still fun.
ALONE in the other hand it can really feel like a chore sometimes...

[h1]Do i still recommend it though?[/h1]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2931402682
I Still would recommend remnant [b]but only and i really mean ONLY if you play it at least with a friend and not alone.[/b] Its an overall good game and fun to play, if even hard. Again, its a souls like game and you should always remember that, its not just any 08/15 3rd person space shooter or something. [b]it is legit a hard shooter where you have to learn your movement and read and learn the enemy patterns.[/b] Else you will just die.

So if you enjoy hard games like said dark souls but just as 3rd person shooter and havea friend with you which might would enjoy to play with you coop, give it a go. It can legit be fun to play, even more if you get the DLCs which add more stuff to ""farm"" and go for.

[b]Recommended - a nice and hard souls-like 3rd person shooter. Best enjoyed with a friend or 2. Alone it might be not really enjoyable and the nature of the game with the random world seeds CAN feel like a grind sometimes so be warned about that.

The game also looks gorgeous with a great range of environments to play through.

Like two bosses one left and one right on a small bridge and you get flung of the bridge and die because the devs don't know how to stop you falling off the map.. 

Or a Boss Fight with a guy that throws so much Snow at you that as in many fights you need to heal, but you can't heal and you can't use a potion because if you stop moving you die. 

Don't worry, because you have limited stamina so you will not be able to dodge and then you die!

Not quite a Dark Souls with guns like many people say, more of an actually challenging Warframe or variation of Returnal. Very focused project, almost nothing to distract from the gameplay. The whole thing is a hunting safari around world in a familiar yet well executed fantasy+sci-fi setting. Your character, gear, abilities vs enemies and bosses in pretty environments, that‚Äôs it. There is kind of a story/lore, but it‚Äôs nothing special, easily skipped with no consequences. A bit rough around the edges with some design decisions tho and takes a whole long as5 first act to ramp up the fun factor and give more options to play around with. After that it‚Äôs smooth sailing, super addicting to hunt for gear, explore, shoot. DLSs are a must, imo, especially if you like the core gameplay loop. Adds a bunch quality content and QoL features. Coop simultaneously is great yet annoying. The most noticeable is difficulty scaling.

""Souls with guns"" but their design decisions are different enough to be its own thing. 

Movement feels pretty clean, you can slide under and spot dodge attacks and it looks/feels cool. 

Build diversity gets into arpg levels of nutty where you can one shot the game with every type of dmg. 

Boss fights kinda suck because they throw trash at you the whole time for every boss but you learn to deal with it. 

Visually the game is phenomenal. The first zone makes you think its gonna be this generic destroyed city the whole way through but nah. 

A few puzzles throughout the game to give its dungeons a lil spice

for some reason the first boss that divides itself feels and is more difficult than the rest of the bosses, they made it intentionally difficult so you have to grind some levels in order to advance, all of the rest of the bosses feels so easy, even the one on the bridge....

the world feels linear (cant stress this enough) giving the player not many things to explore, the Map that gets discovered you cant even zoom in so it looks small once you clear it out.

Story/campaign is SO BORING, couldnt care for the story to be honest, also as you get close to the endgame the cutscenes and dialog just drops in quality. you'll see this even with the final boss first cutscene, like where did the assets go?
Compared to other ""souls like games"" this has nothing like that, the grind is boring, mechanics are not interesting, the guns and armor sets dont really matter, you can upgrade the 1st gun to the max and dont care about the other ones. Starting Class adds no benefit at all, it only gives you armor and weapons that you can buy later on from a shop.

You can also ""cheat"" at the very start of the game by getting some knowledge tomes and re-roll campagin (basically start over with all your items etc) get the tomes again, rinse repeat.

-Really fun to play with friends
-Lots of love and detail put into the worlds, lore, enemies and assets
-Always something new to find with the randomly generated worlds and encounters

I Can't even begin to describe how much content is in this game, and how much I love it. 

People were so quick to brush this gem under the rug, coining it 'another souls-like' and moving on- but it's genuinely so much more than that! 
Sure, you can equip rings for bonuses, there are armour sets, boss fights with fog walls, etc. But this game has so much depth to it. More than people may give it credit for. 

I try to rope new friends into this game any chance I get. The endless discoveries, the extensive world lore, the new encounters? All of it is so much fun, and a genuine delight to dabble in with company. Down to the combat being fun and varied, to the different story paths you can choose, and especially down to no detail left untouched when it comes to the story and settings. 

This game has so much genuine love and care put into it. Whether you just want to shoot at some sentient trees, fight with bug people, or just want a little co-op game to kill time with, I genuinely recommend it. 

Very much enjoyed in co-op, absolutely ideal. But if you just want to play on your lonesome, there's no harm there either! Give the game a shot if you like 3rd person shooters and souls-like gameplay. You won't regret it.",1675587469,1675587469,True,20,1,0.71737825870513916,0,True,False,False

Game is very good, but that first Gorefist fight, if doing it solo, was absolute gaming cancer.  My 16 year old did it and he felt the same, got him about 10 times...and he's a Souls addict.  We did it together on a new play through and the two of us pasted him the first try.

So yeah, the game's good.  If you try it and get killed 15-20 times or so on Gorefist on your first playthrough, take heart:  you weren't the first, and you won't be the last.

Ultimately, Division 2 was one of my favorite games...and this is sorta like this, if it had a baby with a Souls game.  I've always felt that Souls games were simply too difficult for my old ass, but I'm managing pretty well now for the most part.

(1/28/23)This might be a great game, but after dying to gorefist for over an hour with level 2 gear score trying to get to the first destination, I'll never know.  To hell with this game, I don't play games to be angry.

The game itself is absolutely solid, though. The vibes are immaculate, I haven't really seen an apocalyptic scenario using trees and roots, it's interesting, unique and allows for varied and fun looking bosses.

 Quick review - a lot better than expected.. 

 If you like the older, 'simpler' xbox 360 type games  (that made a game 'fun' with minimal convolution), then you're going to like this..

 EDIT: - best things about this game is 'solid' feeling shooting AND 'hit-feedback' of enemies - they actually animated their hits if you want a shooting game where you can really 'feel' the enemies getting hit this is the game to get,

 Also - if you're sick and tired of 'looter-shooters' where the biggest enemy in the game is the time you waste constantly sorting and organizing inventory, and want to start supporting games that only give you 'resources' to craft and upgrade a few, but meaningful weapon types - this is the game to get


 (cont.) ...  They didn't pay 100 artists millions of dollars to bedazzle you with high-res characters you can see the pores on their face,

 didn't put in 100s of hours of vocal dialogue, lines of text, or endless 'quests', 

 they simply made a game where you have fun shooting stuff, and a simple yet effective item/gun upgrade mechanic.

 Folks, if you ever played 'Godmode' , (absolutely fantastic game) and loved what a simple yet effective game that was,

 and/or you ever played 'Hellgate - London', where you go around a map 3rd person just shooting stuff etc,

 you're going to love this game.

 This game is NOT some sort of 'souls' like  (why do people keep using that term?  change the vocabulary please..), it's a freakin shooter and one modeled almost exactly after  "" Godmode "".

 Godmode - you select 2 weapons for a stage  (Ashes - 2 weapons up to four), 

 Godmode - you select a 'magic spell' you can use during your mission once 'unlocked' by 'charging' after you kill enough enemies (Ashes, you select a 'special mod' for your weapon, that you can use after charging up, after killing enough enemies)

 Godmode - 1-4 players coop  (Ashes, 1-3 players coop)

 Godmode - Basic, but fun, mission design  (no dialogue or quests other than shooting stuff)   Ashes - no dialogue or quests in the main mission area, there are 'dungeons' though where you might find people   (Note this is based on my limited gameplay experience, but it probably will have few npcs or quests in the main mission areas at most)

 Godmode - Great '3rd person over the shoulder' view, felt slow and clunky to move but once you 'get' it it becomes very fun and satisfying combat, rolls are essential to dodging shots and swarming/flanking enemies. 
  Ashes - 3rd person over the shoulder view, feels slow and clunky to start but once you 'get it' it's very satisfying and fun combat, with rolls being essential to dodge stuff as you get surrounded/flanked and shot at..

 Godmode - you can customize your guy with a basic outfit of hat, shirt, pants and 'accesory'  (all cosmetic but were fun to do to dress up your guy).   
 Ashes - you can customize your guy with a basic outfit of hat, shirt and pants.  They not only look cool but will affect your guys stats.

 etc etc..

 There are a lot of games out there folks and believe it or not just because something isn't a 'cake-walk' doesn't mean it should have the 'dark souls' label slapped onto it..

 (yeah you have campfires, as if other games in the past didn't have a 'rest' spot you could rest in.. )

 Not only that, the 'real' hard awesome brutally challenging game (that had the best melee combat ever made in a game) that truly 'started it all' for awesomeness and difficulty,

 was a game called  "" Severance: Blade of Darkness ""..

 It was far ahead of dark souls both in terms of date of release and also overall awesome game design.

 You can tell Dark Souls copied the crap out of that game because they even ripped a blatant 'skull armor' designed enemy right from it.

 So everyone quit with the Dark Souls meme, and otherwise this game is great especially if you want something to 'relax' to and grind away at,

 just challenging enough to be 'fun' but not overload you with superfluous nonsense loaded in games nowadays like pointless questing, endless dialogues, pointless game mechanics, excessive 'loot' garbage (like the borderlands), nonsense over-done 'graphics' etc etc.

 It also uses a 'fog' map feature which is great, very satisfying for completionists etc.

 (gun design is great too you get few guns but have lots of upgrade options)


 - The game has lots of flaws too but I will write further another day

 (Note if you're really into this type of shooting mechanic try 'Immortal Unchained' , it's a great game and similar to shooting like Ashes but designed for solo deep challenging play with a lot more leveling options for your guy)",1568206845,1675013941,True,10,0,0.554687976837158203,0,True,False,False

Overall this game is a highly refined entertainment experience with immense replay potential.
I appreciate the normal mode is not an easy mode, but a balanced and challenging experience. 
This game must be awesome fun with like minded friends while it respects you as a solo player also.
I appreciate that you can fail bosses repeatedly without having to go through a tedium until you learned the encounter and overcome it. I appreciate the weapon handling, ranged and melee and the manifold playstyle options available. I appreciate the attention to detail in the map design and animations, overall audio production quality and fantastic user interface for controller and keyboard&mouse. I appreciate the constant reward for my curiosity while playing and that the player agency is taken seriously. I appreciate that the game allows me to ease myself into the harder difficulties and gives me all the time i need to learn.
There is so much more to appreciate about Remnant: From the Ashes, especially that while being inspired by a few games of the rpg genre it is built upon its own solid foundations.
There is so much i can be looking forward to repeating the campaign or playing the additional game modes.

Summary: 
Saw that there was a sequel to the game in the works, and being an avid Dark Souls/ Souls-Like fan I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I think overall my experience was a little more negative than most since the game was built from the ground up with CO-OP in mind and I had no one to play with since all my friends are afraid of the Souls-Like Genre. Couple that with the fact that I paid full price and things don‚Äôt look so good. With that being said, there is a hidden gem in this. A hidden masterpiece that just needs a little more time in the oven. As the first recipe, with the way I played it, gave me a sour after taste but the initial flavors where great! I hope the expand the experience, make the worlds a little less bland and tunnel simulator, and more open with more diverse mobs with diverse actions that require the player to think tactically like what Dark Souls and Elden Ring do so well. I have hope for the sequel, but knowing that this is where it came from I will not buy it on day one, rather wait to see what others say and then if my concerns are resolved I will definitely get it. If my concerns are resolved, we might be dealing with a masterpiece.",1674313017,1674313017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like, why did I think it was a good idea to go up against a giant spider monster with only a frying pan for protection? But let's be real, that frying pan is the real MVP of this game.

The graphics will make you feel like you're in a nightmare, but in a good way. Like when you're in the middle of a dream where you're being chased by a giant hotdog but you can't stop eating it because it's so delicious. That's the kind of nightmare I'm talking about.

The gameplay is smooth and the controls are tight, unlike my ex's... well, you get the idea. 
And the bosses? Let's just say they're harder to defeat than my mother-in-law's opinions.

In conclusion, ""Remnant: From the Ashes"" is the game that will make you question your sanity, your cooking skills, and your relationship with your mother-in-law, but it's totally worth it. So grab a frying pan and get ready for a wild ride.

An excellent take on the souls-like genre focusing on skilled gun play and a really unique randomization feature that makes it extremely repayable. Some very fun weapons and armor to discover that let you make several interesting builds. Then top it off with seamless co-op with up to two friends.

The world of Remnant has a really interesting setting with a fascinating story that unfolds over several varied dimensions you explore. It features some great music and amazing sound design as well. Maybe some of the best since the original Dead Space. Reloading an alien pistol never sounded so satisfying with its chirps and whirs. 

My only complaints I have are some minor multiplayer issues such as only one person being able to use a vendor 1 player at a time. It makes sense on vendors with limited stock but on blacksmith and upgrades its a bit annoying. Lastly, If you have some lag issues in multiplayer the Labyrinth can be a frustrating and deadly place.

Is it souls-like? It has a roll button. 
Is it hard? No.
Is it janky? Yes, but in the best way possible.

Few things to note: 
Multiplayer is done through Epic. You will need to sign in and friend all your friends there.
Mission/Story progress is only saved on the host's save. You will only retain the upgrades, gear, and levels your collect and earn if you are not the host.
After logging out for the evening, you will come back to find that the maps for every area, even the ones you've explored, will be covered in fog of war again. So search every area thoroughly before leaving so you don't have to backtrack, you won't know where you've been before.
Default sensitivity is awful and will require adjustments.

All that being said, this is a super fun co-op experience. Connectivity is excellent. Graphically it's very similar to New World. Like most ""souls-likes"" the trash mobs are a walk in the park but some middle to late game bosses are very punishing, requiring a huge amount of team coordination. And honestly? Those fights are what makes it such a good co-op game. You have to talk to each other, devise strategies, and execute perfectly or you will be one shot one by one.

I read the reviews before purchasing and many warned of the late game grind and how tedious and annoying it is. So my friends and I made a pact not to play that portion of the game. Once the story is done, we are done. No grinding, no min-maxing, nothing. In doing so, we are having a fantastic stress free time.

There are no gimmicks involved.
No weird requirements.
No random invasions or PvP to deal with during sessions.
Just pure co-op goodness!

[h1]1) CO-OP 10/10[/h1]
Remnant is [i]actually[/i] a proper co-op game. No joke! The Steam tag, for once, is an accurate reflection of what you're getting with this game.

The co-op implementation in Remnant is so simple and straightforward (praise be!) that, quite literally, even a cave-man could play with friends. It's quick and easy to find and connect to a friend's session and for them to join yours. In non-survival modes, [b]everyone gets the XP from kills and all loot is shared[/b] (not ammunition), so there's no worrying involved in missing something valuable that your friend(s) pick up.

No hassles. Just fun.

[h1]2) LEVEL DESIGN 10/10[/h1]
The game uses an open world design that allows you to jump between fast travel points you discover as you progress through the game. The zones are all very pretty and unique. There are several different biomes to experience, and that can be extended a bit with the DLC. The levels are all big enough to be interesting and fun without being too long that it feels repetitive or a drag to slog through.

There is also some randomness involved. Dungeons and other ""special events"" you can encounter in the world are randomly generated at the time of your character's creation, so no two games will be identical, making the co-op aspect of the game all the more enjoyable.

[h1]3) COMBAT 10/10[/h1]
This is a gun game. If you like to shoot (and kill) things, this game is for you. There's a wide variety of weapons in the game, some you can buy, some you can find and others you'll have to craft with unique boss drops (akin to Dark Souls). The gun play in Remnant feels very satisfying, and I particularly enjoy using the crossbow for its ranged damage and stealth.

The weapons (and mods you can slot in them) offer you a lot of tactical choices to both supplement your gunplay and help overcome hard challenges, and it's not overwhelming. While it may certainly be possible to brute force your way through the game with the same 3 weapons, there are situational advantages to using certain weapons or mods, which makes having those weapons and mods in the game meaningful. They are not merely superfluous additions or there to satisfy playstyle choices.

[b]The boss fights in particular are very well designed and feel balanced[/b]. Most are difficult but none are impossible, even if they might initially seem that way. As with any well designed boss fight, discovering the right strategies and tactics to defeating them is part of the joy of the fight, and that often involves figuring out weakness or thinking creatively about which weapons or mods can give you an advantage. As a result, you will emerge from many a fight with a great sense of satisfaction.

[h1]4) MOVEMENT/TRAVERSAL 8/10[/h1]
This is one area where I think the game could be improved. Movement by no means feels bad, but it can feel a tad slow, in part because running into things or dropping off ledges (ie the environment) interrupts your sprints. As such, I found myself frequently mashing my run key to try to run again only to frustratingly toggle between run and walk. This could be done better so it feels more fluid.

Additionally, I don't like the use of stamina during open world traversal. It serves no purpose other than to slow you down every few seconds, and there's no joy in that. It's micromanagement at a nuisance level. Stamina, and all implementations like it, should only ever be used when in combat. Not for getting around.

[h1]5) STORY 10/10[/h1]
The story in Remnant is delivered in bits and pieces from the NPCs you interact with and, very often, notes or journals you encounter as you explore the world. It is a fantastically dark tale with a lot of mystery weaved in that at times can be hard to follow. But it feels nonetheless rewarding when you begin to understand what's going on and develop a mental picture of all the characters, events and timelines involved.

The voice acting is also very well done, and all the NPCs you interact with are voiced over. They did not skimp in this regard. You get your moneys worth and more.

[h1]TLDR;[/h1]
I highly highly recommend this game, particularly if you're looking for a fun co-op to play with friends. I well and truly cannot think of another game I have enjoyed as much with friends and without any problems to speak of. Very much looking forward to the release of Remnant 2 to continue the fun. Well done, Gunfire Games!",1673888287,1673888287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing about Remnant really stands out positively for me and I think that's the biggest issue with the game: This is the most ""Mixed"" game I've played in recent memory. Unless you just want to replay the story endlessly, there's not much bang for your buck here. It's a decent co-op experience, but there's better and cheaper options out there.

The best thing I can say about this is just how smooth the co-op experience is overall. In fact, it's best played strictly co-op with friends because trying to pub it was tedious and slow. Your friends can follow you through any zones and repeat bosses will drop needed crafting materials instead of their usual unique drop for them (each weapon can only be crafted once). The spawning mechanics really drag down the experience with pubs though because you can't spawn until the host touches a checkpoint. Even though you'll get everything the living players picked up while you're spectating, you might be sitting there for 10+ minutes watching them fumble through the zone, with no camera controls or map access. 

The developers designed for the campaign to be replayed multiple times because of how many randomized bosses spawn throughout the zones. Each boss has a unique drop which you can use to craft a weapon or skill token back at the hub. While it's a cool concept on paper, trying to farm for a specific drop is a pain because (again) of how the multiplayer works. You can't just drop your summon sign outside of a boss room and hope the host summons you into a fight you need. An Adventure mode was added in a post-launch patch that allows you to ""reroll"" a region, creating a randomized slice of that area without resetting your whole run. You might get what you're looking for in that 30-45 minute run or you might get all repeat bosses. I didn't really enjoy these though because I felt it cheapened the experience and I didn't find much new.

The campaign's length was the biggest disappointment for me. I heard Remnant was short but I reached the last boss in under eight hours even with trying to do all the side content. If you have someone carrying you through you could probably finish it in under five hours. There's little reward for finishing on higher difficulties and the DLCs don't seem popular either. I could go on about how annoying some areas and enemies were, but you can blaze through this quickly enough that it doesn't really matter.

If you're the type of person like my brother who is content to grind the same game for hundreds of hours just to watch some numbers go up, you'll get your money's worth out of this. I'll probably replay it again co-op if a friend picks it up but I was thoroughly unimpressed by Remnant. It's not a bad game, but it just feels like a directionless, outsourced product instead of a memorable experience. The devs will need to decide what they want the sequel to be and improve the multiplayer from there.",1673841728,1673841728,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The Bosses in this game ALL suck, having a zillion mobs while fighting them is not good difficulty, its just bad design.
- This game should NOT have a random generated map. Its not a Roguelike, its an RPG.
- Along with the map generation I find it baffling that they decided to have weapons, armor, merchants and other NPCs to be random. ""Oh you didn't get that quest or weapon you were looking for? just reroll the campaign and start over"" WTF, What an awful design choice.
- Other complaints include repetitive gameplay and maps on the long run (mainly because of the randomness), hardcore mode being permadeath instead of something more interesting, etc.

The reason why in spite of all that I still recommend it is because I really had a lot of fun and I believe its a great adaptation of a Soulslike to a shooter.

This game was no where close in my radar until one of my friends showed me it while the game was on sale. I picked it up and absolutely do not regret it. 

Playing the campaign solo does provide some challenges (my first boss in my first play through was Gorefest and took some time), but having a buddy or two definitely makes things more enjoyable. Lots of bosses, lots of loot, fantastic gearing/leveling system, great multiplayer system, and lots of replayability. 

Linux performance is really good. In using proton 7.0-4 and GE Proton 7-37, I get around 90-120fps on medium setting using a System76 Gazelle Laptop (model from year 2021, upgraded to 32GB RAM). However, when I play in a multiplayer session, performance is good and all of the sudden, my performance will tank and I‚Äôll get 2-3fps, making it unplayable. It seems that using the Hide NVIDIA GPU launch option (PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=1 %command%) helps a bit in that I get 15-25fps when my performance tanks in certain areas. When loading into new areas, performance restores to normal. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs something within proton itself that‚Äôs causing this with no fault from Gunfire Games.

Here is my solo experience. I played the game on normal. The game in the beginning was challenging, but when you get use to the mechanics dodging grunts and using area of affect attacks make it rather easy. I made the mistake of using the same gun almost the entire game. Please do not make the same mistake. There are better weapons out there.

While the grunts are easy, the bosses are never alike. They all have a variety of attacks and need a variety of counters in order to win. I have found the grenade launcher mod combined with a snipers critical shot potential was a pretty fair was of defeating bosses. 

I feel like the games story was not all that great. It was all based around sacrificing other peoples values to complete the story and defeat the final boss. You as the main protagonist was rather an antagonist for some dimensions. Some made you the antagonist by force. The only realm you will save is your own and one other. The others are just screwed.

Though I did not play with any friends during my campaign I did get the innate sense that this game would be rather entertaining to play with friends. Lots of quick reaction moments and boss fight deaths that could have been prevented if other players were involved. 

The class system is rather nice. I choose the medium range class, but luckily the game does not prevent you from  using any weaponry of your choice thus I was able to change to a sniper.

Dirty and dinge-y where it needs to be, vibrant and glow-y where it needs to be. The music is also solid, and the sound design is good enough that I feel i can tell where an enemy is going to be coming from. Most importantly though, the gameplay is fun. It feels good dodging hits, getting crits, timing a melee or special use just right to take out multiple guys, it's all good. The build variety is also insane and trying out new builds is a huge draw to the game and it's replayability. The upgrade systems are expansive enough and it will take a looooong time to get everything, but it doesn't feel like a chore to do so.

Currently plying it on hard mode and the world definitely feels challenging.

The post apocalyptic setting is spot on with a defined grand enemy and lots of details that can redirect to the story of ""how we've got here so far"" and the way fast travel has been implemented is very ingenious to fit with the lore.

I thought Outriders was cool, although a bit boring; Remnant is definitely better: fun, challenging, misterious.

Also the coop is well implemented, non intrusive and straight forward (looking at you, Dark Souls).

I'd describe it as a Souls-like but not ""Dark Souls with guns"", it just isn't - there's no death penalty for a start.

One thing it does better than the Dark Souls games is being able to Co-op with a friend through ALL content without being tedious. 

The DLC's aren't anything amazing but there's definitely an increase in the quality of the boss-fight mechanics in the DLC (Subject 29-something). I'm hoping that's a sign that Remnant 2 will keep going forwards with the quality improvements. The formulaic tile/world generation is a little bit samey after a while and I'd love to see a change-up on it. 

I also think Traits need some love so they can make builds a bit more fun and unique as you're progressing. Needing to +20 a trait to see any real effect means you're waiting 20 levels before seeing that pay off. As it stands the weapon Mods and Armor set bonuses are really the thing that make your gameplay feel different and I think Traits could benefit from having the same level of impact.

Sometimes the story reminded me of Secret World/Control with the SCP Foundation-esque type logs lying around the world but I'd say the main story is mostly pretty weak, especially the DLC with its underdeveloped characters. Seeing different worlds and their species is pretty cool though and there's a lot of charm that comes with it. 

Really hoping Remnant 2 either commits to the story more and world-building or it goes fully into the tiny vein of Diablo it's channeling and becomes all about the crazy loot/builds and more FFXIV trial-like boss fights that you get in the DLC.",1673181884,1673182047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wow! What a pleasant and unexpected surprise. I had my eye on this game for a little while now, being drawn in by the world and art style. I almost jumped in solo, but found a friend to play through with.

From the top, many people call it a third person shooter spin on Dark Souls, and that's about as close to the truth as you can get with a simple explanation. I could already gush a long time about this game, but I'll just break down a few of my favorite points, as well as some points that I'm mixed on. I'll try to be spoiler-lite for those who like lore and world in their games.

[h1]LIKED:[/h1]
- [b]COMBAT:[/b] I know this is very general, but the moment to moment combat and gameplay feels very strong. My friend and I started at Normal difficulty, and at first we were worried it was going to be too easy - the first ""areas"" felt incredibly unthreatening. While I'm sure we could have still bumped up the difficulty, Normal difficulty still ramped up to give us a bit of a challenge in the worlds and especially bosses while not being [i]too[/i] sweaty. Keep in mind the i-frames for your dodges are [i]very[/i] forgiving so use your dodges as much as you can. If you want more of a challenge, definitely either play solo or bump up the difficulty once or twice as a group. There ended up being a lot more enemy variety than I expected, the boss fights are mostly very unique and fun, and it just feels good to play. WARNING: Try to figure out what difficulty you want to stick with early on in the game, because I believe you have to re-roll your entire campaign if you want to adjust the difficulty, unfortunately.
- [b]GEAR:[/b] Let's be clear, this isn't a LOOTER SHOOTER. Although the combat loop might play closer to an ARPG, there isn't loot raining from enemies. Loot is curated well by the developers, mainly unlocked from hidden areas, vendors, or drops from bosses, and the worlds themselves are full of basically crafting materials that help you to upgrade your gear. The armors all have different set bonuses, encouraging you to either mix and match for a lot of different passives, or double down on a particular set if you really like a set bonus for your build. Weapons, accessories, and ""mods"" (get to that in a second) are all easily swappable and encourage build experimentation.
""Mods"" are basically your abilities, and they are attached directly to your weapons for the most part. So you're only going to probably have at max a few abilities equipped at a time, but again, since they exist as ""mods"" that can attach to items, they are easily swappable. (There are certain unique mods that are tied to specific weapons/items that cannot be swapped) There are some really really cool abilities attached to different mods, items, weapons, and armors that can create very unique builds depending on your playstyle.
- [b]REPLAYABILITY/CHOICE:[/b] We tried to mainly play through this game blind, but every now and then we would look something up on the wiki if we were confused, and there are a LOT of things in this game that encourage you to replay. For instance, there are entire bosses that will randomly spawn in a playthrough, and in other playthroughs they won't spawn at all. This also happens with random events and side quests. Even with certain bosses, depending on HOW you approach them or defeat them can completely change the encounter or the loot at the end of the fight - you can even outright avoid or cause boss fights, depending on your choices.
However, some people might already be thinking ""aw man, does that mean if I find out about an item/quest/choice that I missed or should have done differently way after the fact, I have to either start the game over completely or wait until my next playthrough?"" Thankfully, the devs thought of this, as well. Without going into too much detail, you can basically ""re-roll"" or ""re-instance"" certain areas specifically for this sort of thing, without affecting the main campaign progress of that character. Awesome.
- [b]LOOOOOORE:[/b] You can just blaze through this game and skip the story if you're not into that sort of thing. A ton of lore is kept in journals, computer terminals, and other things lying around the world. NPCs who have a ton of lore for you even give you a way to skip their dialogue or tell them you're not interested.
However, if you ARE interested, there is a LOT of lore for you to dig into! My friend and I took it slow, read lore bits everywhere we could find them, exhausted NPC dialogue options, and really really enjoyed getting pulled into the world. If you're a fan of eldritch/cosmic horror type stuff like me, you'll probably like this.
- [b]ROGUELITE MODE:[/b] My friend and I pretty much waited for each other to come online before continuing our story progress, but during a lunch break one day I [i]really[/i] had the itch to play more without messing up our co-op progress. That's when I saw the Survival mode. At some point the devs updated the game with a Roguelite mode - start from scratch at a hub world, enter dungeon, fight boss, return to hub world for more upgrades, rinse repeat. It's honestly a lot of fun, and even though you don't carry any of that loot out of the mode, you [i]can[/i] unlock a specific currency that can be used to buy transmog items in the main game. Pretty cool, imo, and yet more awesome replayability.

[h1]MIXED:[/h1]
- [b]MELEE:[/b] With the inspiration this game took from Soulsborne games, I tried to be more melee focused at the beginning of the game. I was actually thinking ammo would run out a lot faster and be a lot more scarce (it might be at higher difficulties), but the melee in this game doesn't feel... great. It's not bad! But at least on Normal difficulty, we found ourselves mostly resorting to ranged stuff and only using melee when I was in a bad spot or needed to push through a couple enemies to get more ammo. Some melee weapons feel better than others, though, so it's possible it just didn't click with me. Someone who possibly focuses on a melee focused build might enjoy it better, but I do hope they work on the overall feel of melee combat for the sequel. (Note: After playing the game more, I feel a bit more positive on this aspect, but I still do hope they improve on melee in the sequel.)

[h1]DISLIKED:[/h1]
- [b]CO-OP STORY PROGRESSION:[/b] This is not an issue that affected me personally, but I wanted to mention it since I found out about it. Co-op progression seems to only be tied to the HOST of that session. Yes, connected friends will unlock items and character progression that will remain persistent, but if they return to their own world, none of that story progress will count. My friend and I only played when we were both online so this wasn't an issue for us, but it's something to keep in mind.

Will update this review once I'm done with the main campaign and maybe dabble with DLC, but all in all this game was a wonderful surprise and I'm greatly enjoying it. I honestly think it's probably worth it at full price. If it's on sale and you're on the fence, I highly recommend it even more.",1672708157,1673105454,True,14,0,0.689997851848602295,0,True,False,False

I found it on Xbox Game Pass a few years ago, and since then I've played it over and over on multiple platforms, recruiting friends to join me for 3 person co-op and spreading the fun that this game provides with as many people as possible. This title is so much more than ""Dark Souls with guns."" 

Remnant combines the souls-like formula with rogue-like elements in a way that feels endlessly replayable, not giving you every boss or environmental interaction during a single playthrough, but asking you to re-roll certain biomes to experience new and interesting content each time. The game essentially takes tile sets of preexisting boss arenas, dungeons, and world events, and uses an RNG to generate a biome for you to explore with these elements baked in. That means no area will ever look exactly the same no matter how many times you play the campaign or re-roll the content during adventure mode. There are four difficulty settings too, so people who might be a bit intimidated to play a souls-like can rest assured that they have the option to play the game with less punishing gameplay than is customary in games like Sekiro, Bloodborne, or Dark Souls. 

The game can be played single player, but it really shines when played with one or two friends, as it supports a party of up to three people. 

There is also some really incredible lore present in the game if you are willing to take the time to explore it. 

This game provides fewer weapons and armor sets than other souls-like games, but this seems very intentional and is in no way a bad thing. The weapons are extremely well designed, with each one feeling so unique and interesting that when you find one, you value it so much more than you would in a game with 200+ weapon choices. This isn't supposed to feel like a looter-shooter. It's designed so that each new weapon and armor piece you find causes you to rethink your entire build. Which armor (and the unique bonuses that come with them) would pair best with this weapon? Which ring? Which amulet? What kind of weapon mods will be most valuable for me given this biome's enemy types and unique environmental hazards?

The different items in the game can be combined in new and interesting ways to create unique builds, but it never feels like a chore to do this. It's so intuitive. The inventory management is minimal, the user interface is effective, and the game just lets you focus on the fun. 

You are doing yourself and your friends a disservice if you decide not to get your hands on this game and experience it together. I highly, highly recommend Remnant: From the Ashes.

Dark Souls with guns and randomized worlds / sections each time you replay ( RNG can hit you can give you the same ofc, though with the amount of different paths you'd have to be super unlocky to have the whole playthrough the same ).

A lot of bosses have alternative kill rewards such as for example breaking Its legs before killing It etc giving you a different boss reward, quite a lot of replayability with set features above and overall a pretty damn good challenge.

Not saying it is bad, I believe I got my money's worth, but there is just not a lot going for it, there are lots of interesting ideas but they are not expanded upon.  Some people say this is just a Soulsborne game but with guns but I don't really see that except for similar gameplay and some features.  I only played it on normal mode and single-player but to be honest I don't think I will replay it on harder mode at least for awhile, since there is really nothing new afterwards nor interested in the DLC unless another big sale comes up.

Story:  Not much there, I didn't even realize this game was a sequel to another VR game that came out in 2016 until after I completed this game and was checking out the wiki page to get more lore info.  It is not needed to figure out this story but I think there could of been more done to describe the lore.  Even though I put a lot of hours into this game, it still felt short and forgettable since there was little lore and characters introduced were not expanded upon and shown only once.

Gameplay:  Again if you played a Soulsborne game this will feel very familiar, just with more long range attacks, though the difficulty is not there (at least on normal mode).  Has the same stamina bar but did not seem important.   Gun play is fine just like any other 3rd person shooter and the guns were pretty unique depending on mods used but melee weapons were limited and those attacks didn't really feel different from one another.  Even though you start by choosing a specific character class, it did not matter because you can immediately buy the same items the others had within an hour of starting. When leveling up you can decide on what traits to enhance which helps build your own play style but some of the traits just seem like a huge waste and never touched (the speed of vaulting over walls is a trait that can be upgraded, but is rarely done in combat and only takes a second to do normally, why waste points in this?)

Levels design: the level sections that are not scripted are randomly generated (you can even reroll them and keep the previous items) which also means the items and some bosses you get will always be different.  This does sound like a good feature except that some areas have the same environment assets and placements duplicated so you get a weird sense of deja vu.  Even though the areas are huge and have a lot of smash-able objects to collect items with, there is not much to interact with so the environments, although look good, feel bland and empty.  In some areas (desert world) I felt like I was spending more of the game smashing things to get currency than actually fighting.

Items:  I am not sure if I just got lucky with my play thru of items, but after getting the base random items before the first big tree boss, I stuck with them till the end and felt no need to change them.  Guns felt distinct between them depending on your play style but melee weapons all felt the same.  Consumables were barely even used and hoarded but again this is probably due with the good fortune of base Items I got at the beginning and normal difficulty setting.

Characters and enemies: The NPC's are forgettable but do their job to progress the story.  The enemies and bosses though are a disappointment.  I can see that some effort to detail was put into them but cannot really tell since they disappear after killed which is a shame because I like to be able to see the designs up close.  The ranged enemies are easy to take down and the elite melee enemies are bullet sponges though there are variety to them and how to go about attacking them.  The bosses were let downs though, they were just giant bullet sponges, I had more problems with the constant waves of smaller enemies summoned around them than the actual bosses themselves, so not the epic one-on-one boss battles I was hoping for.

Final thoughts: Thumbs up because I got my money's worth but was expecting more, buy it on sale.

Post note:  I am interested in checking out the new one though from the trailers but if I hear it is pretty much the same as this one then I will have to pass.",1672969734,1672969734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Please note that this game is NOT a clone of any soulsborne game. It merely mimics certain aspects of the genre and exceeds in providing consistent rewards throughout the journey it provides. 

To really appreciate this game, one needs to dive into reading the lore. Take your time and read the journals, logs and tid bits the developers have provided. It's an interesting Sci-Fi adventure. 

Remnant is a casual challenge. It will not punish you for dying, BUT you will die, and often. You will be forced to use your modifications acquired throughout the campaign. You will pursue joining public games to acquire upgrades not available in your campaign and Remnant allows you to do this at a pace that leaves you feeling satisfied.

I've played all of the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro. I love them all (Sekiro being my favorite). But what Remnant brings to the table is a refreshing change of pace to the genre. It's not overly hard. You're not going to beat your head against the wall trying to beat boss fights. You will die and try again and you will succeed, eventually.

[h2]Remnant: From the Ashes Review[/h2]

Less punishing souls-like game with a gorgeously detailed environment. Join this third-person survival action shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world full of monstrous creatures. Face the horde of bloodthirsty enemies solo, or with up to two other friends. The game undoubtedly is a love child of varied games. You will see the resemblance of Dark Souls during boss rushes, Fallout from the post-apocalyptic environment, Sea of Thieves‚Äô in the graphics, and SCP foundation in the horror fiction. Alongside challenging gameplay, you can also upgrade your gear and rerun the worlds with a randomly generated campaign.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The scene starts with your character washed up on an island with nothing but clothes and a rusty sword. The story commences with a slow build-up, but when you reach Ward 13(bunker) and start the reactor, the game takes an exciting start. There are few NPCs at the spawn point, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to remember the map segments. The game solely wants you to engage in the action and face the monsters. With all the gear modifications and three different class selections, gameplay becomes quite challenging and do-able at the same time, which makes the game super fun and interesting. In order to survive the wrath of this madness, you need to get a hold of the dodge mechanism. If you are worried about the game lacking in the variation of bosses, then just chill and enter the madness of the monstrous world. You don‚Äôt need to worry about the length of the playthrough, as it‚Äôs quite promising.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
This definitely meets the quality of new-gen games with its brilliant and eye-pleasing graphics. The detailing on the map is spectacular. Every boss is uniquely designed and impressively balances with the environment‚Äôs color palette. Many of the games have bosses that look lifeless, but the developers here managed to depict a life form that might actually exist. Even with the rich detailing, the GPU consumption is not critically high. You can easily play the game in genuine settings without experiencing any lag. You will surely encounter some areas where you will be obliged to take a screenshot because of the colorful and eye-popping scenery.

[h1]Why the campaign is different from other games:[/h1]
The game has a unique way of keeping you engaged in the game for a long time by randomizing the campaign. Playthroughs are entirely different for everyone. The bosses are mainly classified within two divisions: dungeon boss and world boss. Dungeon bosses or mini-bosses are an upgraded version of regular enemies. On the other hand, defeating world bosses will move the plot forward. all world bosses in your playthrough, but that's why the game grants you the ability to reroll the campaign for a possibility of facing new bosses at the cost of increasing the world difficulty. Another way is to join multiplayer worlds of other players to seek out new bosses that might not have appeared in your world.. Adventure mode brings a new layer of exploration, by allowing players to re-roll the following biomes: Ruined Earth, Rhom, and Yaesha without having to play the whole campaign again.

[h1]Main Pros and Cons:[/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Great visuals
    [*]Fun gameplay
    [*]Variation in playthrough 
    [*]Astonishing Bosses
    [*]A less punishing Dark Souls-like game
    [*]Exciting to play with friends
    [*]No pay-to-win
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Can be hard and boring to play alone
    [*]Encountering  all bosses might consume lot of time and tries
    [*]Lot of crash reports
    [*]Most of the bosses feel like a survival wave instead of one on one battle
[/list]

[h1]Tips to new players:[/h1]
If you are unaware of Dark Souls-like games, then it‚Äôs highly recommended to play with friends, as you might die in just 2 hits. Avoid selling scraps in the beginning, as they will be required for gear upgrades later in the game. Even though the classes are somewhat similar, choosing ex-Cultist might give you a bit of a head-start. Easter egg for all the lovely readers, when you begin your first mission and claim the keycard, a particular bookshelf might seem like it‚Äôs hiding something. üòâ

[h1] Miscellaneous Information:[/h1]
[b]Info about DLCs-[/b]
Both the DLCs are worth it if you are looking to increase playtime by a lot. It offers new zones, new bosses, new weapon mods, some hidden puzzles/dungeons, and much more. Highly recommended during sales.

[h1]Honest Rating:[/h1]
The game fulfills your desire of playing a beautiful dungeon crawler that isn't as constantly difficult as Dark Souls. It‚Äôs a fun challenge that you can do alone or with friends and have a great time. Even though it‚Äôs a mix of a lot of games, it still feels unique and memorable.

Unfortunately, unlike Dark Souls, this game has one huge drawback (at least for me) - it is not balanced around single play :(   I started as a Hunter class (more due to looks than serious consideration over pros/cons) but quickly discovered in the first dungeon (sewers) that IF YOU PLAY SOLO your sharpshooter is worthless. There is simply no places to hide and shoot enemies from a distance (some enemies turned out to be immune and require a dangerous close combat - Hunter, looking at you). I found out that it is pretty much pure luck (what enemy mini-boss you get), not skill that governs how far you can progress. 
I was only able to get to the first boss (Shroud) because another player joined my session - and yes, with a coop play when my character can shoot from a distance it was immensely more enjoyable. 
Again, I dont have company for coop play and in a PVE mode it is simply unenjoyable for me :(",1672754926,1672754926,False,1,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

The game is, largely, inspired by the soulsborne sub-genre of action RPGs. But it's only mildly so, because this game is largely linear and there isn't a backstab or counter mechanic in the combat system. Instead, the game feels more like it's a third person shooter, with melee combat taking a backseat for the ride that is Remnant: From the Ashes. In some ways it works, and other ways it acts as a detriment. The best and arguably most compelling part is the randomized maps and ability to reroll the game map, at the cost of restarting story progression. But sometimes rerolling means you won't even encounter the same character again. It's a risk/reward gamble; and the same could be said for the game itself, a risk/reward gamble.

It's difficult for me to really summarize a review in a way that may carry any weight. The best I can say is... as someone who likes soulsborne games more from afar, rather than in my hands, I found Remnant to be mostly enjoyable.

Impressive and probably Hugely Under-rated. This is a well made, third person, monster hunter game with a lot of functionality to offer.

It does bear some familiar hallmarks: challenge focus, ""bonfires"" that respawn enemies, dodgerolls that differ depending on equipment weight, that sort of thing. It's different enough in the details that people will complain about the ""soulslike"" label, but it's similar enough that the inspiration is clear.

Gun combat feels good, which I suppose is the main thing. It bears some similarities to Gears of War - mostly chunky movement and diving rolls - albeit without the dedicated stick-to-walls cover mechanic. The game's at its best when you're in a proper shootout with gun-wielding enemies, who often do a decent job trying to outflank you, driving you forward or back and out of cover. The game is at its most frustrating, however, when you're being swarmed by ten trillion melee enemies, as you often are. Melee combat exists, but is very rudimentary - a backup. Boss fights compound this frustration by doubling down on the enemy swarms; almost every single boss is flanked by an army of adds, and are consequently outrageous on higher difficulties. The game is, in its defence, clearly designed with co-op in mind.

As loadouts go, you can only carry three weapons at once, of three specific categories: a ""hand gun"" (any smaller gun; pistols, submachine guns, sawn-off shotguns, etc.), a ""long gun"" (rifles, shotguns, big lasers, etc.) and a melee weapon. The game's pool of weapons is large enough that this one-weapon-per-category restriction feels a tad [I]too[/I] restrictive, but I suspect this is meant to facilitate some sort of build diversity for co-op. Those of us who have no friends might have less fun, but I suppose that's always been the case.

Perhaps the game's biggest flaw is also one of its theoretical strengths: procedural generation. The game's worlds aren't static for every playthrough, but cobbled together somewhat at random from world parts. This is fine in theory for a game that seems built for some measure of longevity - and it clearly is - but the issue is the [I]lack of parts[/I]. In just the second run, you'll see the same stuff you've seen before rearranged, and it rarely if ever really changes the flavour of an area. Enemy spawns will be different, equipment loot spawns will be different, you might see a couple of new environments (worlds consist of multiple mostly linear levels with different environments and one or two might not generate in your playthrough; perhaps in your game you won't see the infuriating canyon town on Rhom, for example) and bosses will be different, but the levels themselves rarely ever feel unique relative to other levels of the same environment type. A few side-dungeons will have specific gimmicks - exploding mines everywhere, a status effect that saps health and recovers health with every kill - but this idea is woefully underused and each feels no different the second time regardless, new layout or not.

The most frustrating thing about this misfire of procedural generation is that one of the DLCs introduces a ""survival"" mode that effectively turns the game into a simple roguelike, for which the system fits far better. You start with nothing but a pistol and a little cash, and you're thrown into a random world to make do with whatever random loot you find in the random environments you come across. It's honestly so much more effective than the main campaign that I wish the game had been designed around this mode from the get-go. There's not quite enough to it as it is for it to stand alone, but if they'd introduced some sort of rogue-""lite"" progression to it, unlocked more options the further you got into it or something, it'd keep me busy for ages.

The plot is thin. It touches on some neat fantasy ideas - an eldritch entity consuming dimensions or whatever, a science mishap that let it through to Earth - but nothing is really explored. Each of the four (five with DLC) worlds shows the bones of backstory and lore, but none - aside perhaps from Earth - has an arc, or any real flesh to those bones at all. The early game sets up a bunch of characters at home base, but does very little with them; they're all but forgotten by the endgame, with nothing new to say. The story is really just an excuse to hang gameplay on, and I suppose that's fine, but it feels like such a missed opportunity when sprinkled with so many good things.

DLCs are okay. The aforementioned survival mode DLC (""Swamps of Corsus"") is actually advertised as one that beefs up one of the base game's worlds, with survival mode as an extra. Survival mode steals the show, though, and the changes to Corsus don't add much. The second DLC (""Subject 2923"") finishes the story with a fitting shrug, and adds a snowy rat world that isn't bad.

So in the end, it's fine. Solidly okay. A good, albeit rickety, foundation to build on, and one which will hopefully support a great sequel.",1672510377,1672510377,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Areas scale on the level of your gear when you enter them. This is an easy way to balance the difficulty but it's not a good way to do this, because you can screw yourself in the late game if you enter an area by accident or find an extra area too late.
2. Upgrade materials are not renewable, so you better figure out which gear you're using for the whole game, quick. This screwed me on my main playthrough, I could try to beat the final boss, but it's just not fun.
3. As I'm sure you're aware from other reviews, this game relies heavily on boss fight adds and the boss fights are generally cancerous compared with the rest of the game. There are ways to fix this, but oh well.
4. There is seeded RNG for what items you will get on any given run. If you want a specific gun or armor set, you're essentially screwed if the dice don't roll your way. Sometimes you can't access loot because of the way items and events spawn. There is one event where if you fail to take down a fleeing enemy in a fraught, bleeding-edge difficult area, you don't get the loot, period. FUCK THAT.

Tl;dr it could be so good. Why? I would honestly have 100-200 hours in this if 3 of these 4 problems were addressed. As it stands I can't stomach playing this for another second.",1635899019,1672290207,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, the game has guns as the main source of weaponry which, while actually making the game almost too easy at times, forces the developers to introduce a way to gain more ammo during the tankiest bosses. To do this, they force most bosses to have smaller enemies that rush the player which the player can kill to get ammo. Which means that the player has to shift focus between ads and boss, which artificially increases already tanky bosses to an even tankier battle. Couple this with some bosses having random gimmicks that almost seem unfair (I'm looking at you, insta-kill pitfall cloner) and status effects that the player HAS to deal with in order to have a fighting chance, and you have an insanely complex boss fight. Which is actually quite unfortunate because, if the player had the ability to gain ammo without having to fight ads, the fights would actually be quite entertaining and challenging.

Second of all, for some reason, the developers went with a, in my words, ""Path of Exile"" style mapping system where you can re-roll areas to gain gear. That means that a lot of the gear is locked behind RNG events and can be incredibly tedious to get the things you want. For example, on Rhom, there's a boss fight where you have to collect a Control Rod and then use that Control Rod on a Construct to unlock another boss fight... however, it's possible that the Control Rod will spawn without the Construct or visa versa. You'll get keys but no doors.

Third, the events that the player must fight through to get specific gear can sometimes be incredibly frustrating. None of the smaller enemies are exactly ""weak"", mind you, and when you have to fight waves of enemies, it can sometimes be overwhelming and basically boil down to spamming the dodge button until the player has a fraction of a second to get a few shots off and hopefully either kill an enemy or two, or do at least half health to one.

I couldn't recommend playing this game at any higher difficulty than Hard for most players, unless you're a hardcore Souls fan, this game is going to bury you. I'm hoping that in Remnant II, they come up with a way to give the player ammo without having to fight enemies so that the player can focus on the challenging, well-designed boss fights, without the inane tedium of dodge dancing.",1672186307,1672186307,False,44,15,0.499178767204284668,0,True,False,False

7/10

Gameplay:

This is genuinely one of the most mechanically well-designed games I've played in years. The addition of a Dark Souls-eque roll mechanic adds a sublime level of depth to what would otherwise be a bog-standard third person shooter. Dodge rolling through an enemy's attack and then whipping out your shotgun to deliver the killing blow only to immediately whip around and finish off three other enemies makes you feel like an action hero worthy of a Matrix movie. However,

Story:

The mechanics of this game are just begging for a story in which you play some sort of Van Helsing style occult monster hunter traversing a ruined world so he can take his vengeance on the horrors from beyond time and space. The plot we are given, however, is that it is a video game. Here's a gun, there's some zombies over there, and progress will happen once there are no longer some zombies over there. ""The Root"" (which might as well be holding up signs saying ""we wanted to make a zombie apocalypse game, but zombies are boring now so here are some things that are definitely not zombies"") are about as toothless an eldritch horror as you can get this side of Innsmouth. On top of that, every character talks like they're in a fallout game, overexplaining every last detail (presumably because the developers know you're not paying attention to the paper-thin excuse for a plot they wrote). Also, a lot of the very nice atmosphere and tension of the actual action sequences is let down by the protagonists incessant qipping. You'll finish off a horde of enemies in a creepy subway station and the generally oppressive ambiance will start getting to you. You'll start wondering if you mist a monster who might sneak up behind you later, you start to get immersed. Then, your character will yell ""that's the last of them"" (or some other quip fit for a Call of Duty game) and you'll remember you're playing a video game.

Visuals:

The graphics and environment design are quite pleasant. The game is going for a more stylized aesthetic which I quite like because it tends to age much better than attempts at photorealism. The design relies heavily on fungal imagery and glowing red details which I enjoy.

Sound:

The sound effects are excellent. The music is unmemorable, but it sets a great atmosphere. The voice acting is good too, as long as you're willing to sit through the crap dialogue.

Conclusion:

You start in a boring warehouse busting crates and then you kill a dragon and you're off to Narnia with all sorts of crazy NPCs and weapons that shoot lazers and such.  Its got a meaty perk system a variance of weapons, armor and skills to pair with them. As often happens with souls likes, I want to like them more than I do.  Sadly, while this one will get the thumbs up, its in the 6-7/10 category where my gripes are pretty front and center.  

First is the camera.  Game is holding me hostage with cheap fall deaths, an inability to see behind me in a game that constantly spawns behind me, and also an inability to see thrust attack that are always coming.  Oh and that one fight where you fight two bosses on opposite sides.  Certainly not using your own game mechanics as difficulty are you?  Because that won't make players mad.  Second is the way it handles boss difficulty...adds....lots and lots of adds. That's it.  Dragon fight was memorable in that its mechanics were fleshed out enough you didn't feel it but often the adds are just awful.  Challenging for sure but not fun and detracts from the boss fights when they all follow that same pattern.  Third is the randomization.  You can tell too.  Why not just throw it all in.  For all the effort put in to make all the pieces jumble, just make a bigger map.  The replay value would still be there, and then you don't have the maps feeling like a tile set because you can place things for maximum theme and effect. Oh and the PC voice acting was trash.  Not the line recording necessary but the implementation could have used some work.

Anyway I had fun but this game tested my patience a bit.  Stuff I'd say for Elden RIng were just things I didn't like were just bad design here.  Is that unfair?  Probably but this ain't no Elden Ring.  Worth it on sale but don't stress over this one, its fine but unlikely to blow you away.",1672101785,1672101785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Truth be told, I hadn't played it up until now due to this description as that doesn't feel like something I'd like, even as a huge fan of Fromsoft games. 
And in the end, I'm glad it's not. 
A Boss room and check point system does not make a Souls game. If that were actually the case, then MegaManX or any Igavania is a Soulslike...

""ARPG with firearms"" is far more accurate as there's a major focus on replayability, co-op play and unique builds with traits and abilities that rely on player creativity to come to life when combined with each other.  
The RPG elements within are pretty nice and are already affording me some really fun and creative combinations that let my play style shine rather than hold me back. 
Think Outriders sans the looter shooter angle and a more deliberate pacing...
Imagine the Tide games without the hoards...
You get the idea.

The game feels like a mix of three games: it has similar gun play to The Division, the difficulty is like a Dark Souls game (but easier) and it reminds me of Doom when it comes to ""spooky/frightening sounds"" that may increase your adrenaline. 

Pros:
- Really good single player experience and a great game to play with friends
- Could be the most balanced game I've ever seen (every single build is viable)
- You can select between four difficulties, catering the experience to your own liking
- Replayability. Even after finishing the base game, I could play adventure mode and discover a ton of new gear, bosses and dungeons that weren't present in the campaign.

Cons:
- Multiplayer with randoms is strongly discouraged, if you desire a certain item (bosses/dungeons with alternative kills/completions award different items)
- The RNG in endgame can be a bit insane (to get a specific item you may need to re-roll a map that desires 3 specific areas out of 4, in order to gain the specific item that you are searching for. The odds of this happening feel close to 0, since there are a ton of possible areas to RNG from)
- Weak DLCs. I would not say that any of them are worth it.

TLDR: I would strongly recommend the base game to casual players, or those who only play single player/with friends. For people that desire a 100% completion, are achievement hunters, or those who enjoy playing multiplayer with randoms; stay away. This game gets extremely tedious once you are looking for specific items, while already having acquired the majority of them.",1671796195,1671797089,True,82,0,0.867340683937072754,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: Remnant makes you realise what it's like to live a life in the multiverse.


You start off in your own campaign. You play it either solo or co-op or a mix between. I heavily recommend to do your first playthrough solo in order to get the download on the bosses, areas and mess around with gear. Add to the fact that strangers can and most likely will interact with your world and activate and/or complete quests without you knowing - making you miss some stuff.

So you start in your campaign. This is your Earth, this is your world. You spend the most time on your first playthrough because it is yours. Your character is, presumably, born on this Earth. The quests have meaning, your rewards feel earned. You feel like you're just another human trying to survive a post-apocalyptic world. 

The barriers begin to fade the very moment you beat the Earth boss. The entire game feels completely different after that. No longer are you a survivor being pummeled by the endless onslaught of the Root. You're a traveler now, on a journey to find answers to a seemingly insurmountable problem. You voyage beyond Earth itself to completely different worlds. But these are still your worlds. You care what happens to the people you meet. You make the choices that feel right to make. 

Eventually, you find the answer you're looking for and prepare to fight the final boss. And when you beat it... that's when the game really begins.

What happens now? Your world is safe. There's nothing left to do, but you've heard there are rewards for different choices. Different gear for different dungeons. 

With the power of the World Stone, you eventually make the decision to re-roll your campaign. 
As a player, but also as your character. 

All of a sudden the barriers completely break. All of these worlds, all of these people living their lives around you are now tools to get new gear. In a new, self-imposed quest to become more powerful for the hell of it; to truly embrace what it means to be a traveler in the multiverse. The people you met in your original universe don't recognize you anymore. You have to rebuild your relationship with them entirely. 

You can never return to your original universe. Your first worlds. That moment has passed. The connection you had to your first playthrough slowly fades with each re-roll.

Each re-roll you grow more powerful and eventually you are strong and confident enough to truly beat the game. 

[spoiler]You fight the true final boss in the latest DLC and win. You've saved the world. Congratulations. Well... you've saved -this- world. A hollow victory. Countless other worlds are still in dire need of help by the same threat. And so, yet again, you re-roll the campaign.[/spoiler]

This is now your character's life. Their insatiable need for gear and power now completely in sync with you, the player. Your avatar's goals and methods to achieve them now completely align with yours. Their life is now a game to them - the very same game you are playing.

The fact your character eventually completely syncs with you as a player is why I think this game is special. No other game does this. Even with its bugs and, sometimes, clunky mechanics, I find the immersion perfect.

So give this game a try and see if you get what I mean. Play alone, or with friends. Experience how they interact with their first world. How everything is super important at first and how it slowly changes to 'just another method to get this ring'.

Good luck, World Walker.

A ""souls-like 3rd person shooter with procedurally generated levels"" sounds like it would be a mess but Remnant actually manages tie all it's different systems together into something unique and amazing.  

At it's core this game is a challenging and difficult 3rd person shooter.  Combat in Remnant is a slower affair that rewards caution and precision.  Like in other souls-like games running around like a headless chicken and not paying attention will get you killed.  Bonfires do exist though so if you die you just start the current area over.  

The combat in this game is really good.  The enemies are varied and engaging to fight.  You have the standard souls-like dodge roll so all damage is avoidable with proper timing. Most enemies also have weak points.  All of this together with each region having very different level layouts makes the combat very satisfying.

The boss fights in this game tend to get some flack because most of them summon weak monsters during the fight.  I initially hated that aspect of the fights but now I see it as just another boss mechanic.  The adds themselves have very low HP and are very easily dealt with if your aim is decent.  It does seem cheap the first few times but the game will always tell when they're coming somehow. 

Honestly the audio in this game deserves it's own special mention because of how much information Remnant packs into the different sound effects.  Audio cues are used to great effect in this game for all sorts of things.  Like you can easily can tell what enemies you're fighting before you see them because they all sound very different.    

The other very cool thing this game does is that it actually has good RPG systems.  Between traits, weapon mods, armor set bonuses, accessories and the actual guns themselves there are alot of ways you can build a character.  Weapon mods aren't what you'd think either.  Rather than being something like a scope weapon mods are how you pick your character's active abilities.  Some mods do traditional things like let you shoot grenades but others let you buff your character or summon minions to help you in combat.

Lastly this game has a huge amount of replayability thanks to the game scrambling the area layout every time you revisit a a region.  It also employs random events and multiple bosses for each region.  The level generation in this game has enough parts and different ways to connect them that you probably won't notice things are getting reused until you've been playing for a while.  The level layouts in this game are honestly good enough that it's hard to tell the game is making them on the fly.

I recommend purchasing this game on sale or otherwise.  I know of no other game that manages to successfully blend excellent shooting with the ""tough, but fair"" challenge and interesting RPG systems of a souls-like.  I am eagerly awaiting the recently announced Remnant 2 because souls-like shooters are rare and Remnant is the best one someone's ever made.",1671047951,1671047951,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

---{Graphics}---
‚òê Otherworldly
‚úì Beautiful
‚òê Good
‚òê Decent
‚òê Bad
‚òê MS-DOS

Notes: 
If you have a mid rig or better, the graphics for some of the game's worlds are best experienced with higher graphic settings.

---{Gameplay}---
‚úì Excellent
‚òê Good/Engaging
‚òê Average
‚òê Mediocre at best
‚òê Bad
‚òê Watch paint dry instead

Notes: 
Easily the best aspect of the game itself. Ever played DS? Now imagine it with guns. The fluidity of the character itself, and the enemies and bosses' attack patterns makes it feel like an incredibly polished game. All the guns are enjoyable to use and once mods for guns are unlocked, there are so many combinations you can create to tailor to your play-style providing a wide range of choices and gunplay. Movement is solid and timed dodges feel rewarding to execute. Traits need to be unlocked through different prerequisite tasks before being able to utilise and upgrade them. Of course, co-op mode raises the bar in challenging difficulties (as enemies hp scales with number of players). I played the campaign with two buddies in Nightmare mode (second hardest difficulty) and it was plenty challenging enough, but eventual success felt extremely satisfying.

---{Audio/Soundtrack}---
‚òê Eargasm
‚úì Very good
‚òê Good
‚òê Average
‚òê Bad
‚òê I'm now deaf

Notes:
Soundtrack is very good - especially the themes for the unique bosses. If anything, it pumps you up during the boss fight. Lots of triumphant-based compositions. You'd have to listen to it for yourself.

---{Difficulty}---
‚òê Just press 'W'
‚òê Easy
‚òê Significant brain usage
‚òê Easy to learn / Hard to master
‚úì Difficult
‚úì Dark Souls

Notes:
Like I mentioned earlier. DS ... with guns. Dying is naturally part of this game's system. You are meant to die. And die you will. Over and over perhaps. Depending on the difficulty you play at, there are times where you will feel it's either impossible or straight up difficult to beat a specific boss or whatnot. But with enough persistence and patience, learning the bosses attack moves/patterns and eventually beating them feels extremely rewarding. That being said, playing on the easiest difficulty shouldn't be much of a problem. But its more fun to play on harder difficulties IMO.

---{Grind}---
‚òê Nothing to grind
‚òê Minor grinding
‚òê Isn't necessary to progress
‚úì Average grind level
‚òê Substantial grind
‚òê I hope you have a second life to grind

Notes:
The only thing you grind for mainly are resources (found in the open world) to upgrade your gear, weapons and equipment. If you are a collector or a completionist, then you might be one of those players who want to find every unique piece of armour set and every single weapon. There are different prerequisites on how you obtain different guns/armours depending on your playthrough via choices. You can always re-roll the campaign/adventure mode to get an alternative outcome. This will take time depending on how many rolls you need, as some prerequisite options are purely down to RNG.

---{Story}---
‚òê No Story
‚òê Text/Audio floating around
‚òê Some lore
‚úì Average
‚òê Good
‚òê Amazing
‚òê It‚Äòll replace your life

Notes:
Some of the game lore is explained throughout the game's campaign by default. This gives you an overview of what has happened so far. However if you are a lore-digger, you'd find it in your best interests to read notebook entries and computer logs (left in the open world) to read as that gives you more in-depth story lore.

---{Game time / Length}---
‚òê Long enough for a cup of tea/coffee
‚òê Short (<10 hours)
‚úì Average ( 10-30 hours)
‚úì Long (31-60 hours)
‚òê Substantial ( 61-100 hours)
‚òê ‚àû

Notes:
The average gamer can complete the game's main campaign in a relatively short time... if they are play on the easiest/standard difficulty. Harder difficulties or grinding for better unique gear will take more time --> best way to play IMO!

---{Audience}---
‚òê Kids
‚úì Teens
‚úì Adults
‚òê All

---{PC Requirements}---
‚òê Check if you can run paint
‚òê Potato
‚úì Mid Rig
‚òê Big Rig needed
‚òê Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

---{Price / Quality}---
‚òê It‚Äôs free!
‚úì Worth the price

‚òê Not recommended
‚òê You could also just burn your money

HIGHLIGHTS:
‚Ä¢ Replayability, after your first play through you can reroll every 'area' of the game to get different dungeons and loot to permanently unlock. This can feel pretty bad if you are specifically grinding for something, but I'll get into that later.
‚Ä¢ Co-Op, in this game you can easily join or have friends join in on you, at any point, and the healing system is VAST what with many items, abilities, and armors that work for team play. 
‚Ä¢ Fun mechanics, save for a couple enemies and bosses you'll find yourself challenged and engaged with enemy mechanics, unlike some soulslike games where you can big weapon and plow your way through 90% of the encounters this one you always have to play safe and smart. 
- To add, the newest DLC 2923 has a lot of bosses that feel like raid bosses in MMOs where positional and area attacks are key to pay attention to. Very good addition if you're into that. 
‚Ä¢ Graphics, while this game isn't the most beautiful thing in the world and doesn't offer next gen features like Ray Tracing, it has a certain ambiance that I personally find very appealing. The eerie glow through mist, the radiant gems shining through overgrown mobs, the greasy shine of swampland mobs, it's all very fitting to where it is and they nail all their locals and mobs for them. Again, not super detailed, but an absolute match for the theme everywhere you go. 

DOWNSIDES:
‚Ä¢ Grind, So this can go a few ways. Some people will LOVE to reroll maps to get all the loot but here's the issue. Some of the look requires some very specific map requirements, such as a specific dungeon boss and a specific vendor all being present on the same map, which is a very low chance. (Bare Fist Melee Ring) OR there is the Letos Amulet, my white whale. I've done the math, statistically it is very low percent that I have done around 100 Earth rolls and never once seen Leto's amulet, but that sure is the case. It's whatever, I get it, but I feel like something needs to be built in where every roll always has to have something you don't have, if at all possible, because there are a LOT of different things to loot.
‚Ä¢ Lag, The game isn't perfect. It has a lot of rubber banding at times and when you add multiplayer to the mix you can find yourself in a lot of situations where fighting at range becomes frustrating. This is especially true in Subject 2923, where some maps you legitimately can't use projectile based weapons such as crossbows because they'll hit invisible textures that are floating in the air in front of you, or between you and the enemy. This can feel pretty bad when using the ultimate of the bleed crossbow and it just embeds into the thin air feet away from you instead of a big elite pushing you in. 

At the end of the day, I recommend this game. Maybe a 7/10. HOWEVER, with friends? 9/10, this game is seriously so fun with friends it's ridiculous.

The graphics and overall presentation promise routine but recycle noticeable visuals, the movement, and controls work very well but have weak dodging mechanics.s. Overall a welcome dive into a dystopian world but with unpleasingly few details about the protagonist and a lot of potential. 

:: POSITIVE ::

+: Variation to some degree
I played with a close friend who finished the game already and he claimed several times during our joint playthrough that a handful of encounters we witness were also his first encounter, which was cool. The areas also get randomized for every unique session which is nice for replayability.

+: Skillsystem
A simple but effective skill system allows unique builds and therefore supports your playstyle.

+: Musical score
At certain moments remarkable music and fitting well, supporting memorable moments and fights!

+: Controls
No problems with controls, I played with Keyboard and Mouse and partly with an Xbox One Controller and it was really good!

+: Fair checkpoint system
The game got a decent amount of checkpoints which enables us to play short sessions and not struggle too hard at certain segments of the game.

+: Content:
Even though I never played those other game modes, there is a Survival mode and an Adventure mode just for browsing around your world and trying to find more loot. Never played it tho, but cool that they implemented other options.

:: REMARKS ::

O: NPCs & Story
There have been NPCs and very cool voice actors, but the overall impact of those NPCs had felt rushed and there could be more potential. As I understand they attempt to carry out the important pieces of lore through reading and listing to audio logs, I would WISH to see also more through the world itself. It was okay, but I was excepted a bit more.

O:  Boss battles
Some boss battles are good with really well-thought mechanics, but most of them just spawn additionally just additional enemies which just ruined the mood for an interesting and challenging boss fight. It felt at some point disappointed when you finally reach a boss and then the strength of the boss was just justified by all their spawns. I was kinda disappointed about this.

O: Items
It was interesting finding those items, but somehow I would like to have more options for finding different items. Or being able to buy them from more different vendors. Or upgrade rings/amulets. Also, the elementary resistance did not matter that much, even on Hard. Maybe it impacts more at higher difficulties. I really cannot tell what could be made to change it. But I felt not completely happy.

:: DOWNSIDES ::

-: Difficult scale
The game should not be played for the first run on a higher difficulty, since the game scales damage dealt and health from enemies ""notably"". We have been able to finish the game on this difficulty because my close friend could join my game with upgraded gear and could switch with ease when certain bosses might deal too much damage. Mostly casual enemies and bosses two-shooted me due to the high difficulty.

-: Dodge mechanics
Dodging can be sometimes difficult and also punishing. Attacks got sometimes a larger area of effect as shown visually which leads to confusing moments when me or my other friend which also played the game for the first time tried to dodge. Since there are no other mechanics instead of running away from danger, dogging was sometimes a bit unreliable.

-: Ending (also DLC ending)
No comment, play it for yourself. :)

-: Game-breaking bugs
At one moment during play I disconnected the lobby WHILE my friends were still connected, thinking about how modern games (like they do) deal with that without any issue. Unfortunately, my close friend which already finished the game before lost because of this issue/bug items/skills and even skill levels. If you playing with friends and you host the game: Let your friends disconnect first! It sucks losing progression because the game cannot handle closing a lobby. 

After writing this review, I need to say that I still would recommend this game for you to play. But with friends. I cannot see myself playing this game alone and again, even with options of replayability. It is just that the game gives me no incentive to explore the lore of the game and I don¬¥t feel a strong personal connection to the game. But again, it was really fun playing this game with two friends of mine, challenging the game and its bosses, and spending a good time together. I highly suggest you play this on ""Normal"" and you can finish it under 20h tops.

I recommend this game if you plan to play it with two friends, but not if you seek a single-player game.",1670454408,1670454755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really wish they would have done more with this game either kept adding DLC or made a sequel because a game like this deserves it. Sadly i think we will never get something like that because they made chronos from the ashes as a prequel and it flopped because they changed the way the game was played.

There is a lot of gear and talents available, leading to some decent build diversity, although some dominant items and clear choices lessen this. Finally, the game-play systems are unique and they work well. Campaign, adventure, survival all are fun and meet their purpose well. I played each mode for dozens of hours and enjoyed it all.

First off, Remnant From The Ashes is little more than a ""run-around-n'-shoot-em-up"" style game, so don't expect much in the way of a detailed NPC dialog or immersive story-line. Leveling your character, armor, and weapons is a slow grind that requires repeated runs through the same boring and bland areas. The runs are extremely short after each of which you are forced to fight a major world boss before you can progress any further in the game. Loot drop rate and level increase will decline tremendously after each run through the same area. Even after all your hard effort and repeated runs, you are not going to notice all that much of a difference in terms of power and endurance. Single player mode produces the same amount of enemies that you'd expect to see in a co-op mode. Normal mode is hard, so I wouldn't recommend jumping straight into any higher level of difficulty unless you are a gamer god or you are fond of getting ganked 6 ways to Sunday. You can carry a ton of crafting materials; however, your ammo capacity is extremely low leaving you rely heavily on melee, buying multiple ammo boxes per run, ammo drops, and near perfect accuracy when firing your guns. You cannot trade in co-op mode; though, all items are automatically shared among team members except for ammo. The lesson here being to grab the ammo loot or tough shit for you. The movement of your character leaves something to be desired. When you heal or reload, your character moves like a sloth caught in a tar pit, which leaves you exposed and results in your character being easily killed. Prepare to die multiple times in this game, as I said: you are starting out as if you are in co-op mode. Would I recommend the game? Yes; however, only to the most experienced and patient gamer that doesn't mind the more mundane and monotonous style of game play. If you are expecting detailed dialog, immersive story-lines, and game mechanics that make sense, then Remnant From the Ashes is probably going to greatly disappoint you. One last side note: expect glitches.",1669597757,1669597757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll say again. This game is FUN. I don't care what anyone says. I've dealt with this more than once. I wont do it again. I'll never see my money back so be it.

The DLC were marketed as free updates and then sold for $10 a pop come release time; and that leaves a sour taste. You can expect about 25-ish hours of gameplay from the base title, and expect a handful of minor bugs, as well as a smattering of some major progression halting bugs for the unlucky few. 

[Original Review]: This game released as a full title, but unfortunately never felt like one. Many aspects of the game are ridden by beta-level bugs, and the amount of gameplay available isn't up to par for the $40 pricetag. I might have even recommended the game in the past, dismissing any bugs as being fixed in the future, and ignoring the lack of content because the developers promised free updates, and even sent us a roadmap. However Gunfire Games have left me pretty disappointed with my purchase. The game was fun, sure, for 20 hours, but offers almost no replayability due to having no dynamic reward system, and after one or two playthroughs your character will have fully completed available progression. Oh, not to mention those aforementioned bugs never got fixed, and only 1/3rd of the free content roadmap was ever delivered. 

[4/14/2020]: We get news of the second roadmap update finally coming out. After months of silence, Gunfire Games has finally announced the Corsus Swamp and Survival update.... is going to be paid DLC. Not free content like was promised. You can even still see the Roadmap announcement in their steam blog.  What's worse, is the new-player discount offered in the form of a $45 Game+DLC bundle. Just a little stick in the neck extra, for all of us early supporters. I for one will not be supporting Gunfire Games in the future, and I'd recommend you steer away from Remnant: From the Ashes if you expect anything more than 20 hours of gameplay out of $40.

[11/23/2022]: You know, I'm still salty about that whole DLC-not-free-updates fiasco I mentioned above. After learning a thing or two about the troubled development of this game, and revisiting it after a friend picked it up on sale; my attitude toward this game has shifted to be a little more forgiving and less critical. The game still has bugs. The game still feels like it should have been a little more polished before release, and I certainly don't appreciate being duped into believing I'd be getting more free content when it was going to be paid DLC all along. But I've decided to give this game my reluctant recommendation after all. The game is short. The replayability is limited. Is this game worth $40 at base price? Probably not. But it's a good sale purchase. If you can snag this title at 50%, maybe even 60% off; go for it. It'll be worth 20 or something USD. Just know what you're getting into: a little indie action title with a rocky development that ends up showing through the cracks. But I can't be so harsh as to say not to purchase this game anymore. I can't come back to the game after 2 years, have fun playing it through again, and still tell people to walk away with a clear conscious. I'll probably check out some other Gunfire Games titles in the future too, contrary to my harsh stance above.

It starts off as a pretty difficult game, even on normal (which is the baseline difficulty), especially if you don't play ""souls-likes"". But, of course, the more you play the more gear and traits you get and upgrade your stuff and easier it becomes. So naturally, you can move on to higher difficulties like: Hard, Nightmare and Apocalypse; when you start to find normal too easy. Although, I should say that, the RNG aspect of this game can screw you over depending on what stuff you get on your first run through the Campaign mode, because some gear/mods aren't really that good at the beginning and others are stupidly strong even early on.

Bosses are well designed and I enjoy fighting them a lot (both solo and co-op). Some feel a little bullshitty at first but once you get the hang of them, you'll realize they're fair.

The part I enjoy the most is that pretty much every single weapon and mod is viable and you can make a build around it in late game. You wanna play a mod mage who blows everything to high heavens with their mods? You can! You want to be a stealthy sniper who moves in shadows and one taps everything and leaves bosses heaving after 2 hits? Sure, go ahead! You want to build a tank who takes multiple hits from enemies at once and then replenishes health like he just got sneezed on? Yup, that's available. You wan to play good old support in co-op buffing your teammates and healing them, while also not losing too much damage potential yourself? Done.

Speaking of co-op. I really like it. Community is 99% of the time chill and very cooperative. Just don't set your game to public if you're gonna kick someone immediately after they join. Other than that, there's not a lot of ways to understand each other, except pinging and only a handful of emotes which take a little too long to ""be expressed"" and the options are very limited.
This is probably my only negative opinion on this game. It needs more emotes and different types of pings for better communication.

I have positive expectations for the sequel, and how they might improve it, which HOPEFULLY should be happening in the foreseeable future, since THQ Nordic trademarked the title ""Remnant from the Ashes 2"" and ""Remnant 2"".

If it has peaked your interest, definitely grab this game while it's on sale (and it goes on sale pretty frequently). It's worth the money.",1669217706,1669217706,True,67,1,0.85790485143661499,0,True,False,False

The weapons are cool, the visuals are pretty great, but the one drawback is the RNG dungeon system. I have fought some bosses 15+ times while trying to roll for the other boss in that area. I'd love it if the devs weighted it so that you could get new dungeons on your second or third pass instead of having to constantly re-roll. It makes the experience way less rewarding and the game feel more like a chore. If I got all the bosses on my second or third pass, I'd be more willing to come back and experiment with more builds.

As many claim, this game's boss fights were probably designed with groups in mind and I'm pretty sure with proper role delegation among friends these would have been more manageable (and fun), but trying solo made it challenging and rewarding to keep trying. 
I'll admit that had I not been blessed by rng and ran into a weapon mod that allowed me to summon an AI companion, frustration might have been the prevalent experience at times.

+ Gameplay: Movement and combat feel very smooth and create exciting, tense moments
+ Setting: It's a different take on post apocalypse and while the story is not the focus here, I found it an intriguing backdrop with some interesting characters
+ Replayability: Random map layouts, bosses and dungeons are good enough reasons to come back again. Adventure mode also lets you revisit worlds without messing with campaign progress
+ Variety: There's more than a few bosses as well as lots of traits, weapons and modifications to try out

~ Most bosses are quite unique and interesting, but playing solo can make managing them and their adds overwhelming without the right equipment
~ World layout: Being randomly generated, no map will ever be quite the same, but they will also never be as interesting as a hand crafted experience. There's no Firelink shrine here
~ Difficulty curve: As is common with these sort of games, just traversing the world and dungeons felt quite hard at first as you're new to the mechanics, but got less challening (and at times a bit too easy) over time. Bosses were always a threat though

- Level progression: The difficulty of the world being bound to the level of your gear makes you hesitant in upgrading it. It felt like the best idea was to hold out on upgrading as long as comfortably possible and then use your materials to get a buff for a particularily difficult challenge. It's not the worst system, but always having those mechanics in mind takes you out of the immersion (and satisfaction of chracter progress)

All in all it's a strong recommendation as a game somewhere between Dark Souls and Left 4 Dead. I wouldn't even hesitate to try it solo (if you don't mind giving bosses the occasional 37th try).",1636131584,1669155832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is getting on a bit now but it is well worth picking up if you haven't played it.
The maps and graphics are fantastic and the motion and game play is super smooth. The enemies and boss mechanics are varied and fun to work out, although they can be frustratingly difficult at times, until you work out their attacks. 

Above all, this game has fantastic replayability and you will have to play through it a few times if you want to get all the gear as the levels, side quests and bosses are randomly rolled and change each time.

In my opinion, a much better version of dark souls.

p.s. the 2 DLC are well worth picking up, especially in the current sale.

I only wish there was more of this game, a second game of It or just them adding more content to this one.

I cant really find anything bad to say about this game but that doesint make it a 10/10 or anything, i cant give it any rating to be honest its just a personal favorite nische game nobody knows about really.

Achievements are fairly easy for the most part, mostly requiring RNG (Praying that the right item or area spawns in your adventure mode). 

If you're going to grind for ANYTHING in this game, achievements or items, I highly highly recommend Remnant: From the Ashes World Analyzer. This will 1000% guarantee to cut down the grind. 

Save Analyzer will tell you what has spawned in your currently rolled adventure (or campaign!) world. It takes roughly an hour to clear an Adventure, but the world analyzer will tell you (upon loading into the world) what is and isn't there, thus saving you many hours. Looking for a certain ring? Easy. Need Fetid Pools for glowing fragments? It'll tell you if it's there or not. Want to know all the bosses you're going to be facing? Also included. 

If you're playing casually, a single run through the campaign won't take you too long (depending on skill). If you really like how the game feels, Adventure Mode can keep you going for a very long time.

The game is sometimes clearly designed with co-op and not single player in mind and this mostly evident during the bosses.

The bosses all inflict one or more status debuffs either through their own attacks or the endless ads that spawn for most of the fights. One of the first potential bosses can inflict bleed (this does DOT and debuffs healing) and the arena will produce kamikaze enemies that can inflict Rot (this sometimes interrupts animations with coughing).

There's even a double boss fight where ads spawn in periodic swarms. I'm maybe halfway or more through the base game and not a single boss encounter has actually been fun because of the ads and the only fight I've seen so far that doesn't have them is a double boss fight on a narrow bridge where the bosses use lasers to push you off the bridge and AOEs that inflict debuffs. The vast majority of my deaths have been during bossfights to the ads and only a few bosses have actually killed me themselves. One of your first potential boss fights is a game of hide and seek with a teleporting archer that sometimes nukes your general area with rot while you're being chased around by a mob of enemies. 

Another fight is with a large monsters that deals a lot of damage with its attacks and sometimes charges down hallways and will climb up into the ceiling and plop down somewhere else. He gives a sort of Tyrant vibe with how he slowly walks down the hall before he attacks. He'd be a pretty cool fight but the cramped halls are flooded with enemies that explode on death, create a temporary DOT field in addition to the permanent ones made by destructables in the corners of the arena and all the DOTs can half your stamina.

The final boss is pretty rough because it can stun lock and essentially one shot players and if you die you have to do the first phase again.

Granted, the ads are how you get ammo back during the fight but I noticed during the bridge fight that destroying the walls of the bridge gives ammo and I don't understand why more fights couldn't have just done that with crates. Also there is a ammo box item that restocks your ammo that can be bought from merchants anyway.

The game also does that thing where you have to cut some boss parts off or kill two bosses at the same time to get some items. You only get one item or the other and you have to use ""adventure mode"" to re-roll the area and hope the RNG is merciful if you want the other item from the boss but at least it doesn't leave the item you get purely up to RNG like Artorias' greatsword in  Dark Souls  and force you to play the whole game again if you want a certain weapon.",1667679032,1668282526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

IRRITATING STUFF
- Ward 13 hub world and the opening hours of story are quite the bore. You have to actively push past the opening hours of the game for the art direction, cool ideas and excellent combat to start seeping in. 
- Story never gets good.
- The leveling and enemy scaling is confusing and anxiety inducing. Things start to click as you play more but I kept checking google to make sure I wasn't shooting myself in the foot by upgrading my gear.
- Sweet jesus I wish there was a loadout system or a way to tag gear as favorites.
- Performance is horribly impacted by enabling shadows to medium or higher and it feels wrong.

GOOD STUFF
+ Once acclimated to the game systems the combat and power fantasy are excellent.
+ Lots of cool and well designed bosses. 
+ Great visual/audio/design experience once you get past Ward 13 and Earth.
++++ Discovering Adventures near the end of the campaign was GREAT.

When I got back to the end of the campaign, I steam rolled it and it was extremely satisfying. Didn't last forever but it was an extremely fun chunk of gaming.

It definitely still holds up even in 2022, and looks stunning for a 3 year old game. It has great replayability due to the loot and world-gen system. It'll take several playthroughs to get every gear piece and weapon due to this, but doesn't feel grindy and instead feels very rewarding.
I wouldn't say the difficulty is that bad, especially if with friends. The game itself can present a challenge (especially at higher difficulties) but ultimately is part of the experience. You try the boss a couple times but ultimately figure out a strategy to kill it; it can get frustrating but after you finally complete it an amazing feeling of relief and fulfillment washes over you. If something like that doesn't sound fun, this may not be the game for you.
Gunplay is pretty solid and combat itself feels balanced as there are a lot of different optimal builds and strategies (some are definitely better than others-but the really overpowered ones are locked behind several playthroughs so it's all in all pretty fair).
My biggest complaint about this game is that there aren't more DLC's, which is why I'm seriously hoping that Gunfire comes out with a sequel at some point.",1667796130,1667796226,True,22,0,0.696055233478546143,0,True,False,False

It is better then the sum of its parts, since if you look closely upon every part you see a lot of flaws. I hardly know where to begin. I like shooters, but I don't like souls-like: this game is more for souls-like fans imo.   
Shooting is fun, but flawed.  
Remember when Dragon Age:Origins caught flak for having an NPC stand around in your parties camp to advertize its DLC to you? This game does the same with NPC vendors just standing in your base for DLC gear you can't get as  a reminder that you can/need to buy the game part they stripped out for DLC. Just nobody is surprised by that kind of shitty design anymore to make a fuss about it I guess.

The Good:
The world/map designs are very atmospheric, visual fidelity isn't al that great but it makes use of what it has. The bad part: using the map to travel around checkpoint is poorly designed: you can't see what checkpoint is what or where. And walking around a big base or a map where there are longs swaths of just space where nothing's happening.  
The enemy designs are original for the most part, lots of variety if you take into account that there are multiple worlds to explore around in. The bad part: they just try to bumrush you constantly, running away or hiding for a bit so you can heal was made a lot harder because of this. Make of that what you will.  
The shooting was a lot of fun, guns feel snappy. The downside: you can only fire guns from ADS (iron sight) which gives other enemies always the option to approach you from off-screen since you are zoomed in. Field of view becomes useless.  Trying to rely on audio-cues for this didn't work either. I think its poor audio placement. You could argue that that just means you need to be aware of your surroundings, but the game can just spawns enemies behind you whenever it wants, that works adverse to that idea. It doesn't gel for me: instead of fighting/shooting, i need to stop doing that to check my direct surroundings...feels like a bad flow.  

Weapons and armor: The upgrade system that is in place makes any extra gear you find superfluos: If you try to spread upgrades around too much you end up underpowered and underarmored: stick with a handfull of weapons and invest in 1, maybe a 2nd armor set. It is that, or grind away for scrap/iron. You also find no real loot (in the first few worlds i played in at least): just scrap and iron. The entire armor/weapon system reminded me of Mass Effect 1: incremental upgrades and a lot of hassle to figure out what was optimal for use when checking for resistances, damage, etc. Also the game just throws a lot of rings at you and nothing else...not a bad system as a whole, I just found it not very interesting and tedious to use.  
 
The controls: also a mixed bag when using mouse and keyboard: Not being able to customize controls for something as basic as 'toggle run', is a serious flaw. And having deault mouse click revert to a melee attack when not ADS in is a choice I guess. It works, but I am not a fan of it and you can't customize beyond it.  
The Lore is something that is hidden away in the game, I liked discovering bits and bops around the place, but then trying to interact/ask npc's about things I discovered was just not an option.  

The Boss fights: this is where the big meat of the game should be according to most people. I was just annoyed for most of the fights I encountered so far. Visually cool looking, but the fights get hampered by 'and lets spawn some trash mobs as well' gameplay. Combined with my earlier gripes about the controls, the forced ADS, the game just becomes an exercise in frustrations that could have been easily avoided if the audio and control designs were just a better.    

Overall this is a game to pick up on sale (which I did) but even then it has annoying flaws that keep it from being a really good game. I would give it a 6.5/10. It is mostly for fans of these kind of games",1667136804,1667136804,False,99,17,0.529371023178100586,5,True,False,False

The story is barely there, NPCs are not interesting and worldbuilding is scarce. The game could definitely benefit from a better artistic direction, but what is already there is really quite good. Shooting is fun and your character feels sufficiently heavy. There's some gear variety ranging from typical post-apocalyptic attire to bonelike armor. I really like the visual changes to weapons that come with attaching skill mods to them. Some locations are rich in amazing atmosphere. Weapon and trait progression encourages repeat playthroughs of vairious levels as you can drop stuff and ""discover"" traits/stats somewhat randomly, beating the story without unlocking half of the available gear.

Because even after you get every single item and kill every single boss (at least twice) it does not stop being fun playing with your friends. Coop games like this one are incredibly rare.

Although, there's a lot of loot, I would not call it a looter shooter. Loot game is pretty weak and simple. What is not weak, though, are the weapons. Each one feels distinctive, original and well executed. It is just fun to shoot with almost every weapon! The weaker side here would be melee combat, which has it's own advantages, but overall is not on par with the ranged combat in this game.

Game structure is interesting, where you ""roll"" every biome and that biome along with it's 2-3 dungeons are randomized once per roll + enemy placement and their numbers are randomized every death. So each run of the campaign and adventure mode (where you can roll and farm each biome separately) will have different dungeons, bosses, weapons, armor and so on.

The game is challenging on two last difficulties, but not very hard otherwise. Some similar mechanics to Souls games (stamina based roll, checkpoint touching, etc.), but it didn't feel to me a ""souls-like"", it is an original enough game that you will remember as Remnant and not a souls clone. Game has a good build diversity and very pleasant art-style. Story is weak, although has some funny surprises. Very well made audio, very helpful in combat, voicing is not.

This is AA game that is made well, has fun and engaging loop, well implemented and satisfying combat and full coop design where you can play literally anything with your friends (outside of the starting mission) and have a ton of fun!

This is a third person shooter with RPG elements, several superficial surface-level similarities to Souls games (death is meaningless, resting at 'bonfires' respawnw enemies, healing is limited, dodge mechanic means don't get hit, stamina management, exploration is important, titanite-ish upgrade system, boss fights, a safe hub level with all your NPC vendors, etc), a beautiful post-apocalyptic semi-open world with optional areas to explore at your leisure, and a stylized graphic novel presentation (similar to most Telltale titles). It is also ""difficult"", and we all know that everyone loves to slap ""Dark Souls"" onto any game that doesn't just hand you progress on a silver platter. However any and all difficulty can easily be countered by the same philosophy that can get you through Dark Souls: GIT GUD SCRUBLORD. Or summon help from friends. That also works too.

You lose nothing on death (except for pride). Your character speaks. This is not Dark Souls with guns. It is a completely different experience. ""So it's Bloodborne"" ha ha ha ha NO but also yes. If you're expecting Dark Souls and you're a filthy casual who relies on shields and parrying, you're gonna have a bad time. If you're expecting Bloodborne, you're a whole lot closer there.

617290,57142081,76561198037726801,0,11,756,0,588,1619908515,"Let me start by saying that even though I don't recommend buying this game it's not because I find no enjoyment in it. I think there is a lot to like about this game, the gunplay feels good, the weapon choices feel diverse and meaningful, and the mods add an interesting angle to combat. However I can't in good faith recommend this game because I have one major issue in trying to play this game and that is the boss design. Some bosses are fine, but there are a few that are just unfun to fight. (Note that just because I did not have fun with a boss does not mean it was an inherently difficult boss.)

Every boss in the game has minions that it will summon throughout the fight and in a game like this that in and of itself is not an issue, enemies spawning means your ammo keeps getting refreshed so it can actually be to some boss fights benefits. However it does not seem like all of them were thought through very well as there will be times where you have to deal with self destructing enemies while fighting a boss in cramped corridors. This is very frustrating, far too many times did I dodge a blow from particular boss only for a self destructing enemy to rush around the corner and stagger me with an explosion and then the boss would follow up with a killing blow. 

This in and of itself would be less of an issue if healing didn't take a second to take effect, some bosses you do not get enough breathing room to actually heal. Every form of healing has some limitation that prevents you from doing it during a boss fight. When you are dealing with a boss constantly charging you you need a few moments of fresh air to actually stand a chance, but these rare moments are interrupted by another enemy attacking you which cancels the healing. There is an exception with one power that gives healing in an area, however staying in a limited area for too long can easily get you killed.

In some cases bosses are just big bags of hit points and there's no real skill in dispatching them, just needing to remain patient as you cycle through dodging, shooting, and reloading. These are particularly unfun because there's no particular challenge in fighting them other than not losing your patience. However even these are more enjoyable than the specific example I am going to be giving.

Riphide is not fun to fight. It has 4 basic moves, a ranged attack, a melee attack, a healing power, and a wave attack that hits the entire battlefield. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well that's because I haven't explained Riphide's unique mechanic. Riphide is not a singular enemy, it is multiple enemies that share a singular healthbar. It starts as 2 and at 75% of it's health it will divide into 4 enemies, at 50% it will divide into 8, I have not gotten him down to 25% but I assume he will divide again into 16 (apologies if this assumption is incorrect). Each enemy is individually capable of using all of his moves, meaning at any given time you have to be aware of up to 16 enemies who could be charging you, getting ready to shoot you, healing itself (which since it's a shared healthbar means they're all healed), or firing a wave that hits the entire battlefield. This healing is done over time and an enemy is immobile while doing it, it can be interrupted with a single attack however this is easier said than done as you will soon find anywhere from 3 to 15 enemies between you and the one healing the entire group. They cannot be killed individually, every single one is alive until the healthbar runs out. If you would argue that this boss sounds fun then power to you, but it is just too much of a headache keeping track of everything at once for me.",1573703642,1665981392,False,1,1,0.447820335626602173,0,True,False,False

Aside from ranged combat with modern weapons, the other things that sets Remnant apart from other Souls-likes would be how its Campaign is structured with randomised elements--bosses, dungeons, encounters and drops per region--as well as how you can functionally access the end-game with Adventure Mode at any time. Your character progress carried between the two. If you don't get a certain event, dungeon, encounter, boss, drop or whatever you can roll and re-roll Adventure Mode until you get what you want. 

Adventure Mode farming is where the game's longevity truly lies. There are so many weapon mods, traits, long-range, short-range, melee weapons, armour, trinkets to collect, The game's greatest strength, variety through randomisation, is also where its frustration lies if you're a completionist or chasing a specific weapon, trait or whatever because you just have to run and re-run a region in Adventure Mode until the event or drop you need appears.

Where do I even begin? I bought this to feature in a bad games compilation, but I expected it to be the lightest offender on the list. Souls formatting with guns? How do you f*ck that up? Well, let me tell you.

Firstly, unplayable netcode from the ground up, where said netcode can literally crash your game or cause frequent disconnects, and this is on top of lagstep behavior (a couple seconds of having everything work, then everything halts, then speeds up or teleports to resume, leading to buffered attacks and damage, unavoidable attacks, constant teleportation or temporary noclip, or even outright dropping dead randomly). On gigabit ethernet for both people involved in the testing, with no similar problems in other games, it's fair to say that this is unique to this game, especially when I can find nearly identical issue reports dating as far back as this game's launch month.

Another reviewer mentioned a fairly critical flaw in their boss design, and it's entirely accurate: minion barrage. Every single boss encounter in this game spams minions along with a randomly-generated trait to the boss itself, leading to not just entirely ""lol xd quirky and random"" fights, but outright tedium, where sometimes you can get one-shot walking into the boss arena due to immediate AoE spam. If that's not to your liking, what about a giant boss which spams seeker mortars of gas along with spamming suicider enemies which also have gas? Or what about the fact that large enemies can actually ignore level geometry and hit you through pillars or solid walls? Tack on the fact that a lot of bosses are just upgraded variants of world encounter enemies, and you have a pretty bad negative: most bosses feel like a poor implementation of a roguelite's boss roster. If tedious grind is how I cut through bosses rather than skill, how does this even hold a candle to the Souls framework?

Finally, the performance. Now, a lot, and I mean a LOT, of UE4 and Unity games perform like trash and are horribly optimized, but this is Aliens Fireteam Elite levels of bad in design and optimization. A plain, glowing crystal in the middle of your home area magically takes up over 80 FPS out of my 200 FPS average, and that's with config tweaking and all. If a simple glowing prop takes up over 40% of your average power, that is hideous and leaves only horrors to the imagination as to how it was passed in QA. Without optimizations or tweaks, or even outright sacrificing your resolution, you're looking at an average of maybe 70, best case scenario? This game somehow matches Aliens Fireteam Elite, and again, that's impressively bad.

So, unplayable netcode, terrible spammy design, and some pretty shallow depth with some harsh limits on upgrading to really nail that home. Even after three years, these things remain prevalent issues. Do not buy this game, spend the money on literally anything else.",1664748589,1664748608,False,3,0,0.484754890203475952,0,True,False,False

Remnant: From the Ashes is, in my eyes, a very different experience. Although it's certainly a third person shooter at heart, the integration of many souls-like elements produces a very unique and satisfying gameplay loop that's kept me engaged long after 100% completion. That, paired with its unique procedural generation for each campaign experience, sets it aside from from anything else I've ever played.

There's more to it than most people think. I don't even think people can really have a good grasp on this game by their first clear of the final boss, unless they go out of their way to do a lot of optional content first. I've had friends think I'm insane for sinking as many hours into this game as I have, but after they've played it for more than just a few hours (and not on Normal difficulty), each of them finally understood.

This is an example of a game that put gameplay first. This is not necessarily a good thing. It is clear that things like the story, NPCs, etc. took the backburner. There's a little less layout variety than I would like. There's a lot of bugs left unpatched. But in my eyes, the positives of this game outweigh those drawbacks by a long shot.

I would say without a doubt that you should give it a try. The mechanics are easy enough to learn, and I think it's likely that you'll be drawn into the game despite whatever issues it may have. And there is still an abundance of community resources to help you with whatever questions or issues you have. Despite this game's low playercount in the last year, there's no shortage of devoted players willing to help in whatever way they can, as well as a plethora of different apps and sites to provide various utilities for the player.

Original review:

[strike]Not finished yet - not even close actually. But I can say I'm enjoying myself. The gunplay is fun: the tight dodges and high enemy damage (on Nightmare anyways) feel satisfying while you pump shotgun blasts in between rolls. The enemy types, although a little samey across environments, are decently balanced. Rarely does a monster stand out as unfair.

There's a few problems but not enough to be dealbreakers. Gear balancing feels iffy. Visual variety is not great. The mechanics around switching from melee to ranged combat is the opposite of intuitive. But, these are not major concerns.

As far as how the game works, I have no clue. Feels almost like a roguelike except death sets you back to checkpoint - not the beginning. Randomly generated campaign progression, mutually exclusive bosses, stuff like that definitely was not my impression of the game on the store. Not to say I'm not enjoying it. 

Last thing,  a complaint and warning - either I'm illiterate, or the game decided to NOT explain the extent to which difficulty matters. I'm certain it didn't mention to me the ramifications of choosing Nightmare - and now I'm stuck playing a difficulty specifically designed for characters on a New Game+. So everything is a sponge and can practically two-hit me. I believed the difficulty setting  I can't alter the difficulty - the only option is to start entirely fresh on my character and campaign.

But yes - other than the difficulty thing, this game is pretty fun.[/strike]",1617874879,1664246721,True,5,0,0.564397513866424561,0,True,False,False

Loved the game starting out but once you get to endgame is where you see this games major flaws and just how clunky it can be.

TLDR; Play Vermitide 2 instead.

Even though there is fun in this game, the horrible implementation of non-boss content and lack of player guidance really ruin it for me.

1. Players cannot beat the first boss in the game without first leveling up their gear, getting mods and leveling up traits - Okay! No big deal, you can just grind the content before the boss, right? 
What content? 
The path to the very first boss is too short to give enough XP to level up quickly. Did the developer make the content path longer in a hotfix? No, they left it half done. This means you get to repeat the 10 minutes worth of crap enemies for 6 trait levels. It is amazing to me that the VERY FIRST FEW HOURS OF GAME PLAY ARE THIS HORRIBLE and the game has good reviews.

2. This is a loot RPG game. You'd think it would be easy to figure out. The game play should literally be ""kill, loot, upgrade, repeat."" However, the content design department dropped the ball on communication and the result is everyone having to read a damn walk through to figure out how to play the game.

3. The first mission you get gives no real helpful information. Do I enter the sewer to get to the subway?? Who knows. Instead of giving the player a few breadcrumbs through the sewer so there is no confusion, the mission is kept vague and can't even be completed after your first boss fight. This makes no sense. How hard could it have been to guide the player to the first boss fight after the tutorial? This is GARBAGE game design.

4. Overhead radar communicates too little. I'm not sure why Gunfire Games bothered adding it. The only time it is partially useful is when you passed a path and notice the fog of war. Otherwise the map has limited use.

5. Found a hidden place in the level? There will never be loot there, ever. Some diligent level designer created areas off the main path for loot--but then didn't place any loot in those locations. It could have been 1 scrap, I don't care, at least it is something.

6. I've encountered 2 bosses. Boss one: no enemies but the boss itself. Failed attempts at beating the boss gets players NO XP. Boss two: makes enemies spawn, players get XP even when he fails. Was QA just not involved in the development process? How did no one notice that the very first boss fight is both not enjoyable and a waste of time?",1598284518,1662591568,False,5,3,0.384255409240722656,0,True,False,False

The Good: Purchased when on sale. Satisfying gameplay loop of shoot, loot, upgrade, new area, repeat. Very diverse amount of bosses, if you like boss run games, this is for you. Labyrinth mode plays like a third person Binding of Issac shooter. Very addicting,

The Bad: Randomized maps. This is a terrible idea. If you like exploring, there is already plenty of it. Need to find a weapon? How about restart your playthrough to find it. This leads to more grinding for less rewards, and being stuck in a single playstyle for hours or even entire playthroughs. Also due to this, you cannot see which map leads to where when in game, and can be lost searching for some NPC or weapon that simply didn't spawn in your playthrough's world. 
If this were fixed or a ""set world playthrough"" mode was released, the game would be a 3/5. If you could unlock weapons after set points in the game instead of looking for something that simply didn't spawn in your playthrough, 4/5.

The unclean one, the fight with this boss in the basement (not the standard one), that felt like he is adapting, mixing up attacks and switching targets when comfortable for him!

You'd think that would ruin any sort of challenge a souls-like is suppose to have, but if anything it makes it more difficult. When your main source of damage is a ranged weapon, that gives the devs the ability to ramp up encounters with varied enemies. 

My only real con with the game is how tedious the game feels near the endgame. I started with the rifle and repeater pistol, and ended with the rifle and some SMG i found randomly.

Okay I get it... this is a Dark Souls style game but not nearly as good.
The combat in Remnant is SLOW. Its frustratingly clunky with long combat animation and horrible input delay. (it takes 4 seconds to complete a dodge and getting hit will cost you 5 seconds of crying while your enemy continues to hit you)
If there was someway to include the combat gameplay of Shadows of Mordor you might have something with this game but sadly it stinks comparison.
There are just too many better options out there. (Red Dead Online, Aliens Fireteam, State of Decay, Clancy's Division, Warframe, Destiny, Strange Brigade, and most MMO's like Conan Unchained, Elder Scrolls and Secret World.",1661920251,1661920251,False,0,0,0.457939296960830688,0,True,False,False

- Normal: A casual yet still fairly challenging (if you play solo) playthrough. You can enjoy the story easier and there is a LOT to read (so I kinda recommend playing solo for the story) and immerse yourself in.

- Hard: A slightly more difficult but still manageable mode, not over the top but provides a fair and balanced difficulty increase. Still easy for squads of 3 but you'll probably still die a few times anyways.

- Nightmare: You guessed it, it's a nightmare. The game for some reason decided to make the difference between Normal/Hard and Nightmare/Apocalypse literally massive. Enemies have way more health and some mobs can 2 shot you. Yeah, it's hard. However if you are playing with a trio and have some experience I HIGHLY recommend trying this difficulty out, it's a lot of fun (personally) for me and my friends to experience an actual challenge together. I will say, however; that for some this difficulty may prove to be too much.

- Apocalypse: You will die. Many times. Will you persevere or beg for mercy? That, my friend; is up to you. This difficulty will break you down, you may even rage. But if it isn't satisfying to kill a boss on this difficulty I don't know what is. Truly this is a difficulty level for true gamers.

I should also add that aside from the main story and difficulty there is also Survival Mode which has no effect on the main campaign *(apart from unlocking rewards by killing a number of bosses in one run)* and Adventure Mode which doesn't rewrite your main campaign but allows you to farm resources and retry an area to get different bosses freely. I will also add that you CAN in fact reroll your campaign at any time you so desire, allowing you to change the difficulty and everything. 

Benefits to each game mode.

Main Campaign - Story Progression, Loot, Unlocks
Adventure Mode - Loot, Unlocks
Survival: Unlocks

Tips

- I recommend playing Single Player on Normal difficulty, you can change difficulty at any time anyways to make the game more challenging if you so desire by rerolling campaign or doing a quick Adventure Mode instance. 

- I recommend playing Survival Mode with 3 players (preferably friends and with a stable connection) as playing it solo is really difficult and time consuming, not to mention if you end up getting knocked down it's GG.

- I recommend not restarting main campaign if you want to get a different boss weapon/items because you can just use the Adventure Mode to farm them, it's all luck based regardless.

- Your equipment level will determine your in-game difficulty, meaning if your friend starts a new character and you are on a character with level 20 gear, your friend will be getting absolutely destroyed by the easiest mobs in the game because his equipment won't be up to standard. Make sure to take caution with how you build and work around your friends/randos within the game so you aren't ruining the game for anyone.

- There is a TON of hidden loot, if someone is running around collecting it - may be worth it to allow them the time to run around and collect, never know what they may find. Instead of just kicking them from the game for taking too long, maybe go help them out and look for loot alongside them. If you really don't want to wait up obviously you can just kick them, but more often than not they will find something you may have missed. 

- Have fun!",1661863753,1661863753,True,18,0,0.720902979373931885,0,True,False,False

The premise of the story sounds interesting but is extremely shallow. The game only lasted for around 6 hours. Most of the extra time was spend looking for logs to read and grinding different guns. Most bosses don't feel rewarding to kill because they are either extrmely easy or have a attack pattern you simply cannot dodge at times.

The game allows you to build traits, armor, weapons, mods, etc--to get the stats that you're wanting to create a unique build. The game's ability to reroll the maps make it to where every experience really does feel unique. It's repeatable, replayable, and enjoyable.

1- Enemy Scaling: is a gimmick that's past overdue, it has to go... Hear me out: You give players the choice between 4 levels of difficculty, but then you take that choice away. I start playing in Hard but suck at it, so I switch to normal so I can get the hang of it and get better gear to better deal with hardened enemies in higher difficculty levels, but turns out, if I reroll the campaign in a higher level, enemies are not only harder because the mode is harder, they have also scaled up with my gear, so they are double hard. Why did I took my time to plan my progress and the points I would spend on the traits I need the most if again, I'm going to be weak as if I haven't progressed at all???

The point is: why give players the choice of difficculty levels and then take that choice away? That's a design flaw that's screams ""western ARPG"" (cough cough Bethesda). Instead of upping the dificculty by making enemies be more forgiving and have a slower attack rate at lower levels, but react faster and attack more relentlesly in higher levels (and maybe add a random resistance to stagger and knockdown so enemies are not impossible to KD but add the chaos factor that sometimes they will not be staggered), devs lean way too much on ""just make 'em take and deal more damage"". It's the cardinal sin of Bethesda's RPGs where the only way they know of making the game harder is gIvE ThEm mOrE HiT pOiNtS. Please don't be that dev team for an otherwise awesome game

2- The story is barebones of a story: I know it tries to emulate the cryptic and mysterious Souls narrative, but... Souls games have FIRST the deep lore, and THEN the clues scattered across the game. In RFTA the narrative feels like a classic western ARPG with dialogues, interactions and cutscenes, but then the player agency that feels natural is not included in the gameplay, for example. you not only meet The Founder (grandpa of the current Ward 13 commander), but also his wife (commander Ford's grandma), and you know they are related, but they have no interaction at all..? Nor I can suggest them their relatives are RIGHT THERE..? It doesn't feels mysterious and thought provoking, it feels lacking. Sorry, I like the setting very much, but I have to be completely honest after going through the campaign 4 times, Ward 13 is ""nice"" but the 2nd playthrugh starts to feel lacking, and thein it feels stale. 

I'm not hating on the game, I still love playing it, but it has flaws that future players need to know and devs need to acknowledge.

PREVIOUS REVIEW (for which I still stand by)

Super super fun, it gets frustrating and unfair until you understand what's happening, and I love that. I love when games don't rely on holding the player's hand. Is not Dark Souls, but it has the spirit. Combat is super super fun. The randomizing gets repetitive but is not game breaking, if anything, it adds to its charm.

Weapons: all weapons, all gear, everything is useful, there is not one weapon that cannot hold its own until the very end game. There is no armor or gear that is objectively superior to other, all have its usefulness and everything is balanced (except maybe the DLC hand weapons that can emit a blast of energy at no ammo cost but even those are not game breaking)

Play it with friends, it's super cool to get obliterated by bosses or areas together",1659453357,1660736924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

interesting gameplay mechanics : sliding and neutral dodges are satisfying and rewarding to use when you are familiar with enemy movements. Yes, sliding has I-frames. Few people know this.

Gear sets are interesting.  Items are easy to manage

Maps are beautiful. Some areas are fun to explore and I will never get tired of it.

Adventurer mode adds so much replayability

DLC boss designs are extremely good

You get different rewards from boss when achieving ""Alternate kill""

Cons:
Lots of bosses(exclude DLC ones) difficulty rely on mobs. 

Certain rewards are locked behind a chain of rare events which is painful for completionist like me. Luckily, they are not essential to most builds. They are usually for fun or creative use.

It was developed by Machine Gun Games, who were also responsible for the underrated Darksiders 3 which, itself, discarded the Zelda/Diablo trappings of its predecessors and, instead, drew inspiration from the Souls games. Clearly, Machine Gun are big fans of From‚Äôs output.

Story

Planet Earth has been invaded and taken over by ‚ÄúThe Root‚Äù, mysterious tree-like aliens from a parallel universe. Your task, as one of Earths last survivors, is to solve the mysteries of The Root and destroy them. That‚Äôs the basic premise. There‚Äôs lore and backstory if you want to look for it but story mainly takes a backseat to the action here. It‚Äôs serviceable stuff, no real complaints.

Visuals

Nothing to write home about here. Playing the game on max settings and everything is just fine. The main character and enemies are decently animated and the game runs very smoothly. Where the visuals suffer the most is in terms of design. Machine Gun Games may be Souls fans, but I think their admiration is more focused on From‚Äôs gameplay philosophy and systems. Don‚Äôt expect anything that rivals the architectural wonders found in the Souls series. Much of the first part of the game is spent wandering the same old post-apocalyptic wasteland you‚Äôve seen dozens of times before (and not up there with the best representations; it‚Äôs quite bland). Things do get more interesting later in the game but keep your expectations in check here. Workmanlike is the word.

Sound

The sound design is actually pretty good. Gunshots are punchy and satisfying. Ambient sounds are nice though music is sparse enough that I can‚Äôt remember a single track. The one issue I have is with enemy proximity. The sound does an ok job of letting you know which direction an enemy is coming from, but it doesn‚Äôt give you a good sense of how close they are. Enemies will sometimes sound like they are right on top of you when, in fact, they are a couple of hundred meters away. Other than that sound is just fine, and the voice acting is decent enough.

Gameplay

The game is a third person shooter/RPG hybrid with some very basic melee thrown in. Not long after the game begins, you‚Äôll choose one of 3 classes which will determine your starting stats and equipment but does not lock you in to any specific play style. Depending on which you pick you will get a set of armour, a primary weapon, a pistol and a melee weapon. After that it‚Äôs pretty much straight into the action. RftA uses some method of procedural generation for its world/dungeons. By this I mean, dungeons do not change each time you enter them but rather the are generated for each specific playthrough of the game. Personally, I am not a fan of this approach to level design at all, it robs the game of that sense of personality that a game with completely authored level design has. As an example, Bloodborne is one of my all-time favourite games but I found the procedurally generated Chalice dungeons utterly boring visually and repetitive in terms of level design. Likewise, after only a few hours the cracks began to show in RftA. I started noticing the same connecters in the levels and one map, a sewer level, was around 90% identical to one I had traversed before. Your mileage may vary here, but I question the value of endless replay potential when the results are so repetitive and characterless. On the flip side this does give some interesting results regarding loot, enemy placement/types and bosses which can be entirely different from one playthrough to the next. 

Speaking of enemy placement, in general this is fine, but the game does have a nasty habit of spawning enemies out of nowhere, often accompanied by an elite enemy, something I really dislike in this type of game. It‚Äôs a feature that cheapens the feel of any shooter, in my opinion, with the exception of wave-based modes. This may be a by-product of the procedural generation, but I much prefer intelligent, pre-placed enemy configurations driving the challenge. The stealth (enemy awareness) stat is almost useless considering it can be undone by an enemy just spawning behind you. This happened to me numerous times while sneaking about, now I don‚Äôt bother. Bosses can also be challenging but rely a little too much on swarming the player with adds rather than the boss by itself being sufficiently challenging (probably to avoid making coop boss encounters too easy).

Ok, enough griping, time for some positives. I love the combat! The gunplay here really does shine, with great audio/visual feedback when you kill an enemy and the melee is seamlessly integrated with the gunplay making the game very easy to pick up and play. When you aren‚Äôt out shooting bad guys, you‚Äôll spend your time in the ‚ÄúWard‚Äù a sort of Nexus/Firelink Shrine/Hunters Dream equivalent that is, largely, safe but has scope for some exploration. Here you‚Äôll chat to NPCs, buy & upgrade weapons and armour and the systems in place to do this are very simple and easy to understand.

I imagine some folk are going to describe RftA as ‚Äúthe Dark Souls of looter shooters‚Äù, and while that is easy shorthand it doesn‚Äôt quite do it justice. For example; the loot. I love the way loot is handled in RftA. Instead of endlessly cycling through mountains of incremental upgrades and worthless trash, every weapon and piece of armour, in RftA, is useful and worth investing in. Loot doesn‚Äôt come thick and fast like, say, in Destiny or the Division but when you find something in RftA it‚Äôs much more exciting imo. Weapons & armour become something you cycle back & forth between strategically rather than something that gets replaced and never used again. It‚Äôs an honest and transparent way of handling loot and I hope it is not misunderstood as the game giving less than those other shooters with their piles of useless, random stat garbage. Levelling up your character attributes is done by acquiring ‚Äútraits‚Äù for your character, which you get by performing certain actions within the game, and spending XP points to improve these traits.

Difficulty wise the game is challenging, though the spawning of enemies makes it artificially so in some cases (sorry I really hate enemies that spawn out of nowhere!). The penalty for death is VERY lenient. It will take you back to your last crystal checkpoint, which are essentially RftA‚Äôs bonfire‚Äôs, but you will lose nothing upon death. Yes, the enemies you killed will respawn, but you keep all your XP and collected items. Long time Souls players will find this barely an inconvenience accustomed as they are to harsher penalties. Challenging as it can be, it should be possible for most people to finish especially with the drop in, drop out cooperative play. Speaking of the coop, I‚Äôm playing solo but did join a few games and invite once to my own game just to test. Both worked perfectly. Campaign progress is only saved for the host in coop but everything you earn in a host world is carried over to your own campaign. Not sure exactly how matchmaking works, I always ended up with hosts that were further into the campaign than me, maybe it‚Äôs related to character level? Thanks for adding gestures too Gunfire!

Verdict

RftA is a very enjoyable third person shooter with RPG trappings. While it does have some shortcomings, especially with regards to world/level design, the hugely enjoyable shooting mechanics and fantastic approach to loot make it well worth the investment at just over ¬£30! Hope the devs really support this one and looking forward to what they do with it in future! Great job Gunfire!

500 upvotes on that review but u dont see on the storepage - gg valve  

My review of subject DLC was banned because i said 2 bad words in it!
Corsus DLC is a freakin mess of rng on top of rng on top of rng - while the items r nice - the way to get them and the possibility the game MAYBE created the 2 or 3 random things together in ONE adventure is just outraging gamedesign (see DLC review)

In general i would give this a neutral review, the game as coop with friends or solo is really good but public coop and rerunning the same few worlds again and again and a forced/artificial rng system are major negative points.

I gotta say i love this game, especially the first 20-30 hours with a new character.
After that its gets a bit shallow, because u just rerun worlds and max out perks that just make u OP. I really wish the game had more content, more random tilesets for the existing worlds and more new worlds entirely. Playing through the  2 campaigns is way to fast.

A note about coop. This is coop with friends, not regular coop.
While it works, playing public with random players has MAJOR issues.
When u join a game its very likely that the game will have noteiceable delay!
90% of the puplic games that u join laag like hell! Some in forums claim thats due to the epic online services dll that was added to the game to allow crossplay with players who get the game on epic store.
In a game like Revnant where timing is crucial to basic gameplay, this is a major bummer!
When u host a campaign a client can change the outcome of decisions u have to do in the campaign! So when u play the campaign the first time, play it solo on normal difficulty!
There will also be some high geared and very experienced players joining u and rush through everything without a big deal. So, again, if u dont want ur gameplay to be ruined - play solo!

Survival would be THE gamemode for experienced players, but again in public coop without being able to communicate in any way or ping indicators this just doesnt work.
Survival would also need some small qol patches than it would be epic. 


Gameplay is really good, overall balance is well done. Progression feels good.
Solid grafcis, crisp and clean, no visual glitches.
Performance could be better though, regarding what the game needs to calculate and display and than compare that to other games - theres quite some room for improvement there. I had to put some settings on medium for most times stable 50 fps, although the difference in detail is not really noteiceable. (i5 4430 | GTX 680 4GB)
The game has a few worlds that u go through in the campaign. They are made of different sections and dungeons that are put together randomly with each new campaign (or adventure - u can start adventures at any time for ONE of those worlds, so u can farm for specific items, u dont need to do that, but its nice to be able to do that).
Which bosses u encounter is also random. Item drops as well, although most(all?) stuff is connected to a certain tileset section of the world.
Theres a 3rd party savegame analyzer availabe where one can check what was generated in the active campaign/adventure. 
Although i would STRONGLY suggest to stay away from that and adventures and play throuhg the campaign at least 2 times before hunting for specific items

For me one of the most annoying things of the game is that u can miss dungeons very easily. Its very easy to get confused where u have been already and where u still might need to go.
A strong deep orange marker means u havent been there yet - a slighty more greyed out orange marker means u were there already - took me 60 hours to notice that. Than sometimes u need to go back to a certain area/dungeon - theres fasttravel for that yes - but u need to remember the name of that section - for me its very confusing. It would be easy to fix that with proper markers and names for entrances on the map!


Possibility of corrupted savegames since release - still a topic? Make manual backups!

Coop game - no text chat!!! SERIOUSLY? Lazy devs! No excuse for that!
On top the voicechat doesnt work properly, like the res tof public coop its laaging and its interrupted - SO NO COMMUNICATION possible - nice coop!

The game has some flaws regarding matchmaking, joining of players - minor issue but would be nice to have that flawlessly working

Cheaters?  https://steamcommunity.com/app/617290/discussions/0/4325098189134098147/

400 hours in now, third of that was online, hosting myself or joining a game - didnt notice any cheaters

The game will sometimes note of possible cheating happening - which 99% of the times seems to be a false detection - it seems to happen due to players doing stuff repeatedly very fast (like switching stuff in inventory) with a bad connection (which is like i said above - most times the case in public coop)",1597689245,1659464805,True,0,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

This game is a Dark Souls clone if Dark Souls had ranged guns and rogue-like elements. It's a brief single player story but the pudding is in the gameplay. This game is incredibly fun and even more fun if you have friends, but I don't so that part is not fun, it's sad. I need friends in my life.

GRAPHICS - Great stuff. Not confusing this with real life, but it looks great and you won't ever say something like the graphics suck.

GAMEPLAY - It's fun as hell and fluid. I like to shoot the guns more than I do like to whack stuff, but you might be different. It's really good. If you like video games at all, you would at least appreciate this.

STORY - Ehh... Something about 'The Root' who are like tree people who wants to inject kids with their lifeforce so they can take over? I think? Who cares. It's fine. It's better than Super Mario Bros. storylines.

REPLAYABILITY - Fantastic. I wouldn't play it for a 2nd time if otherwise. It's RNG so every playthrough is different. I hate that but I guess I like it. I want more unlocks so I keep playing.

SOME PROS: Boss fights are great like Dark Souls. Lots of them and they are all different. You get cool rewards and they can be hard as horse manure - just like Dark Souls. Theres LOTS of variety to armor and weapons - just no shield because it's not Dark Souls. Pay attention. It's additctive and that's a good bad thing.

SOME CONS - I wish I could equip more than 2 weapons at a time. It's kind of annoying. Why give me like 20 weapons and mods if I can only use 2? 

Idk, this is a great game. I might edit this later. Probably not, but this is the review so far. I recommend it to people who hate roots.

The DLC is kind of lame so I hope they are prepping a sequel. 1 DLC should have been free, the 2nd is just rat people and rat enemies in a snow level. Not sure why they went with rats, but here we are.",1659336933,1659337287,True,14,8,0.665821313858032227,0,True,False,False

This game is honestly loads of fun to play with your friends! You can definitely play it solo as well, but i feel like running around together in a group with different weapons, mods, and builds feels a lot more satisfying. At this time i've put in about 130 hours into the game. So i feel like i have a pretty good feel for what it is. Remnant is a looter shooter, in the style of dark souls. So if you're into that type of game, this could be for you! I will say the game is very grindy, and requires multiple play throughs. I've put in as many hours as i have and still haven't played all scenarios and obtained all items. The story in this game however is a bit underwhelming. It's not bad, but it definitely isn't going to blow you away. Where this game shines is the satisfaction of beating those tough boss encounters, and crafting some insane weapons and weapon mods!! Some of them are absolutely nutty. This game has tons and tons of replay value to whoever is willing to put the time in. The only knock i've had thus far, is the game does have some kind of anti cheat software. And if for whatever reason your game freezes or crashes, you lose power, your pc overheats, whatever the case may be. There is a chance that your game save/file can become corrupt. And you will have to delete your save, and start entirely from square one again. That is a HUGE knock. Especially with a game like this where you have to grind. It happened to me 3 times and i was legit almost all set. But my pc at the time was garbage and iv'e since upgraded and haven't had any issues going forward. At the time it was aggravating, but somehow i pushed through and played again. Only because as i said this game really is awesome! So for those of you who enjoy looter shooters, and are into basically a dark souls with guns, this game is for you. If i had to put a rating on this game i would defintely give it 8.75/10. And i think thats a very fair score as this game will have you doing re-rolls til 4am lol GLHF and GGS! Hope this review was helful for some! :D",1588530236,1658636959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's as boring and unrewarding as walking to an ice cream shop you like then realising it's been closed down. It's lacking any sense of excitement and overall lacking in so many things like a sense of accomplishment like the only time I got this feeling was when I had completed the game as I had felt that I completed a chore that took 26 god damn hours and when you beat a boss that you've been stuck with for the past hour that's not a sense of accomplishment that's the feeling of hatred for the game devs for making this chore of a fucking game.

 Walking is boring in this game how do you even manage that? everything is boring with this game hell mostly annoying too. No excitement no sense of accomplishment no sense of danger in this game too, actually no I retract that, there are some senses like dread and a form of danger. Like when you die a third the way through a dungeon only to go spawn at the start when all the enemies have respawned and when you realise that you just wasted so much of your god damn time on this damn game only to be rewarded with nothing but a worthless achievement and a shitty mod or something bruh. This game has nothing that makes it stand out from literally anything else, anything could beat this game in any of it's genres ffs.

Story? nothing besides ""boohoo wood travels through worlds and makes them corrupt sadge :(((( my world guardian died boohoo :(("" yeah theres jack all lore man all i remember is dreamers and that shit literally so forgettable even if there was more my brain couldn't handle this brain cell killing trash.

This game has no redeeming features besides it's enemy variety i guess if you could even count that there's wood, flesh, alien, bug(?) species. I could feel all of my brain cells losing it while I held the W key for so long and to sometimes click on my mouse to kill enemies while I ran through the needlessly large main and secondary maps on the planets. Hell a part of me want's to finish the dlc so I can see if it redeems itself but I think it'll just be mid tier to trash through and through.

Likes:
- The game-play in general (movement, inventory management, ambiance)
- Difficulty (enough challenge, if you have rolled good map spawns for weapons)
- Dynamic map generation (not a single play-through is like other - besides the bosses)

Dislikes:
- Difficulty (it's pretty much impossible to finish the game if you get bad weapons from the dynamic spawn generation)

My main gripe is the same with all souls-like games I've played. That is finding where you need to go is very difficult at times. There is a late section with several maps that I had been over for at least 3 hours with growing frustration that almost made me give up. I know the designers want us to have the complete experience of their wonderful work, but they need to take into account the frustration meter of the players.

It has a lot of replay value and it doesn't feel too repetitive whenever you go through the same worlds. It's fun both with friends and alone and it has a fairly well done story in place. The weapon and armour designs are top notch and every single weapon mod is unique and brings something new to the gameplay whenever you mix around the builds.

If you like guns and dodging this is the game for you. 

That being said if you're the kind to be invested in stories, it's somewhat a different matter. About 80% of the story is locked in hours of gameplay, the other 20%, which is the ending, is locked behind a dlc which is, not gonna lie, a bit of a turn off if you're into lore stuff.
Don't get me wrong, I like looking for lore in the various corners of the maps, but having to go search up a mid tier prequel game that's vr exclusive and also having to buy a dlc to get a proper ending or an ending at all is pretty rough.

Plus in one of the ""endings"" of the base game you don't even get to fight a boss. You have to purchase another dlc and the dlc doesn't even give much else to the table. Just another map, a boss battle, and a new mode. The other dlc has 4 times the content and they're the same price!

Beat the normal campaign and working through the hard mode, finding myself in a greater challenge due to greater number of enemy ad spawns and higher hp for bosses and elites. The ""dungeons"" are fun overall, with a coin flip as to which end you spawn in on with each campaign you reroll. The gunplay in Remnant is something i love about this game the most, giving a ranged option* to each combat encounter. Of all the base world maps, the forest tileset is probably my favorite. The game shifts from grim and darker colors on the environment to mixed shades of greens and blues, etc. plus the enemies receive another fresh coat of paint (not a bad thing, keeps it interesting). 

The takeaway from this, The game is great overall, I actually prefer the aesthetic and gameplay of this to other soulsborne games or similar in the genre as a personal preference. The post apocalyptic feel combined with the mixed world weaponry and armors give the game a unique look that I've come to love. The bosses, while frustrating at times for someone like me, have many fair elements about them. If you don't pay attention, you're going to get hurt and potentially sent back to your last checkpoint, lol. The swarming ad-mobs at times can be..... less than favorable and makes me question the fairness of the game itself, but they aren't impossible so long as you learn with each encounter. Don't rush, take your time.

What i'm hoping for a sequel (if there is any) for this game. More variety on weaponry and armors, and more exploration on the concept of ""The Dreamers"" and their effect on the worlds. Many aspects can be taken from everything written in this game as far as lore and backstory goes, offering a plethora of directions to head in the future. I'm sure it will be a while until we may or may not see another Remnant game, especially after that random vr game was made (hate that was the case) but certainly still open to potential. Emphasize more on combat mechanics with the encounters, show more of a distinction between the big bosses and the elites and the mobs via design and behavior. Give even more exploratory rewards for traveling to different dungeons and areas. 

Overall, Great job, wonderful and fun game.

for most it will be a weak start. but for me i enjoyed the start of the game and was hoping they would expand on the starting area. but later on you will visit other areas and for most is when the game becomes interesting. would have been better if they didint go for the ranged dark souls and branched off as they have an interesting setting and enemies. Later on the game expands to different areas keeps things fresh.

what i liked:
-plenty of enemy variety, -Enemies dont feel too bullet spongy, -great atmosphere and beautiful scenery

what i didint like:
-boss fights arent too great and will spam minions that eat up ammo and dont guarantee ammo drops not to mention most are mandatory
-not much weapon variety (where the aks, m16, p2238's at?)
-Anemic mod carrying capacity. you only have 2 guns and some guns have a locked mod limiting your abilities you can have
-upgrade system is confusing and strange, enemies scale to your strongest weapon meaning you have to upgrade all equaly. and it vaguely tells you if you are at a disadvantage in upgrades via the advanced stats
-you are limited to 5 characters.  -Cant sell your armor to make it easier to organize.

suggestion: make it so players can chose their own difficulty in coop, one person can have normal scaling the other can have hard like in gears of war 2. - Would be nice to give teamates your consumables",1657598872,1657598872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Full Version. Not a bad game by any means, I'd love to see a more polished sequel. Most of the bosses and enemies are very repetitive and similar. Most of the bosses have the same attack style too. Summon minions and deal AOE damage. The story itself is okay too, maybe a touch anti-climatic. There's a bunch of threads that never really go anywhere. Biggest complaint is that RNG is such a factor. I missed out on pretty much all the really good items because I was unlucky and the dungeons that contained them didn't spawn in on my playthrough. Because of this RNG based seed, levels also feel very similar, winding corridors with a bunch of enemies. Gets pretty repetitive after awhile. That said? The mods are nice, the weapons are fun, and I like the style. It's a fun game even with some of the rougher edges.

I'd recommend it if you've got a few friends to play with you and it's on sale. Other than that? I hope the sequel, if there is one, ditches the RNG maps and does something cooler with the bosses.",1657307858,1657307858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has good replayability because you can unlock multiple guns and armors from the same map so you have to play the game again to unlock everything and each map has multiple bosses so every playthrough will be kind of different.
It has a game mode that you unlock when you finish the game called adventure mode, it lets you play a specific map instead of playing the entire campaign so if you only need/want to clear a map for specific items you don't have to play the entire game again if you don't want.
The game is 100% playable in coop from start to finish so that is a huge plus.
On the negative side the game is not so good optimized so you will have to turn down the graphics in order to play at higher refresh rates.

The concept is great, a souls-like shooter with upgrades you can acquire at your base, the shooting/combat is satisfying and feels good and well executed, the visuals are better than expected and look pretty nice.
That's all the positives I really have for this game.

There is basically no story, you get told to kill a boss for some item and return so the person you talked to can help you achieve your goal, your goal is to find some guy that knows how to get to a monster which is affecting the supply transport for your base... It's just piss weak and everything is told in cryptic dialogue only to seem more interesting while everything you do is incredibly basic.
It took me and a friend 10 hours to reach the end of the game, we explored literally everything and now the game offers us a new way of playing which is basically the same thing just slightly different.
The boss fights them self sometimes take place in cramped spaces making it difficult to see some attacks or where the boss is or the boss just attacks you through a wall.
The weapon and armour diversity is incredibly lacklustre.
Exploration is barely worth it, you're better off just racing to the end of the map and fight the boss, you won't find much worthwhile on your way to the next stage of the game.

There are just lot's of poor design choices for what could be a great game.

The game is bleak but the graphics are in and of themselves pretty. The story as far as I experienced it is good and mostly explained through semi long journal reads. I would have preferred shorter text bits more frequently but it makes sense that an entire journal would be a bit of a read, not really complaining about that.
The moment to moment gameplay is also not bad, I played as a squishy long range class and the gunplay is really satisfying, the melee does its job but I never felt like running out of ammo a whole lot so melee wasn't really all that necessary most of the time.
The reason I'm not recommending this game is because, after 6 hours I really just don't want to continue on. A lot of the bossfights really seem to have multiplayer in mind. I started playing on Hard but after encountering a boss that would have required me to endlessly kite him while avoiding exploding self destructing mobs it all just seemed like a bad use of my time. So I rerolled the campaign to easy. This made the game somewhat more enjoyable but now I had the opposite problem of the game feeling too easy. All the bossfights have a lot of adds and require some crowd control as well as dps which is where different specs in multiplayer would have come in. You can do the fights on easy well enough alone but it feels more like tedium and less like a challenge.
The zones I encountered were all either standard fare post-apocalyptic city or dilapidated office/research lab/subway tunnel. This is not really awe inspiring but I guess its to be expected in a post apocalyptic setting.
The enemy variety leaves something to be desired, I killed upwards of a hundred (maybe 200) mobs I'm pretty sure and what comes to mind is (spoilers): different variety of humanoid axe tree, bow and arrow tree, gun tree, big sword big muscles tree, summoner tree, weird little ball things that die in one hit, explody ball things, and one straight up dude that had something to say but I shot him in the face so I couldn't hear.... But it's mostly variant of humanoid axe tree guy.
The levelling system is kind of underwhelming, as is gearing. I feel like a lot of what is on offer is specifically designed to go well in synergy with other players which would be great if anyone I knew actually wanted to play this game with me.

It is completely possible that I haven't given the game enough of a chance but after forcing myself through abandoned lab no. 2 only to somehow end up in subway no. 2 (parts of it even had the exact same layout as no. 1) in the first 6 hours I just wasn't feeling it anymore. I think this game really would be much better to play with friends. Don't count on public matchmaking, that seemed pretty dead to me.

So yeah probably a thumbs up if you want to play this with a friend, definite thumbs down for solo players.",1656966771,1656966771,False,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False

I have got mixed feelings about this game. It had lots of potential that was unfortunately never quite realized.

The core gameplay is solid, it runs well, the coop is seamless, works great and imho [i]heavily[/i] carries this game (A good coop? In MY DS-esque game?). I found the game's atmosphere quite charming and enjoyable as well. But that is where the good stuff ends, unfortunately.

The single biggest issue is the length of the campaign. Me and my friend completed this game in about 7 hours, but that was while fucking around, needlessly upgrading stuff, exploring pretty much every nook and cranny and even reading some of the lore spread out throughout the game. You could do it under 4 hours easily if you just rushed through it and that is just ridiculous, especially considering the asking price.

As far as the story goes it is just, there. It is not necessarily terrible (though very basic and clich√©) but it does not feel very compelling either. Or like it matters all that much. All in all not a game you would play because of its story that is for sure.

While levels are randomly generated their design feels very linear. You could play this game absolutely wasted and still complete it as all you need to do is hold W and shoot stuff. Some would argue that the random generation of maps is a good thing. That it adds lots of replay value or some horseshit like that. It is all rubbish really, exploring completely empty buildings does not add ""replay value"", it just does not respect your time.

The only thing that adds some replay value to this title are the possible bosses you can encounter depending on your rng. The issue is that those bosses are not very well designed, any potential difficulty comes from them just spamming adds and as such most of them are not very memorable - all but 2 really, with the worst offender being the actual final boss of this game.

Speaking of the final boss: 
[spoiler] Is this an out-of-season April's Fool joke? The first stage lasts 30 seconds tops and the second stage consists of single mechanic and single attack. What the fuck is that. While a good ending can carry a mediocre title the reverse is just as true. This definitely left a sour taste in my mouth after what was overall a pretty enjoyable, if rough, experience.[/spoiler]

One last thing - I am not a fan of getting DLC gated loot. Like at all. I hope whoever came up with this BS gets his nuts bit off. :) 

I suppose I just expected something more out of this game. Personally I don't think it's worth it in single-player, there are plenty of better games you could be playing instead. But even then I would still recommend it if you've got someone to play with - it is genuinely fun in coop. Get it on sale though. This game has [i]nothing[/i] that would justify its price tag.",1656893878,1656947805,False,5,0,0.493304252624511719,0,True,False,False

- Dark souls with guns? Kinda, but not really. You will recognize the bonfires and unlock shortcuts after bosses, that kinda thing. The actual encounters are much more akin to an adventure game, though (ie, most have adds). Fighting more than one enemy at once is a conscious choice by the devs and the game is designed around it. Claiming you could beat a boss if it didn't have adds means you missed the point, got tunnelvision on the boss and ignored all the sound design, attack patterns, stagger mechanics and weapon mods this game offers.

Player count feels healthy to me, but I assume that's still thanks to Remnant having been free in the epic games store some time ago. Even before that happened though, I have never found no public lobbies at my level.

Honestly, I prefer playing solo anyway. Clearing worlds all alone on apocalypse (not recommended for new players btw) feels very rewarding. Every enemy makes sounds to announce itself and usually makes another sound when attacking, so even when you get surrounded it isn't too hard to stay in control of the fight.

Another thing I'd like to highlight is balancing and build diversity. On normal and hard (as well as nightmare for the most part), there isn't really a build I would advise against, on apocalypse the only build that struggles IMO is lifesteal/health regen, as you will generally take more damage than you can heal, unless you're good enough at dodging that you might as well use consumables instead.

Then there's animations and sound design, which are both great. I especially love the animation of players jumping out of windows from the second floor, the ""why the f*** did I do that"" expression is just great. The headshot crunch sound from a common enemy from one world is another personal highlight.

One last thing: even though this game is difficult, there is no punishment for dying. You will have lost some time, but you'll keep all your gear, all your max health, everything you picked up before you died will stay.",1602072460,1656931832,True,12,0,0.658367753028869629,0,True,False,False

No I can't, because you have stamina and everything walks faster than you run. If the warp speed boss isn't riding you, the ads hit you and you stop chugging. Most of the time you are also treated to being stun-locked. Boss hits you for 7/8ths of your health, you stagger, hit two finishes you. You have one chance to roll. Bummer if you have no stamina. 
The final straw is screen gets way to busy. You have smashy smashy stuff, smoke puffs, camera jiggly.

And did I mention you can't hip fire? I get that the devs are forcing the issue to use you melee at times, but melee is weak-sauce super slow. So in reality you just scope point blank. Get dizzying at times. But there is no incentive to max all 3 of you start weapons.

If you like Dark Souls and other Souls-like games, then it's definitely worth checking out. It's not the best Souls-like, but it's not a bad game. (Pro:) The areas are large and look nice, (Con:) but are often repetitive, linear just wide-open spaces with nothing to explore FOR. There is also a lot of back-tracking involved and it's easy to get lost or miss things. 
(PRO:) The game has an online co-op feature and it was very active during my playtime! There were almost always 1-3 people available who would join me. (CON:) Due to the open-world and all the back-tracking, I found myself relying heavily on these players because I would easily have gotten lost without them. 
(PRO:) There seems to be a good variety of bosses, (CON:) but many of them can easily be missed due to the fact that each level has mutiple possible bosses you can encounter but it is randomized so you might see 1 boss but not see the other for your entire playthrough. So I ""beat the game"" (the final boss) but only saw half the bosses along the way.
(PRO:) There is a decent variety of armor and weapons, but I found myself sticking with early game gear for most of the game (CON:) do to not finding a lot of gear during my playthrough, or find certain weapons to be very clunky. 

Overall, I found the game to be good but quite short. I haven't played the DLC's yet but I will whenever I pick up the game next. I found that once I completed the game, I didn't really see any re-play value at the time, but it is definitely something I'm sure I'll pick up again in the future and try again. But I would recommend playing this game all the same, but definitely get it on sale! 7/10

The core gameplay of it works fine and is enjoyable, but it very quickly devolves into a lot of frustration. This game is obviously drawing off dark souls, but lacks an understanding of what made the decisions and mechanics in that game enjoyable. The majority of the boss encounters made me annoyed instead and were not satisfying to complete when we did succeed, given that any mechanics that are present in the fight are so poorly explained as to be frustrating when you look up on the wiki what you were supposed to do.

If you're after a semi-souls-like looter shooter, it's pretty alright. You could do worse, but you could definitely do better. If you're after a narrative experience, especially in multiplayer, look elsewhere. Half the cutscenes broke for the people not hosting the session, only one person can interact with npcs at a time, including story npcs, but each session only gets their information once, so you can't each see what the first person who speaks to them sees or ask the same questions.

The last few remnants of humanity limped along over the years, taking cover and living in hiding from the menace that was the Root, the deadly, alien invaders who brought about the fall of humanity.

Your team of three fights across randomly generated maps and slays boss monsters in the hopes of earning extremely rare loot. The flow of progression from boss to boss is pretty simple: you enter a new zone, explore until you find a door to the next area or a checkpoint, go forward, fight the eventual boss, and repeat. 
[u]Graphics:[/u] Environments are grotesquely stunning. Each zone has a beauty all its own while also leaning into a dark, twisted vision of the world.

While the single player experience is pretty good, I do believe that the game truly shines in co-op.
Playing solo, I focused on damage mods, while on co-op I tried to protect my damage dealer and provide benefits through the weapon mods.
There are a lot of builds you could try out, as the game allows you to specialize your character through traits, weapon mods and armor sets (which provide unique bonuses). Each boss drop allows access to either an unique weapon (built-in with an unique mod that cannot be changed) or mod.
I was mind-blown when I saw that mods change the looks of your weapon.

As far as cons go, the game is quite short (15-20 hours if thoroughly explore and brake stuff for scrap), but I feel that your should play it at least two times anyways. And you're not going to play it for the story, I'll tell you that.

Really have no clue what they were going for here. Usually don't care all that much about story if game is fine, but this story is so lackluster and not very engaging; hard to follow, boring read, uninteresting characters. Boss AoE's register only half the time, or even when you dodge properly, it still hits you. Monsters look like something a teeanger would draw out of boredom in class; like they drew concept art and ran with the first sketch conceived. Couldn't even refund this mess, because I was 2 hours over the limit. Not even exaggerating or being overly dramatic when I say this is one of the worst games I've ever played, can't even remember a game as god awful as this one in the last 5 years. $25 lost for good, just made these losers even more rich.

PS, here's my friends review: Perfect World Entertainment is desperate with this one... this is a poor attempt by a company that's only made CRAP, to be modern and hip to keep their dying company alive. This is like a kid's macaroni art attempt at a high action-packed shoot'em up. It feels dead, there's no life in this world. The characters are phoned in, I forgot the story because I was chewing on my tongue drooling like a slumcock millionaire at this boring title. The graphics are amateur hour, there's nothing here.

It took me 12 hours on my first playthrough to finish the game. 

So I decided to give adventure mode a swing at higher difficulties... the thing is that the difficulty scaling just makes getting hit more punishing and it makes the bosses bullet sponges, or any enemy for that matter on apocalypse. I don't consider this to be ""difficult"", I consider it to be a time waste. It is in the same boat as jump scares being categorized as ""horror"".

Does that mean that the game is no fun? Absolutely not. It just would've been a lot more fulfilling if a higher difficulty meant that the bosses would get actually more difficult. For example new mechanics, attacks etc. Up until the final boss they are all pretty much brain dead. 

I will keep playing it for a bit more, because I want to see how broken my build can become, but playing on higher difficulties holds no merit for me. It is literally doing the same tactics, but instead of 5 minutes it takes 35-40 minutes on apocalypse. Higher difficulties also give the same rewards, other than XP. I understand that they don't want to force people to play higher difficulty game modes, but they could've made it more... difficult. Bullet sponges is not the way to go, but at the end of the day, that is just my opinion.

The enemies are re-skins of enemies from elsewhere in the game, and on my first play-through I got a bug that empties merchants shops. I tried finding fixes or info but there's so little that the only solution I found was to restart the file. The movement feels somewhat off. I cant place why, its just something about it not sitting right with me. A lot of the items that you can only get from playing through the game multiple times hardly ever feel worth it as well. 

Now for the worst part. The bosses, the thing that should be the draw of this game, they fucking suck. The number of bosses that are only difficult because of the amount of ads in the boss room is astounding. I don't find the artificial difficulty of a boss fight drowned with fodder to be enjoyable. If a boss fight is only hard because of the amount of smaller enemies, its dog shit. Not even the ones that don't do this felt good for me. Those two moths on either end of a bridge for example. They aren't difficult but those absolute pricks would knock me off the bridge constantly. Setting up a boss fight where you have to do a 180 just to see if you're going to get pushed into a chasm is poor design. It didn't feel enjoyable at all. 

To sum everything up, this game makes a lot of ""choices"" that feel astoundingly dumb. If your bosses have to get their difficulty from ads, the controls feel off, the maps feel bland, enemies are just re-skins from the first level, and you have to replay the game just to HOPE that a glitch is fixed (or reset the save file), your game needs a full redesign. I personally wouldn't recommend this game, however that doesn't mean someone else wouldn't enjoy it. There are a lot of people who enjoy this game and they have reasons that you can check out. At its core though, I personally hate this game. I want to try finishing it and maybe my mind will change, but 14 hours in and i haven't had a single moment of excitement, wonder or adrenaline, or anything else resembling having a good time.

Although the game has problems the amount of potential it contains is incredible and with a bit of spit shine it can be something truly beautiful.

I won't be focusing on the positives at all (considering I've already given the game a thumbs up) but instead I'll just give you the rundown of the negatives:

Bugs: mostly with the last boss where the portals that take you back from the shadow realm just stop working and require you a restart. The mirror also stopped working for some reason and needed a restart. Enemy AI varies from brilliant to very dumb but overall it's fine.

Every time you die the game goes pure white. I'm not a fan of being blinded and this should be an easy change.

The minimap/map is worthless at times on any level that has elevation. The entire map should always be displayed with different colours for elevations.

There's not that much incentive to level up weapons other than the ones you heavily invest in because getting an ""upgrade"" requires taking 3 steps back. An easy fix would be to make all newly acquired gear drop as ""your max leveled gear minus 3 (or something)"".

Now the big one. The random nature of the game. I'm honestly not sure why this is a thing. I guess that ""everyone has their own unique experience"" but that can be achieved by making the player have a choice instead of relying on RNG. Being forced to reroll a level over and over again in order to get what you want feels bad and should not be a feature.

Overall, massive potential and I hope updates fix these problems. I absolutely recommend it and hope for more content soon.",1572639609,1655025249,True,52,3,0.710459649562835693,0,True,False,False

I also hate the 3 person view and how any gun usage makes your character completely unaware of all enemies outside of a 60 degree arc you are aiming down. Only having 2 weapon slots could be fine for a team, but is not enough solo and I am tired of games forcing melee by making artificial ammo limitations.

Honestly I should have quit right at the start with the first mini-boss that was able to block all bullets with its sword (you have to bait him into attacking you, dodge and then attack) - like a lot of the rest of the game, it feels like it was made to annoy.",1655004155,1655004155,False,0,1,0.459427207708358765,0,True,False,False

I hope you like grays and browns and same-ish looking twig enemies, because you'll be seeing them nonstop. There's nothing interesting in the world, and everything is a nearly identical flat box with a few extra cosmetic details. Instead of encounter design they just plop a few enemy spawns into an area - including ones that aggro from range if you've rested at certain bonfires. If there are interesting or fun weapons, I didn't find them in about five hours of play. Enemies aren't hard, and difficulty mostly comes from a completely lack of signposting attacks in animations or SFX (which is one thing that makes the souls series really work). The story seems to be told through immersive-sim style computer terminals and books, although with some of the worst writing I've seen in a game ostensibly developed by people who speak English as a first language. The story that is there is d-movie quality post apocalyptic stuff. The game seems designed with grinding as a viable strategy, which is usually a bad sign.

Advantages
- Not that detailed, but still worthy character customization. 
- Memorable and unique lore and world building.
- Good graphics with decent gunplay and melee animations.
- High replayability due to randomly generated worlds that are based on RNG.
- Good visual design of bosses and enemies.
- Various builds.
- Sufficient amount of secrets, exploration is rewarding.

Disadvantages
- Despite RNG there are repeatable layouts of each map. 
- Broken hitboxes, majority of bosses, mini bosses, and average bots can easily kill you through walls and other obstacles.
- Quite short story, that could have been much better and more detailed. Most of NPC lack of backstory and motivation.
- Mediocre soundtrack.
- Way too easy bosses even on hard difficulty, that have a very few and yet simple movesets that usually kill you due to poor hitboxes and never-ending zerg rush of hostile bots.
- Poor selection of outfits.

[b] Strengths: [/b]
++ [i] Lots of good items[/i]. Good variety of weapons, armor, mods and accessories to collect and, as not all dungeon bosses appear always, you will want to replay a lot to get everything, even more because of the variety of viable builds.
++ [i] Very interesting story[/i]. The game's story depicts an alternate reality where in the 60's some scientists performed experiments of a non-canon nature that opened the door for a very ancient evil to invade Earth, spread and consume everything it finds (Lovecraft says hi) creating a future post-apocalyptic where the game takes place. Despite the fact that much of the story is presented in computer files, diaries and optional recordings and the story is much more focused on the world and the enemy (the ancient evil) than on well-constructed characters or anything like that, the story is still there and it is extremely interesting.
++ [i] The technical part of the game is excellent[/i]. Very good optimization, well done scenarios and graphics, extremely satisfying gunplay, co-op mode works well. I noticed that the loadings take a little longer when I leave the session in public mode, but nothing too serious.

[b] Weaknesses: [/b]
-- [i] Bosses[/i]. It has a lot of variety. The guys really spent their creativity because I don't remember seeing the same or similar bosses in the entire game and some you pass without even having to fight. However, when you increase the game's difficulty instead of the bosses having more complex mechanics or having more health or something, no, they just summon dozens of minions then you die because of the minions and not because of the boss.
-- [i] Classes[/i]. They are practically useless, you choose a class and get a set of armor, primary weapon, secondary weapon and melee weapon of the class and also the mods and characteristic perks. Right from the start at the base you can buy items from other classes that you didn't choose. And the perks you get in the game too. So it makes no difference which initial class you take.
-- [i] Subject 2923 DLC[/i]. The DLC is perfect, the problem is that the game only really looks complete with it. Without it the game looks good but very short. It is a continuation that brings clarification and greatly complements the main story.

There are mini boss options in some areas that add to the experience (though some people think that is the first boss and die without any plan). What this game adds compared to the dark souls games is it does have a difficulty setting with a hardcore option added in. I tried the game on hard but it just isn't for me with how much of a bullet sponge a lot of enemies are. The auto generated areas might seem bad for a lot of people, but it does mix well with the small areas the devs built so it doesn't feel odd or too strange most of the time. It does add reply ability to the game. What really adds to the reply offers is that items are randomized. You might get the best ring for your build early on or you could get some pretty strange rings you haven't seen before. That touch is what adds more rogue like fun I do enjoy.

The keyboard controls are strange but not hard to learn. Space is used for a lot of things that it isn't normally used for and the B key is to go back or end a pop up window. ALT is crouch when normally it is CTRL. F is for your special when I normally like it bound to Q. The controls are pretty strange but you can change them or get used to them, so not too much of an issue. 

The trash adds are a bit much at times. They were until I figured out that the melee attack deals with them so much better than my guns. With those that don't recommend the game because of the trash mobs in boss rooms or in areas, try melee. It is faster than shooting and doesn't waste your ammo.

It is a pretty fun game and they added the most desired features to it like having a rando built in. The NPCs and story just feels like a cardboard but hey, at least I can go about and collect things.",1654517942,1654517942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those unfamiliar with this game and are wondering what its all about, it's basically Dark Souls meets Warframe. The main style of game play is that of a third-person over-the-shoulder shooter with dodge rolling and fragile constitution. The world maps are randomly generated throughout each playthrough with a few consistent events that coincide with the predetermined plot line ever player will experience. This allows for pretty decent replayability and keeps things fresh when playing in another player's game world.

Generally, the game feels good to play and its fun. When the pieces fit together, it can be pretty thrilling and exciting to play. There's nothing quite like surviving an onslaught of enemies rushing you from all angles while you scrap by with what little remaining ammo you have and are masterfully avoiding damage. It's also fun to search the world for hidden secrets, such as a cool piece of armor or weapon tucked away in zones if you look hard enough for it. The game also feels really good to play with friends and that alone may be worth the price of admission.

I do take some issues with the game though, primarily how unpolished it can be at times. I'd say the biggest offender, something that many other games have also failed, is how they implemented the random level generation. It's particularly offensive in Remnant because you WILL get pretty bad Deja-vu at times. I've walked into pieces of a dungeon that have the exact same layout as a dungeon I just completed 20 minutes earlier, other times I've done dungeons that just seemed like a reversed version of another one i completed already. I've found important items in the exact same spots in the exact same generated room. Beyond the randomly generated rooms, there are also random bosses interspersed throughout each player's game world and these are always just bigger versions of other enemies you've already been fighting. It's things like this that just feel incredible lazy from the developers, it's passable enough to make the game a game, but its no where near the level of detail that you'd expect from a game who is clearly pulling inspiration from Dark Souls.

In addition, there are also a few quality of life improvements and poor design choices that I'm surprised the developers have somehow overlooked. Stuff like enemies aggroing onto you from the moment you stand up from the checkpoint crystals. Sound design is pretty bad at times, it sounds like enemies are right behind you but nothing ever shows up. You can be following the sound a monster's growls and never seem to find it because it sounds really close when in reality its not. Likewise, monsters will actually run up on you from behind but you won't hear them. This can be pretty detrimental in a game that is focusing its difficulty on how aware you are of your surroundings and how quickly you and avoid damage. There doesn't appear to be a way to view maps of zones you've already visited without actually teleporting there. Load times in the game are pretty horrendous. The menus aren't particularly use friendly, my friends and I had no idea that you could upgrade Armor because the menu kind of obscures that fact. Interacting with NPCs are pretty clunky, sometimes the dialogue doesn't activate if the NPC was in the middle of an animation when you go to talk to them. More than one person can not talk to an NPC at a time so you all have to take turns upgrading equipment. There are quests in this game but seemingly nowhere you can view your active quests from and this could be indicative of that menu problem if this option actually does exist somewhere.

You see what I'm getting at? It's riddled with small issues that could be fixed and then there are also things they should have anticipated would cause problems down the line if they invested too much time into it. For a game to truly take the design philosophies of Dark Souls to heart they would really need to focus on the quality of the experience. Bloodborne tackled Random Level generation and the dungeons felt unique and different, rarely did you immediately notice that you were playing through some of the same chunk of rooms unless you had been playing the hell out of the chalice dungeons. There were completely unique bosses in the chalice dungeons that weren't in the core game either. And everything else in those games feels solid and intentional. Remnant just feels like its trying to sell itself as a third-person shooter souls-like without promising the same quality.

I do think this game is worth the time to play with friends because its otherwise really fun. And you know what? I'm coming back to edit this review to add that I have incredibly fond memories of this game a year later. So regardless of all the things I nitpicked about it, I couldn't actually recall all of these faults because in the grand scheme of things the game is actually really fun and what it does well is what you'll remember. 

I'm hoping Remnant gets the sequel it quite frankly deserves. And I hope that sequel is incredibly polished because, if it is, you're looking at a game franchise that will be the next big thing.",1606323736,1654495261,True,62,0,0.848262250423431396,0,True,False,False

I found a boss that multiples every quarter of health (each one multiples to two). Yes, that means it will eventually be 16 on one. No matter how much stamina I drained to gain distance, there was always one at my back. Top it off with a 360 degree AOE, an extremely fast dagger attack with a one maybe two second charge and to top it off, it can heal.... Whats that you say? Stop the healer! You mean stop the healER'S dear reader.. Also, this game has no shame in enemies spawning behind you. Exactly where you came from. If you hear your character say, ""Oh shi*"", that is your queue something is behind you). You can literally, and I mean LITERALLY, leave a cleared room and HEAR the enemy spawn. Not just grunts, but elites too. 

Imo, Remnant has those types of bosses and mechanics where I feel someone at the office said ""make it Dark Souls!"" and Rick goes, ""ON IT!"". Which lead us to today.  

Look. Again, the game is fun. However, very little armor looks cool and even less for the guns (especially when you put a mod on it, one mod makes roots grow out of your gun.. No joke). Also, the sound design for the guns (reloading included) leave at lot of room to be desired. However, Remnant is a AA title. So I let some of this go. But one thing I am getting tired of, are these SoulsBourne games having bosses too easy, or too hard. Not the balanced hard from FromSoft, Deck13 (Surge2) or Team Ninja (Nioh2). Granted, the last two had time to iron out their issues having released two to three games in this genre. This is hard in the sense of what I call artificial difficulty. Take the boss above, I thought I found a pattern. First they throw daggers, then AOE while others rush you, then, heal. But these last few tries, as I got closer to beating the boss, I realized no. I had two to three doing the AOE attack, one to three throwing daggers and two healing (while the others rushed you). This is happening all at once! For a single player. You're not shooting if your rolling, you're not shooting if your trying to heal. Meanwhile, I saw no end to the healer either. I let the healer go once to see if it would stop, or I could output more damage then they could heal. It does not seem it stops on its own, and I was doing more damage. However, because I had so little time to actually go on the offense or had to reload (not complaining about reloading) that healing is pretty effective. 

I had to stop playing. The frustration was building. I would sprint to the other end of the boss map, turn a corner, try to get myself together. Somehow, all it takes is 1/2 seconds and they (multiple) come around the corner. I get no breathing room for fast paced boss fights, but man, this isn't hard, it is annoying. 

In the end, although I do recommend the game, I have to say, if you got friends to play with, I think you'll enjoy it more. If you're solo, like me, there is fun to be had. Just keep in mind, you will find bosses you can easily tell were designed around a group. This boss being one of them.",1653871725,1653871725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You become apart of an adventurer's guild that uses portal stones to access many different worlds. Only instead of human civilization being as it is now something called ""The Root"" ravaged our planet's eco system,going so far as to twist and mutate certain people and animals into monsters. Worse, it has effected the indigenous species of the foreign alien frontiers as well. ""You"" are leading an expedition to stop The Root and to heal the damage it has wrought. 

Gameplay seems like a typical third person shooter on the surface but throw in class selection,crafting,upgradable character traits,and even secodary talisman power-ups you can assign to each weapon. (These ""power-ups"" are similar to the varied plasmids found in Bioshock.) This is where I would normally say ""Diablo with guns"" but Remnant deserves a better description as many of its' ideas are presented in a way that is refreshingly original.
Several times you may feel like you are reliving fragmented memories of playing Gears Of War or even Resident Evil 4 but then it goes further into its' own aesthetics that are distinctly ""Weird Wild West"" meets ""Dark fantasy"" meets ""Apocalyptic sci-fi horror"". (There's even an important side plot about gifted psychic individuals. Labeled as ""dreamers"", they were being used in an experiment as astral-projecting explorers to chart the outer reaches of the great unknown.) 

Certain creatures from the outer-realms are surprisingly whimsical,friendly,and will talk to you. You learn about their cultures and what their civilizations were like before The Root ran rampant and unchecked throughout the weave of all creation. The lore is fascinating and many of these unique beings even resemble mythological creatures and the old pagan gods. (Just with stranger more alien-like features) You can make a few dialogue choices that effect your game but temper your expectations as this is very ""surface level"" thus Remnant From The Ashes should not be compared to Mass Effect,Dragon Age,or Fallout. 
 
Meanwhile your plucky MC spouts hamfisted amusing dialogue ranging from overjoyed exuberance when you survive a horde of incoming creatures to comically crestfallen lackadaisical lament when reinforcements arrive or when you are near death. Aka, there are moments you feel like this weird half and half amalgamation of younger Han Solo and younger Indiana Jones! 

So is Remnant a looter? Is it a shooter? Is it an action rpg? Is it a somewhat more lighthearted version of Stephen King's Dark Tower series? A sci-fi re-imagining of fey folk and polytheistic religions altogether? A somewhat more strange and frightening version of Sliders and Stargate? A Guillermo del Toro grim-dark cross-over reboot of Winx Club and Little Nemo The Dream-Master with spell-shooting guns instead of wimpy magic wands? Well,that is what it is to me and it has been one heck of jaunt beyond the pale!

Pros

+Setting is distinctly unlike anything I've ever experienced in this genre.

+ Combat is fun,fluid,and challenging.

+There is loot

+There is shoot

+There are even close range melee weapons to boot

+ Beautiful unique environs

+Weapons,talismans, and armor are strange and ""other worldly"", getting increasingly more unique the longer you play.

+Your class does not restrict you as much as you may initially think. Later on you truly can tailor your character however you want.

+Character customization options are decent. It's no She Will Punish Them,Dragon's Dogma,Soul Calibur 6, or Saintsrow 2-3 but it ain't too shabby!

+Randomization makes re-plays fulfilling and worth it to see new sights and to fight never before encountered bosses

Potential Cons

-As with all games built upon the souls-like formula dying comes easy. Aka, the initial difficulty curve may scare some people off. (Though for the record, Remnant is one of the more forgiving games of this ilk.)

- Game has a slow burn of trial and error whilst your progression demands switching out equipment regularly and crafting better items. 

-Even thralls of common enemies can totally wreck your well laid plans if you make so much as a single misstep or a single misfire.

-Boss areas are pain and purgatory personified 

-A bone I often have to pick with western devs lately is armor sets are always drab or ugly. That's why I'm so torn here. Aka, I actually think the aesthetic juxtaposition of ""Mad-Max and Pan's Labyrinth bunk in a cabin along with John Carter and Unforgiven"" compliments the setting nicely. 

Simultaneously I do wish there were just a few sexier armor sets for the fairer sex. Obviously it is not a big deal but there's reasons why many gamers appreciate eyecandy! (And I do not believe adding some titillation in a game is anymore of a ""grave sin"" then extreme violence or big explosions. In the end it is all just harmless fantasy escapism! We've come a long way since real-life bath-house orgies,vomitoriums,public executions,and Roman gladiators!)",1653798868,1653855916,True,1,0,0.503968238830566406,0,True,False,False

As much as I hate hearing it, its mostly true. From the items, to the gear builds, to the enemies, Remnant: From the Ashes mirrors Souls type games. But by no means is Remnant a bad game. It came up completely out of nowhere in a dry spell of gaming for me, and before long I fell in love. I've never been a Souls type gamer due to the default difficulty floor, but the inclusion of guns as your primary weapons appealed to me as a longtime fan of shooters. I eventually found myself  100 hours in, replaying the game on Nightmare difficulty in the hopes of being able to brag about the achievement to my friends.

Remnant is not an easy game. Buildcrafting, learning dodge timings, and cooperation with your teammates are what spell out success. The game is very well designed and graphically appeasing enough in its art style, bosses are fairly creative and challenging, and there's enough content in the base game and DLC's to keep you challenged for a decent amount of time. There are very few moments where you are ""overpowered"", save for one or two cheesy builds you can use if you have all the necessary gear from hours of gametime. Every area/dungeon is randomly generated, encouraging players to do additional playthroughs or ""reroll"" their worlds for a chance at specific rewards or bosses.

Some negatives:
1. The story is......confusing? It seems very disjointed and hollow, like none of the characters have connections to each other or you. Every big monologue sounds like a suggestion, this voice acting can be rough at times.
2. Playing co-op is insanely fun until you realize only one of you can use a merchant at a time. This led to a lot of time wasted while each person purchased gear/upgraded/etc.
3. Maps/Dungeons VERY confusing if you don't pay attention to the fog of war and your general direction. Lot of ""wait, haven't I been here before?"" moments.
4. Even after all the time I've spent, I wish there was more content to play. Once you collect all items/traits, Survival mode is your only real option (IF you buy DLC)
5. Farming world rolls and spending massive amounts of time exploring them just in the hopes of getting the random world roll with the conditions you want for a particular reward, can be exhausting. There is a third party tool to help with this if you prefer.

All in all, Remnant is a fantastic game, and just challenging enough ( incredibly so if desired) to be a good time with friends or solo. Definitely worth the buy if you find it on sale. Also the soundtrack slaps.",1653602702,1653602702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really though the game has many options on how you want to play with something as simple as just running up to things and hitting them still being a pretty viable option except with some bosses.

Gameplay loop is great for about 100 something hours and then I got bored of it and just achievement collected. (I played on playstation first.) DLC's in this game make it more entertaining but theres not that much difference in main story with them. The story isn't exactly easy to understand either sadly, as it loops and can be confusing to some.

[tr]
[td]
- Build diversity is through the roof. Every build matters and all of them are viable.

- Atmosphere is breathtaking. Every map feels alive and different.

- Exploration is rewarding. Every nook and cranny is chock full of items, pendants, rings, armor and weapons.

- Optional/missable bosses and dungeons make experience a lot more enjoyable and force you to explore.

- Combat feels satisfying, gunplay and melee transition seamlessly. Taking cover, dodge-rolls, sprint-slides make the game feel more like a Division: But Dark Souls.

- Map is procedurally generated. Not every area, playthrough bosses are the same. It is based on RNG and they can be a whole lot different.
[/td]
[td]
- Map diversity in a single map is not that distinct. So, you can easily get lost if you don't use the minimap/map. Everywhere looks the same.

- Story percentage is not shared between saves. Progression, items and upgrades do.

- Solo experience feels boring after a while. It cannot compare to likes of Dark Souls in that department.

- Multiplayer connection problems can happen. P2P connection is used so sometimes you straight up cannot connect.

- A lot of the weapon mods (Ash of War system in Elden Ring) essentially devolve into summons when you approach into the late game. There are a lot of different weapon mods that are not summons though.

Good game, worth the price. Don't be deterred from getting the DLCs, even with one of them bringing a pretty bad rating, as the content isn't bad, but a lot of people feel it should've been free. The shooting is really nice, the scaling is a little off and the areas are varied with some being an overall better experience than others. Very few bosses are needlessly (and artificially) difficult, which is always nice to see, and most of the actual difficult ones require some skill and/or teamwork to be beaten. 

I've had the worst luck when it comes to survival it seems, The Hero's Sword gets unlocked permanently for all your current and future characters upon beating 10 bosses in a row. I've reached boss 10, been in the middle of fighting him and then had my run completely destroyed by bugs or glitches, such as the boss getting stuck in the floor making it almost impossible to even hit him, me getting stuck in weird places and sliding into the void, dying instantly and so on.

It's somewhat Souls-like, as it is tagged as, and I am sure others most likely mention plenty in their own reviews but it stands out on it's own and personally I don't think it is quite as frustrating overall as Darksouls games, i.e. it isn't as hard by any means, however it is still a challenge at the bosses.

However the voice acting and animations are well done, not maybe up to AAA standards but still enjoyable.  The story starts mysterious as most of these games do, however there are plenty of clues along the way.

[h1]The Game[/h1]
Straight from their website Remnant: From the Ashes is a third-person survival action shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by monstrous creatures. As one of the last remnants of humanity, you‚Äôll set out alone or alongside up to two other players to face down hordes of deadly enemies and epic bosses, and try to carve a foothold, rebuild, and then retake what was lost. ENDLESS FANTASTIC REALMS AWAIT - SCAVENGE. UPGRADE. SPECIALIZE - STRENGTH IN NUMBERS. Ok sounds awesome.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This game takes the concept of what you more or less expect from souls-like games and gives it its own spin and has a heavy focus on gun combat over melee combat. And for the most part this gunfight souls game actually work pretty well. Shooting stuff in this game is fun and the team at Gunfire Games did a great job. Good amount of challenge and difficulty. Speaking of difficulty, by design, Remnant From the Ashes is a brutally difficult game for a number of reasons, chief among them the quantity and relative strength of enemies and their annoying tendency to flank or appear behind the player and be single-minded in their desire to kill.


[h1]The Loot[/h1]
The loot in this game is surprisingly good and rewarding to get. Each weapon can be upgraded and even has a mod slot for giving some interesting effects you can mess with. This can make builds really fun to experiment with. Some of the loot are exclusive in specific areas.

[h1]Bosses[/h1]
Easily the best part of the game is this game's bosses. Many of them are just mini bosses. They all look different and cool, sound different, fight differently and they even change tactics depending how the fight goes. All of them have some interesting themes to their environment and design and it just make going through them that much fun. There's two boss variations. There are two types of bosses that you can encounter as you travel to different realms:

World Boss - World bosses are the main bosses of the game. They are typically found at the end of an area, and are mandatory for progression through the game. There's 15 bosses.

Dungeon Boss - Superior, stronger versions of elite enemies, possessing greater health, damage and unique moves and mechanics. To identify if you are about to enter an arena for a dungeon boss, you'll find the entrance engulfed in fog and there will be a checkpoint nearby. Upon entering the arena, the battle will begin. There's 24 bosses.

You won't get to see them all in one playthrough and that's a good thing.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Honestly, looks great. Serious! Crank those graphics. Try 1440p if you can.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1] 
Great. 

[h1]Co-op[/h1]
Yup it's even better with friends but you already knew that much. But since you're not alone anymore what's different? Btw playing with random kind of sucks connection-wise i found out. Maybe skip that. I was trying it for the first time and it ran poorly. Not sure why.

[b]Cooperative Play Scaling[/b]
The game scales with more players that affect the following:

Enemies' health is increased
Enemies' damage is increased
Enemies number will also increase

[b]Co-Op Mechanics[/b]
There are some mechanics of the game that will change once you are playing in Co-op.

Loot/Item Drops are shared. Players will not have to worry about trying to loot items that are scattered or are dropped as fast as they can since Remnant: From the Ashes introduces a shared mechanic. Whatever item a player acquires, the other members also acquire the same item as well.
Usage of Crystal Bonfires and Crystals. In single-player, one can freely use a Crystal Bonfire or a Crystal as a checkpoint to rest. Resting at these checkpoints replenishes Ammo and Dragon Hearts in exchange of respawning all the enemies in the area. In Co-op, resting can be used to Respawn fallen allies. And in order to rest, all players must be present and using the checkpoint.

[b]Teamwork[/b]
Players can choose to play the game as a single-player. But it is recommended to play with other people or your friends since many of the game's Weapon Mods and Traits are built to provide support not only just for yourself but for your team as well. Mods such as an AOE healing effect that generates an HP restoring pool that heals the team who is within it, an active skill that allows everyone to mark and see enemies within their range, and Traits that increases the overall performance of a player once they are in a team.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
Remnant from The Ashes is absolutely solid and came out of nowhere. I remember watching the trailer for it and it looked cool enough that i wishlisted it hoping it would be good. For the price way under 60 at release it's crazy that it actually delivered. I did leave a lot out simply because you should experience the rest for yourself. I definitely recommend getting it if you like souls-like games.

So for transparency i scraped my original review because at the time i hadn't played enough of it and was just making a review because i found the game really good and actually launch right and wanted more people to know about it by hyping up key stuff about it. However, while the review wasn't false in all that i did say it wasn't a review i sat down and really think about you know. It wasn't a real review. So this is me re-doing it simply because i recently picked it back up and finished it. To the 1 user that rated my original review as Helpful i want to say thank you. Hopefully this one is more deserving of that rating. Oh yeah Merry Christmas! :D

617290,114743297,76561198051672262,141,25,499,0,240,1651534892,"Initially I left a positive review, but after playing a bit more, I think I have to reconsider. This is not necessarily a bad game, but I personally don't think I like it enough to justify the price. I played it a bit on Epic when you could grab it for free and then bought it on Steam for the DLCs, which I don't even feel like playing anymore, ironically. 

First of all, I want to point out one thing: Remnant is [u]NOT[/u] a Souls-like. 

The only things it has in common with Dark Souls are dodge rolls and Estus Flask. Upgrade levels are not a Souls-like mechanic and the ""bonfires"" are simply fast travel locations, you don't use them to level up or anything. There aren't even souls that you can lose upon death. Remnant is a third person shooter with elements borrowed from DS, but that's it. Something like Darksiders 3 comes much closer to being a Souls-like than Remnant. 

The map design is absolutely nothing alike. DS has intertwined maps with complex paths, lots of hidden areas, carefully planned enemy placement and items sprinkled all over them. Maps in Remnant are very empty and linear with barely any reason to explore (not like there's much to explore anyway, again, [b]very[/b] linear). You just walk from A to B, sometimes to C and shoot random enemies along the way, collect some materials/consumables and occasionally come across a singular item such as a ring. 

The boss fights are also more comparable to boss fights in games like Borderlands than to boss fights in Dark Souls. You don't really have to learn movesets or anything, you can just run away and shoot at most of them until they die. Most bosses you can do on your first try if you play on normal difficulty. If you die, it's likely because every boss loves to spam mobs in your face, so you can get ganked to death. 

Spoilers about the final boss fight in this paragraph. [spoiler] It sucks. It's terrible. Actually one of the worst bosses I've seen in a video game. I could write an entire essay about it, but to sum it up: unexplained mechanics that you need to look up online, unavoidable and constant damage ticks, an insanely huge health pool that turns it into a bullet sponge and, worst of all, the boss has exactly 1 attack. One. You avoid it by walking sideways. It's embarrassing tbh. [/spoiler]

Stamina management isn't nearly as important, your melee weapons don't have large movesets that are unique for every weapon, the starting classes don't matter unlike in Dark Souls, there are no builds that you truly have to focus on during your entire playthrough unlike in Dark Souls, the list goes on. It simply is not a Souls-like, it merely has some shared mechanics. 

And lastly, there's little armor/weapon variety. The gear that is in the game is cool and unique, but there just isn't a whole lot. At least in the base game.


If you're looking for a 3rd person shooter to kill some time and do some grinding, maybe this is for you. I'm sure a lot of people love this game, again, it's not necessarily bad. But if you actually want a Dark Souls experience, you will be severely disappointed. I recommend games such as Code Vein, Nioh 1&2, The Surge 1&2 or, if you specifically want a Rogue-like mode, Mortal Shell.",1651353935,1651537434,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Always bonus points to games that let you play the campaign co-op. Hard mode is actually pretty hard, so would not recommend starting off there, even if you think you're good at games. 

Story is a bit lacklustre, but the setting and atmosphere is really cool. There's a few items that you get from beating monsters which you trade in for different armors and weapons, which is interesting but rather shallow when it comes to loot. I feel that it could be more interesting with build variety and etc if there was more to do on this front.

I dont like these types of difficulty sliders. the game is great on normal, but hard just doesnt feel harder, its just punishes mistakes more and you fight the bosses longer.

Please stop giving the illusion of difficulty as shoot your limited supply of ammo at this boss that just has more hp. instead of hp, why not make the attack patterns different, we have to memorize an attack pattern to defeat them anyway, why not make the bosses less predictable. After this swipe -> we expect poke -/> What>> anotehr swipe??? -> and NOW HE POKES? change up the algrorithm. please not bullet sponge.

This game does not work on bullet sponge because you have only a set number of bullets for ALL your guns. they share bullets (unless you use a consumable that gives you ammo refill)

I love this game, i love its style, i hate the difficulty slider.

Overall - So... this game uses randomly generated dungeons/items that are based on the luck of your world roll. If you happen to miss something (like the assault rifle or magnum) your only hope is to reroll your world or get into someone else's game that, has it.  Awful.

The rest of the game feels like a free to play game, except they charge $40 for it. Perfect World strikes again!

p/s: u can summon mobs that fights alongside with u in this game and its perfect for single players :) i basically has a dog, two flying skulls that throw out hairy balls, two small mobs with sth like a dagger? i also can summon turret lmao. Welp who needs to play coop when my npc companions kill every enemies for me :) In this game there are also traits and items that can enhance the damage dealed by the mobs that we summoned upon.",1651066082,1651066082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beat it in 10 hours and thats with exploring everywhere and fighting every boss and acquiring every item I could. A run is randomly generated to a point so it does have replayability seeing as you can find weapons armor and other gear you never saw before when you begin again.
All thats left by the point im at now since I play solo is to keep rerolling the world in order to get gear that wasnt generated my first run or play higher difficulties. Also could achievement hunt.
Suppose theres dlc as well but at the moment I dont see the point. 
Definitely worth it on sale I found it an enjoyable experience almost the entire time im sure if you have friends to play with that makes the process of restarting a world or going through higher difficulties more worth it.

As that is a game I dislike, that is not a kind comparison (I found Dark Souls sado-masochistically frustrating).  If you try to play this game solo, it fits though, it is comparatively difficult.  Where this game excels is in its coop.  
Unlike Dark Souls, which seemed to try to actively discourage coop, this game actually recommends and promotes it, hence why I like this game and despise Dark Souls.  Without coop, I would have never picked this game up; I would have found it a found it such a difficult, discouraging slog that I would have quit the game in under 2 hours and never took it up again (much as I did Dark Souls).  As it has coop, it is less of grind.  Yes, there are challenges that can wipe your team, regardless, but good teamwork can overcome most challenges, eventually.  This makes the game a gritty challenge rather than a nigh impossible proposition.  I have read reviews of players claiming to have soloed the game.  They must be God's gifts to gaming, as that's a feat I'll never be able to honestly claim.  (I've attempted; I've failed enough to know, for me it's impossible.)
The game does have its weaknesses.  There are still the occasional bugs.  Melee isn't really much of a viable combat option.  Character and equipment customization seems very limited.

- No loot clutter. The things you find are all potential useful and you don't lose too much time with inventory management. 
- Decent replayability thanks to the semi-randomness of the game and a few different viable class builds
- They did a good attempt at creating an original lore, with a nice environment and visuals.

Contra:

- When you are stuck with a boss, you are really stuck, not a lot of side-quests to upgrade your loot or boost your money when you run out.

Remnant has fun, fast gunplay with a fairly large variety of guns. But on top of that it has so many armor sets, trinkets, and mods to go along with them that you have an impressive amount of build variety once you have a decent bit of gear.

The replayability is impressively high for me. The game has so many events that can be generated for every world with several bosses. And on top of that many of the bosses have multiple ways of doing the fight. Changing how can reward different loot and sometimes a very different fight.

The multiplayer is fairly seamless with pretty good netcode as well. I don't remember any disconnects. On that note the game also ran perfectly for me as well.

The atmosphere is nice, and having the multiple regions help keep things different. And as much as people complain RNG is fair (mostly) in the way that yes you have to work for gear but its not usually such a long grind that the rewards end up not being worth it.

The game does lack a tad bit in enemy diversity in comparison to other games, which admittedly can become a bit boring/tedious, but I believe that helps new or returning players get into the groove of the game without raging. And if you choose the game is too easy, you can always change the difficulty on the fly, which is pretty cool in a game such as this.

Armor/weapons/accessory options have a great amount of diversity, allowing for many different types of builds. Most will admittedly look up builds for harder difficulties, but honestly that is no fun. With such diversity you can create many types of builds and have fun experimenting. Many of the weapons (mainly boss weapons, similar to souls games) have different mods as well that brings more diversity into the game, ranging from ammo changes, aura usage, and even minion summoning. With all the diversity almost anyone can find/make a build suitable for an enjoyable experience.

Finally, and probably a big positive for most, is the multiplayer option. You can have a total of 2 other players run and gun with you at any point in time, with this difficulty will scale evenly with the number of players in lobby, which also scales experience and most importantly loot. Now, unlike many games Remnant does NOT follow the same loot rewarding as most games, when one person picks up loot everyone in the lobby also obtains said loot. that includes equipment, currency, and important items such as quest items. (ammo is not shared unfortunately but they do have accessory that allows it). 

That should about cover it, if you would like more detail, or someone to run this enjoyable game with, hit me up :)

It's so mediocre it actually makes me wonder whether Dark Souls is actually also a mechanically bland game in a pretty disguise.

Overall, the mechanical complexity is too low. Weapon upgrades are just a matter of increasing weapon damage to keep pace with tougher enemies in later levels. Weapon mods aren't mods at all but a selection of magic spells that do not modify your weapon at all. Why they're even associated with weapons is a mystery to me. Traits and items give you marginal percentage bonuses to various stats. Armor set bonuses are actually significant, but make me wonder why you even get to mix and match your armor pieces when the game heavily incentivizes using complete sets instead of piecemeal selections. Weapons are fairly diverse, and enemies differ a fair bit as well, but the nominally impressive length of the game is ruthlessly padded with repetitive and frankly boring levels, and all elements of this shallow game wear thin very quickly.

Ultimately this is not deep enough to offer any engaging single-player experience. You can however absolutely use it to run through a few levels with a friend and do a little social activity together. Best played when too tired or distracted for any actual challenge. The bosses however are very difficult: When playing solo you have no time to heal up, so you must dodge perfectly. When playing in a group of two, you have no time to revive the other guy, so you must at least never die. Never played in a larger group, but I guess with three people one can serve as a distraction while another revives the third, so it should be handily doable then.

I give this a thumbs up because I probably will play it again in the future, but the game doesn't really deserve it. Strange.",1627163116,1649877540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While Remnant: from the Ashes steals many elements from the Souls-like genre its gameplay, feel and appeal are fundamentally VERY different. 

Yet what's similar to Dark Souls itself is the overall quality and the fun of the experience. 
This is one of the best game of all times: it has a thrilling gameplay loop, amazing yet simple rpg system, incredible replayability and surprisingly wide build variety.

I'll spend 2 words on replayability since the game really opens up AFTER your first play-through. You'll likely beat the final boss before you gained enough levels, weapons and powers to put together an actual build but that's actually where the real fun starts. You'll start hunting down events, bosses and achievements you didn't encounter on your first run via the ""Adventure"" mode, which allows you to visit a single open area of a specific world and 3 dungeons within it (or you could just do a second full campaign on a higner difficulty if you wanted to). 
Once you learned all the bosses and played around with a few builds you'll delve into the rouguelike mode which allows you to really test your skills, to become even more powerful that the main game allows if you last long enough and to unlock even more accesories for your main characters.

If you enjoyed DarkSouls or any of the FromSoftware games and always wanted guns in the mix of the combat loop, this game will be what you're seeking. Guns do take up the meta, there aren't many melee weapons that outperform many guns. But it's still really fun. The entire game is linear but the entire map is modular, meaning that every NG+ is randomized, so finding something specific will be challenging or require a map reset. The AI works surprisingly well with how random the maps are. Lots of cool looking concepts and designs for guns, enemies, armor, and a lot of neat environments and map design layouts that seamlessly flow together given the modular nature of the randomized maps.

Here's what the game suffers from; lighting and overall grim colors, it's like there's an apocalyptic re-shade mod applied on the entire game, it even drowns out the colorful and flashy spells/magic that are in the game, (I understand that the game is set in the aftermath of human extinction and the apocalypse, but still, everything has almost the same color pallet). The art style is like a mix between TF2 and Fortnite and Overwatch, I'm not very fond of those games to begin with. Voice acting during dialogue is alright, but your character's combat dialogue and after-combat dialogue are very repetitive and almost cheesy due to the voice actors effort put into the lines. You'll hear the 3 most common phrases before, during and after every combat encounter, so be prepared to hear the same lines over and over again from your character, (Thankfully the settings are pretty well-made and in-depth so you can turn off voices and subtitles). Guns mostly outperform melee weapons, there is almost no reason to use melee when guns are much superior in almost every encounter. Maybe I haven't played through the game enough but it feels like there isn't much content in the game or much to explore once you beaten it.

It has one of those complicated plots that is not explained too well and the player is suppose to just roll with it like a George Locus script.

But an evil plant creature has invaded the earth from another dimension and is basicly killing or turning people into plant monsters who also I guess being a gaint dragon in a tower and it was summoned to our plane of existance because a dreamer's thoughts touched it across time and space to anchor it to our reality and if you touch gaint red crystals you can actually shift between the barriers of these other worlds and dimensions to collect information and widgets on how to get to the big evil tower and defeat the roots....

Or whatever, it doesn't matter because the game is awesome. it achieves a somber toned atmosphere of decay and ruin as you run and gun through some rng created area's  to find weapons and items but also complete little quests that give you access to more gear and equipment to fight bosses to get more gear and equipent.

Many of the bosses actually have two ways to beat them to give different items for crafting which can be very challanging.

I would say the game is challanging or maybe just outright hard on higher difficulty levels.

Its a great co-op game with friends to help each other through boss fights or run through the game to complete different objectives, if you love collecting things the game has you covered and who some of them items have a few steps and also a bit of luck to get you can travel back to try again though some do require a few reruns to trigger.

Gunfire games made a decent Gem here. those with a completionist drive while find plenty to do while those around for the ride will enjoy the variety of locations, creatures and interesting bosses to fight.

For one, the mapping system is quite bad, it lacks detail and feels kind of thrown in with little effort. There is no symbol legend, so the icons on the map and mini map are not described at all. In areas that you've already explored, some sections of the map are greyed out and others are lit up. I found this very confusing because it made it hard to tell if I missed spots or not, I'd rather the entire map be lit up once you've entirely explored that area and only be greyed out if you missed spots.

My next gripe is the lack of quest/mission indications. I've put quite a few hours into the game and I almost never know where I'm going, I kind of just wander around and try to get to new areas that I don't recognise until I stumble across a boss fight or something that I need to interact with. Maybe this is part of the way the developers wanted the game to be played but a little more direction would be nice. Even paying attention to the NPC dialogue seems to help very little.

Another problem I had which seems like it would be minor but actually becomes very frustrating, the fact that switching your aiming point of view gets undone after releasing the aim button. Example, if my character is aiming with the crosshair to the left of their head, then I do a roll to evade a projectile, the crosshair will then be moved back to the right. I think it should stay to the side you set it to, until you set it back to the other. Maybe that's just me though.

Last negative point, some of the conversations have so many ""dramatic"" pauses and conversations feels so dragged out that I end up wanting to skip stuff, even though I really like enjoying the dialogue in games. Plus, the writing isn't great so that really doesn't help the experience.

On the bright side, the environments are super cool, creates really good atmosphere and the enemies fit within said environment so well. I love finding a new boss or area, it really keeps me coming back! Combat is amazing in this game, except when you get hit through a wall lol. But overall the fighting is the strongest part of this game!

This is also a very challenging and unforgiving game, so be prepared for that, but it sure is rewarding once you complete a tough section.

Overall, good game. But it lacks a certain polish that I would expect from a publisher like Perfect World. Still recommended if you can pick it up on sale.

Edit: just beat the game and am now even more disappointed, beat it with a friend after less than 20 hours on hard difficulty. We probably could have done it in 10 on the easiest difficulty. If the combat wasn't so fun I'd say don't buy it. But the fights are really quite awesome.",1595778609,1649168697,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While I wouldn't call it quite as hard as a Souls game, it's a great starting point for those wanting to dip their toes into a higher difficulty game without being yanked fully into the water and drowned.

Maps are randomized just enough that you can't memorize the path on a new play through of the area, which adds a little bit of freshness to farming or new characters. Bosses are included in that randomization, not every game instance will have the same bosses, save for the obvious ones like the end game/story line necessities. This leaves you completionists and gear farmers redoing the same zones multiple times in order to get the items you want. Though, even if you get the boss you want, they may not drop the item you want depending on how you killed them. Yeah, did I mention different kills result in different items? Enter the grinding and never ending goal to become OP.

Definitely a lot more fun and recommended to be played with co-op. Especially if you're with a group of friends rather than crashing the party of some randoms. Everyone stressing out together on a boss you're under geared for is how gamer bonding was meant to happen.

If you're going to pick it up, do yourself a favor and grab the DLCs. One of the few games I'd recommend the extra purchase for as it adds quite a bit to the game in a creative way.

I played through it multiple times on Xbox, did it again on Steam and at some point when I'm craving some Diablo style with a higher difficulty level, I'll play through it again.

Remnant from the Ashes is the first RPG, Souls-like game that I played and the first Souls-like game with guns. When I first started the game I started off with a sword and as I progressed I got my first two guns when I picked a class. 

And as I progressed in the game the more that I level up my character and unlocked more levels to go the more difficult the game increased as usual. The game has infinite backpack capacity to help players choose their own combat style, armor and resources to fit. The game loot system is not very similar games like Skyrim or Dragon's Dogma but it is still good. The shooting in the game is actual good even it can't free aim to the other enemies and so is the melee combat even there is no target lock. And adding in game gun mods that is added with fantasy magic is something that I have never seen before including guns that is filled with fantasy magic. Enemies where almost very fun to kill alrthough I get killed instantly because of lacking upgrades and not enough items for healing. And Simulacrum is absolutely very rare to get when not upgrading my items and Dragonheart wisely. 

This game also encourages to play it with friends meaning if that  boss or level is difficult I need players in order to beat a level. The only criticism is that this does not have a chat option for players who don't have a speaker  which makes it frustrating that it is more of a speed run rather than a campaign because I missed on secret item or spot so  side mission to activate. 

I really like the campaign story in this game. Its not actually too perfect but its actually pretty good. Although the story felt a little bit confusing, its good but a little confusing.  Sometimes I just always wonder how my character's place look like before he sailed off or why he use the starter sword called ""The Blade of Adventure"" I think of my theory that is a family heirloom.

In coclusion I say that this Souls-like game with guns is something to look up for. And I hope that this game will have its own sequel to expand more if this story.",1648336871,1648336871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ik most people will just write ""git guud"" of which I'll just retort back with I've played all of the ""dark souls' style games. 

The boss battles were great at the beginning. Seemed very intuitive, nothing felt difficult in a cop out or cheap way that some devs like to do to give the illusion something is hard but really just throwing in one hit mechanics from lack of creativity. Revanant doesn't do that. It does the opposite. It throws a ton of problems at you at once. Now this wouldn't be to much of a problem if the game didn't heavily rely on you upgrading your weapons to the point where it's not worth spreading the upgrades around unless you want to grind your ass off to keep everything up in level. I mention this because I chose to upgrade my shotgun and long ranged pistol. Everything was fine at first until I run into a boss battles that throws a ton of mobs at you that you simply can not avoid unless you have a weapon that has a large clip. I even have my reload speed perk maxed out. So basically you're forced to use specific weapons for specific instances. Which would be fine, IF they didn't center the game rewarding players to upgrade only 2 weapons. I would also add the reloading aspect of the game is extremely sub par. Look, if i dodge when my bullet is literally IN the gun but the animation doesn't end and need to dodge and somehow the bullet magically isnt in the gun anymore, that's idiotic, the reloading time is essentially prolonged due to animation not ending when it should. They clearly did this on purpose because, well how long does it really take to reload a double barrel shot gun. Not much time, so instead of just allowing the shotgun to have a shorter reload time and balancing it out somewhere else, they chose to pick the player hellscape of animation delay.  I'm sorry but for someone who loves DS type games, this game really fell off the mark about midway through. 

Look if you have the time, it may be worth playing for you. If you don't have a ton of time, I wouldn't suggest it because you will find yourself being more frustrated at the game rather than reflecting on yourself and seeing where you can improve or if there's a different tactic to take.",1648332065,1648332065,False,5,0,0.480011105537414551,0,True,False,False

What I got: A bootleg Gears of war with fake open world composed of very large corridors and the worst attempt at itemization I‚Äôve ever seen.

It‚Äôs actually closer to Outrider and many other generic looter shooter than gears of war tbh.

What I also got was the biggest historical laughter.

Let me set the picture for you:

The game start with the most obscure set up possible.
You are a guy on a boat, with the most clich√© RPG sword ever modeled on your back you want to get to a tower on a small island. Alright simple enough. I guess it‚Äôs a medieval fantasy setting then.

You boat sink near the tower and you get pushed on the mainland a bit off said tower. It feels like that thing is like RIGHT THERE, but apparently it‚Äôs just impossible to reach it, because‚Ä¶ reasons I guess. The tempest is to strong or something.
You walk a lot find a guy with a gun that gets overwhelmed by a horde of monster‚Ä¶ Alright, I guess it‚Äôs not a fantasy setting then?

Watch the guy die, then watch yourself die, then you get rescued, somehow, but the friends of that guy. All that in cutscene, no gameplay what so ever. Typical RPG set up.

You are now inside an underground base. The most obvious ‚Äúhub‚Äù you‚Äôve ever seen.
You are introduced to a bunch of characters, being forced to go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth between them for a while, have exposition dumped on you about stuff you couldn‚Äôt care less even if you tried. You just want to get to the tower. Why?
No idea.

The people in the base can help you‚Ä¶ maybe. Just turn the power off, activate a magical fantasy RPG teleportation rock (all very generic, but this one is red rather than the usual blue). Now a old lady tell you to go look for her dad because‚Ä¶ he can help get on the tower‚Ä¶ or something?

I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôve been enduring the most boring and drawn out dialogues I‚Äôve ever seen for the past half and hour and I just want to shoot at stuff.

Finally they let me out. I‚Äôm now in generic_postapocalypse_city_ruin_subtype_overgrown_453.
It reminds me a bit of Darksiders. I quickly realize the ‚Äúcity‚Äù is literally just a very large corridor dotted of the same 2 or 3 enemies. There‚Äôs some resource gathering, ‚Äúspare part‚Äù which I realized 8 hours later was supposed to be just ‚Äúmoney‚Äù, steel, and some consumable.

I never found how to rebind the consumables on the 4 shortcuts the game offer (the UI is just terrible, even just finding how to exit the game is a struggle), and they were all very, very weak anyway so I just never used them in the end.
I get into a sewer, find a new type of monster. It‚Äôs the only type of monster in that sewer. At the end of said sewer I get a weapon‚Ä¶ so I guess that was a minidungeon or something?

I get out, I continue going trough that very generic and monotonous city and realize how important the level design of Dark Souls was to its success. In that game you could see at a glance that you were progressing, going up in a city or down in a cave, you could look back and see the road you came from and look ahead to see your goal in the distance.
None of that here. You just keep going on the same very, VERY repetitive giant street doted of a couple of monsters here and there.

I kill a boss, loot ‚Äúsomething‚Äù on it. Don‚Äôt really know what it is, but I suspect it will be used in the hub, so I teleport back to it.
I learn then that that items is the equivalent of Darksouls Lord Soul. You can just trade it to the ONE merchant in that city (a character that sole personality trait seems to be ‚Äúa ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚Äù) for one weapon. No choice to be made here apparently. I discover a bit later that some time the item will give me a ‚Äúperk‚Äù instead, but there‚Äôs never a choice offered like in dark souls, and there‚Äôs no secret merchant to find to turn the item, it‚Äôs always the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that will trade thos items for you.
So why is that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• needed exactly? Why not have the bosses directly loot the items to me?

Anyway, next to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is another merchant, his sole personality trait is ‚Äúnot a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚Äù.

Not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• will let up upgrade your gear and armor. To do so you just need to give him an increasing amount of money and steel. There‚Äôs 3 or 4 tier of steel and the higher the level of the item, the higher the tier of steel you‚Äôll require.
Yes, it‚Äôs basically Dark Souls upgrade system again, but this time you don‚Äôt have different upgrade options, and the steel isn‚Äôt something limited and rare you have to look for, it‚Äôs just a random drop you‚Äôll get everywhere.

I now got the whole picture:
In this game, there‚Äôs only a very limited amount of gear, be it armor or weapons. No random loot, literally just stuff you get rewarded from progressing in the game.
The armors come in 3 pieces, which are all sets that get bonus for being used together, so you have literally no reason to even try to mix sets (you can transmogriphy their looks tho, so here‚Äôs that).

To upgrade these gear you‚Äôll need to grin, a lot, go see Not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and spam ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù until you are out of resources, which happens rather quickly.

This will just increase the damage ouput of your weapons and the resistance of your armors.

You can only carry one main weapon, one side weapon, and one mele weapon.

You can put different ‚Äúperks‚Äù in one (and only one) slot on each of your main and side arm. Not your mele weapon tho, because reasons.

These perks are overall very uninteresting with the exception of some summons that can be useful, and one totally broken perk that let you zoom across the map very fast while raining thunder over everyone.
The thing is, most weapons come with an imbed (and unremovable) perk already sloted, so that quickly cut the amount of build you can do.

You have also 2 ring and 1 necklace slots. These can be found on some spots on the maps, and are minor buffs that help to reinforce your preferred game style.
This is all very basic, very limited, very grindy and very boring. The staggeringly small number of weapon is just‚Ä¶ sad. But hey, when you level them up their skin change a bit, so here‚Äôs that I guess.

Since I‚Äôm already in a tangent, let‚Äôs cover quickly the gameplay.

First thing first, it quest very obvious early on that the game was never designed to be mele centric, to the point that most bosses literally can‚Äôt be mele (or if you try you will get stomped instantly), and the rest of the mobs are usually easier to kill with a few bullets than having to run toward them to give them a wack, especially since all mele weapons seems to have a staggeringly short range.

Other than that, the combat do feel good. It‚Äôs responsive and feel impactful. Nothing feel too bulletspongy, the swap between weapons is snappy and overall shooting (and even meleing if you really want too) feels pretty nice‚Ä¶ the problem is how repetitive it gets tho and that‚Äôs mostly due to 2 simple factors:
The extremely low enemy variety, and the limited number of weapon you can carry. This game should have let you carry at least 2 main and 2 side weapons.

The level design doesn‚Äôt help too, since you can‚Äôt even take cover, you often just fight in vast empty room or tunnels, there‚Äôs no real stategy needed here, just line an enemy shoot, and do the same to the next until everyone is dead while using the dodge button when the enemy use the ‚Äúyou have to dodge to avoid that throw‚Äù action.

So yeah. It‚Äôs polish and feel very smooth, but it‚Äôs also very shallow and get old pretty fast.

Bad collision boxes. You always get stuck on edges of various objects throughout the game world, that are often bigger than the visual objects themselves.

Enemies can straight up hit you through walls. This especially goes for some of the bosses. Extremely frustrating.

No option to re-spec your character. This is just a big no for games like these. You cannot possibly know how good some of the specs in the game are before you know how the game and everything around it works, so you end up investing into something that you don't even know if it will be usefull at some point, with no way of undoing except start a new character and play the game all over.

And even once you stand at an area barrier or even mouse-over one on the map, there is no description on it as in ""travel to XYZ"", so you don't know what the area behind this barrier is called until you actually traveled through it, which means you constantly have to load into a different area, just so you can know what it's called, figure out it's not the place where you want to go, and then have to load back to the previous area, to run to the next barrier, hoping that this one will lead to the area you want to go to.

Your own character has like 3 different voice lines which he says over and over and over. Gets very annoying after a while to hear the same few phrases all the time.

No option to hold sprint.

I have never played any kind of 'souls' game ever, now I realize that I didn't understand what this game was trying to be like originally. I have been watching some people play 'Elden Ring', and I've never seen or got into playing  these types of games before. My exposure to this ""genre"" through watching 'Elden Ring' is ultimately what motivated me to revisit this game. 

From watching I now learned how these games are structured. I had much more fun with this knowledge as opposed to trying to play it as if it were an ""fps looter-shooter"" type game. Other people were able to apply their own experiences from 'souls' games and enjoy it the 1st time around. I had no real experience with any comparable games originally and was left in the dark.

TLDR: Revisited, now love it. Enjoy RPG/FPS games but had never played or watched any ""souls"" style game before. After watching 'Elden Ring' I learned how to actually approach this format.

It basically feels like a stripped down Fallout influenced by Dark Souls, mixed with a Stargate theme and some weird fantasy mechanics that are never explained.  There you go.  

Is it like Dark Souls?  Saving you some technical explanations, it's more forgiving in terms of mechanics.  Bosses are interesting, but sub-par and surrounded by ""adds"".  I did appreciate that many of them have an alternate kill which results in a completely different item drop. They also have unskippable cutscenes, which is unforgivable in a grinding game.  Regular enemies are a dime a dozen with heavy telegraphing, and the very snappy control system feels wasted on them. 

The story and lore are pretty intriguing, and then suddenly it's over.  They also didn't bother having an actual ending, unless you count the pseudo-ending provided by the DLC Subject 2923.  Sidequests are practically non-existent.  Character interactions are brief, and shallow.

Levels are randomly generated, but honestly pretty short.  At any given time you can roll a world via ""Adventure Mode"", which cycles everything, completely outside the campaign.  If you're thorough, there are very, VERY few items (I only recall one) that are missable in the campaign, but if you do, you can reroll that as well.  Not every boss, character, piece of gear or event is available on every roll.  

There are, technically, no character builds.  Your starter gear is affected by one of three classes, but through various achievements or events in the game you acquire cards with various effects.  These Traits level up to 20 a piece, and there are 50 of them, ranging from HP steal, to armor effectiveness, melee damage, some stats, all sorts of things.  All of them are active at the same time from the moment you acquire them.

The gear count is 49 weapons, 18 armor sets, 74 rings (of which you can wear two at a time), and 36 amulets in the game.  There are also 40 weapon mods providing your functional abilities, but not every weapon can change the slotted mod.  Weapons and armor have their own levels, gained from a small set of materials you find on your travels.  Weapon mods have their own stat increases based on the level of the weapon that they're on, and recharge as you do damage with them (or just naturally, via specific loadouts).

Remnant semi-fails on its RNG and replay value.  While the core game is fun, and the 3-person coop has reasonable scaling, it's largely a collection game.  This is because the story is so short, enemies do not scale in such a way that they require specific builds, AND loot remains the same on all difficulties except Hardcore and Survival modes.  Remnant is something you ""just play.""  This is fine for many people, but if you expect to need a variety of equipment and/or abilities to get through sections of the game, you will be utterly disappointed.  ""Advanced challenges"" don't exist.  

In Hardcore mode, you create a fresh character for a perma-death run for the campaign, in order to snag one of ten pieces of account-bound equipment or an emote.  Any unlocks are saved after completion of the entire campaign, or death, for any and all characters.

In Survival mode you are stripped to your undies, taken to a room to buy some randomized starter gear, and have to beat a random world from its beginning that also has randomized gear and trait drops.  When you complete it or die trying, you're chucked back out to the starter room, with any unlocks being account-bound like Hardcore mode.  Five of the ten unique items dropped here can also be bought in the regular game with a special resource gained from any difficulty other than normal.  

Since item drops, character appearances (such as vendors), or specific dungeons are random, the RNG can be quite horrendous in spite of the relatively small environments.  I gave up on a particular armor set after thirty or forty rolls on a particular world.  It doesn't help that none of it is necessary to get through the game, and some builds are dead in the water depending purely on how many times you can do things like looking for an insect in a random room, in a random dungeon that has a random chance to spawn IN A RANDOM PLACE ON THE MAP.  Even with good friends, good music, possibly good booze, that kind of sh*t is just too much.

In my personal experience, however, the game is excruciatingly slow to get going. I played 17h and felt like I barely had any progress. The upgrade paths are extremely linear (few options and then just boost stats of those few options with crafting materials). The areas to explore are really, really dull (in the beginning, at least)...or, I say explore, but really there's no exploration element what-so-ever; If you find an alley or an alternate pathway somewhere, then chances are it's just a dead end with nothing there. Whereas most other games have progressed to rewarding exploration through loot or collectibles at the end of these ""dead paths"", Remnant: From the Ashes does not. Similarly, Remnant: From the Ashes doesn't utilize a lot of other ""typical"" game-design based on implicit knowledge; like hinting the way with a brightly colored world object or a beam of light. This makes Remnant: From the Ashes play like a 10-year old singleplayer rather than a current generation title - which it, however, very much manages to look like! The game is pretty beautiful, although again; the areas are boring and textures and models are copy-pasted everywhere, making nowhere feel unique. Entering a new area is thus interesting for a whole whopping 5 minutes...until you've seen all of the models that the next 10h playtime will contain.

I didn't bother to read anything about this game to avoid spoilers so i let myself to be suprised.

Gunplay feels good, environments look great and even on normal it is challeging enough.

Sadly none of my friends want this game which is sad because it is really a great game.

Yesterday i got butchered by a butcher in a shack in a swamp. I came in unprepared. This is what i really enjoy about this game. Die by a boss, figure out what the mechanics are and retry. Luckily before each boss you can check in at the savepoint and teleport to base to stock up.

When using a checkpoint, smaller mobs respawn which is ok for me since there are more then enough spawnpoints and so far no small mobs between a checkpoint and a boss.
Also, a using checkpoint restores your ammo, health and hearts so it's good to go.

The only let down for this game is that my friends won't play. Oh well, luckily i have a dog i can summon which accompaniesme.

You travel through a variety of realms, each having its own unique lore, setting, and feel, in order to take down the apocalyptic interdimensional horror of the Root, which are literal roots. A nice departure from trees being used to symbolize life. But even weirder, the game has random generation alongside a branching storyline, even though each level is mostly linear. What's more, almost every boss has an alternative counterpart, meaning every time you play the game you can end up with different bosses, routes, and even locations. The game is almost built on replaying, too. You don't have to replay, but each character you make gets their own randomly generated world, which you can re-generate, or you can bring them to friends' worlds in the name of the grind or simply to try and get unique drops from bosses you didn't fight in your run. A sprawling skill tree and variety of weapons caters to various playstyles, meaning every run of the game can be practically indistinguishable from the last. The game and lore is very well put together, but some of the animations are lacking.

However, it doesn't all come together.  While the set pieces are beautiful, they often don't come together in meaningful ways.  The environmental views are beautiful, but fail to tell a total, coherent, or terribly meaningful story about the world or characters you encounter near it.  The mechanics are occasionally marred by poor foresight, such as allowing characters to spec out for melee before giving them a boss that flies, or making enemies scale with your item level- meaning the game is made HARDER by upgrading items.  Co-op is... Well, it's perfectly fine, frankly.  The netcode is pretty great.

So far, the bosses I've encountered just spawn what seems like an endless amount of enemies. Some parts just become a straight shootout, or you gotta deal with status ailments like no other. Does that make the game difficult? No, that's just being annoying.

Your enemy's hit range can throw you off because of your hitbox, but it's more noticeable when you're trying to dodge to the side or back away. However, I've noticed that you get hit less if you just dodge forward.

I might update this the more I play, but so far this game being considered ""souls-like"" is throwing me off.

Edit Feb. 21, 2022.
So, it seems like it'll take a lot of effort to do an melee only run. Also seems unnecessary as most enemies have close and long range attacks. Easy to dodge most of their long range attacks though.

Starting weapons seem to be the worst ones until you can get boss weapons. They're like night and day in damage and effects. Even the built-in mod is better.

Some maps have like empty areas, unless they're different depending on the RNG aspect and might contain an item on the next re-roll.

Some bosses I have yet to figure out how to melee attack, so I just ended up shooting. Adventure mode kinda helps avoid doing a new game plus run, which in a way you can already do by re-rolling the Campaign.",1643594450,1645472065,False,11,0,0.528812885284423828,4,True,False,False

Definitely more fun with friends (so many great, skin of the teeth boss battle victory shouts of joy) but I particularly enjoy the ability to re-roll multiple campaigns and adventures using the same character without ruining the progress of my multiplayer campaign run.  

Really my only big critique is I want more: solo would be a lot more fun if there were more RPG elements (more towns, NPC quest givers, and story related side quests). The game relies more on having to play it through multiple times in different ways than having a huge diversity of characters or stories to explore the first time.  It works well and has a ton of replay value, but the world is so good I'd like to explore it more deeply!

While the DLC is a blast, no one and nothing in your home base (Ward 13) seems to change or acknowledge story events with the exception of few lines of dialogue with one NPC. Though, in fairness it sounds like the original game was a bit of a shock success and the DLC was just a reaction to the success, not part of the original game plan.

The problem is more with balance. I've been playing in easy, and up until the area I reached the game was not too hard - still challenging at times, but I was thinking that I could grow some balls and play on the hard difficulty. Not anymore, though.

The Swamp clearly shows that, sadly, the devs have no idea of what a good abalnce in a game is, and decided to put enemies to make the game hard for the sake of being ahrd, instead of it being, y'know, fun. So you have two basic enemies. One of them is easy to deal with - aim for the head, and you usually two shot them with the light gun. But the other.... The other has no apparent weak point, is a bullet sponge (it's not that tanky, but 5-6 bullet per enemy for a trash mob is WAYYYY too much...).... And they swarm you. Seriously, WTF ???? Usually enemies that swarm you are weak, to make up for their huge numbers, but not here. On top of that, it seems they aggro from the other side of the map, so you jsut get constantly aggrod without ever being able to plan for it.

Now it would be ok if it stopped there. But there are also two elites enemies in the game. One of them has a regen ability - once you damage him enough, he'll put himself in a vulnerable state, but if you don't kill him then, he'll regen ALL his HP. Yeah. Try doing that while being swarmed with tanky basic enemies. Simply not possible.

The other is much easier to deal with..... Except you don't really kill it. Instead, once that elite is dead, a larva tries to run away, and you have to kill it or again the larva regens the elite entirely. Again, try doing that while being swarmed by enemies. And you'll be swamred by enemies while fighting this one because he can also summons the tanky basic enemy ! Yes that's right, even if you do manage to lure the elite in an area you cleared up beforehand, you'll get swarmed by enemies !

This Swamp is the msot worthy of its name yet. It's a tedious, utterly unfun slug. And at the end of the day, when I look at it.... Was the game really fun ? No. A Souls-like shooter sounds fun on paper, but in practice it doesn't deliver - at least not this game. Props for trying to do something a bit unique, but this game would require more work to be fun. And at the end of the day a recommendation has to be based on whether a game is fun to play or not. Go grab a true shooter if you want to shoot things and have fun while doing it

EDIT: OK, the game is not too bad when playing in coop. But it feels as if it wasn't designed for singleplayer at all, which is what I bought if for originally. So I'm not changing my reviews, although if you have friends to play with/are comfortable playing with randos (I am not), like shooters and souls like game, then go for it, I guess",1575740751,1645381417,False,2,3,0.449145227670669556,0,True,False,False

This gives you a huge sense of completionism and reward for doing a little bit of extra exploring which doesn't come risk-free.  I love that.  The combat is immediately complicated but also gives that same sense of reward in successfully overcoming your need to button-mash your way through like most games would push you to do as well as carefully planning what situations warrant using your consumable items. The problems I've had mostly come from the typical 3rd person view getting the camera tangled way outside of the screen/play area and having no idea where your character is or what they're doing. This is especially important to keep track of in CQB situations where this issue almost strictly and constantly occurs.  You'll find yourself stuck in reload animations for some reason almost all of the time (A common bug) or you'll be trying to decipher what your character is doing or if the key you pressed is registering 70% of the time as you're invisible to your camera in hallways and tunnels etc...  To make this more frustrating you'll have a huge area you've monotonously cleared behind you but for some inane magical reason enemies will spawn in droves behind you and all around you without warning or any indication of spawns or missed hallways.  The game is great in it's barebones and stuffs all of the AAA developers into a dark corner where they belong but it's strongest point is also it's weakest and most frustrating point in gameplay.  I think if this had a grade it would be about 80% based very heavily in favor of it's story, balance and style but lacks in some weird little bugs that are a result of it's over-the-shoulder style camera and obscure difficulty scaling combined with the camera issue and super weird unintentional reload bugs.  Apparently this version is also updated graphically, I don't know what it looked like before but the version I'm playing now looks phenomenal in 4k with some clever tricks in texture and shadows, it feels a lot more refined than borderlands 3 using what I'm pretty sure are similar if not the same cell shading techniques.  VERY impressive over all and strongly suggested to buy even at full price and even better on sale.

Being a fan of challenging games which make do not hold your hand, Remnant was right up my Alley. Being a Dark Souls inspired game  ‚Äî character customization, challenging combat, and memorable encounters. Where your typical souls like game is melee focused, Remnant has an emphasis on ranged combat. 

The story and theme of this game reminded me of Sliders or the comic Black Science ‚Äî  traveling through many dimensions trying to save your own.

  [*]Great and engaging combat that keeps you on your toes.
  [*]Vaenvironments that range from post-apocalyptic cities to colorful jungles. 
  [*]Procedural generated worlds make it so that no exact playthrough is exactly the same.  
  [*]Memorable boss fights and encounters that stay with you after you beat the game.
  [*]Though there are two DLC options, I would recommend the Subject DLC over Swamp (or pass over swamp).
  [*]Character progression along with a huge weapon selection to make your Dimensionauts hero of your dreams.     
   [*]Outside of the tutorial, the entire game can be played solo or Co-op with two other people.

My only gripe is that the story could have had more content, but it had enough for several play throughs. I have done all achievements, collected everything in the game 3 times, completed nightmare on hardcore mode and have done the game several times over with friends and had some good laughs and did some cursing (hardcore with friends haha).

Graphics are completely fine to me, leveling system for weapons is ok. Kinda pointless with how it's designed, because the worlds level up proportional to your weapon level ( bosses do have minimum levels but as you improve you will not really need to upgrade gear), but it gives you stuff to collect and grind if that is your thing. More content is supposed to come in the spring of 2020 so that will be fun. Yes, it is sort of like Dark Souls with guns, but with its own Remnant flavor.

I can't really complain about the game, all games have downsides, but any cons this game has is far far outweighed by the pros. It would just be nitpicky things that could be made better since I've played the game so much and know what I would like to have improved. In my opinion, it isn't lacking anything that makes me not want to play it.

100% recommended!

Pros:
- Coop gameplay: we really had to synchronize our attacks, and defend each other
- Guns: awesome and fun guns that feel really good to use, and very good looking
- Special Abilities: each gun has a power (that is replaceable) with cooldown, they are really fun and necessary to beating the game
- Gameplay: It feels super smooth while you are fighting ranged, thats most of the game
- Aesthetics: very nice graphics and enemy designs

Cons:
- Enemy melee attacks can be a little bit cheaty, it seems that the players melee hitbox is too big
- The story, as it is told, is boring: too many characters that actually say nothing, and have little to non personality
- Not much armor options

Probably the lore is pretty nice, but the story would have benefited from having less characters, giving them more depth and personality. I feel like they wanted to go with the feeling of a populated shelter (Ward 13), but as the characters in there feel so stiff, it ends up having no life.
An idea could have been to have very few interesting characters as aids in battle for the players (the sellers, armorers, etc), and then all rescued people are protected inside a more secure area of Ward 13. You cannot access them for their safety or something like that, but you know they are there, depending on you.

1)  It actively tries to deceive and manipulate the players via a false sense of progression.

2)  It's autosave-only which means that you can easily lose everything unless you manually back up your files outside of the game (It happened to a friend I was playing with.)

[h1]Short:[/h1]

Remnant From the Ashes is literally my favorite game from the point of view of its ground controls and combat. If STO had ground combat like Remnant, it would be (in my opinion) the greatest game to be made so far (take note of that ARC games.)

Unfortunately, this game is autosave-only which means that if your autosave gets corrupted, you will lose everything unless you have backed up your saves manually by locating them and copying them to a different folder. (Instructions on how to do that are at the bottom of the review.)

The integrity of this game is also compromised by a counter-intuitive, treadmill-like, level-scaling system so broken that upgrading your weapons makes you weaker relative to the enemies. Upgrading actually makes you weaker... sad. Even worse, it sometimes is necessary because while the enemies will scale up, they won't scale down so if you don't upgrade, you will be badly under-leveled.

The boss battles can also feel cheap and frustrating. Most bosses simply spawn ads faster than a gremlin in a water fountain and some of them are much harder to defeat in coop (I played most of the game in coop but needed to do two boss battles alone in order to advance.)

[h1]Long:[/h1]

Deeply ambivalent about this game...

[h1]The good:[/h1]

Movement and general combat system are second to none.

The music is very nice.

The world is is reminscent of the one C.S. Lewis created for The Magician's Nephew. It's very interesting and full of possibilities.

The combat CAN be a nice blend of shooting, dodging and hack & slash... at least until the bosses start spamming adds and healing themselves.

Joining other people's games just works (you join games rather than sending invites but you can still easily play with your friends by having the host set the game to friends only and then having the other players simply use the option to join a friend's game.)

[h1]The bad:[/h1]

Boss battles can be tedious and very unfair since the bosses are just cheap having lots of adds, a ridiculous number of hitpoints (this can make you hate your weapons) and the ability to dodge, teleport and kill you in a hit or two ESPECIALLY when you have to slow down to use a healing potion. 

I actually liked the design and rhythm of some of the bosses so it really is sad that they decided to turn so many of them into rabbit lords that just spawn minions like a gremlin in a water fountain. The add spamming actually makes the bosses feel less unique since regardless of how the bosses work, every boss battle basically turns into fight the adds and try to get in a few shots to chip away at the boss while avoiding artillery strikes and poison which the cheap boss will keep spamming at you along with the infinite minion spawns. 

The leveling system is a counter-intuitive treadmill. The bosses and enemies level up to always be one higher than your most powerful piece of gear with the result that rather than feeling stronger as you level up your gear, you often end up feeling weaker instead. To quote the devs:

""So, if you have a +5 gun (so level 6 behind the scenes), a +3 secondary gun, a +2 sword, and +1 armor (all 3 slots) your weighted afterage is about level 5. Now, each NEW area you go into will be 5+1 (your level +1, so 6). Your level 6 gun will be doing work, and your armor will be below-par for enemies in that level 6 zone.""

In other words, the game's ""scaling"" treadmill not only ensures that you do not really get stronger but also you can't even choose to prioritize one class of item since all the enemies will be ""scaled"" to your best item hence you must level everything you plan to use to the same level without prioritizing anything. This means that you will either play a mediocre character with no particular talents or a weak character with no particular talents. 

The weapons are underwhelming precisely because of the bullet-sponge bosses and the treadmill leveling system. I can't appreciate a weapon which can't even kill low level trash without multiple hits no matter how many times I upgrade it and when I see the weapon I upgraded so many times being virtually useless against a boss, I frankly stop valuing the weapon. The weapon then ceases to exist in my mind as a weapon and simply becomes a contrived mechanic to draw out the battles on the assumption that if a well-organized team of people can kill a boss quickly, then the game is somehow ruined since it says in the complete hack's guide to game development that boss battles should always take at least fifteen minutes.

I would like to recommend the game but I must do so with a warning. To get a good experience out of this, you need to metagame to keep your gear level down and avoid re-rolling. Even then, you will still get in trouble in endgame because the max level for the enemies is higher than the max level for your gear and abilities. This is partially compansated for by the fact that you can get passive skill bonuses but even if you do everything right, you will finish the game about as strong relative to the average enemies as you started out.

An additional wrinkle is the fact that weapons with built-in mods (boss weapons) are actually twice the level they say they are so you need to upgrade them to exactly half the level of your other gear.

Honestly this game probably would have been better without any RPG-leveling at all. A level up system that doesn't actually allow you to bceome stronger is worse than no level-up system at all.

Jim Sterling, who rarely meets a Soulslike game he doesn't like, doesn't recommend this and given that he found the constant feeling of getting stronger in Dark Souls, I think it's possible that he might have actually liked the game if it weren't for the level-scaling.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N3PgYxf6JM

To sum up, this game has great combat and an interesting world but it's design is somewhat undermined by a leveling scaling system designed to prevent you from actually getting stronger and a save system that requires working outside the game to back up your files.

[h1]Saving:[/h1]

Your profile sometimes randomly becomes corrupted and you lose everything.

[h1]Backup your save![/h1]

C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Remnant

Check your save location and hope that the game's auto-back up save files work.

Path: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Remnant\Saved\SaveGames
Ex: profile.bak -> profile.sav (Rename profile.bak to profile.sav)
Ex: save_0.bak -> save_0.sav (Rename save_0.bak to save_0.sav)

After I wrote the first negative review for the low-effort ""Swamps of Corsus"" DLC, one of the devs banned ALL of my Remnant screenshots as violations of the Steam terms of use. He claimed to have done this by accident... eleven times in a row.

I had a lot of fun, but once you hit a certain point where the curtains are pulled back and you realize how everything is tiled together and encounters, weapon designs, and abilities copy/paste each other, it gets VERY dull very quickly and it's hard to pull anything meaningful out of it anymore. I played with a friend the entire time, which improved the experience greatly. I do not think I would have played this if I was alone.

The story basically doesn't exist, and what little does is impressively complicated and yet one dimensional. So I guess bravo to them for achieving that. Even the enemies you face along the way in the campaign are completely randomized so it's not like you really have an actual antagonist or memorable characters aside from ""The Root"", which I'm still not even sure what that is or where it came from.

The bosses are the most fun part honestly. After going through a couple levels and mindlessly killing regular enemies who are just placed by an algorithm strictly to sink your time into them, I found myself just sprinting past them just to get to the more interesting boss enemies. The biggest issue with the bosses, however, is that Gunfire Games decided the best design they could implement was sending ceaseless waves of regular, tanky enemies at you so you can't focus solely on the boss. That way it's harder to tell that a lot of the bosses aren't difficult, just very tedious.

The various items provide many different stat boosts that would allow you to try different play styles which is fantastic. The thing that confused me the most however is the stats that boosted melee attacks, as if someone were to make a melee character. With every single melee weapon, you get a light attack and a charge attack, and you can dodge. That's it. You can't parry, block, shove, or combo. Enemies charge at you in great numbers, and there are a ton of ranged enemies. Some bosses literally cannot be hit with melee attacks. Playing a melee character would be the most pointless and frustrating thing possible in this game.

[b] Pros: [/b]

[u] Coop: [/u] Works smooth and it's really fun to have shootouts with your friends and Hordes of enemies
[u] Guns: [/u] Fluent and great Gunplay with heaps of different Weapon Types to play around
[u] Mods and Perks: [/u] A big variety that you can unlock and customize your character with. Especially the weapon mods are fun to tinker around with
[u] Soundtrack: [/u] Surprisingly good Soundtrack that fits the occasion, being it the fight against a giant boss or just a stroll through the Hub Base.


[b] Cons:[/b]

[u] Level Design: [/u] In each World the Dungeons are mostly just Copy and Paste Design, have you seen one have you seen them all. The only way to tell the Dungeons apart is the Names. In certain locations the World can look really interesting while in other sections it looks really bland and it's just you walking through empty spaces.
[u] Melee Fight: [/u] There is also a fair bit of different Melee  Weapons to choose from but barely any use for them because the Enemies will swarm you everytime making it a painful experience if you try to fight more than 1-2 enemies at a time
[u] Story and Lore: [/u] Boring and very generic. It feels shambled together with some cutscenes leaving me confused about what even is  going on. There is certain bosses were I would've liked to know more background lore but learning that feels like chore and the most you'll find out is through the Item Descriptions in Boss Drops which are often more unhelpful than helpful.
[u] Characters: [/u] The devs tried to go with the basic; ""Oh there is this character who dislikes/likes/is curious about you from the beginning and you want to know more about them"" but the only reason you'll speak to them is either to buy items or upgrade your gear because they are just so poorly written.
[u] Difficulty: [/u] The Game relies on very cheap tactics like swarming you with Hordes of enemies or the excessive use of Status Effects, with some being barely noticeable and others making the game straight up annoying. There is also a total of 4 Difficulty Settings (Normal, Hard, Nightmare, Apocalypse) which scales up HP and Damage Pools. Besides inflating the Enemies Health and Damage there is no real benefit to do that. It has no effect on loot drops besides a slightly higher spawn rate for Elite Enemies who drop a Crafting Material. Not worth it the extra effort and time required to kill Enemies.
[u] Reroll System: [/u] Every World of the game will be generated randomly with one of the 2 World Bosses and 2-3 Dungeon Bosses (Depends on the World). You can simply reroll the Worlds seperately in Adventure Mode or reroll the entire Campaign which also makes you loose your entire progress, only your character and gear stays the same. So if you want to fight the other bosses you'll have to reroll the World. The problem here is the  random factor, if you are unlucky the world might generate 3 times in a row with the same boss. 
 Now this can be Pro or Con, depends on the person who is playing. In my case it's a negative point simply with the fact that I don't want to be forced into rerolling a world again and again only to get a specific  weapon. If you like grinding then this might be for you.
[u] Buggy: [/u] The Game often feels rushed, especially the DLC. Item descriptions in a different language, a Boss Item simply disappearing out of my friends inventory, making him unable to get the boss weapon or  a Boss just falling out of the Arena and dying on the spot.
[u] Souls-like: [/u]  Basically one of the Main reasons why i bought that game. But unlike a good Souls-likes the Game relies on cheap tactics to make it Difficult (Stated Above). I was especially thrilled to fight the Bosses but sadly only a few of them were geniuenly fun and challenging to fight. Some are clearly inspired by the Dark Souls series,  which isn't a bad thing, like a Ornstein and Smough type fight in the Subject 2923 DLC , a Dragon Boss which let's you cut his tail off to get a melee weapon or a pretty difficult Moonlight Butterfly fight. Still most of the Bosses will constanly summon smaller enemies which makes the fight more annyoing rather than challenging, while others barely summon any little helpers at all which makes the Boss a cakewalk.
The Game tries to go for the classic Dark Souls scheme of 'You have to figure it out by sourself"" with some of the Boss or Game Mechanics but fails at it so that you'll have to brute force your way through it because you  have no idea what's going on. There is also the classic shortcut next to every World's first Bonfire that you can unlock but in most cases that is unnecessary since behind that locked door waits just another Bonfire that you can use instead of opening the door or gate.


In Conclusion there is a few other things that I could rant about but I'll leave it at that. I really tried to like the game but after a few hours playing it felt more like a chore because I wanted to make it worth the money.
If you are looking for a new Souls-like I recommend looking elsewhere, in my opinion the only reason why this game is called like that is the use of the 'Bonfire' System. 
Playing it in Coop and fooling around with the different Guns can be pretty entertaining but all the Negative Points that I listed above drain the fun out of it really quickly.
If you really wanna buy it wait for it to be on Sale, the price with the DLCs is not worth it at all compared to the rougly 20 hours playtime you'll need to finshed the game if you play at a chill pace.",1644770115,1644771512,False,56,5,0.61297917366027832,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*] Don't judge the rest of the game by the difficulty/aggravation of the first boss. He's probably the most annoying boss of the game because the exploding adds make the fight more luck-based than skill-based.
[*] Read up on the scaled leveling of the game (and why it isn't always best to upgrade your gear) or you may be confused by the seemingly random difficulty. Also be aware that allowing a high-level gear person in your group can boost enemies far above your level which can make you useless in your own group (and possibly force you to reroll your campaign).
[*] Several bosses can be defeated in a different way to get a different piece of gear.
[*] The game [b]loves[/b] to hide materials, consumables, and accessories from you. Check every nook and cranny!
[*] The Steam ""guides"" section for this game has a lot of great info like how to get certain sets of armor or how to effectively build a melee character. [i]Highly recommended.[/i]
[*] Important for last boss! [spoiler]Kill as many enemies as you can in the ""shadow void"" before exiting for a damage buff that will allow you to actually do damage.[/spoiler]

-hands down best co-op souls like combat looter shooter to date, mechanic and story wise. More games should just give the f*ck up and be this instead. Just as solid solo
-simple weapon, armor and abilities to swap around for easy but specific builds

-every conceivable line of hobo wear from p1ss stained trench coats to sh1t caked rubber tires and hundreds of feet of duct tape to hold your guns together. I personally hate the armor aesthetics of this game but they could appeal to others, so I'll show the neutral section some love and just drop it here.

I have to say down right now after loosing all my progress!
For some reason my computer cycled power.  When it came back it said the save file was corrupt and do I want to repair.  I said repair YES.  Then it came back and said FAIL and forced me to start a new character, no getting out of that without task manager.  I have this game on Steam, I expect better backup of saved games.  Why is there only ONE for so many of these games and it is so eager to overwrite it!   I can understand that files can be corrupted on MY Hardware when the computer crashes, but not on server for 118 hours worth of gaming!!!!!!   So I am very mad right now and tried all the forum and steam help stuff I could find and frankly it is not straight forward.  None worked.

I kind of had a love hate relationship with this game before this.  Half the bosses are way too hard for me on easy.  I had a friend that smashed his monitor due to this game.  I smashed a mouse.  Anyway, most of the game is pretty darn fun and the graphics and sound are very pleasing to me.   I have so many hours because I kept replying the easier stuff over and over and eventually would win against a boss.  I will tell you right now that I game for fun and not competing.  I have NO DESIRE to get better like it is some kind of JOB.  I get so mad when I see people tell other people to LEARN to game.  There should ALWAYS be a way for people that want to get past a boss to do so without a heart attack or equipment loss.  People should be allowed to have fun.  I am fine with the game calling me a cheater....I just want to have that freaking option!

I actually originally bounced off it so hard I refunded the game, but it was after returning alongside two friends that I ended up greatly enjoying myself. This is one of the best souls-likes on the market right now, but it is held back by the fact that this is not a journey you can make with randos. 
PROS: 
-Combat, at least with guns, is very punchy and solid and the weapons are unique. You get lasers, crossbows, lightning guns, flamethrowers, guns that shoot bugs, guns that launch explosive beehives, etc alongside your standard FPS/TPS guns.
-It has like roguelite elements in that worlds are slightly different each time. Rather than full randogen, it instead will chain together dungeons and overworld areas in different patterns with different bosses. The effect is that replaying areas stays fresh for far longer.
-Adventure mode (basically allowing you to replay any chapter of the story and its respective world) means you get to experiment with builds, item choices, and see absolutely everything the rogue-lite elements provide.
-Very solid combat and gear systems. Mixing and matching rings, armor, and amulets can drastically change how the game plays.
-Art direction is very good once you get past Earth. While Earth is very standard post apocalypse, the other realms are gorgeous and look far more like things out of fantasy games. Ancient mystic forests, desert canyons filled with warriors, snow covered woods, magic swamps filled with mysterious machinery, etc. Definitely a breath of fresh air. 

NOTES:
-This is not a game that can be played with Randos, and it is not a game that is very fun alone either. Bosses are buffed in multiplayer to require actual teamwork and coordination to properly take down, something that only voicechat can really provide. Bring a friend, preferably two.  

CONS:
-Melee combat is bad, and should be treated like emergency melee in a standard FPS instead of melee in a souls game.  The wind up leaves you way too open to getting slapped, and this is a game where every bit of health counts. 
-Very little armor variety. The armor actually has perks of its own which makes it understandable that they couldn't add in quite as many sets, but it is still very very noticeable how few sets are in the game. This is partially alleviated by the armor skins, but those are DLC locked. 
-Some bosses (Cough Ixilis) break when the multiplayer balancing is applied to them, requiring faaaaar more effort for three people to take down than a solo player has to expend. 
-Story is obtuse. I know this is becoming a cliche of souls likes but it is definitely noticeable here since it drops threads like a cheap jacket. You meet an important guy who is basically God of the multiverse in a stone tower and he tells you to screw off and you never see or hear from him again. A woman mistakes you for a chosen one when you emerge from a portal to a desert land and then she is never heard from or seen again. There is some kind of rebellion brewing among the satyr people of the forest world, you meet the resistance leaders, and then never talk to them again or see how their rebellion goes. Seeing a pattern?

Go watch some reviews, check out some gameplay, and see what you think. I played the entire game (100% achievements) solo and have zero complaints.

I'd recommend playing the game on hard from the very start, so glowing fragments (mats used to purchase skins) will drop from the elite enemies and bosses. It'll make the ""Fashion is Danger"" achievement less of a grind (if you're planning on going for that).

Fun boss encounters, tons of incentive to replay, lots of little secrets, and satisfying combat. I also hear it's a great co-op experience.

Definite recommend from me.",1644088905,1644088905,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
617290,109550583,76561198030699316,406,85,981,0,667,1691793677,"This one's for the hardcore gamer that loves Dark Souls and roguelikes. Gameplay is divided into 4 segments; Bosses, Traits, Rerolls, and Upgrades. You should play this one with a Guide, such as the wiki. Be prepared to bring up to two other players; this is a co-op game that lets 3 people play, but you can solo it (not reccommended). The DLC is required to get the full experience of the game; buy this game on sale. There are about 5 ""worlds"" to play in this game, about a couple hours each. This game is also buggy. This game does NOT have a Souls mechanic, meaning if you die, you lose nothing. What you lose is the ability to obtain a much needed upgrade and a frustrating route to take back the chance.

With the boss gameplay mechanic you have 3 bosses per area, World Bosses (Your objective), Event Bosses (Similar to DarkStone; this is usually randomly generated on roll based on two possible Event outcomes), Dungeon Bosses (Minibosses). You gather traits for special actions you do. One such example is you can kill one of the first Event Bosses to gain a specific trait and item, otherwise you can nab a Mask from a different dungeon in the area and use it on the tree to gain it's trust and obtain a different trait and item. A world or planet usually has a bunch of areas, and those areas usually have 3 dungeons; event, world, and dungeon.

The Trait system is kinda like the skill tree in other games, with exceptions. You must find the traits on your own (please use a guide) to unlock them. You get traits by doing specific things, and they replace ""Levels"". You have a Trait bar at the top of the Trait menu, and that's your game level. The game gets up to around 800 levels. Each trait is maxxed at Lv 20. The game has alot of Tomes in the world (blue item pickups) that give you free level ups. When you use the Crystal (bonfire) in Ward 13, you can reroll your adventure, which restarts your progress but you keep all items, equipment, traits, levels, etc. This reroll feature exists so you can reset events and nab the items you are looking for, esp if you messed up your objective (HINT: the game has an Adventure mode so you don't lose progress in your story if you reroll; DLC is NOT required for Adventure mode). One example of an objective easy to mess up for getting a new trait is infecting an elf in the Corsus world. If you die before you reach the elf, you can reroll the adventure and try again (please use a guide).

Upgrades; you can upgrade your weapons, armour (PLEASE DO NOT UPGRADE ARMOUR; it automatically levels the enemies to make them stronger), craft new weapons, and buy crafting materials in Ward 13. Upgrading weapons is part of the Trait mechanic because it stacks the abilities you already are upgrading through Traits. It's somewhat designed like a trading card game, where you have to think about what you are trying to stack when you deal with Traits and Upgrades. Weapons also have Mods, which allow players to use special abilities, but they are attached to your weapon. When you press Y/Triangle to switch weapons, the mod is selected, so you have to switch weapons to select what mod you inserted during battle. Please remember this because I always forget xD
I reccommend the Mender's Aura mod for beginners, which regens you for 10 seconds (useful before you can upgrade the Dragon Heart), and the ""wallhacks"" mod for beginners (Hunter's Mark), which allows you to see enemies through walls. Extremely helpful mods before you unlock Root Mother since most of the game at that point is just walls (it's a cityscape)... And Root Mother allows you to upgrade your Dragon Hearts (Estus Flasks).

DLC locks certain useful weapons and traits, AND crafting items needed to upgrade your Base Vanilla game. I reccommend the DLC so much because it drags you down, especially friends you play with and especially those friends who use your save or their save files to farm traits and high level items. The game is hardly playable without the DLC.

AND YES.... you can use anyone's save file to upgrade yourself. If you play in a friend's world, all changes and upgrades, etc will be yours to keep on your charcter when you go back to your original save file, online or offline. The only thing that resets is story/adventure mode progress, as it will leave off where you left it before you joined your friends. It is highly reccommended to visit each other's save files so that you can progress each other's story.... and possibly redo questlines you messed up before to get a trait or item. And YES. If a friend gets a trait from a boss while in their save, you usually unlock it as well (certain ones cannot be unlocked this way, such as the battle with Brabus, which requires a rereoll or a hop into a friend's save in order to unlock the trait for both players).

Here's some of the other stuff outside game mechanics.

Great:
-Worlds and some mechanics are innovative and creative; creativity like this is really hard to find in video games now
-Graphics are amazing in Ultra mode, 1080p 240hz

Good:
-Environments are pretty
-Lore is convoluted, meaning alot of it is open to interpretation
-Lore is kinda simple with the conflicts.... Dark Souls lacks that and confuses you with the lore; this game is more straightforward
-The game has comedic moments; a high fantasy game like Dark Souls takes itself too seriously
-Combat is rewarding during some fights
-Extremely high replay value
-Online is shared, meaning I don't lose character progression when I return to my save
-The lack of a ""Souls"" currency means I don't lose valuable character progression (BUT I lose something more valuable, which is time, if I lose the ability for a chance at a trait/item)

Bad:
-Combat is not the best here; boss battles that are not satisfying and has an ""ads"" mechanic, ugh
-GLITCHES omg the planet of Yaesha has the best combat in the game but all the enemies are stringy RE4 monsters who have such glitched animation that they are easy to fight... but when they DO animate proper, they are so freaking Soulslike that they are really fun to fight
-DarkStone-esque Events meaning I have to reroll campign just to get the boss I want to fight... There is a 50/50 chance on every roll that it doesn't happen... it waste's so much time esp if I'm playing with other players
-The game has a hyperbole of counterbalance; I am not able to equip the armour or rings I want to equip because Pushing the Big Red Button means I sacrifice too much... in a Team based game, that is not good

Horrible:
-Ads are enemy spawn waves that are not the boss; think Serious Sam and it's just not a good mechanic in a Souls-like game
-Lore requires a prequel game that has even worse playability than this game
-NES Four Score dilemma; Players need to learn the game via a guide before jumping in, as well as actually having friends (who also need to read a guide)... who then need to want to play a game that locks content behind DLC... This is a really bad mess for new players and it doesn't incentivise them to keep playing, making the game push further into niche
-REALLY bad support; there is on-going debate in the community about the Elder Knowledge trait, and it's divided so bad that the devs REALLY need to step in and say something on the matter... Racism could be solved with how much players disagree on spending levels on that trait
-Replay value is ""Getting Over It 2: The Sequel""; if the game had a better checkpoint system on some of the more difficult traits to aquire, I wouldn't pull my hair out so much... The elf corruption questline has one of the best traits in the game but has NORMAL enemies that oneshot you as a high level player... ugh
-PLEASE FIX the menu system.... I have to maunally load in to an area to know what it's called which makes Trait/Item grinding more frustrating than it should be.... and the LOAD TIMES ugh
-Load times, even on an M.2 with fast internet are ridiculous and unnessecary
-I had to purchase DLC to upgrade my guns",1644059742,1644059742,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

And you can see from my time record that I tried.

There are a lot of positive things about the game, like the lore, the gameplay, the world, the bosses, the mobs variety...

I played it exclusively solo and didn't find it that difficult. I of course, had my share of deaths but never I thought the game was too hard or balanced for co-op only.

But after 42 hours of play, I feel like I wasted my time because the game is very repetitive and it didn't reward me enough to compensate this issue. There are simply not enough items to loot in order to keep me engaged and even rewards on bosses are not very interesting since they're mostly new skills to slot in your weapons, forcing you to make choices and change your playstyle if you want to use them... 

I understand most of rewards are obtainable via harder modes but if I can't stay interested in the game throughout the main campaign and quit because of its poor amount of rewards, there is no chance for me to experience those harder modes...

Most people seem to not have these issues, but this is based on my experience with the game.

Pros (generally a great game) 

1. There are a lot of weapons and most of them are unique and fun to use. Really excellent weapon diversity and most feel balanced.
2. Different choices throughout the game and the randomization of boss generation means the game has great replayability.
3. Different outcomes from how you defeat some of the bosses yield different weapons or equipment, again increasing replayability, but this isn't perfect. There are some issues with this as for some you need to beat them in a specific way such as hiding before the fight or breaking a certain body part. This wouldn't be so bad if you didn't need to deal like 80% of the bosses health only hitting that one part to break it. As these aren't weak points and it takes so much damage to meet the conditions you're never going to discover this naturally and will have to look up if the boss has something like that. Still a good feature though, but I wished the game hinted at these somewhere.
4. The boss designs themselves are good and they are the focal point of the game.
5. Enemies in general are different and interesting to face encouraging different strategies but not forcing them if you like a certain playstyle.
6. Armor and items allow for great diversity in your setup and enable many different playstyles to be viable. It seems like a lot of thought went into this and they are fun to experiment with.

Cons 

1. Solo play is vastly inferior to playing in a group. This is a real issue that makes playing by yourself not really something I'd suggest buying the game for.
2. Boss fights are significantly worsened by every boss I've encountered except 2 spawning an infinite number of minions as the fight continues. This distracts from the otherwise interesting bosses and becomes a big problem in Nightmare and especially Apocalypse difficulties where it can take multiple clips to kill a single minion. Most of the boss fight turns into focusing down the minions as fast as possible to be able to do some damage to the boss before the next wave of minions spawns in and constantly checking that they didn't spawn in behind you. This is made worse by the bosses that spawn in the suicide bomber type minions that one-shot you in most builds or exceptionally tanky minions

Techinical Issues (what stops me from recommending the game - most people don't seem to have these)

1. Control hotkeys reset every time I open the game, but not to default, completely unbinding some like zoom that I have to reset manually every time I play. No idea what causes this. Fixed by reinstall but happened again.
2. Menu type shortcuts don't work for me. For example press ""x"" to access weapon mods or ""b"" to go back in the menus have no effect. Also applies to the press ""x"" to die when bleeding out. I have to manually click on the ""press b to back"" button on the screen to use the menus. Can't do this while bleeding out so have to wait the full duration, but this instance almost never comes up. Not too big a deal but really annoying. Again reinstall fixed but came up again.
3. Certain enemies appearing caused a CTD every time. In my case it was the Blight Skull. Every time a Blight Skull attacked my game would CTD. Once again a reinstall fixed and thankfully this hasn't come up again. Probably a corrupted file, but this is the only game I had an issue with something like this.
4. Random death glitches that skip the bleedout phase and cause you to instantly die with the falling/knocked down animation. This occurs to me every few hours when fighting various bosses even while my teammates have the Dragon Hearts left to revive me. Especially annoying when it ends your hardcore runs and the reason I don't play hardcore anymore.
4. The Ruin bug. If your Ruin is not charged in a multiplayer session and the host quits the session your Ruin can be bugged to never charge its weapon mod again. The reason this happens is dumb and many people have experienced this issue but it's not going to be patched. Unfortunately I did not know this and my Ruin became bugged. There is no fix. If you want Ruin's weapon mod you need to start a new game. Even reinstalling does not fix it. Just don't use it in multiplayer unless you're the host.

I've had to reinstall this game 9 times to correct the technical issues that came up on three different hard drives. Most recently this was on a brand new SAMSUNG 970 EVO Plus 2TB SSD and a new SAMSUNG 870 2TB SSD on which everything else runs correctly so it's not a hard drive issue. If these issues didn't keep happening I would recommend the game as it's good.

The controls are excellent (it's the first souls like game I've played that actually feels great using mouse and keyboard), the weapons look, feel, and sound awesome, and the enemies are interesting.  I also like the random qualities that were added to the game so that each play-through is slightly different.   I guess really the only annoying aspect for me (aside from the area up to and including the first boss, which happened to be Shroud for me) is the amount of added enemies to the boss encounters.

I am still  on my mood to continue forward after making my review of this game. It is a surprise that I missed this game when it came out, 2 years ago. And finally, I do see a hidden charm which I am impressed with, compared to some other games similar to Dark Souls and DS series itself: the RNG of replayability, difficulty and loots-grind that it could be a problem at times. But other than that, I do see a small, yet solid, game.

First of, for a game tagged as ""Similar to Dark Souls"", it is quite a lite version, similar level feeling I would give as like as Ashen. I gave my few points in this review too that you might not to focus much on that point. You don't lose scraps when you die. Yet you do have a ""Bonfire"" mechanic, limited healing items and hard bosses. That's probably it for the feeling familiar with DS, seriously.

For the rest, the game offers a good shooter mechanic experience, a level system that you do gain points to put in your traits. Kinda it gives you a way how you want to progress in the game, inlcuding additional traits that you can find along the way, depending of your actions or events in your playthroughts.

And if you have read carefully, your playthroughts will be never the same on restarting your story. That's right! The themes of the game will stay the same, but the maps themselve will randomly change. For example, you have met your first boss, then you do restart your story. When you arrive to meet your first boss, it might not be the same as before. Another one on my experience, I met someone in a blimp before, talked with him. Right now in my second playthrought, the blimp is no more, but I got a cursed area with some kind of cultists, praying around a tree. The game itself changes, each time you reroll it. Even in multiplayer, you join with your friends in their game sessions, their maps will look familiar, but not the same as yours.

Talk about the multiplayer experience, the game scales about how big your team is. Not only you do have a difficulty option before starting the game, but you also have a multiplayer scaling too as difficulty: more hp for enemies, more damage,etc. Already that I play on HARD difficulty because I really felt NORMAL being too easy, the multiplayer scale really made the difference. At this point, I will say that rushing head down and killing every enemies in the vicinity isn't the best tactic that I saw while playing online. Take some time to create a build that you can use for either solo, team oriented or both if you want to. You have the choice for all kind of customization with the gears and mods to setup yourself in this game.

For the builds, I can say that it works depending on what you can get as trait, weapons, armor and mods. You see, we all start with three different traits. As we progress, we gain more traits dependings the events and actions we have done. Each time you level up, you gain 1 point to put in a trait. You can also gain a point if you find a Tome of Knowledge which they are rare, but also not that uncommon in this game. Traits are more likely to gain more HP, Stamina, do more damage in Melee, Elemental resistance, Mod duration,etc. 

As for the weapons and armors, they are varied. Starting with 3 full sets as starter, you can think a bit the playstyle of what you prefer to aim first. Like Dark Souls, you do choose something from the start. But in the end, you would be able to do anything.

As for the weapon mods, you can equip only 2 at a time. Those acts like your spells in the game. Some can be cast only 1 time before you do need to recharge them. While others can be cast multiple times. Either for offensive and defensive  uses, you can play and twitch with them while creating your builds. Sometimes, you might switch with some other mods when you are stuck against a boss to adapt and beating out these fiends.

As part of the story, it is pretty basic, slightly shallow. But the core is there. Simply put that Earth is invaded by a thing named the Root and it devours the life forms on the planet. You, the hero, decided to try to reach to the source to stop this infestation and you will walk in many places to reach this destination.

That sounds like a classic fantasy RPG. But this is what it is. Some npcs are recognizeable. While some are quite forgettable. It is a bit of disappointment  on my part. Possibly more interactions would make them more intriguing, lorewise and intriguing. But unfortunately, it is not the case.

For the music soundtrack, it is epicly good. Funny that we do have some good memories for the Dark Souls music bosses. If you pay attention in Remnant, I am pretty sure you will get the same vibe into it.

In the end, I have fun playing Remnant. Along with Subject 2329 that it gave me an additional and rough 7h  with some skips and at least 1h with the Swamp of Corsus so far, the game lasts quite a good long run for a small game.

I recommend to try it out. It is even better with friends, at least to start on Hard difficulty for some good challenges ahead.",1642633601,1642633601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story kinda sucks IMO. You don't really have any reason to get attached to any characters. The lore is kind of neat but you don't get enough time to get invested in any supporting character or factions to ever really care beyond ""What do I shoot next?""

Most of the game is some basic shooting, kiting, looting to upgrade your weapons and upgrade your traits 1% bonus at a time. The best of the game happens during boss fight where a lot more brain is required to either fight against gimmicks or manage several problems at once. Unique guns and unique mods offer some pretty fun mechanics shift when fighting. Unique weapons tend to have unique mods, meaning that you lose the versatility of builds when using those exclusively.

Still, it's a pretty decent bout for a couple playthroughs, a bit more with DLC. I just wish I cared more for the story or the characters in the game, but they're pretty soul less or not given enough for your to ever care.",1642487971,1642487971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a lot of good. The term souls-like has become synonymous with games that try to mimic souls, and rarely reach anywhere near the level of polish, or fairness those games achieve. You usually see these games described as ""Dark Souls, but with ___"" and this game is often described as ""Dark Souls, but with guns"". Gunfire Games however, decided to innovate, and make something with a souls feel without restraining itself to that formula, and what you get is a pretty good third person shooter with souls-like mechanics. It doesn't try to outdo Dark Souls, it tries to do something different, which makes it easier to forgive many of this games flaws.

I went into this game with fairly low expectations. I knew the levels were randomly generated, which, to me, sounded like an attempt to cut costs and let the game design the levels itself. The first 5 or so hours of this game aren't great, and almost outright bad. My first area was flat and lacked substance, my first dungeon was a slow straightforward slog through endless trash mobs, and my first boss was an awful reskin of one of the enemies who would just teleport around the arena and endlessly spawn more trash mobs. The first impressions this game gives aren't fantastic, and if it wasn't for the satisfying shooting mechanics, I'd probably have dropped this quickly, and thankfully I didn't because I got to play through one of the most fun shooter RPGs I've ever played. 

After the bad first area, the games quality just goes up and up. Killing mobs, trying out new guns (which are all exceedingly well balanced), and looting these maps was actually extremely fun. The areas get better and get aesthetically pleasing and complex as you go. While I still partially believe this game used random generation to cut level design costs, it works very well for this type of game, and to my surprise, works to this game's advantage more than it's detriment. Everything you come across in a playthrough is randomized, including loot, bosses, and even quest opportunities, which makes going back and replaying the areas feel fresh when a new point of interest shows up, or you find a quest or gun that wasn't there before.

The story itself is nothing to write home about, so if you're looking for something with a good story you may want to look elsewhere. The bosses vary HEAVILY in quality, some are fun and require strategic thinking, while a select few are so unbelievably bad they make the Bed of Chaos look like a masterpiece. The final boss in particular is a mess and heavily punishes not using a certain type of build as well as having an incredibly annoying gimmick. Certain other bosses are worse, which isn't helped by this game's very clunky dodge-roll. There are times where you will die constantly and it won't feel like it's your fault, and times where you will suffer a few deaths that aren't exactly fair. These flaws would be fatal in any other souls-like, but since this game innovates, it's easier to forgive things it does definitively worse than Dark Souls. 

The Co-Op in this game is actually one of the highlights. Souls-like games usually adopt the faux co-op system Dark Souls had, but this game lets you play the entire game from beginning to end with a friend, and loot is shared between all players, making co-op the arguably definitive way to play. Solo is still fun, but I feel like this game was designed to be played with a friend or two. 

The gameplay is easily the highlight. The shooting feels great no matter which gun you use, and the weapons, mods, armor, and trinkets are all very balanced. You can use your starting guns and armor from start to finish and you wouldn't be worse off than someone who uses later game gear, they all work and are all viable. Just about every weapon mod (which are more like abilities) feel powerful in their own way, and it feels great when you find one that meshes well with your build. The game wants you to use whatever gun you enjoy the most, and not what some meta decides you should use. 

If there's one massive complaint I have, it's the bosses. Bosses are divided into two types, dungeon bosses, and world bosses. Dungeon bosses are (usually) just regular enemies with modified movesets and mechanics added. These aren't bad, but feel kinda jarring at first when the bosses are hardly modified from their regular counterparts other than increased health and endless mob spawning. World bosses are the more unique battles, some of which have alternate means of killing them or taking on the battle itself, like hiding out and ambushing the boss in a better arena, or playing a song to skip the boss itself. I love these and honestly I wish other souls-likes (or even From Software) would adopt this mechanic, as it makes refighting a boss feel fresh. There are, however, a select few bosses that are just.. very bad in terms of design. These kill the game's momentum as you have to fight a boss that might be wildly more powerful than anything you've faced before, or has mechanics that are just borderline unfair. 

All in all, I recommend this especially if you have someone to play with. It has great replay ability and can be literal weeks of fun.

It has very good multiplayer, which is important for me personally, as I am always looking for challenging boss-hunting games which I can play with my friends. Despite a couple minor hiccups multiplayer works fine. You can invite up to 2 friends to explore the game together.

I am not very good at shooters, however in this game I really enjoy the gunplay, there are a lot of weapons to choose from and my personal favourite is a gun that shoots THE RADIATION RAY. 

One important thing to know: the locations are generated randomly, so each of you runs will be unique and you will never meet all the bosses and find all the events in single run. You can export your character to your next run, kinda like in Diablo series.

The bosses are very fun, both in vanilla and DLC. I still didn't met them all, as far as my playthrough is, the most hard and at the same most fun was DLC Shaman boss, who summons the thunder, that chases you and oneshots you if you did not ran away! We died on him like 10 times, and when we finally beat him, that felt soooo good!

The visuals are also great, each biome was made with love, and that shows. You can find so much nice hidden details and lore which make this world alive and interesting.

its more itemization side.  can grind and change difficulty.  Found grind tiresome since new weapons don't come leveled up and in order to be potentially viable, you have to level it up.  Weapons have a max level.  I just cheated resources.

story is super basic.  Big bad evil, you lone hero save everyone.

overall.  Not as finely tuned, balanced, challenging as dark souls.  But has better multiplayer, rpg element if you like that.

Playing single-player is punishing (no getting back up after being downed, same number of enemies so you're frequently overwhelmed)
Playing with randos or friends with mismatched skill levels is frequently frustrating for someone.
Playing with people who are going to play without you is frustrating when they're suddenly more powerful the next time you play because they have 100 more trait levels than you do.
Playing with people who know the world-gen algorithms and what items spawn where is frustrating for people who want to experience it fresh.

EDIT:
After putting a lot more hours to this game recently I have to add to this review.

This game has great mechanics and cool bosses. Very souls - like in terms of difficulty.
It has a grindy upgrade system if you want to upgrade everything you unlock. It has a campaign re roll which basically lest you keep you items but restart the campaign so you can re explore the worlds and find new boss encounters. Has an adventure mode where you can go through specific maps to grind missing items and also has a survival mode which is more rouge like.

I have to say it is 100% worth the buy, solo or co-op with friends this game was a pleasure to play!",1603920743,1641606423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember getting this game for free on Epic at some time last year, but I never play it because of Epic's lame multiplayer system (plus I ain't got no friend on that platform). So I bought this game during the Winter Sale on Steam (Top 10 anime betrayal, XD). When I played it on singleplayer mode, I felt like I was playing a soul-like Borderlands: mobs are tough but not as troublesome as those Dark Souls monsters, map is big with many secret spots, and u can collect materials for upgrading and even rare gears. What's more, the modeling of characters are good, sometimes there are glitches but most of the time are a-okay. Remarkably, the weapons gained via purchasing or boss fights are flashy: Some are with special effects, some are just cool as heck, and when u buy the dlcs, there will be more fancy weapons or gears, :).

When you go for multiplayer mode, things are getting quite interesting. Three dudes can co-op in a good way, fighting off countless foes, or just get shit-faced and teabag each other. The most impressive fight I had with friends was the boss fight with the Ravager, a wolf-like colossal beast. In order to lure him out, players should ring the bells in order in front of his little cave, or you can just poke his cocky nose with your sword. At first, we didn't really know the order, so we kinda fussed and shit happened, someone accidentally hit the wolf's face, and we immediately entered the boss fight, unprepared and fked up. Anyway, the PvE mode is just pure fun. Besides, there are survival mode and adventure mode available for players, which are also pretty intriguing with some special quests. 

One thing I felt bad about is the story. No need for spoiler text here cuz all I remember is me being asked to save this save that, meeting a bunch of different people and going to many weird places, and the story just ended. I thought it would be more after the final boss fight but it didn't. So all I could recall were some tough boss fights and me roaming around a vast region with countless mobs. So, to me, it's quite hard to gather those fragmented info because I am a lazy guy who always skip reading texts. Also, in order to understand the story well, I need to play its prequel, which is just mediocre compared to this one.

Anyway, it is a pretty wholesome game, pretty much meet my needs during Christmas. If you are a big DS fan and wanna try something new, give this game a shot!",1641554516,1641554901,True,48,5,0.753147602081298828,0,True,False,False

Fun game with great boss fights and core mechanics, takes a lot of cues from Dark Souls and adds guns, but isn't a Dark Souls ripoff as some people have said.

Great trait-base character system let down by having so many of them that are completely pointless in the face of just taking the few that deal damage. Interesting weapon choices.

Even with 2 DLCs, it's lacking content. The campaign took 7.5 hours whilst going slow and searching all of the side bits. The ""endgame"" is ""run variants of the same thing over and over"" to farm loot, there's very little reason to run higher difficulties beyond your own satisfaction. The story is good but not well fleshed-out. Also it's one of those games that scales to your equipment level, so ""progress"" is mostly illusory which is kind of a shame.

Starting out the game was a positive expereince, and the game is well done in general.
The largest issue seems to be that the controls freeze or trigger unwanted actions such as doing melee attacks when you want to shoot for example.
Checking online that other players too have same issues. spending 3 hours for one fight (the first boss) because he calls exploding minions who one taps your life. It is just so frustrating. Typical small studio screw up and then not bothering to fix it.

then came combat... the control scheme is simply whack, and actions feel slow an unresponsive, with seemingly random amounts of delay on melee attacks when going from ranged

This is a great game.  It can feel weighty or heavy in the controls, but they actually handle quite tightly on both keyboard and controller.  World (and what a world it is!) / item / xp progress is never lost, ammo always restocks, so the only ""punishment"" for dying is that enemies reset... which, given how enjoyable the gameplay is and how much I gladly replay this game, isn't a punishment at all.  It just means more of the game.  It's tough at times, but even the toughest moments are satisfying.  If you can't overcome something alone, you can also bring in some co-op (though disconnects are common, it's been improved since launch).  Also has some of the most creative weapon design that I've seen since... maybe the old PS3 game Resistance: Fall of Man?  But here you can mix and match a lot of weapons with special abilities.  The DLC definitely round out the game.  It's got a lot of replayability even without but it can still feel on the shorter side.  To top it all, I'm really glad this game has a character creation option -- it's one of the things I like best in any (A)RPG.  Armor all looks cool with unique abilities too.  There's a lot of variety here to make the experience your own.  I would really hope for a sequel so that they can expand on what they've got here.

Pros:
- Gun play is super smooth.
-Camera controls are responsive, I rarely had issues with bad camera angles as I have in Souls titles.
- Visually Appealing with interesting environments. 

Cons:
- Very short; I beat the entire game in 15 hours and that was playing at a pretty relaxed pace at hard difficulty while solo. 
  At lower difficulties with friends I'd imagine it'd be even shorter. 
- The boss fights are honestly ruined by the waves of basic enemies that are found in virtually every boss fight. I found myself dreading boss-fights, not because of the challenge of the boss, but of the constant annoying basic enemies. 
- The story is basically non-existent and very generic. 
- Areas are just copy- and - pasted often times with a narrow variety of enemies. Often times enemies are just re-skins with similar attacks. 
- Scarcity of upgrade materials pidgeon-holed me into using only a handful of items. 
- The final boss is absolutely terrible. A nonsensical fight with a dumb gimmick and a total of like 4 attacks. Way more imagination went into earlier, non-consequential bosses than went into the design of the final boss. 
- The game just kind of ends out of nowhere with no build-up or hype, just a kind of ""here we are at the end"" vibe. 

Final Verdict:
This game has so much potential with some of the best third-person gun-play I've ever experienced. But boss fights are tedious, areas repetitive, the story is so unimportant, and the final boss is lazy and kills all excitement for a satisfying ending. If you're looking for a ""Souls-Like"" this isn't it; the gameplay and tone aren't similar at all, it just has boss fights behind fog walls that have big health bars on the screen and that's it.",1640743468,1640743468,False,32,3,0.641699016094207764,0,True,False,False

tl;dr: Should be a fine game if you have at least 1 partner to play with, but not very enjoyable as a solo experience.

The gunplay is actually pretty good, but everything else is mediocre. But there's just one massive flaw, at least when playing this game solo.

In my opinion the game does not have enough, if any, balance regarding player count and enemy spawn rate/count. Specifically during boss fights, where the game just shoves in hordes of enemies all around you alongside the boss, unnecessarily turning the game into a bullet dodge hell.

I get that due to the player's attack method requiring bullets, the extra enemies are one way to provide bullets to players, but it really felt like the player are always expected to face the boss with other players. And the game already provides a purchasable item to replenish the ammo at an affordable price, so I don't see much points for that many fodder enemies.

There's also some special enemies that can attack without having you on their line of sight, and if you are unlucky to aggro'd multiple of them (the enemy type and placement are re-rolled every restart), it's borderline impossible to dodge... unless there are other player that can be their target so the attacks are more spread around.

As much as I hate to admit it, at one point the only thing that kept me going even though I don't have any partner to play with (i.e. my internet sucks lol) is my stupid pride to beat a hard game. The last boss I faced was the [spoiler]Undying King[/spoiler], and at that point I was ready to swallow my pride. It didn't help that I had to repeat some dialogues even though I have to fight it no matter what (as opposed to the usual bosses where entering a fog-gate will trigger the fight). I wanted to lower the difficulty and admit I didn't git gud enough, but I have to restart my campaign progress (which excludes gears and characters progression, but no way I'm spending another 10 hours to get to where I was).

So in conclusion, this is a potentially fun party game, but I can't really recommend it if you intend to play it solo. I think it's still possible and I'm sure many have beaten it solo, but it was not an enjoyable experience at least for me.",1640681810,1640681810,False,94,14,0.651972353458404541,0,True,False,False

Beware, this game can get quite hard, specially the bosses. I like how each area and it's respective bosses were clearly different and they each had their particular weaknesses (as well as strengths, something to keep in mind). I never really used the boss weapons but it's pretty cool how you find/unlock new items during the adventure.

It's not an awful game, but I don't believe it's worth spending a lot of time on. I beat the campaign solo on normal difficulty in about 11 hours and don't have much incentive to pick it back up again.

What I liked:
[list]
    [*]Guns were mostly interesting and felt fun to use. Scoring headshots with a hunting rifle was challenging and enjoyable, at least for a little while.
    [*]Player movement is fluid and responsive and helps you feel mobile in fights.
    [*]The game has a decent sense of atmosphere in some locales.
[/list]
What I didn't like:
[list]
    [*]No meaningful or intelligent class system compared to contemporary games, and the loadouts aren't specific to any class as far as I can tell.
    [*]The game stutters at high frame rates with an RTX 3070/5800x, even while RivaTuner shows I'm keeping a steady 120 fps with loads of GPU and CPU headroom.
    [*]The loot game feels pretty weak. There aren't many guns or weapons to choose from and you'll probably end up finding a set of items you like and upgrading them to stay relevant.
    [*]The item economy is bizarre and doesn't feel fleshed out. You won't find many items you need for a given biome while playing through it; you need to stop blasting and go buy them from a vendor. 
    [*]Enemies lack interesting variation. Not much will surprise you here if you've played any other shooter/action title in the last decade.
    [*]Procedurally-generated maps feel winding, inorganic, and directionless.
    [*]Bosses are tuned to be fairly easy and are largely disappointing.
    [*]NPCs, cutscenes, voice acting, lore, and story are all completely ignorable.
    [*]There's just not much content here. You can re-roll the campaign to play it again while keeping your gear, but I don't see any reason to play it again. You're not going to have a significantly different experience the second time.

Game combat is much like Dark Souls but not as difficult to me because of the combination of melee weapons and GUNS !!!!!  The art style, atmosphere, and environments give off a Dark Siders 3 vibe.  There's no hip-hopping around like a jacka$$ in heat, or overbearing par-core, ridiculous sorcery or magic unicorn poop (although there are potions and amulet type items and endearments).

Expect light puzzle solving, smashing and looting (wood crates and chairs), get lost and confused as to your location and direction, DIE A LOT, and use colorful language only to start over and go back for more.

It really is a problem.  You are walking along, and all the sudden, monster just spawn around you and it only takes a couple hits to tear you down and then you gotta start all over and do it all again.  It starts out a fun shooter game and then turns into a boring constantly dying because you got surrounded by 8 monsters without any notice and they stun locked hit you to death.  If you get hit you stagger back and can't attack for a solid 1-3 seconds, enough time for something else to hit you. And then you dead. 

The game is much more fun in a party system where your buddies can get you up.  One person becomes the ""pull"" and the others sit back and wait for you.  If you go down, no worries, your buddies can get you.  Of course this is not possible by yourself. 

Other dumb quirks, you can't run while you use your healing.  The game makes you walk so if you got surprised attacked and you try and fall back while healing yourself...good luck. They will quickly catch up to you and kill you.  Melee fighting is fun but not really a good thing because you highly risk the crap movement system pushing you into the enemies blade and now you are at half health.  There are a lot of annoying little things with the game. Like your melee hits have a regular reach and the enemies hits have double what you have.  Plus many enemies have a fast move speed so its best to kill them before they get close.  But many maps suck because again, enemies will just randomly spawn in around you.  There is even an ability that lets you sense where the enemies are and it is useless most of the time because they randomly spawn around you. 

If you have friends you can play with on a regular basis, I recommend the game.  If you want to play solo, enjoy the really hard difficulty with no way to lower the difficulty.  I'm a father with a family, job, chores etc. I got a few hours a day to play pc games. I don't want to spend those three hours dying and starting over with no progress.

Remnant and Dark Souls are not as similar as some other souls-like games, but Remnant scratches that Dark Souls itch better than any Souls-like game that I‚Äôve played (this includes Sekiro, but not Bloodborne, considering I‚Äôve only played the latter for maybe an hour or two). 

After playing the Souls games for shameful numbers of hours, I was burnt out on them. I tried other Souls-like games, but none of them felt the same. Discovering Remnant was truly joyful; my desire for more Dark Souls was satiated. I originally felt like I was playing Dark Souls with guns. But I noticed a big difference after playing many hours of Remnant, then returning to Dark Souls.

Souls games feel lonely, creepy, and dark. Remnant feels more like an upbeat, action-packed adventure. Remnant is much faster paced. The Mods in Remnant work and feel very different from the spells and weapon art of the Souls games. There is no ‚Äúpuddle‚Äù to retrieve dropped currency. Items found are randomized. There are no consumable weapons to buy. There are not nearly as many different items, weapons, etc., but the variance in perks is much greater. And of course‚Ä¶there are guns.

The games have many similarities, though. Upgrading materials are found to make weapons stronger. The dodge-roll combat feels very similar. Stamina is treated the same. Dragon hearts and Bloodworts work like Estus Flasks and Life Gems. Worldstones work like bonfires. Armor and ring Loadouts, boss fights, status effects‚Ä¶I could go on.

I‚Äôm probably leaving out many differences and similarities, but I think you get the point. This game scratches that souls-like itch, but it‚Äôs definitely not Dark Souls. In my opinion, it is the best souls-like out there.

Remnant has three different game modes: Campaign, Adventure, and Survival. Campaign is just a regular game. Adventure is the re-rolling of specific areas of the game, often used in attempts to acquire desired gear, as the items acquired are random in all three game modes. Survival is completely random and there is no saving. Dying in Survival results in the end of the game; there are no do-overs. This is the game mode I primarily play.

This game has great replay value. The visual art, sound, and gameplay are top tier. This is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. It‚Äôs worth the full price. The DLC is not needed, but I highly recommend it. Do yourself a favor and at least check it out if you can play a demo, score a free copy of the base-game to try out, or get it on sale. But again; this game is worth every penny.",1597529055,1640012169,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The variety of weapons, enemies, environments, and bosses is fantastic.

The shooting is very crisp and responsive, melee is surprisingly decent, and you have a Dark Souls roll.

Good for a single playthrough or for grinding out drops and difficulties and side modes, solo or with friends.

Story is servicable if unremarkable. The background lore is more interesting than the driving plot but you won't be put off by either.

Wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fan of shooter/RPG hybrids or co-op games in general.

I noticed also some bugg and broken Boss and Non-Boss AI¬¥s i hope they gonna fix it in future.

Gameplay is good getting better with Traits
Character Costumisation lacks some stuff more Variations pls ( and make helmet hideable plspls)

- too much emphasis on the cooperative
- infrequent but annoying lags (enemies fall into textures, hitbox bugs, the mechanics of some bosses do not work correctly from time to time)
- map isn't very helpful
- monotonous level design with similar forced shortcuts everywhere
- sometimes there are too many enemies, and some of them are too thick (including bosses), which makes you feel too much repetitiveness and eventually get tired
Pros:
+ despite the banal plot, the game pleases with a non-trivial lore
+ creative approach in representation of other worlds masks imperfect graphics, provoking genuine interest in their exploration (despite above mentioned troubles with level design)
+ the shooter component of the game is implemented very well, there is no imbalance, when the weapon, even with a solid upgrade, is absolutely ineffective
+ there is no universal weapon/skill set, game constantly demands you to adjust to changing environment
+ some bosses have really interesting mechanics
+ curious puzzles
+ cool feature when you can pass bosses by parley or tricks
+ a lot of useful traits, acquired from quest and bosses alike

For those who like DS games this is probably worth a try. Difficulty aside it has all the core aspects of DS- dying a lot, repetition, figuring out the mobs moves and mastering a specific pattern which involves a lot of perfectly executed rolling/dodging to beat them.

For those who don't like DS, I have to say keep moving.
This game is in all aspects mentioned above basically the same. In Remnant you have a Souls-ish game in a new environment with new graphics, and guns, but the core gameplay and what is considered 'skill' is basically the same. And what do I mean by skill? Well I think it's fair to say that this game like most Souls games could aptly be described as a rolling/dodging simulator. If you don't like that kind of thing, you won't like this game. 

Take any shooter or RPG for comparison and you roll way way more in this, to the point where in battle rolling/dodging is pretty much constant. And not only that but the fact that this is one of the most cluttered landscapes I've ever seen in a game dramatically increases the difficulty of rolling/dodging without face-planting into a pillar, a water or electrical pipe, misc. furniture strewn all over the place, car doors, piles of rubble, etc.

If you are curious because you think this game has RPG elements, well it does and it doesn't. in a typical RPG, there is always the option to grind out a level or two doing easy quests or crafting, until you are comfortably challenged with the game. This is one of the best aspects of RPGs that I've always loved. Unfortunately however, in Remnant, the gear based auto scaling system makes sure that if you leveled up to beat the current zone that very soon when you finish this zone the game will just auto scale to one level higher than you just leveled your gear, keeping you constantly behind the curve. I found this design decision to be quite frustrating and disappointing as to achieve the same thing that you can do in any RPG, you will have to constantly grind through monotonous levels of repetition in literally every zone to get back just ahead of the curve if that's where your comfort zone lies.

In my opinion the auto scaling system completely and regularly undoing all the grinding work you did to get more powerful means that you simply cannot call this an RPG, as being able to grind to get more powerful is a core element of RPGs.

Another thing I found frustrating about the game is that it has IMO the most annoying 'adds' I've seen in any game ever. See a elite mob in the distance and start shooting at him, two seconds later half of your health is gone because a group of adds that just spawned literally right behind you and charged right into you. Another example which also happens all the time is you see a river of adds charging you and you get distracted throwing everything you've got at them and don't notice the elite who just spawned- you guessed it, right behind you- yes in the area you just cleared.

On top of all this adds have the annoying habit of putting you in stun lock, creating a situation where one mistake is often death. This is exacerbated by the fact that your primary heal the dragon heart is very very slow to utilize.

Add the above design decisions to the fact that many mobs are absolute bullet sponges, for example even adds or standard mobs can often not be killed with a headshot from the sniper rifle. And they charge you. Which brings us back the the design decision that there is no way out of near constant rolling/dodging during engagements. 

Classical shooter skills like finding and holding advantageous positions and going for headshots is mostly irrelevant here as mobs will always spawn right behind you in the area that you just cleared, or come in groups charging toward you in all their bullet spongey glory pushing through even the best FPS skill sets, again, forcing the rolling/dodging which is I'd have to say the primary battle gameplay element. So much of the time you will seek out the most open space possible so you have the most room to do all the mandatory rolling/dodging stuff.

Therefore IMO you can't call this a 'shooter' game either. As no shooter game I've ever seen will make it more advantageous to stand out in the wide open so you can do all the mandatory rolly/dodgy stuff, instead of taking cover.

So Remnant: From the Ashes isn't and RPG and it isn't a shooter game. It's a souls game. And fair enough, it says 'Souls-Like' right up in the tags. But it also says RPG which again I would beg to differ due to your grinding/leveling up being constantly undone by the auto scaling. Furthermore many will see the guns and think it somehow spans the gap to shooter games which it doesn't.

In Summary: 
Dark Souls fans will probably like it and enjoy using their skills in a new environment with cool graphics and unique story. 

Personally I found the amount of dying and repetition to be far more frustrating and boring than fun. I found the mobs constantly spawning behind me in areas I just cleared to be a constant source of annoyance and frustration. I found the stun locking adds especially to be a constant annoyance. And I found the fact that adds are a far bigger threat in boss battles than the boss itself, to be imbalanced and annoying.  I found the constant need for nearly perfectly executed dodging/rolling to be excessive and annoying. I found that not being able to effectively use classic shooter tactics and instead stand out in the open with a gun to be disappointing. And I found the lack of ability to grind and level up your character to suit your preference of gameplay challenge, without all your efforts being just auto scaled away, to be quite disappointing.

In short for me, as a fan of many RPGs including action RPGs, and shooters of all kinds, I found Remnant: From the Ashes to be more boredom and frustration than fun and ultimately a disappointment. I was hoping for a game that bridged the gap between Souls-like and shooter, with RPG elements, and this isn't it. Essentially it's just a Souls game in different clothes.

To list a few that may affect anyone's experience:
-- Melee swings go through walls with both AI and yourself, leading AI to track you through walls if they are in range to begin a melee combo, regardless of the line of sight.
-- The AI rubberbands towards whoever has damaged them the most, and has so far proven very predictable.
-- Boss difficulty has so far stemmed from adds. The first boss character I faced was a recycled elite unit with spikes sticking out and no special moves that I could discern. It was effectively the same enemy with more aggro, health and adds. After three fog-doors i'm beginning to see a pattern.
-- Adds will spawn within a meter of a player without warning, sometimes in plain sight. *Plop!*
-- Unintended behaviour where summoned enemy positions may not be reset when resting at the bonfire equivalent checkpoint, which means enemies can attack you while you're still locked in a sitting animation without controls.
-- The AI retains aggro indefinitely if triggered, but will simultaneously ignore adjacent fellow enemies getting sniped in front of them. [i] Stelth [/i]
-- Ballistics cannot penetrate glass windows. If you see an enemy behind glass, your shot will break the window but not hit the enemy. You yourself can jump through a window into an enemy, but your bullets cannot.
-- Levels randomly generating looks cool on paper, but the assets they are built with appear so frequently looting through the same buildings quickly becomes repetitive. I'm hoping this'll improve playing further...

Personal peeves are a separate list. Maybe you can get an idea for what to expect. I'm going to keep suffering through because I want to witness all the good work within, but I wouldn't recommend buying above 20$‚Ç¨

There are some beautiful little details such as weapon abilities modifying your guns appearance, or speaking with NPC:s to unlock a quest you might've not otherwise gotten, equipping armor to get special voice-lines...

However, the game shines most brilliantly in Adventure Mode, and while paying for what I feel should have been a free update - Swamps of Corsus in Adventure Mode - is unfortunate, the price is well worth it, if you have the spending cash to burn. 

Grinding Adventure Mode will allow you to roll through a specific planet as many times as you want, to grind for resources, items, and loot. Personally, this is where I spend most of my time in the game. 

Survival was an amazing add, as well. It's fast-paced, and challenging, but I did wish they fleshed out the game mode a little bit, and offered some sort of progression rewards. In fact, Survival Mode could be a game in and of itself, if there was more long-term progression in the mode.

Okay, just because a game has checkpoints(fast travel), healing and rollling does not a Dark Souls game make.

I understand that it is a massive oversimplification of what the gameplay elements are and sometimes I can understand it being used for some games, but specifically here the nuance is lost because what DS offers is more than that, and I'm fairly confident that DS players are more there for the amazing well crafted world, the handholding free adventure, the variety and depth of all equipment, the polished nature of moment to moment combat and gameplay and most of all is the community. The game is clearly inspired by DS to a degree, and includes a few references, the one especially at the end is more or less a frame perfect version of one of the most famous DS emotes.

If you're here for the aforementioned DS like traits I've listed, then this probably isn't the game for you. However, before you simply give up on the game and move on, what you'll find is it presents a completely different experience. So what is this game then? It's a: [b]Rougelite(lite as you lose basically nothing when you die), Coop, Shooter[/b]. That rougelitelite (rll) is something to specifically note though, as that affects the overall polish of the game and restricts some things of the game as a whole.

It's good at:

[list]
[*] Being a rougelitelite, it's very good for replayability. Runs are can be distinct and unique, and everytime you play again you keep your character for future runs.

[*] It's a decent as a coop game, which is vastly different from it's decent as a game, there's a bit of a distinction there. There are relatively few decent games that are also coop, at least as of the past year or so.

[*] It gives you a decent variety of equipment with varying effects, mostly armor set bonuses that are decently strong, and a pretty decent variety of weapons that when found, scale to your current gear level, allowing you to actually swap gear occasionally (since the upgrade level of the gear you find is the same as the gear you currently have. Very nice, and a decent way to switch things up just in case you got bored of a particular weapon.

[*] Most enemies are varied enough, with different mechanics and weakpoints for each one. It occasionally falls flat because some enemies are way more cannon foddery and act more or less like distractions rather then feel like a threat. So this is neutral, but ill push it over to the positive side for good measure.

[*] [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/FaithfulGrossPistachioPoooound-bTSpSG0O0077Qhkz] Hitting weakpoints and big red crit numbers make me feel goooooooood [/url]
[/list]

What's bad about the game? Well lots if you're holding it up to the standard that is DS, but on it's own so far, we can list

[list]
[*] [b] The incredibly annoying control scheme, since 'attacking' without aiming is melee, meaning this game seems more like a film student finally discovering that a camera can zoom. Every single shot you need to take you need to aim down your sights. (This affects so much more of the game than you realize, especially since it literally forces you to tunnel vision just to attack) [/b]

[*] Attacks from bosses feel weirdly disjointed. Seeing as bosses now need the capability to be ranged. You'll understand the feeling if you ever play it.

[*] Fuck the moth. If you know then you really know.

[*] Most boss fights are more or less 3 attacks + a million trash mobs in the arena. Instead of having a boss fight where the emphasis is on the boss itself, the emphasis is placed on 'how fast can you clear the enemies before they overwhelm you'. Which is annoying, but also restricts some play styles (especially if solo)

[*] Quite a lot of the areas are so filled with cover to the point where it's more ""Ugh there's so much running around to shoot enemies"" vs ""Oh nice there's cover here."" Partially also because your run speed is basically someone's grandma's idea of hurrying up, it's as if the run is only minorly faster compared to that of the regular walk. This apparently eventually can be fixed 80% of the game in by putting things into perks - but that feels like a bandaid rather than a conscious choice.

[*] Rolling feels very clunky and heavy, (I would have expected this to be more polished considering it is one of the few ways you can avoid damage in the game)

[*] Coop play, especially near bosses means you can basically never revive an ally, and in some cases makes it so you can barely heal. So y'know, sit and wait for your friend to take it up the arse, or make some popcorn and start watching the movie. I've found out that there's basically a 'trait' for this now, which is partially a viable option, but feels more like a bandaid than anything.

[*] While there are a few secrets here and there, most often the entire area is basically large corridors with enemies spawning randomly throughout the area. So there is variety, just not in the overarching nature of it (but this is more a critique of rougelikes more than the game itself)

[*] Rot infection as a mechanic as a whole (coughing which interrupts EVERYTHING including reloads, rolls, revives etc etc.) It's as if you suddenly came down with an allergy to living. And if someone says just to buy more oilskins then it really turns the game into a drinking contest. Spoilers but despite what the comment says below, is not just on earth (first chapter)

[*] [b] The people who complain about the difficulty are somewhat in the wrong, assuming they pick any difficulty higher than hard. If that is your first time, then you're going to get fucked over, as those levels are more akin to the NG+ that DS has, that usually necessitate a higher level, so lower the difficulty if you have a hard time approaching it first :) [/b]
[/list]

I would have honestly chosen a more neutral option with a 'neither recommend nor otherwise' stance, but I'd err more on the side of caution, and not recommend this game. Partially due to the issues I have with it, but also knowing that the average DS player would probably not enjoy it fully.

I don't know even know which damage type is good against what.

On its nose, the pacing is a little bit heavy and plodding in order to be, I dunno, Souls-esque, and that's totally fine, it works. For what the gameplay tries to be, it handles it neatly, and while it's probably a fundamental make-or-break point for why you'd want to play it, Remnant sticks to its character here. Finding new rings and armor (armor sets each have their own set bonuses) is a treat each time, since you have a lot of variety to cater towards your own strengths or creatively utilize bonuses in tandem. Multiplayer just sort of works if you've got a friend or a public lobby- jump in and go, and that's fun. Enemies are all novel and uniquely challenging, there's a lot of great design concepts that went into the mooks you'll churn through. Bosses veer from neat to infuriating depending on your approach or gear- you WILL be challenged to reconsider your approach.

Pacing is just... All over the place, though. You can find a few guns and armor pieces if you poke around at the start, making you think perhaps there's other secret areas like this throughout the rest of the game. There aren't. If you're not so lucky, you won't even get another gun besides the starter ones (or ones you can buy from the other starting classes) until you leave Earth. You'll think you can just go 'find' some more guns out there, but largely, you don't. You'll decide you don't really want to talk to that wrinkly weird old guy, but it turns out exhausting his dialogue is how you get another trinket or the ability to buy another armor set, because the game doesn't tell you anything. Bosses have secret methods to get their macguffins or weapons and you'll never catch on unless you've got a guide or wiki open on your flank. Player expectations are not managed AT ALL. I'm no stranger to the genre, and hell, I've been playing games for decades, but any and all those little indications that 'this is how the game works' or 'this is the effort/reward loop' or 'you probably want to go this way' are all missing. It's not at all intuitive.

The game's rough edges have rough edges, is really as best I can summarize it. It does what it sets out to do just well enough that it might be palatable on sale, if a little sour. I did glean some enjoyment out of it but really, I wouldn't recommend it at all.",1638749594,1638749594,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is fun and challenging if you want, the atmosphere and the environment feel superb, the story is kinda meh, but the lore is interesting if you want to look for it. Bossfights were pretty good, but to me there were too much minions around to really appreciate the boss designs, i think there was just a single bossfight that had no fodder, so it's quite different from most souls like games.

There were some questionable design choices, but nothing you can't deal with. 
One of the most annoying was the endless looting, i wouldn't be surprised if 1/4 of the game time was spent breaking pots/boxes/barrels for scrap to upgrade gear.

The other is, i don't know how to call it, content delivery maybe? Basically the campaign is randomly generated with most key points staying the same, so even after full playtrough i don't thing i've seen half or maybe even a third of the content out there, because it just wasn't there. I get that this encourages to go for multiple playtroughs, but the environments/dungeons aren't that varied, and can get boring even in single playtrough, not to mention multiple.

the game is not overly difficult outside of a few specific boss battles , the challenge is very well balanced and you can always crank the difficulty up if you find it too easy also.

checkpoints are common and you always have one right before a boss battle so even if you die you rarely have much to redo and you also don't lose currency when you die.

Remnant from the ashes don't feature a lot's of guns but with every single of the weapons you will get your hands on feel like it's have it's own specific unique design. weapons come in two category , you have the regular weapons you can buy , upgrade , equip with special effects and you have boss weapons which come with their own set of inbuilt effects like a sniper that can ressurect you on death or a crossbow that can make enemies bleed with it secondary attack.

armors and relics also play an Importants part of you gameplay strategy , some relic give damages bonus , health regen and other bonus that might feel small at first but that can eventually turn the tides of a boss battle in certain circumstences.

The game offer you both a main campaign and adventure mode. there is a boss rush/survival mode but I haven't really played much of it.

Even if you've played it a while and think you've got it under wraps, the game provides plenty of opportunities to turn you upside down and onto your head. I'm going to give this one a solid 10/10; even after having completed the main game, gotten all the armor/items/weapons/etc. and a majority of the emotes, I still find myself coming back to this game over and over. Better yet, DLC finally dropped for one of the most fascinating areas in the game, with the promise of more content coming out in the future. I know I'm down to clown, and so is most of the community who's been here, so come see what we're all gushing about.

The character customization is basic but ultimately doesn't matter, since most of the armor sets are meant to protect the human body and tend to cover it completely. Your voice can be a little misleading since there's essentially two or three lines they speak when you're swapping between them, but again, that's unimportant since the main focus in this game should never be on how you look underneath all of that clothing and armor. I can think of maybe 5 armor sets where you might see a majority of your own face, and most of them I wouldn't presume would get actual use unless you would live and die by its equipment bonus.

Weapons feel fantastic, be it melee or ranged, and finding ones that you enjoy using is both satisfying in the fact that weapons feel like they have impact and that they're usually pretty badass; everything has a different hit sound, kick on weapons is real without being obnoxious, and the timing on (most) weapons feels fair. Weapons obtained from killing bosses or overcoming challenges meet these expectations and more; [spoiler] IE, there is a boss called The Ent that has a chance of spawning on Earth, and it drops the highest damaging shotgun with a modification for a grenade launcher that leaves a field of rotting fumes to damage enemies. It glows from within, looks like it's twisted and infested with the Root, and feels VERY nice to hit enemies with.	[/spoiler]

There is a perk system in the form of ""Traits"" that determine certain stats for your character. These can range from simple health and stamina to how easy it is for an enemy to spot you when running, crouching, etc. And that's not even the tip of the iceberg; you can easily pick up extra traits by performing simple tasks. Collect enough guns, you get a trait for handling your guns more effectively. Join a game with another person, you automatically get the Teamwork trait, increasing defenses when you stick together. Walk far enough, you get a trait that decreases how much stamina you use when running and dodging. The list goes on and on, and there's already guides out there explaining this in further detail, so that's that.

Equipment is another important aspect of the game. Much like other ""Souls-like"" games, you have to take into consideration the weight of your armor and what articles of decoration you'd like to wear. Heavier armor will make you roll slower and move a very little bit slower, but you can tank through certain hits without getting stun locked and, of course, will take less damage overall. Lighter equipment makes your rolls faster, but don't diminish your invulnerability period, making it quicker for you to retaliate with either melee or ranged fire. Your one necklace and two rings act as utility buffs of a sort. There are some that make you tougher, some make you stronger. Others make you quick, and most of them provide strange buffs. [spoiler] The very best ring to find early on is the Sagestone Ring, which grants a 15% boost to all exp earned. It's incredibly useful, and I haven't personally felt the need to take it off and replace it with something else yet; it allows you to obtain traits at an accelerated rate, making it more useful than any single ring in the long run. [/spoiler]

The only downside I see to the game is the randomizer, and even then it's a fleeting issue. See, once you start a game, the world you're in is randomized and laid out for you to explore. If you and a friend sat down and played this side by side, chances are that you'd quickly notice that your words look and play VERY differently. Be it the structure of an area, where enemies spawn, what dungeons exist, and even what bosses show up to fight you, the experience will almost always be different every time. I played alongside one of my amigos here on Steam, and I think we shared exactly 3 bosses between the 2 of us through the entire game; you're forced to fight at least 12 if I'm remembering correctly, and there are over 20 different available bosses for you to end up fighting. There are even events and npcs that will be randomized out in the main world, meaning while you might have found Mudtooth's little shop on the inside of a crashed plane, your friend might have found nothing, or an entirely different encounter altogether. When the game first came out, if you didn't get a boss you wanted you either had to reset your game or play through the rest of the campaign to get the one you wanted; however, they've added in another mode called adventure mode which lets you play on any map you've completed at least once with a different shot at bosses, and by extension another shot at their unique weapons. Perfect addition, but lets move on.

I realize that if you haven't played this yet, you might be blanching at my mention of ""resetting"", so I'll explain a bit more. See, once you've beaten the final boss, there's not much left to do in your world. However, at any given time throughout a playthrough, you can go to a checkpoint and choose to ""Reset World"". It'll ask you if you really want to, and if you choose yes it asks what difficulty you'd like, ranging from Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. It'll then generate a new world for you. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT RESET YOUR CHARACTER. You will keep everything you earned, all of your traits, all of your equipment, and everything will keep it's upgrade levels. It exclusively resets just the world, providing a new layout and opportunities to fight different bosses.

But that's basically everything you might need to know about Remnant. It's a pretty forgiving ""Souls-like"" game, which is a nice change, but it still retains its own identity and individuality in its design and how it plays. I'd personally give it a stellar recommendation, and highly suggest picking it up. Even if you aren't too sure about it, it's worth a shot. The main story can be completed within 24 hours, but that's just the first difficulty level and you'd be missing out on a majority of the bosses. There's plenty to do if that's what you fear, so once again, give it a go and see if you like it because this leap of faith pays in dividends.

The date is November 30th and I still come back to this game when I need to chill or just want to have a bit of familiar fun. Its like that favorite relative that you make a beeline for at family gatherings; you don't see them that often but when you DO, you have a great time.",1566400543,1638338411,True,2,1,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

But you probably know it as the Souls-like title with an emphasis on shooter elements rather than the melee combat. 

TL;DR ‚Äì Robust combat and mechanics meets a beautiful post-apocalyptic world to make possibly the best shooter-style Souls-like title to date.

Story (3/5): Just like the Dark Souls series in which Remnant draws much of its inspiration from, a large proportion of the story telling comes from interaction with the world around you. Whether this be getting morsels of lore from the flavour text on items or the sparse dialogue with the world‚Äôs NPCs. Little is known about what remains of Earth after it is ravaged by the mysterious Root and it is up to you to find out. Where Remnant differs, is in the inclusion of dialogue options to help flesh out the story. While the initial premise of the world seemed promising, the writing itself is rather flimsy. In fact, the true conclusion of the story only comes upon completion of the Subject 2923 DLC campaign. 

Gameplay (4/5): Remnant‚Äôs combat is broken down into ranged and melee with an emphasis on the former. Players have the option of two ranged weapons, a primary and sidearm. With a large variety of weapons and armours to choose from, players can really tailor their equipment to best fit their playstyle. Consumables too aren‚Äôt an afterthought, playing an important role in your continued survival. In place of a stats system, Remnants has a Traits system which provide percentage-based improvements in damage and survivability. All these systems gel together harmoniously to make one really, really fun experience. The cherry on top, that‚Äôs the 3-player online co-op system which works flawlessly. 

Controls (4/5): Tight and responsive are the words which best described Remant‚Äôs controls. My entire 32 hours playthrough of Remnant was done with a keyboard and mouse. Default key bindings are perfectly serviceable and mouse sensitivity customization allows for truly granular levels of control. Spend some time to really dial your settings in and you‚Äôll be nailing those headshots in no time.

Graphics (5/5): Made using Unreal Engine 4, Remnant is far from the most photo realistic nor graphically demanding title of 2019 but, boy does it look fantastic! Individually, the texture, lighting and shadow work are nothing to write home about. But they are certainly more than the sum of their parts as Gunfire games has done an amazing job of setting the atmosphere for each world that you encounter. Whether its heavy fog or a passing sandstorm, Remnant undoubtedly scores full marks in the immersion department.
Bonus Note: Remnant also ticks all the right boxes for high resolution and high refresh rate gameplay. Playing the game on 4K120 is truly a treat!

Audio (4/5): An unintrusive background score for the most part with distinct audio ques and great positional audio. Remnant is a title best played with a pair of headphones/headset for that added level of immersion. 
Issues/Optimization: Strong net code with good multiplayer connectivity. I played the entirety of the campaign on co-op without coming across any noteworthy issues. The game is also well optimized and not too demanding on most modern PC gaming systems, 1080p60 is perfectly achievable with an Nvidia GTX 1060.

Overall (4/5): Remnant: From the Ashes may be a Souls-like title in the way that it draws many of its core ideas from the Souls series especially the tough bosses. At the same time, it is wholly unique with its take on combat mechanics, gameplay and level progression. Moreover, the game even has various level difficulty to choose from. As a whole, Remant is an excellent title and, in my opinion, probably the best gateway title into the world of Souls-like titles. Highly recommended!

Every relevant to the features game should be doing this. I also really like the grimy as hell tone combined with weird sci fi, doing a different twist on post-apocalyptic games. You can also flip from playing online to solo with a simple switch, without having to do any dumb Fromsoft Quit To Main Menu shit. I also like the way the controls feel overall, everything feels responsive and does what I expect, except that I keep accidentally chugging items because of muscle memory from another game.

Anyway for a game that was the weakest reviewed thing I picked up in this fall sale I think it's pretty damn fun. I get that the combo of things this game tries to do isn't going to be for everyone but I'm finding it a winner so far.",1637999918,1637999955,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]
Some time in the misty past, long, long ago, one game developer turned to another and said, ""How about we make Dark Souls, but with [b]guns[/b]!"" 

The other developer looked excited and said, ""That's a great idea! Should we iterate on the stellar level design principles of Dark Souls in any way, or even copy them whole-turkey so that our game benefits from copied-but-still-excellent design?""

""No,"" said the first developer. ""Just make all levels large hallways with mobs dropped randomly within them.""

""Okay,"" the second developer said, nodding. ""Should the gunplay of our game be dynamic, with the ebb and flow of combat that's been established in countless Soulslike games? You know, the careful gauging of an enemy's attacks and responding to them?""

""No,"" said the first developer again. ""You should just empty all your bullets into targets and move on. Oh, and make the window for dodging an enemy attack incredibly forgiving. Invulnerability frames for days!""

""Got it, boss. Now, what about the guns themselves? Should there be a wide variety, each with a distinct 'personality,' that the player can swap between?""

""Are you kidding?"" the first developer asked, sneering. ""You know the Halo rules: no more than two guns at a time. One pistol, one rifle. And they should all basically fire the same, with little recoil or drop-off. Make sure the only difference between weapons is fire rate and effective range. The core gameplay may be shooting a gun, but no one ever said that your core gameplay had to be [i]fun[/i].""

""Okay, I think that's everything,"" said the second developer. ""Oh wait, I almost forgot! Bosses. Bosses are arguably the most important part of a Soulslike game. Classically, they're difficult fights that require the player to adapt their play and weapons to a boss's rhythm and weaknesses. What should ours be like?""

The first developer was quiet for a long time, thinking. Finally, they said, ""Add control.""

""Add...what?"" asked the second developer, stunned.

""Our bosses should be about add control. You know, little trash mobs that attack the player. All the difficulty from the boss fight should lie in killing meaningless cannon fodder. If the player can do that, then they get to shoot the boss a few times. Then right back to add control.""

""Wow,"" said the second developer. ""That's...brilliant! The players will love killing garbage and rolling away from boss attacks for several minutes at a time."" The first developer nodded sagely. ""One last thing before we spend several years making this game: any notes on player equipment or consumables?""

""Hmm,"" the first developer said, stroking their chin. ""Make sure armor has a virtually unnoticeable effect on the game, being basically interchangeable without impact. Oh, and make sure that the player never has to manage their ammunition in any way by making an 'Ammo Refill' item that's both inexpensive and infinitely available.""

""Incredible. Just incredible,"" said the second developer, bowing and scraping as they left the room. ""We'll get right on it!""

One other aspect that sets it apart from other souls-likes is that you can set the difficulty for yourself, which is great for people who are just getting into this sort of thing.

Pros:
+ Combat with gun feels solid and satisfying
+ Diverse variety of weapons
+ Random generated world means you can encounter different bosses in each playthrough

Cons:
- Randomly generated means nothing really stand out and interesting in the level design and worldview
- Boss fights don't feel unique since most of them just spawn a lot of weak enemies while occasionally attack us
- Character and weapon progression are not that interesting, mostly stats based
- Kinda short, only around 12-14 hours. but it still have replayability due to random bosses and dungeons. I believe you'll discover all the contents after 3rd playthrough which i think will be around 30 hours

-Easy to get into after initial learning curve
-Plenty of replay value due to RNG worlds
-Pretty non-toxic playerbase
-Plenty of different weapons, armors, charms, and rings to choose from for builds
-Incredibly nice world/enemy design

Cons
-Too much potential grinding due to RNG for materials and equipment
-Pretty basic character creation
-Looping/playing in general can get stale without friends or being on public
-Labeling for hard mode and beyond are a little misleading, you need to be much more experienced than it lets on
-Grinding for xp for traits is extremely slow and tedious

Overall, Remnant is a Souls-like for people that favor good fun over straight challenge and tends to be slightly more fair than others of the genre

Firstly in general it is WAY too easy. Like each area having a max variety of 5 enemies that most can be one-shotted easy. This is incredibly frustrating when it comes to the bosses, which are also very easy, but have horrible game design that makes them a frustrating mess.
It's a 50/50 toss up whether a boss is going to be so easy that you literally don't lose any health during your first try beating them, or they will have a gimmick that leaves you thinking ""what just happened"". They are all full of minion enemies which would be fine since you use ranged weapons mainly, but when this is combined with some bosses throwing 4 different attack types that have different cues, it doesn't make sense to have annoying minions chipping your health away and diverting your limited camera attention when you're 1 second from being one-bombed by an attack you can't see.

As for consistent issues, the main thing you will fight is the camera. Some bosses have attacks that are telegraphed on the ground, some bosses have attacks that are telegraphed above the player. This is fine in a game like Dark Souls where you don't need to have the camera zoomed in on the centre of your screen and have peripheral vision. But I'm sure you can see how this is an issue in a game that entirely focuses around you zooming in and shooting directly at the boss, or at minions. Another huge consistent issue is that since it is a 3rd person shooting game, some genius developer thought that they should keep it so that you can only sprint forward. So if you want to run away from a boss that can kill you in one hit you have to completely guess whether you're being attacked, they're charging an attack, minions are all over you since you can't turn your camera around until you've stopped and are vulnerable. Again, it works in Dark Souls because you can sprint in any direction regardless of the camera angle.

Also for some reason almost EVERYTHING in this game is faster than the player. Some boss attacks are straight up undodgeable, combining this with the fact that you're essentially blind when sprint away from danger, it just makes the game feel cheap.

At first glance pretty much every boss is very easy. They all have quite low health, normal attacks aren't too punishing and you just have to shoot them. But then one of the developers played too much Dark Souls instead of learning about game design and decided to fill the bosses with cheap instakills, bad camera angles and arenas full of minions. It's very disheartening to go from never being hit by a boss, to the next one spamming you while youre on the ground because you can't see the glowing telegraph that is not only out of your cameras view, but the same colour as the ground.

Like Sekiro, I enjoyed most of non boss areas, but the boss design is so cheap and broken that I don't believe the game is worth anymore of my time.
Going from being one of the my favourite games of the year that I bought it to me detesting it due to things that should have been picked up in first round testing is very disappointing.

The story is kinda empty and soulless too.

Edit - After reading some other reviews I've have found that some of the devs are pathetic, power hungry people that ban customers that have negative views on this game. Which makes a lot of sense considering the lack of polish and issues a blind man could see quite frankly.",1637191690,1637192370,False,1,0,0.483626455068588257,0,True,False,False

Play through it on hard mode, Skip nightmare difficulty. It just takes other game's unreasonable nightmare modes and adds 1-hit kills from most enemies. That's even with all of my skills upgraded. Using more heavy armor might let me take another hit or two, but at the heavy cost of range dmg. It's just another mess of a nightmare mode like most games have on that difficulty.

Basically Dark Souls 3 (hardest game ever) with guns, but somewhat easier because of said guns. Probably my favorite game of 2019. You get a melee weapon too but the main focus is on ranged damage. The game looks good with some really great environments and artwork, particularly environment detail and also enemy detail. Enemies are frightening and dangerous, especially if you have a pair of balls and are playing on hard like I am doing for my first playthrough. Bosses are intimidating too on hard and are no joke so be geared up and ready for some pain, just like your mother.

Here it is both:

[b]-Toggle Sprint Key[/b]
This is probably the only game that uses a toggle key for sprinting. Yes you are reading correctly. Not holding down the shift key makes your character sprint (like in any other game), but pushing it once. Some actions like aiming or standing still, interrupt the toggle which means there is no chance to get used to this unintuitive system EVER. Several thread exists with pleads by players to change this, but nothing was done for 2 years (and probably never will).

[b]-Enemies can hit the player through walls and the ground [/b]
Long range melee (staff, spear ect.) enemies that are getting aggroed but can't reach the player, can still hit them through walls and the ground floor below them.  Very annoying if you get hit by these enemies but need to run though half the map to get to a stairway in order to kill them.

[b]-undodgable attacks [/b]
Players in souls-like games have invulerability frames during dodge animation. Do a perfect dodge roll to avoid an attack completely. Makes sense. I was having problems dodging specific attacks and after hours of trying to get the timing correct, I was getting suspicious. After checking this issue online it confirmed my suspicion. Some attacks can't be dodged even with frame perfect timing. Makes no sense at all.

[b]-Enemies are unpredictable by cancelling their animations [/b]
Some enemies and in particular, some bosses seem sometimes skip a boss stage after they are getting damaged and glitch into a new attack. Hard to explain but imagine a player attacking a boss below 75% HP, the boss getting into a different stage, but sometimes ignoring it and just turning back around and continue attacking.

Darksouls with guns, Get it.

Long Version:

Overall Impression:
Solid game with satisfying gunplay, gripping progression and a few great challenges. You do need to enjoy the game for what it is though, a boss gauntlet.

Combat:
Fluid, responsive and satisfying.

Story:
Shoot the Tree people

Progression:
Permanent cross-campaign progression that keeps you going. It's simple, but fun.

Difficulty:
Don't play on normal. Hard is an adequate difficulty when starting out that still presents a challenge without overwhelming you. There are two more difficulties higher than hard if you want a greater challenge. The difficulty curve is quite flat, meaning consistent. Does drop on a few bosses though. There exists a permadeath hardcore mode if you and your mates to enjoy in a weekend zero-death run.

Bosses:
Most of them are great. A few of them though are too easy when compared to the rest.

Co-Op:
Great fun. This is a Pick-up-and-play game that you can pick up with your mates at any time. I'm playing three campaigns with different friends. Your character's progression and gear is independent of the campaigns which combined with the randomised elements means it's completely worth playing multiple campaigns with multiple friends.

Replay-ability:
Game continues to be enjoyable through multiple playthroughs. Some items, bosses, and dungeon layouts varies campaign to campaign so to unlock everything you'll need to play through multiple times.

Loot:
Plenty of accessories. Could do with more weapons and armour. Still enough to keep you going through multiple playthroughs. What is there are all great though.

I have actually, just alt-tabbed from the game to leave a short review about something the game was criticised for in numerous reviews.

The old mechanics the game has - I have just wasted a few hours on one: 
- a ""boss fight"", when there is a helpless ally, whom you should protect for a duration from waves of enemies
- enemies can also spawn close to the ally or reach him in a split second. more so, the aggro logic is broken and at times the enemy may fight you if it spawned close to you and sometimes, it ignores you and runs past you
- even more so - once locked onto the ally, it is not possible to reliably get aggro back, so you simply lose the boss fight anyway, because the game decided so
- FUN (no)

I expect the game to test my skills and reaction, not the tolerance for the mechanics, that exist solely to frustrate.

P.S.: on comparison with DS - so far, the only simillarities are the lethality of combat and enemy respawn upon rest/death. the combat, though, so far, is way simpler, as the mobs, both common and elite ones, are SLOW, lack attack variety, do not really stun-lock or tend to corner you.",1635721291,1635721291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is that a Bug? On one the of the worlds, the dusty one, there is only one Dungeon Layout, that i have to pass multiple time to get to the next area. Enemy Placements are new and the loot is kind of different, but come on, one freaking dungeon Layout?!? 

That's so lazy. I know what they went for with the randomized Levels, and hey, i'm totally on board with that, but please reandomize it and don't gimme just one, one!

To be fair, on earth were 2 Dungeon Layouts. 

And to be clear, the Lore isn't as uninteresting as some reviews incline, the atmosphere is thick and the Gameplay is tight and satisfying. I'm just so utterly frustrated of the immersion breaking World layout. You get to the dusty World, instantly get Stargate vibes, get hyped as f*** and then the Layout reminds you contantly that this is no handcrafted world. It's so distracting and undermines the other work they did to flesh out the word, like Notes, Books, Dialogues and invironmental Storytelling in the Basement of Ward 13.

The Gameplay is totally fine, if you like to enjoy this Lootershooter (which is meant to be played with friends, i get that) as a singleplayer experience, but if like to immerse yourself in a World, be prepared to see some lazy distracting stuff.

And boy do I love me some jank ass Dark Souls 2.

Remnant is a slower paced souls-like with guns being a huge selling point, and for what it is the developers nailed it for me to fall in love with.
Absolutely delighted by how the character progression is done, in Dark Souls you have to choose what kind of weapon you roll early, you might roll a high strength character, later to find a great dexterity weapon in your initial playthrough.

But in Remnant you get to choose from 3 setups that you can pretty much mix up right after.
I started with ""Ex-Cultist"" who is ""Medium ranged"" and you get a AoE healing ability to start off with.
But later I purchased the ability of the tank class with its armor set and found a sniper rifle later into the game which falls into the light armor playstyle, so in the end I am 1/3rd of each of the starting ""class"" setups.

The game does have some copypasta in the level and enemy design, but the unique areas are so well hand crafted that the set play is very enjoyable, and it's also in my favorite setting post-apocalyptic rust and dust.

What seemed like an average adventure for 10-15 hours, eventually turnt into a place, where you want to stay for hundreds of hours. I can state that Remnant is old-fashioned in a good way. Like old movies from late 60th - early 70th. Today you may notice some evident flaws there, but they are still charming. Same here. While there are indeed some outdated gameplay mecanics or conventionalities - the game nevertheless has it's unique style and atmosphere, as well as some great gameplay features.

The first aspect that worth mentioning is an art style of monsters and locations. Definitely not something you can see everyday. How about Earth, infested with roots and overwhelmed by tree-like monsters, mutants and cultists? Or the world of eternal winter, inhabited by giant ratmen, armed with firearms? Or maybe a post-nuclear world, inhabited by mutated barbaric tribes, who use sorcery, explosives and nuclear weapons? 

Setting - great and unique as well. Not your typical post-apoc story where USA & USSR out of boredom made kabooom in 999th time. Here,  in order to survive, you have to visit other worlds and even dimensions, sometimes inhabited by creatures even more dangerous than the ones who destroyed the Earth. The game gives you tons of information about local setting via archaic computers, tape-recorders, letters and newspapers, but... you absolutely doesn't have to read any of this. And this is another great thing, because you can get more or less clear understanding of the situation without them.

Another great thing - soundtracks, which perfectly fit the amosphere. From gloomy and melancholic tunes when you are visiting dead streets of Earth or noisy swamps of Corsus (another world) - to dynamic and even epic compositions while you are fighting with local bosses.

One more strong aspect, and definitely the most important here - gameplay. Yes, not without flaws, but it has enough interesting mechanics to give you some great experience. And the best thing here is shooting. It's not just great, I'd even say that shooting here brings satisfaction. Each gun behaves differently. And their variety is also huge: from some self-made firearms and archaic guns from early and mid XX century - to some crazy alien guns, which can send enemies to another dimension, infest them with some bloodsucking bugs or even ressurect you on death.  

And this is not all. Each weapon can also be equiped with a special module, which can improve it's firepower or even give it some other useful effect. How about fire bullets which will burn enemies? Or maybe frost bursts, which can freeze even bosses? Maybe a healing aura? Or ability to spawn few minions? Most of these modules can be switched between most weapons (because some weapons have their unique modules which can't be changed) which gives you many options to create the best build for your playstyle.

And a word about builds. It's not just about weapons and modules. Each armor set also has it's unique bonuses: some of them give you the best protection at cost of mobility while others may give you huge boost to your overall damage or even  turn you into so-called vampire, who regenerates health by shooting enemies. And you also have a vast variety of rings and amulets to create your perfect build. Very often you can find something that seems rather useless. You may even think: ""Who would even think to use this clearly [i]harmful[/i] garbage?"" But then you may find some other ring, which can totally negate it's negative effect, or combine it with some set of armor so these negative effects just do not matter anymore.

There are also trait points you get after earning a certain amount of experience. You may invest them literally into everything: reload speed, weapons swap speed, running speed, firerate, protection, stamina, etc, etc. Thus, all this allows you to create your unique class. From the guy who can one-shot almost everyone to unkillable armored tank. From support guy, who heal and boost allies to summoner who uses lots of minions. All this creates greate environment for replayability.

While I love all abovementioned aspects, and especially the setting, I must admit that the story here kinda sucks. Tasks are vague, characters are bland, events are uninspiring... Talk with this aged boss woman, recover that ancient aged woman, find the main aged man. Get them all, lol, but instead of pokemons you are collecting old people here. Honestly, I was 10 times more interested in exploration of new locations with it's local ""fauna"" and artifacts, rather then searching for some elusive [strike]Joe[/strike] Ford.

One more thing I didn't like is... prologue/tutorial (you have to finish it before playing the actual game). It looks kinda... poor? And hardly represents main gameplay. It's short but I got bored very soon. If not my friend, who instantly dragged me to co-op, I'd probaly postpone the game for better times.

Now few words about real flaws. Unfortunately. There are few of them, but I see only one huge problem which can potentially burn your chair, make your eyes red and turn your hair white. And that's... network issues. The game uses peer-to-peer system. Thus, you have to pray for you Internet, or the Internet of the host. The situation where I was disconnected, or my teammates were disconnected are countless. No matter who is the host and where is he from - there is no guarantee that you or he will be disconnected.

And let me be clear about this situation. It is not that problematic if you play campaign or adventure with your friends or even random players. You can easily rejoin this game the moment later, because your mates can ""reconnect"" you from the nearest spawn stone. You won't even lose anything. But for survival mode network issues are fatal. Because there is no way to reconnect to the game in this mode. If a player gets disconnected, the game is ruined for him (it's kinda clear why) and potentially ruined for remained players, because they lose valuable asset forever. The moment you see your mate doing ""moonwalk"" on the head of the boss, in the air, or underground - you realise that few moments later he will get disconnected.

Another problem - bugs. And again, it is not a problem for campaign or adventure. But for survival mode they are critical. Boss fell underground - you can't kill boss, you can't leave the room, you can't move further, run is ruined. You decided to change armor piece - you... died. Lol, yeah, probably from heart attack. On island maps from Reism campaign, instead of beign incapacitated after you lose your health - you instantly die. And I mentioned only significant ones.

The last... hmm... really not that much a problem, but more like a claim. Steam backgrounds. I really rarely pay attention to stuff like this but... you have so many iconic and beautiful locations in your game and you put here those ugly NPCs instead? Why not cathedral? Alien nexuses with the black sun on background? Labyrinth? Ancient ruins among giant trees? What a waste...

Overall, even with all it's cons - highly recommend. Find yourself 2 more friends for better experience and you will get really unforgettable adventure. Of course game can be finished solo, but with friends it's faster, safer, more efficient and exciting.",1635473527,1635473527,True,34,0,0.731393754482269287,0,True,False,False

The first thing to say right away is that the game has a variety of biomes that you unlock as you progress through the main story. When you go to a biome, the overall map is semi-randomized. It is [b]not[/b] procedural generation though. In fact, the map is split up into sections that were already handcrafted/pre-made by the developers. The only aspect that is randomized is which sections appear in your run-through of the biome, and also which mini-boss and boss you fight.

Certain parts of the maps have side quests or various NPCs to meet, some of which will give you new equipment or special upgrades. And if you haven't seen everything for a biome, then you are able to re-roll it, so it might reveal some of the areas you haven't seen yet. The only downside to this is that there are a few special events where you need the biome to pick multiple areas in the same run, but that's only if you're trying to do all of the side content. Plus, you can re-roll early if you want to.

The main story starts off somewhat generically but I think by the end of the game, it definitely has some interesting notes, and the final boss is fun. The game has two DLCs, the first of which isn't exactly the best but it contains probably the toughest boss fight of the entire game. The second DLC ends up continuing the main storyline with an even better wrap-up, in my opinion, and covers the lore much more strongly; though your interest depends upon whether you're intrigued by the world.

Combat is very smooth and the best part of the game. The weapons also have a good amount of variety. You carry two guns and one melee weapon at a time, though you can swap things out as you see fit. Also, the game is actually easier than [i]Dark Souls[/i] when it comes to dying because you don't actually lose anything. All you do is revive back at the last crystal you interacted with. That's not to say the game is easy overall, as there are definitely some tough spots. The bosses as a whole are some of the most interesting fights too, which made me happy.

All in all, it's worth your time. I loved running through this creepy world. One thing to note is that the first biome is probably the least intriguing, as it's essentially a decrepit Earth. Don't assume the game is just that, because it's not. There's more fantastical areas to come afterwards. The best areas are later in the game, in my opinion, so go give this one a shot!",1635122511,1635122780,True,28,0,0.769158482551574707,0,True,False,False

Very good story the cut scenes are (OK) you can say this is a decent game !
MUSIC 2/5 
The battle music is not so good you can just turn it off and open youtube and just put epic music ! much better ! 
Gameplay 4/5 
I like the gameplay there is alot of builds to do ! if you have time to thing and try it its fun ! when you have alot of things the game itself its not so boring (this is after the story) yet i have to tell what i dont like (some hitboxes are so BAD yeah ( 1 time i did shoot and the bullet went backwards (true story) Burn my friend :D) 
the difficulties are pointless ( you can get all the items in normal without playing the other difficult )so for me is pointless! (hardcore have some other items that is good!)

617290,54911565,76561198108601580,0,10,4892,0,1151,1688907118,"This game definitely surprised me. It starts off a little rough, but it finds it's footing after the first few hours. It attempts to go for a more cinematic story-telling experience at first, but gives up on that after a while and defaults to the dark-souls style of environmental story-telling. It definitely handles that style better. At any rate, the story probably isn't why you're interested in this.

The main hook here is ""Dark Souls with guns"". In that regard, this game succeeds. That premise has only been tried a few times, most notably with Immortal Unchained. However, this game is probably the first to really get it right.

Obviously, adapting the dark souls design philosophy to a third person shooter requires some changes. Melee combat is simplified. It's not an afterthought, don't get me wrong, and it is satisfying to use. But you definitely can't beat the game with a melee focused build. Instead, you'll be doing most of the fighting with your guns. You get to bring two at a time, a small sidearm and a long-gun. There is a decent amount of variety here, once you get far enough in the game. The early game is a little dry in that regard.
I won't go into too much detail about the combat, you have to try it to get it. But I will say - it is clearly where they spent the most attention. The moment to moment gameplay is very fluid and controls well. This game punches above its weight in that regard. And for a game like this, that's the most important thing to be good at. I think the closest comparison I can make is something like Mass Effect. You're mostly using guns, but you can punch some enemies to death too if you want. 

The parts where the game's Dark Souls inspiration are more obvious are in the world/level design. Similar setup, move throughout the world with bonfire style checkpoints. Bosses behind fog gates. 
It does mix this up with procedural generation. Some parts of the world handle this better than others. The first part of the game seems to have a relatively small pool of elements to shuffle around, and you'll see a lot of repeats. But the later game stages are more interesting.
** edit - I re-rolled the campaign and got a much more varied opening stage. Maybe it was just a bad roll the first time.

Multiplayer is purely co-op, and can be fun. However, using it also cranks up the difficulty and can make some situations much worse than just playing solo. There is also no communication of any kind. Some dark souls style gestures would be appreciated here.
** Edit - they added gestures

The quality of boss design varies a bit. Some bosses are pretty fun. Too many of them rely on hordes of smaller enemies to pad the difficulty, which I do not find enjoyable. While I didn't see every boss, not a single one of the bosses I did see were solo fights. 

I have a special resentment for the final boss. It sucks. The concept and mechanics are good, in theory, but they are not handled right. Some playstyles, like the ""Scrapper"" (shotgun/pistol) starting class, quite literally can't beat this boss alone. That's not a huge issue, as getting an appropriate weapon isn't difficult or class specific, but it is frustrating if your playstyle is so thoroughly useless at the end of the game. But I think the biggest oversight here is that killing it relies on exploiting a very specific, difficult to achieve mechanic that requires teamwork, coordination, and timing to pull off. There is little chance you will do this with a squad of random people. This might get easier as the game gets older and more people know how to handle it. But for now, it is an intensely unpleasant fight. 
** Edit - came back and replayed this in 2021 and the final boss is a pushover now, they must have patched it. Wish they had found more of a happy medium, but maybe it's balanced a bit better on the top level difficulties. I'll have to try it there.

Overall, this is an enjoyable game. Parts of it could use polish, and the ending is more of a chore to get through than an exciting experience, but this is a solid game.",1567304315,1634852240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has the style of game that I have been waiting for, for years now. This game reminds me SO much of Gears of War. If you were and are a fanatic of the Gears series you know exactly what I mean. The Gameplay and mechanics, the shooting, the 3rd person view and hit boxes - all of it. The rustic feel of everything being abandoned and rough. The idea that this is survival of the fittest you know? The intensity really brings it to life when you're in a firefight. This game ALSO reminds me very much of Dark souls. The bosses can be tricky, but learning the patterns and adjusting just a little bit every time you fight that boss.

Some aspects of the game I haven't figured out quite yet, purely out of just having hours in, like the grind, the storyline and bosses. Are battles going to be so hard to the point where we/I depending on if I'm with a squad or not, we are fighting the boss 20-30-40-50 times? Or are materials like Scrap and Iron - may be dependable on upgrading and being able to keep up with the pace of the game and The Root. 

Another gripe I have about it is the effects of characters/AI's talking is very choppy and would be slightly more enjoyable if they were a little more detailed. Of course it's always hard to get the graphics of talking down, but that's not really a big deal, more of personal preference. It doesn't really bother me to the point where it ruins the sequences or anything.

Ratings

-Graphics-
---> Abilities/Aiming/Shooting - 10/10 Love it love it love it - satisfying to hit your target and at this point all this is missing is a quick reload bar. Having that extra addition would be a great liveliness to the game that makes fighting more intense. My own personal preference, but that's why I'm here right?
---> Cut scene environment - 8/10 Not the best graphics a game has ever had, but they look dang good. The world environment plays a huge roll into the whole vibe of the game.
---> Cut scene AI/Character - 6/10 As I explained their mouth graphics are very choppy and kind of an eye sore when it comes to the cut scenes. Could use some improvement.
---> Gun Design/Equipment Detail - 9/10 Weapons that you have equipped sway with the movement of your character which gives the game that next dimension of realism within the game. You can almost feel the weight of your weapons as you walk about The Root.
---> Character/Movement - 10/10 Very natural like and heavy. A lot of games tend to make characters move insanely fast compared to their environment. Remnant has that perfect pace of running and walking. This goes for weapon movement as well. Melee attacks look possible to achieve in real life. The fact that we are just humans and our strength is all we have, gives a better fighting experience when you're playing. 
---> 

*Overall graphics rating - 43/50

-Story-line/Overall Environment-

---> Enemies - 10/10 4 hours in a already 9 different enemies
---> AI Lore - 8/10 probably 10/10 but I haven't read nearly enough notes in game to say whether they create a good storyline or not for different AI's. But so far they create an overall idea of the worlds reality and peoples emotions.
---> World Environment - 10/10 again very much related to Gears of War, That very rustic feel and that the world is crumbling. Like the amount of hope everyone has is just enough to try and live to beat The Root. It brings to life the reality of devastation that everyone is dealing with. But also makes you wonder, where are the other humans? Where are other survivors and what do they have? How are they pushing away The Root? Maybe at some point there will be a base to build? Honestly you could probably figure out by just researching the game, but I like to leave the mystery for me to find out how the game is played - simply by putting in the hours.

*Overall Story-line/Environment rating - 28/30

-Interface-

---> Main Menu - 10/10 Very easy to navigate, graphics and detail are great. That's about it. Looks great :)
---> Character/Adventure Creation - 10/10 very easy to create a new character and most importantly very fast. I am hoping - depending on what the future path is for this game - that they add new characters. I would imagine that roaming a planet being overrun by The Root that there would multiple types of classes of characters and their ability to learn Different/New traits. Like an explosive character, a Machine gun type, a utility based character who can set up turrets and shields for battles - I think the game can expand in that way, but again I don't know what the time map looks like for this game.
---> In-Game Hub - 10/10 Easy to use, not a lot in your face to manage. The animations and transitions are smooth and don't glitch. I've known many menus like Borderlands where the menu like to freeze and transition poorly. The only bug I have found so far is that the ""Waiting for other players"" notification in game will some times stay on screen until you reload into another area or checkpoint. But it doesn't obscure too much game play to make it awful.

My last thoughts on this game are... FINALLY. A game like this is what my friends and myself have been waiting for. A fun, intense, shoot em up game with a crazy story line to make your firefights worth the time. To upgrade your equipment to crush The Root. To redeem all of the lives that have been lost due to this horrible ESTBLISHMENT of ROOTS. Anyways I'm rambling. 

Great game - I am extremely excited to see where this game goes. And am excited to learn more about this masterpiece.

The game itself is a concept I love, a somewhat Darksouls-ish gameplay style with more of a gun focus, THAT is what this game does well, and it is probably the best part of the game:  The gameplay.  The problems come from everything surrounding the gameplay: items not working, the servers post Epic Games integration, glitches, boring areas, the ""story"", being at the mercy of RNG to pad out game time, the upgrade system, and one of the worst ""final bosses"" I have ever seen in a video game.  These are just some of the issues with Remnant, but rest assured:  These issues are big enough issues to be annoying while you are playing, items flat out don't work sometimes, armor sets and rings are what come to mind the most in that department.  Some Armor sets simply are legitimately useless, and you aren't going to be using them as cosmetics or something, it makes the item pool feel smaller than it already is, and it adds insult to injury to the annoying RNG progression.  Not only do you have to reload the same area with NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER done to it each run, but once you get what you were resetting repeatedly for, it's absolutely unusable anyway, so there was no point in even bothering to get it.  

Something that adds to my frustration, is how big the devs talked about this game before it came out, saying: ""It is their baby"" and they ""care about meaningful updates and continued development""  if anything, each update they added to this game, made the game worse.  The Developers are a new level of incompetent, and their Epic Games integration says that.  The Epic Games integration is not frustrating because it is Epic Games, I don't really care about that, what I do care about is the fact that it demolished connection stability for the entire playerbase, and even made it so some people couldn't connect to multiplayer anymore PERIOD.  All of these things make Remnant an excellent concept, with terrible execution.

If it's on sale, and you are particularly bored, you can get around 70 hours out of it if you try to get all of the items.  It could be fine for a casual playthrough as well, but don't expect a lot of depth.  The gameplay will stale out around 45 hours, and the RNG resetting is tedious and not fun if you are a completionist. I don't think it is worth the 40$ + the DLCs (Don't get me started on the DLCs, those are atrocious in their own ways.)  

TLDR: pick it up on sale if you are looking for a casual playthrough of it and you are extra bored, be ready for items not to work, tedious RNG padding, broken mechanics and items, and one of the worst final bosses in gaming.  To compensate you also get gameplay that feels pretty good, and I want to see more games like it, just without the aforementioned flaws.",1634175841,1634175841,False,72,6,0.56968158483505249,0,True,False,False

The game overall is very bland. I feel as though the world here, since it is procedurally generated, has very little room for creativity and detail. Everywhere pretty much looks and feels the same. For those of you who play Bloodborne; think the Chalice Dungeons but an entire game. Not fun and very boring to look at.

Due to this, exploration becomes tedious after the first hour or so. In the beginning I was looking through every nook and cranny but eventually I got tired of exploring as was very rarely rewarded with anything that was worthwhile.

Bosses: One thing that Soulslike games are renowned for are their bosses. This game however really suffers in this aspect because almost every boss comes with enemy gank squads. I hate that. Just give me an interesting boss fight, not these artificial difficulty fights. I never defeated a boss and felt like I accomplished anything, I just felt relieved. Plus their arenas leave a lot to be desired. 

This is supposed to be a Co-Op game. I can understand why some people might enjoy this with their friends but, if you're going to have a Solo Mode, it should be just as fun and rewarding.

This might be the game for you if you enjoy Co-Op and shooty Dark Souls but if you're going to play this Solo, I would give it a miss. It got very boring after 10+ hours and I have no desire to play it again.

TLDR: Play it even just for the aesthetic pleasing :)

Pros: 
Environments
Atmosphere 
Enemies design
Boss weapon design
Very Good Boy weapon mod
Almost complete absence of music with awesome environment sounds instead/music might be very subtle an eerie
Armor design
I want to write story, but it's kind of generic, yet enjoyable, since you rarely see some Biopunk/PostApocaliptic

Cons: 
Bosses Imbalance - most bosses are a joke, except 2 or 3 which are SEVERELY punishing
Weapon Imbalance - some weapon feel too powerful and vise versa/you can annihilate punishing bosses my abusing some imbalance mods (I look at you, Nightmare)
Monster variance - monster are good, don't get me wrong, but too much humanoids. Red, blue, what's not
Main hero commentary - too often same phrases are spoken, otherwise good feature
Some bugs - The Ravager boss just stuck in the bushes after the 1st jump on my 4th or 5th try, enemies sometimes hit you through walls, some attacks have too big AoE so it's almost impossible to dodge (I look at you, Nightmare again)

The game is actually now playable online with the ""potential cheating detected"" bug hopefully solved. Why is it still negative? I joined a match and got downed by the ever-so-bullshit enemy damage scaling, except when I was revived I didn't actually revive and was kept stuck in the downed position. The review was last updated on Aug 31; issue still exists.

[h1]The Good (it's just good)[/h1]
[b]Gameplay:[/b] The game combines elements from a third person shooter by giving the player two weapons as their main source of damage, along with a light (I'm ashamed to say it, but there's not really anything else to describe it with) Souls-like vibe when it comes to checkpoints and melee: it's a fairly basic system of heavy and light attacks, you have rolling with iframes and a stamina bar that halts regeneration when meleeing and gets drained by dodging. The shooting works on weak spots (headshots, but sometimes not the head) and critical hits (shoot anywhere, chance to deal extra damage), along with the obvious standard damage increases, [strike]because every game needs to have those nowadays to make balancing needlessly harder[/strike]. Each non-boss weapon can use a mod item that charges with damage done (and time, depending on your gear) and can be swapped at any time, giving the player two weapons with two magic powers and a melee weapon to seamlessly alternate between. To me the game is at its absolute best when played using all weapons and all mods in conjunction, instead of sticking to braindead lazy playstyles that, in contrast, waste the weapon system's potential and makes for a boring pew-pew shooter with checkpoints... and we've seen many of those already, haven't we?

[b]Upgrades and gear:[/b] The upgrade system for your gear is upgrades ranging from 1 to 20 (and 10 on boss weapons, so I guess it's inspired by Souls there as well) that define how tough enemies in your rolled worlds are; those worlds being either the campaign that has the game's story and four worlds to play in (each with two open-ish maps and a couple dungeons in them), or the adventure mode that has the player select one world to play one open map on with the respective amount of instances. The upgrade system gives place to a better balancing compared to games that also use gear score (which are mostly MMOs) when combined with one of the game's greatest strengths: unique gear. You don't have a rare pistol, an epic pistol and whatever other pistols with two million variations of stats; you have the fucking pistol, period. This helps the game's loot be meaningful, each weapon and armor set be different, and mixing and matching according not to a dumbass meta, but your own playstyle, is encouraged and has had effort from the developers to make each piece of gear properly usable. There are bad builds, but this is more due to gear mismatching than bad design. You also have traits for your character, which are passives to spend points on after leveling up; you can get all of them at the end and they're basically there to fairly raise your character's performance without depending on gear.

[h1]The Bad (even on its own merit, it's awful)[/h1]
[b]Map design:[/b] Contrary to what people would imply with ""Souls-like"", this game isn't on the same level of difficulty: your currency does not get dropped on death, checkpoints are plentiful and the randomized nature of the game's map does not allow a combination of enemies akin to the Souls series. In fact, the randomization is one of the game's biggest drawbacks to me, with each map being composed of tiles from a specific tileset, not very unlike the way Warframe handles its maps - you'll find several copy-pasted rooms in dungeons, as well as chunks of the world map. I can understand people's desire for replayability, but to me replayability shouldn't come at the cost of a game's identity; instead, an approach more similar to Dark Souls should've been taken, where it comes from making different builds and engaging with different players, with a few extra sprinkles like different enemy placements, numbers and whatnot. As it stands, the game's environments can look pretty damn good (it's UE4, so it's basically a requirement), but it doesn't matter when these good-looking environments are the product of an algorithm putting them together in whatever order it wants (within its own limits, of course) - replayability becomes repetition.

[b]Multiplayer:[/b] This could've gone on the ugly, but given what I personally understand of a netcode creation and recreation's difficulty (which is not much), I consider it enough of a core to say it's not just an ""eh, they're gonna fix it tomorrow"" case. Anyway, it kinda fucking sucks - not in the ""playing with people is bad"", mind you, but in the way it's handled:
[list][*]You cannot filter player lobbies by location, nor know in which continent the host is.[/list]
[list][*]You cannot filter lobbies by ping, nor actually see the ping anywhere.[/list]
[list][*]Ping affects several actions in the game, most notably swapping ranged weapons (hit the button, ping delay, action happens), toggling mods (some mods are alt fires, like the flamethrower that is toggled with the mod button and fire with the mouse button) AND THE FUCKING IFRAMES. THE FUCKING IFRAMES LAG BEHIND YOU.[/list]
[list][*]The multiplayer scaling can make fights needlessly hard at times in the wrong difficulties and give very harsh scalings to both the health and the damage of certain enemies, with builds that work for active tanking suddenly being one-shot and certain enemies coming in packs with absurd levels of health.[/list]
In short, it's a pain in the ass to find a lobby with the right ping for you and that gets combined with how important ping is to make for a frustrating experience when you get into the wrong lobby unknowingly. AND I STRESS THE IFRAMES.

[b]Why:[/b] Enemies can hit you while you're on the ground and the game provides no methods of defense there, with the only thing being waiting for your character to get back up while they can actually be knocked down again before the animation even finishes. Try doing that on a high difficulty where you're trying your best to not get damaged by a crowd of enemies. I should probably put this on the ugly instead, but I don't believe it'll ever be fixed; if anything, it'll likely be dismissed with ""it's not broken, so it doesn't need fixing"".

[h1]The Ugly (I can live through it)[/h1]
[b]QoL:[/b] It do be pretty uggo.
[list][*]There is no option for holding sprint, toggling aiming, holding scope (that one is actually double-clicking aiming, which is fucking stupid), toggling scope only toggles the scope when aiming and goes away on weapon swap.[/list]
[list][*]If you stop sprinting shortly before rolling and keep moving, the game will treat it as if you never stopped sprinting and resume the roll from a sprint; this is horrible for stamina management and the lack of an UI icon to indicate the toggle makes disabling it even more of a pain in the ass in situations that demand urgency and the mistake happens. You can also easily cancel your sprint on very short drops from geometry probably measured at two feet.[/list]
[list][*]You cannot navigate the UI with WASD.[/list]
[list][*]You cannot have more than four consumables on quickslots.[/list]
[list][*]You cannot cancel buff mods earlier if the fight didn't last long enough for you to use their very long duration. The game also does not remember the selected weapon when you unequip it on the inventory, so you cannot quickly reset these mods by double-tapping spacebar to unequip and equip the weapon. ""Oh no, your weapon is one of the ones at the bottom, sucks to be you lol"", says the game.[/list]
[list][*]You cannot change your character's appearance after creation, nor have a cosmetic armor slot in case you dislike your statistically preferable armor's appearance.[/list]",1608979242,1633886565,False,1,0,0.519265055656433105,3,True,False,False

A single playthrough felt a little disappointing, but this second one is already very different. It's replayability seems to be its greater strength for now. 

Great game, definitely a lot of fun. If you like dark souls games and guns, this is the place for you. The game is like a weird and shitty dark souls 3, but even a shitty dark souls game, to me, is one of the best out there. The mechanics are so similar it's like you are forced into a mage build. Dodging and running is important cause you can take hits. Bosses are legit and you have to learn their moves and weaknesses to win. When I finally beat the final boss I felt like the man. You finds lots of cool new weapons too, though not a crazy wide variety. 

This game does have its weaknesses unfortunately. For finding items, it is based almost entirely on random events or finding optional dungeons/bosses. This isn't all that bad, but for every boss, the recrommended weapons are almost always the same, ie repeater pistol or hive cannon or assault rifle and beam rifle. I used the machine pistol and beam rifle mostly, but don't get me wrong, the beam rifle got me through the whole game. It made things kinda boring since while I could switch weapons, the other weapons just weren't as good. In the final boss on his second phase, they automatically equip a fusion rifle +5 (the first time). You think is weapon that is super good or at least great against this boss, but no. You are gonna have  to figure out a way to switch back to your +20 weapon without dying and recharge your mods. Or you may just be better than I am. It's not a big deal and I may just need more experience with the other weapons, I just didn't find the other optional missions and so I've been kinda stuck unless I'm okay with working with one of the crappier weapons.
My last complaint is a little more and actual complaint. The npcs don't track with you at all (almost). NPCs respond when you find a new person and bring them back, but that is it. You can defeat god himself, and they still talk to you like that new guy they just saved. It kinda sucks cause it means the other people there only provide services and a little bit of interesting dialog as to their backstory. Beyond that, you have no impact on the world. Now they do build the game to be replayable in a lot of spots, so this allows you to not lose any progress at your home base (I guess), but that is only because you don't make any progress either unless there is one of the few rare exceptions.

I'll add, it's a little weird the main campaign is split into two dlcs. Like you start the game trying to save earth from the root, but you don't do that until you finish the last dlc, why is it a dlc and not just the game I bought and paid for?",1633609220,1633617554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i really like the [u] reward system [/u]you get from bosses. this makes the gameplay loop satisfying. the procedural world can get monotonous though, if you're unlucky and if you're looking for a specific item on your run. needless to say, it's fun looting in this game im telling you. it got me wanting more so i bought the DLC - Subject 2923. i'd say wait for a sale tho if you want to defeat the FINAL BOSS of this game.

the [u] atmosphere [/u] is fantastic. the scenic design for each respective area is amazing. take a few seconds, pause from playing and you'll definitely appreciate what you're seeing.. also, the equipment, enemies, armor, etc. design aren't your mediocre ""fire/ice"" themed designs, so that's a plus!

[u] sound design [/u] is alright, it's not horrible but it's not that unique either (more on the latter), 4/10. sound effects do give a bit of depth in shooting and killing... you'll especially feel this in the hilichurls, they go BLAAAA when they die.

[u] the story? [/u] forget about the story lol, we come here guns-blazing.

""Exploration felt shallow, aimless and meaningless.""  This is somehow part of the game's difficulty, there isn't that much unique stuff to explore, but the environment is beautiful. What is important to consider that not everything is laid out in plain sight, but when found it gives a major satisfaction boost. (In fact there are a moderate number of things one can ""toy"" with.

Many people whine about the upgrade system being pointless. Well.. I tried to not level up my gear :D It was bad. 

Some say that there is no story. They are right kind of but wrong on many level. There is no actual story that develops further and further however there is a backstory of why the things happened and many of the items contain pieces of lore. So the ""story"" unfolds as you find items.



The gameplay is fantastic almost addicting, graphics and animations the same. There are of course some flaws too:
- armor skins cost ""millions"" and to tell you the truth, they are not worth it at all
- it is hard to get all the in game items (it is possible with some heavy grinding) and sometimes an item just won't drop

But I was so wrong. RFtA was a very pleasant surprise with some horror elements, yes, (I'm looking at you, Harrow) but overall it's a great, wonderful game. The action is not overbearing and when something pops off, it pops off and out of control in a matter of moments and, if you're not careful, you're likely to get steamrolled. Progression is apparent, the more you put into your character and guns, the more noticeable it is.

It was a challenge all throughout the game, nice graphics, fairly simple mechanics, great gunplay, super melee play but you will get floored if you're just swinging away carelessly. One more thing I want to point out is you can team up with people, whether in your active session or you can go browsing for other players and even team up exclusively with friends. Even though this game is a LOT of fun by yourself, it's a LOT more fun with people, it turns into a real fire fight which is very cool.

All in all, I fully recommend this game, it gives me Gears of War vibes with people, Dark Souls by yourself, and hours of fun no matter which way you play. There's also replayability in this game meaning you can re-roll the storyline, but keep all of your stuff. Materials and scrap (money in RFtA) scale with your progress as do the enemies.

Now first I mostly just played with my friend on this game. But after a while my progress reseted. Because I reinstalled my pc.... and for got the save file....Cough but anyways I started again and decided to play solo and let me tell you I have not stopped playing this game until now! I have a problem of always deleting my character and starting a new. Which mean I have never actually killed the final boss... Obs? Anyways on to the point why I love this game. First, randomized campaign where the world changes every reroll can be small to really big changes! Second. There are so many fricking cool weapons and armors. While the character creation is pretty ass the armors just make me go like mmmm DAMN my character looking fine right now! Third, Playing this game for a few hours.. I really gotta say i'm not actually bored of the game yet O-O. Now I know I've taken breaks from the game, however that's just because my pc is pretty awful... So on to my final saying, buy this game if you like darksouls inspired games which uses guns and big cool looking bosses.

Needless to say this game will geta  positive review from me, however if you've never played the game and want to know if this game is or isn't for you this review may be helpful to you.

Let's start with the things Remnant isn't. Remnant isn't a linear shooter that focusses heavily on story and cinematics. However it isn't an open world looter shooter either. The closest thing I can think of when describing this game is a Soulslike with guns and semi randomized maps √† la Diablo. If you're expecting a gripping story or a new weapon drop every couple of minutes you'll be dissapointed. So who is this game actually for? Well let me just tell you about my experience with Remnant.

Playing through the entire game for the first time took me about 20 hours or so. Keep in mind I'm a player who takes his time when playing a game, often stopping to look at a beautiful scenary or to listen to a games sound track. I only managed to beat the game on normal back then (the easiest difficulty) so sure enough I wanted a second run, this time with a higher difficulty. Once that was done I wanted all the items the game has to offer, however some of them would only drop in hardcore mode. I wasn't good enough for that yet since it requires you to beat bosses on your first try so I went with nightmare difficulty and Apocalype difficulty next until I was good enough to not get killed 40 times by the same boss. I also played survival mode and adventure mode to fullfill my second goal, hunting down all the achievements which include killing 10 bosses in a row on survival mode and defeating a wolrd boss without taking a single point of dmg. 

So what kept me entertained during all these numerous runs? It certainly couldn't have been the rudimentary and disjointed story that's mostly told via diary entries and item descriptions. Maybe it was the huge amount of loot I was showered with? Well no there's quite few armorsets, guns, modifications (skills), traits (passives) and rings to find. But certainly nowhere near the level of borderlands or Diablo. So what really made me play the game over and over was the fantastic gunplay. Remnant has hands down the best gunplay I have ever played in a shooter game. Movement is fluid an precise. Every weapon feels drastically different and fun to use. From a standard ""fire a fast as you can click"" pistol to a ""this shotgun banishes enemies into a different dimension"" Remnant has everything. There's not a single weapon that is not fun to use or doesn't handle well. Landing hits in this game feels incredibly satisfying. Even on higher difficulties precise heashots will quickly down enemies. Only a few minibosses fall into the category ""bullet sponge"" but they are deliberately designed that way. You can stagger most enemies, making them cancel attacks or spells in the process. Shooting them in different body parts often has drastically different outcomes. Eg. shooting a huge enemy in the knee might cause them to fall over and faceplant right in front of you. Shoot a weaker enemy in the chest from close range and they'll be knocked off their feet. A caster is doing something you don't like? Well if you hit them in the face they might just stop whatever it is they were doing and run away.

Generelly speaking the enemy design in this game is fantastic. The AI is smart and enemies often work in synergies. Every enemy has multiple movesets which the player needs to memorize if they don't want to die quickly. Even after hundreds hours of gameplay I still occasionally see new moves from enemies I've never seen before like a caster that I though was only ranged hitting at me with his staff when I got too close to him. The fantastic gunplay is perfected by so called ""weapon mods"". These are basically spells that range from a standard flamethrower, to conjuring swarms of insects to summoning radiocative flying skulls. Once you are familiar with the weapon you're using and the enemies your facing you will find youself skillfully dodging enemies while keeping a close track on your mod coldowns, while listening to audio cues indicating attacks happening outside if your field of view and analyzing enemy movement patters to anticipate the next attack. It's challening, fast paced, brutal and incredibly satisfying. It's this kind of gameplay flow that made me continue playing the game even when the story was done and my character had found most the items availbeable in the game.

In closing I also want to quickly mention the graphics and sound of this game which I think are both phenomenal. I work as a professional 3D character artist and as a result I like to pay close attention to enemy and environmental design. Remnant doesn't have photorealistic textures, face scans or environmental assets  created through photogrammetry. But what it does have is a phenomenal art direction. There is more creativity put into each of Remnants 5 worlds than you'll see in most other games. It doesn't matter if you encounter some Giger-esque, biomechanical monstrosities in the desert of Rhom, insectoid zombies on Corsus or whimsical satyr creatures with elaborate facemasks in Yaesha. Everything in this game is beautiful to look at, The silhouettes, color palettes and sheer variety of visual languages is astounding. This is the kind of artdirection that impresses me when playing a game and has been another factor, next to the excellent gameplay, why I could play this game for hundreds of hours. As for the sound design not only is there a huge library of unique sounds that build athmosphere and add to the visceral feel of combat. But most sounds are also cleverly interwoven into the gameplay serving as audio cues that help you keep track of enemy positions and predict their attacks even when they are out of sight. It's only when you get blinded by a ratman-magician in Reisum and have to play with almost zero vision for a couple of seconds that you realize you could play this game almosty blindly because the sound design is so well done. Add some absolutely fantastic bossfight music too (Haarsgard) and you'll get why I enjoy Remnants sound design so much.

Last but not least I have to talk about bossifghts and difficulty. Similar to other souls like games there are a lot of bossfights in this game too. Some bosses focus on quick reactions/muscle memory and being able to read their next attack in a split second. Others will turn half the arena into ""the floor is lava"". There's summoner bosses swarming the arena with trash mobs. Dual bosses which attack as a team, and so on and so forth. Personally I enjoy every bossfight. They are a mayor positive for me in the game and the elf queen bossfight is still my favorite bossfight of all time (took me about 4-5 hours to beat her on nightmare before they slightly nerfed her dmg). There's also alternative kills for many of the worldbosses which will result in different movesets and item rewards. I have read however that a lot of people dislike how a lot of bosses will come with an endless spawn of minions. So keep that in mind when thinking about buying this game. 

As far as difficulty is concerned Remnant is definitely on the harder side. While I have beaten the game on the  highest difficulty and know most enemies very well I still wouldn't stand a chance on a fresh hardcore character in apocalypse difficulty and I also woudn't make it really far in apocalypse survival runs. So there's always a bigger challenge if you really want to. For beginners I would recommend you only play this game if failure motivates you instead of frustrating you. There are a couple of noob-filters early on and if you have a problem spending 20-40 tries to beat a boss you might want to give this game a pass. However if you like challenges I recommend buying this game.",1632736206,1632888093,True,43,0,0.781565070152282715,3,True,False,False

The Souls-like action-shooter allows you to experience a world on your own terms: you decide where your strengths lie, and it challenges you to explore a variety of possibilities throughout the game.
As for the replayability: the game keeps on giving. Between procedurally-generated regions, random events, alternative boss kills, and a game-within-a-game survival mode, the addition of co-op just amplifies a need to see what else the game has to offer. Even after 80 hours of play, you can still be surprised with new and crazy situations - and you discover special combinations that are either amazingly effective, or they simply feel extremely satisfying.

For anyone who loves themselves a Souls-game that captures the charm of the original series, and yet brings all kind of ingenuity and personal flair to the table; for people who enjoy a rogue-like survival game; or those who wish to kick back, and take on a myriad of amazing bosses with friends - Remnant: From the Ashes got it covered! Add a bonus for the beautiful environments, inspiring weapon designs, and intriguing lore, and you got yourself a title worth every piece of scrap!",1632770904,1632770904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every boss fight is indeed like dark souls with guns but to make it still challenging they put fodder enemies in EVERY boss fight. That isn't a bad thing necessarily but the adds feel like an afterthought in the vast majority of fights. Victory on higher level difficulties feels more like luck than skill or memorization as a result.

The story is lackluster but the environments are beautiful and it is good enough for mindless weekend play with a podcast on.

The problem I have with this game is the artificial difficulty. I can't take it anymore.

The input lag is fucking unbearable and what is even more frustrating is that the developers intentionally programmed it this way. How do I know? Because the inputs actually act fucking responsive when the player users the adrenaline consumable item. 

You got these bullshit bosses in these tightly enclosed battle arenas with all kinds of bullshit moves to close the distance and you just cannot break contact with them. Especially when you character is constantly getting stuck on textures...arrrrgggghhhh. Not to mention the constant minion spam and idiotic attack effects to keep blocking the player's view from understanding what the heck is going on. This shit is Halo 2 Jackals on steroids. You like Halo 2 Jackals on Legendary...okay that's this but the entire game for 10 hours.

Ohh I forgot about the BS knockdowns and the stagger lock. 

You have to pray to RNJesus that when you hit the sprint button, your character will actually sprint. There is this persistent 2 second delay between everything you try to do: the animations do not smoothly transition into each other. If you do a dodge roll, do not hit sprint immediately afterward it will drop the input. Remember you must wait for the 2 sec delay then hit sprint. 

God help you if you try to use a recovery item in battle. I have a perk that increases the speed of recovery item use and I swear that shit is nerfed in boss battles.

Anyone else notice that when a boss battle is about to come to a conclusion, your controls seem to get all unresponsive and stupid for no fucking reason. Hold aim button and pull trigger: nope melee attack that wiffs into air and is swiftly punished by a 75% health bar attack one-shot. 

The character sprint speed is like 50% of what it would be in another game.

I just can't take it anymore. Developers stop doing this. We aren't on SNES anymore. This isn't the 90s. Stop with artifical difficulty from shite input responses. This game handles worse than Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure.

Oh you just missed the evade window: no this shit handles like playing in molasses.

Oh also I forgot, yeah close to an enemy, fck the fact that you are holding the aim button down for gun use: the game knows better than you the pleb player so we're going to do a melee attack instead. And then we are going to put you on a narrow fucking bridge with bosses on both sides and bullshit ass picket fence so that every time you try to shoot you will melee attack instead because fck you.

The game play is fun, though it's maybe a little extra hard solo, clearly fights are designed with co-op in mind, but that's not a terrible thing, and well makes some parts of the game mcuh more difficult it's not quite impossible to finish the story solo, but if you're going beyond hard, you're definetly going to want to have a friend or two even.",1631769880,1631769880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
