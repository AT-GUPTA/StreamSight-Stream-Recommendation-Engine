The game is one of a kind, it has one of the most comprehensive damage, flight, and armor models outside of a dedicated Sim. That being said, this game has a number of issues, from a predatory grind that makes playing the game more a chore than fun unless you have a premium tank or some other premium bonuses to help you.

Don't put money in this game, the premium vehicles are near naked cash grabs and there is an inconsistent balancing done to the top tier assets. If you want to play this game, don't play past the WWII or very early Cold War Block of vehicles and don't give them your money unless it's on a sale, the game barely deserves your time once you get past that.

Uninstall it and take a break from it for a few months, it's not going to be fun if you just grind away at it.

Maps are very badly designed sometimes, you can spawn and FIRE INTO THE ENEMY SPAWN or vice-versa and it sucks.

Spawn Camping is very much a problem that isn't being addressed in any meaningful capacity, bomber spam with uber large bombs in Ground RB is a big problem as you can have a squad co-ordinate to basically rain down the bombs with little recourse from you as a player if they do it right because AA isn't always able to engage effectively no matter what BR.

CAS can be overly effective, especially when your team doesn't have any AA solutions to handle the threat they pose very effectively. (JuSt sPAwN AA BrO.) When your AA Can't look up to fire a missile or shoot it's guns, or have enough range to engage the target 15/20km above your spawns, it doesn't matter. (jUst sPawN A pLAEN tEN!) That won't work either, with the latest on the nose update, you can be sure you're not going to be able to escape a player with 8 Radar Guided Missiles and there's no AA on the map that can scare them into being defensive fliers.

Helicopters can be VERY broken, with limited to no recourse if they're sitting outside of the range of your missiles and can be more effective than you, just like with the higher 7.0+ Jets.

It has a lot of good stuff going on for it, but it also SUFFERS from scope creep and once you start getting into the 7.7+ Brackets you should really think if you want to put more of your money and time into this game or not.

I wouldn't recommend it and I've been playing since at least 2016-2018 (depends on where you look).",1544296618,1706934915,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: Gaijin really does such a terrible job at hiding the fact that this game is propaganda campaign for the Russian military to cope their way into thinking NATO tanks stopped improving in the 80s.
Soviet technology in the game over performs its real life counter parts, and NATO vehicles lack 75% of their real life functionality and yet, are matched up against soviet vehicles made 20 years later. 

Remove TrickZZter, or start treating all nations the same when it comes to requirements for in-game performance  / documentation. 

-----------
Not better than Il-2 but still a good game.

Edit: 

3,400 hrs invested in this game, account created in 2013 and started playing a lot more in 2017.
So I have been there from the near beginning. 


This game had a great player base support, and the developers/Gaijin actually seemed passionate about the game and history. However, this has drastically declined with the game's rise in popularity as of ~2019-2020.
With it reacting an all time low in mid-2023.

Gaijin DO NOT value their player-base anymore. New and old. 
Gaijin are increasingly gas-lighting players and community, and evermore not interested in what the community wants / needs.

I could write a full list of time where Gaijin have proven to;
1. Not care about player base health. 
2. Not care about longevity of the game.
3. Not care about actually maximising their long-term profits
... But I won't, as it will be an extensive, and useless list.

TLDR; Terrible developers that prefer short term gain, instead of taking care of player-base, and continuously gaslight their player-base, especially veteran player-base.

That is how much I have on this game.

I've been playing this for years, before Volumetric shells Gaijin was at least tolerable.
After they threw that in, there's been nothing but a downhill slide for WT. Its becoming more and more pay to win, research costs are getting higher, the greed of the devs is just getting worse.

Do not touch this game. Do not play this game. If you do, stop till Gaijin reverses course.
I know its hard, I know you like the game but it does nothing but encourage their behavior. We know we have a impact after Bud Lights stock went through the floor, we can do the same thing here by just not playing and giving them money.

Edit:

I just got contacted by Gaijin to reevaluate my review. Yea, its only gotten worse. Their ballistic calculations are absolutely ridiculous at times. 

I may not have real world experience, but I have done more than my fair share of research. I can tell you now that a 88mm shell going into the side of a KV-1 through the roadwheels shouldn't mean the shell just stops existing. At the bare minimum it would go through the hull if not hit ammo, so no I will not change my review till these issues are resolved gaijin.

Don't waste your time here.  Add on -- just died in four game to helicopters and had no recourse against them as I cannot fly my own choice of aircraft...totally one sided.  Also, game keeps putting me into ""almost done"" , no win games.  My review stands---DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME.  FOLLOW ON POST:  Just played another game and got the drop on an enemy tank at point blank.  Fired and NOTHING...it killed me in return and just kept moving on.  Game is RIGGED...don't waste your money.  To prove my point- I hit a Russian tank point blank with a shell that should penetrate 400 mm of armor-and absolute nothing happened-no damage.  His turret was pointing the other way, so I should get a second shot, except for some unknown reason, my gun was not loading. This was the second time today this has happened.  This game is filled with players who use CHEAT CODES.  You have been warned. 7/28/23-got the drop on opponent.  Hit him 3 times with depleted uranium rounds-nothing.  He hit my Abrams once in front-BOOM.  Game is full of players with CHEAT CODES.  TOTAL BS.   7/31/23-Just played two highly enjoyable games without incident.  The Devs posted a notice that they are aware of the problem I mentioned above and are working to solve the problem and ban accounts from players who use cheat codes or bots.  Trust me, today it was very noticeable and I really enjoyed playing War Thunder.  Please, keep up the good work guys.   Aug 17 5:45pm EST - another point blank shot with depleted uranium shell-no damage to enemy tank   I am going to continue to call out these occurrences here and hunt down cheaters because I see the DEVS are looking for them.             NEW-One piece of advice to the DEVS, when players pay their hard earned money for a tank...LET THEM USE IT.  I purchased and Apache and I have never been allowed to use it.  NEVER ENOUGH SPAWN POINTS.  This really needs to be fixed.   NEW-Smoke shells do not work.  Only 1 in 10 create a cloud.   NEW-8/25/23 10:09PM  bots still in the game.  Just opened up on a tank with a cobra helicopter and my guns would not fire.  This isn't the first time.  Having enemy in sights and opened up but guns did not fire.  DEVS need to work harder on this.  NEW-8/27/23 4:58EST-  Just killed by a BOT.  Game prevented me from seeing who or direction of the attack which isn't normal.    NEW- ANOTHER BOT-9/3/23 2:37est - hit a russian tank with a depleted uranium round in the side of the turret-NOTHING-no damage at all.  Then it casually one shot me to death.  TOTAL BS.  DEVS need to do more about this.   NEW-BOT ISSUE 9/3/23 9:57pm est.  I was hit but gun still worked. Moved behind a rock and lured the enemy to me.  It came and I got the first shot.  I hit the fire button TWICE and no shot came out of the WORKING gun.  Then the charging tank one shotted me to death.  TOTAL BS  NEW-I have changed my review back to NEGATIVE.  You purchase vehicles that you cannot use but the same type of vehicles CAN be purchased by the other side.  Since my last review I was killed 7 times by the same helicopter with guided missiles (not the same player) and I have NO DEFENSE or options to counter this.  Simply spawn and immediately die.  There are numerous other balancing issues the DEVS said they were going to correct three months ago and haven't.  The best thing I do in this game is die...the game is off.  After believing the DEVS promises, I don't now.  Don't wast your money here.  Update-finally got to fly a helicopter I bought.  Got warned I was being lased...immediately tipped forwarded to dive to the deck and.....NOTHING...my helicopter just hung there and didn't dive an inch.  The helicopter control are overly complex and really just do not work.  This makes the 11th time in a two week period I have been destroyed by a helicopter...and always the SAME RUSSIAN model.  Glad to know SOMEONE can fly helicopters as part of the game.  SPAWN POINTS are still lop sided and I have no AA vehicles.  Game is unbalanced and lopsided-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY    NEW-9/13/23 510am est-hit an enemy tank in the side with a depleted uranium round-tank survived then one shotted me to death.  TOTAL BS.  This game remains so fucked up it isn't funny.  NEW-9/13/23@ 1007am est-My Abrams M1 Battle Tank was just taken out by a Russian tanks machine gun, not the main gun, a fucking machine gun.  This game is horrible rigged and filled with bots and other BS like this.  Don't waste your money.  This game is nothing but frustrating and filled with cheats.   Follow On Oct 29, 2023:  I found a bunch of side games I liked but the tanks I purchased for the game are seriously flawed.  The arty tank M109 like would routinely overshoot the targets and when I tried scoot and shoot the barrel would bob for an eternity before settling down...needless to say I always died when this happened.  Also, I out ranged most other targets but the sight would not let you target accurately and the map doesn't suite these vehicles.  Major changes need to be done to fix these vehicles.  I do not recommend buying arty tanks...they are not effective and die routinely.  At this point I still have no reason to change my review.  There are better more accurate games than this.  Don't waste your money like I did.",1675465187,1698620671,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
The game itself is amazing. One of the best (if not the best) tank shooters ever. The game play is amazing and the diversity of vehicles is honestly stellar. Each tech tree has unique vehicles and its own play style, and you are guaranteed to enjoy at least one tech tree. 

Cons: 
The grind is insane. Literally the most grindy game ever. Its so hard to grind you pretty much have to pay for premium vehicles or a premium account. 
The game economy is broken. On of the problems with the grind is that tanks cost too much and you gain too little. 
The amount of people who can buy top tier vehicles as soon as they start can ruin the game because you either have a team full of basically bots, or you play against a whole team of basically bots. 


My final review is to not get this game unless you have an insane amount of time, patience, and/or money to spend on the game.",1692561991,1692561991,False,3,0,0.532896041870117188,0,True,False,False

Ok so. For me its now time to change the thumb on this review. I think Gaijing showed that they now care and want to change something. Some may think it is too soon but this is my decision after all. SL income fixed, more prem bonuses, Heli grind via ground, RP changes very soon. They are really working on the roadmap and I think this deserves recognition.

BIG UPDATE EDIT (14/06/2023):

Gaijin released their economy revision roadmap (https://warthunder.com/en/news/8319-development-war-thunder-changes-roadmap-en). For now I will still let the review on negative until first changes go through. But there is hope now and a will to change the game by the company.

--------------------------------

Original review

Ok so. I will also jump the train. My playtime here is deceiving. I have at least double if not triple the steam playtime in real (10k - 15k). I also still play it very actively. But not via steam. So me saying anything else than ""I love this game with every cell of my body and I am addicted"" would be a blatant lie. I also invested a lot of money already.

In short. This is a great game based on MANY factors. Variety, graphics, realism, teamplay, progression. I had so many great moments with this game and my friends that I could not list them all even with 100000 characters available.

BUT. This game, or rather the company, is walking a very dangerous path for a long time now. But now they seem to have decided to commit to it 100%. And this way is to milk the playerbase the worst way possible. New expensive premiums, less and less rewards every patch, economy system, repairs etc. Its slowly becoming a joke. And they need to pull the hand brake. And they need to pull it hard.

I am not writing this to hate on the game or the players. I am writing this because I love the game and I want it to thrive. But not via this way. Please Gaijin. Take this seriously. We are not asking to make this game 100% F2P. We know that you guys need to earn money. But this is too much. There must be other ways.",1684397614,1692181497,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

War Thunder is a great game if you play it for a long time and take advantage of sales when you can because putting some money into the game will help with the grind, which gets horrible at the higher end vehicles, especially without a premium (paid) account or premium vehicles to earn extra RP (or experience). You need to play this game for a long time to enjoy it. I usually play a lot for a few months then take a break from the game till a new update is soon to come, which is usually 3-4 months, maybe more. I would recommend looking at the top vehicles in each nation and choose one to grind out and just keep going until you get bored. Then take a break from the game so you can get back into it at a later date. I wouldn't say it's pay2win, but buying a priemium account or vehicle will make it much easier to grind out planes, and if you plan to buy a vehicle make sure it is something you like, do a little research and choose a higher tier vehicle so you can use it to grind out any vehicle effectively. I think the game will improve and playing with friends makes the game much better. I would recommend joining a group/clan to play with, if you're social enough. Hopefully Gaijin will make the grind easier as they add more vehicles, but at the moment it is a bit tasking to get high tier vehicles which is a turn off. So if you have the time and are willing to improve your skills and not complain about bias like a lot of other people this is a great game for you!",1488238058,1691114912,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gaijin has become one of the greediest companies I have ever known, they advertise new modern equipment that you wont be able to play unless you grind for over 2 years. They also made it so the only way you can progress is by buying multiple $70 vehicles, most of which is just a tech tree vehicle with a sightly different camo. I will play until my already paid for premium time runs out, then will likely quit the game all together unless things change for the better.

Well, it's not that simple. 

God where do I begin with this game. To start, the game-play itself, the visuals and the physics in general are all pretty outstanding for the most part. It's easy to pick up, challenging to master, and offers endless opportunities for skill expression. In general, the design of War Thunder as a game is good and its fun. 

BUT, my god Gaijin is the most disgusting company since EA. This company will advertise a 70$ premium vehicle, which is not even guaranteed to be good btw, put it at a battle rating where it stomps everything it sees, encouraging people to buy it, and then nerf it into oblivion. And there goes your money. Thank god a lot of the premiums are actually pretty bad. 

And then there's tech tree's. There's serious depth to War Thunder. So many different vehicles for so many different play style's. There's a vehicle in the game that you'll love, no matter how you play the game. However again, this company displays how disgusting it is. If you want supersonic jets, like the F-16, F-14, Mig-29, Mig-23, or maybe MBT's like the T-90 or Abrams, you should definitely run away as fast as you can. Most of the vehicles are locked behind the most abhorrent grind you'll ever experience in your life. And no, grinding Genshin Impact does not compare to what you'll experience here. In Air RB, if you play a basic plane without premium, and you get lets say, 3 kills in a 10 minute game. You'll get maybe between 5000-8000 Research points depending on the tier. And btw, 3 kills in Air RB is a good game and you won't get that consistently unless you are very skilled. And those 5000 research points? Yeah you need about 400 000 more of those to get the F-16. Oh and you need to have purchased and researched the previous vehicle in the tech tree. Oh and top tier vehicles are about a million silver lions btw. Without premium account to boost your research gain, it'll take you mmm.... probably between 400-600 hours to grind one tech tree and get one top tier vehicle. You want the rest? Another 400 hours. It is unbelievably painful, and it just gets worse the more they add to the game. So how you do make it less painful? YOU PAY THEM OF COURSE! Buy premium vehicles, buy premium account, buy the research points necessary.

You see the trend? You want to suffer? Play the game without paying a dime, and grind your soul into dust. You want to have fun? Well not only do you need the know-how so that you don't get absolutely slammed by experienced players, but you need to pay up. Buy buy buy. 

Guess what? Even after you've given away all the money you own after the divorce trial, there's still plenty of pain. The servers feel like they're run by Stan the delivery man running at full speed on a giant hamster wheel. You will experience sudden packet loss, be kicked out of games randomly because of latency, and sometimes what your shots fly right through someone because of your ping. 

What else? Well 80% if your playing alone your team will be garbage. A big problem with War Thunder is that you can buy vehicles at every tier. So what you get is teams where you have little Jimmy who's level 10 and bought a premium A-10 or Leopard 2 and gets crushed 5 seconds into every match cause he has no idea what he's doing. If you're easily frustrated by teammates in other games, this will infuriate you. 

Okay I think that covers all the bad things. Pffff, of course I'm kidding. I haven't even mentioned the crafting events yet. So there are these limited time events that come and go in War Thunder where you can get all kinds of rare and neat vehicles. Problem is, like the tech tree, you need to grind your soul into oblivion if you want any of them. If you do well enough in a game you'll get resources to craft components towards a coupon, which earns you the vehicle. To get just one of these coupons, you need to grind like 6 hours at least and do consistently well. Oh, and there is a cap on how many resources you can get daily btw, to make it even more painful. So the grind is painful, are the vehicles at least bad? Of course not! They are the most broken things in the game! (I still hate you BI-1...) It's awful, especially at the end of the event and everyone is spamming these broken vehicles. 

Alright, now I'm done ranting, truly. This game does this to you.

Now, War Thunder isn't a completely bad game. It's awfully run, but the game itself is great. The level of detail on every vehicle is incredible, and with the free HD textures DLC, it only gets better. The environment you battle on as well had impressive levels of detail, really bringing home the immersion. The mechanics are also great. Sometimes the physics behind shells and plane cannons are little suspicious and break, but 95% of the time, it really feels like a simulator game. Map design is also mostly up to standard. There are a few broken positions and bs camping spots, but all of them can be countered if you manoeuvre properly. The variety of game modes are nice and the April Fools event game modes are especially fun. So game-play wise, War Thunder is a great game.

SO. Should you play War Thunder? 

Well, like I said, that depends. 

Do you want a well maintained, well-run game with good balance, easy to learn mechanics and a well designed tech tree? Well run away as fast as you can, this isn't the game.

If you're patient, love tanks and aircraft, can keep a cool head amidst the suffering, and remain persistent despite how painful the game can be, then play. It has its quirks, but at the end of the day, War Thunder is a good game and I recommend it to you. Just be aware that it isn't perfect.

(edit- I can't remember when I made ^that review but on this front, lets talk.)

On my profile this game is highlighted as my all time favourite game and has my most hours spent on it. I literally play this game daily and I'm telling you this so you understand the gravity of my review.

I do not recommend this game to anyone.

I've spent so many of my years playing this game and its just get worse and worse and worse by each passing update and patch. Most recently suffering from them disabling the chat ""Due to the war"" listen. if people have an opinion on the war then thats fine we can mute them in game but instead of that you remove the one MOST IMPORTANT method of tactical feedback in the game basically making it borderline unplayable because you can't talk about combat situation which may turn the tide of that battle even if you are outgunned. I am not buying the war excuse Gaijin unless of course you as developers don't like the opinions of your clients because you literally haven't disabled emblems so you know we have russian tanks driving round with a Z on the side. The War isnt an excuse.

Then we get on to the modern era balancing or more appropriately lack there of. un-counterable distance heli and jet bombing. Explains itself.
ATGM'S which as a weapon system I have no problem with but when you get a BMP coming at you launching a full salvo of 4 ATGM'S in rapid succession like some fucking MEGA MOBILE KATYUSHA while you sit there and reload that one shot that you missed because you are bad just feels stupid. There is one certain jet that I'm sure most veterans of the game are aware of that could be no where near the battlefield and just be killing multiple tanks unchallenged unless one of you pulls out a jet which depends on if anybody actually has a jet mind.

I have put a good amount of money to this game myself because why not if you enjoy it right which I did at the time and even then the grind is somewhat unbearable at times but having said that in all honesty don't bother grinding too much because the fact of the matter is the low tiers aka the WW2ish era's of tanks are where the fun is and actually a good amount of balance is too. So I guess my advice is stick to WW2 era and dont bother with anything after the fact.

I do love this game and will continue to play it against my better judgement I guess until I fully break and just get rid of it. But do I recommend this game to anyone??

There might be some interesting mechanics, yes, but especially the placements of stupid bushes onto the vehicle completely ruins the game for me. It makes no sense gameplay wise and they even look silly. To get them - and I think they should not even exist in the game - you have to grind endlessly or buy them (pay to win).
Thank you devs for this mess. You ruined your game properly. Well done.

Another aspect is the supposedly realistic damage model. You get for example hit in the side of the barrel and your crew is getting killed by shrapnel. Try to find battlefield pictures of that one. I am working with metal. This is a highly unlikely scenario, especially when the breach is closed.
Or you hit an enemy in one of the rollers and the StuG turns still around without any problem and kills you with a one shot in the machine gun port or whatnot. We all saw so many pictures of tanks destroyed that way from WWII, didn't we. Not really, even if you try to dig for them. True, they did aim for weak spots like the turret ring and such, but they did not hit them consistently because of range accuracy etc. etc. 

There is a reason why people called it ""to be Gaijin-ed"" when you are killed in the most stupid and unrealistic way possible. There is for sure no shortfall in mind-bogglingly silly death scenarios.

I do not mind one shot kills, but Gaijin is mixing arcade elements with realism. Sorry, that does not work. On top of it they try people to incentivize to buy premium tanks. One major reason for the balance  problems. 

So enjoyable gameplay to getting raped by premium tanks that look like bushes. Again nice job Gaijin. Better find a more honest way for people to pay money for your games.",1640871517,1641370497,False,3,1,0.532544076442718506,0,True,False,False

There is a very low soft cap on the rewards you can get per battle. Whether you get 3 kills or 12 kills you will probably only see a 12% difference between the two. The grind is absolutely horrible. The economy is terrible as well. You'll see nations which cost 400%+ more to repair vehicles in compared to others. So, if you're halfway through a nation you're probably gonna be playing 100 battles to unlock one vehicle, and then you might not have enough money to actually buy the vehicle once you've unlocked it.

-Inconsistency of damage delt and received is through the roof
-hit registration and ""player sync"" just seem off at this point
-matchmaking puts you more and more often in a full uptier (even though the matchmaking list says there are more then enough players for your current tier; just don´t trust that list.)
-for some users (like me) some vehicles don´t get rendered in at all times they start to ""flicker"" or don´t even render in for a few seconds (this is a problem that existed for a while now; some Youtubers like Oddbawz have some good examples for that issue in their videos)
-servers ""feel"" like they lost a bit in performance; EU servers show you a decent to good ping with no package loss and you can still experience a bit of lag and rubberbanding (vehicles ""flying"" over hills or spinning on; most of the times at a distance around 800-1.200 meters)

So yeah, can´t recommend it again at this point. Started with some friends to play it again, but it´s the same cycle all the time: We play again, with some hope it will be more enjoyable this time and after about 2 weeks no one wants to play anymore (for 2 months or so), because everyone is fed up with the issues you encounter more and more often.",1485869086,1624551640,False,2,0,0.544072985649108887,0,True,False,False

Now even cruisers just randomly explode all the time from a random shot, skill doesn't matter. I had also been so excited I had paid for a ship so i could join the naval beta.

Their excuse was that the schedule was not set yet. I do not want to play with this ever changing boat. Please and thank you.
 The community is pretty toxic as well. I wouldn't bother asking for help, and teamwork? Nonexistant.
 The aircraft are still pretty decent, but the game mode i loved that they used to have quite a few of throughout the year (enduring confrontation), has been basically left behind because people whined about actually having to fly to the battlefield and/or fly back to land and repair/refuel.

War Thunder is a pay to gain an advantage game.

Like many others now, trying this shifty system of  subscriptions etc, it seems pretty effective, I see people in purchased planes all the time and you dont stand much chance in a 1 on 1 with most of them as most of them have a much heavier 1 second burst from the guns / cannons, so you in a crappy plane , you have paid nothing to develop yet, man your such a victim in this game, that is , right there the definition of pay to win or pay to gain an advantage, a definition well established from the days of DOS to current day.

Right, dont expect DCS levels of flight realism, totally different game, this game is the arcade version of flight sims, its brilliant in that regard.

What it does do is give kids a much better understanding of a 3d environment, and parents alike, lol, and it brings people together in large games where your almost never facing the same set of players twice, everyone gets jumbled in that server matching system from what I can tell.

Flying itself, for an arcade style game, is pretty damned impressive, I like that you can use a HOTAS joy or mouse or both and keyboard and all buttons Ive needed so far are bind-able, so thats a heap of great work in the backend of the game you dont usually see, done very well, almost perfect.
The game does not feel quite the same on a joystick, I find myself often just playing in the lounge on second PC with mouse, while youngling also uses the mouse, always, but when you fly with the joy, its not quite as simple to aim, but its still pretty good.

Just for pure fun, is a blast for say 2 hours a day, to get rid of that, I MUST FLY itch, lol, works wonders, that or you grab an RC plane / chopper like we have and hit the real skies !

Overall  I like the game, hate the business plan, but they did such a good job on the game itself, its still worth playing just to experience the WW2 planes and great modelling.

You can do all your planes up with custom paint jobs etc, you can buy with real money your countries own real flag for your planes etc.

There are some days you'll play the game and jump in to either tank or plane arcade battles and get shot once and die instantly anywhere you go.  Other days you'll do a lot better.  This game does a horrible job explaining anything that you really need to know when it comes to being a good fighter pilot or a tank commander and sometimes it's a fun fun ride.  Others it's just really frustrating.  The main problem with this game and I see other people still complaining about it is the ridiculous grind that Gaijin implemented.  I figure they changed things to be this way because of how greedy they secretly are but back in the early early days of this game you could play a few hours or less and unlock a low tier plane (or even tank when they first came out).  I remember this is how I unlocked the majority of my planes back in early Beta years ago.  The game was very fun then and I can't exactly put my finger on why.  The planes just flew better and it was easier to shoot other people down and dodge their shots, now everything feels frusterating.  That's what this game can be summed up in in one word, Frusterating.  Now you must spend what feels like years of your life to unlock maybe half of the planes and tanks that are unlocked?  If you don't want to spend a ton of money that is.  Too bad this game doesn't make the Free to Play model more viable because I'd play way more if that were still the case.  Gaijin basically changed things so if you are serious about playing more than a few planes or ships you really need to give them money, and I'm sorry but with all the things they've done over the years I'm not giving them any money whatsoever.I used to really love Arcade or Realistic or even Simulator battles in using Planes until they made some fundamental changes to everything flies and feels and then I stopped for the most part because using a mouse and keyboard to fly and aim just became too frusterating when it used to be so much fun.  I don't know why things changed over time because they don't do a good enough job of explaining hey this is how you fly well and dogfight against other people if you want to win with this countries planes or this country.  I usually jump into tank mode in either Arcade or Realistic because it's way more enjoyable than World of Tanks for me, the graphics are pretty nice and the way the shells either bounce off armor or go straight through and hit the crew is a lot of fun.  What isn't fun is every once in a while every time you spawn and immediately see an enemy you'll get one shot and die instantly because there's either some kind of aimbot going around or some people just literally spend all day playing this game because it's Free 2 Play/Pay 2 Play (in a way).If you plan to not spend any money then be prepared to put a ridiculous amount of hours into this game.  I've been playing since early beta what seems like many years ago (all off of Steam so my hours played is very small on here) and after hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game I've still barely unlocked Tier 4 of both planes and tanks.  It's unfortunate that the game used to be so much better back in the early days when the matchmaking and tier system was completely different but now it's based on a newer tier system with battle rankings for the vehicles that just don't make sense and it's made the game unfair and unfun to play most of the time.  Back when this game first came out it was incredibly fun but most of the time I just play a few games then realize why I stopped and delete it from my hard drive to save space for a different game.  Granted I still enjoy this more than World of Tanks or any other plane fighter game but still, I wish Gaijin actually listened to their community instead of being one of the most frusterating game developers on the planet to deal with.  They really do try to add awesome new stuff into War Thunder but they do the stupidest things without asking what we the player wants just so I'm sure they can try and make more money.  Also if you want to have an unfair advantage always play as the Russians since they're just overall better in most respects.  That's because the developers are Russian and they have this obsession with Russia being better!  I guess that's kind of like us Americans being like AMERICA, FUCK YEAH!

Review from me :
gameplay :
good kill cam like sniper elite (actualy destroy cam)
like real phisx, shoot at sloped armor and nothing happen
Realistic mode, you can shoot your allies, so feel free to kill you friend
Air mode is great, but i not to good at air mode, so ground is best
MUST know weakness every tank, so you can win easily

Feature :
much glitch in game, black texture popping some time (fix, never happen again)
price 1 tank (T29) = 1 new AAA game (WTF)
only 2 mode at ground force (air ??)
need more tank
Point : 7/10
must try

Update 24/04 (FIX) :
T34 no explosive filler, and AP seem weak, 120mm @ 240mm
IS-6 OP tank, need some tweak
US now better BR , but still weak
Gernany now have trouble, IS-6 !

Update 03/06/17 (FIX):
Now game near balance, but if new tank come, balance is far again.
IS-6 now weaker than before, and m103 more stronger turret
Germany have little explosive filler, no too OP. NEED fix at higher tier like Tiger 2 H 10.5cm
need to fix RU-258 (?) too fast and too strong ammo at its BR
I hope gaijin make fake tank, like world of tank have lots of tank

Update 04/12/17:
all going better, but at BR 4.7 - 5.7 British are worst, huge ammo and high penetration not help much, just dont use BRITISH, you will suffer on easy killed",1486703665,1588265945,False,0,0,0.543870747089385986,0,True,False,False

This game had so much potential but was wasted on a greedy company like gaijin who cares about money more than quallity or listening to the player base. The only saving factor of it is that no one else has made a game quite like it. Once I see a competent studio release such a game I will uninstall War Thunder that instant. War Thunder has a horrible grind for new vehicles that keeps getting added to every 1-2 months with new broken vehicles. They incentivise you to pay money to reduce the grind and yet don't fix the existing problems. The company is so greedy that they will not even stop at installing practically malware on your computer ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/5j221b/gaijinnet_agent/ ) that my best guess when running in the background tracks your data and uses it to advertize even more or sell to other companies for even more of a profit. This is a game riddled with problems that the development company doesnt bother fixing because they are too busy trying to make get more money out of the users whatever way they can. i would never recommend this game in the current state even after just going out of beta stage a few months ago. The top tier gameplay is tough to get to and broken to all hell once you get there. Avoid this game if you can.

If you have time to grind all day, then you can enjoy getting one shotted by invulnerable shermans or tigers. Grinding tier through tier takes FOREVER and the only sense of acomplishment you will feel is when you are the only one who will be trying to achieve anything within the game. 90% of the time your teammates will be camping somewhere trying to get snipes while you and maybe 1-2 more people will try to complete the objective. 
Havent played airplanes since 2014, i dont care for them anymore they are broken and unfair still

After 2 years and 800 hours of additional gameplay (1470 hrs total), I've decided to revisit my review. 

Long story short, this game has undergone quite a few changes, enough so that I would, and have, recommended it to friends.

The balance issue is still very questionable, however it seems that now the balance issue depends on what tier you are playing at, and seems to be more focused around single overpowered vehicles at a given tier, rather than entirely overpowered tech trees based on a single nation. 

There have been a TON of vehicles added, this also helps the balancing due to variety. 

Grind is still long and the purchase of premiums is still a massive advantage.

Although there have been a few maps added and quite a few vehicles, there are really no new game modes worth noting, and Air Realistic Battles needs a major overhaul. Also, many of the consistent annoyances, such as spawn camping, is still an issue. I will say that they did a very good job with the new spawn points system.

Overall, i think that with the new updates Gaijin seems to be doing many things well. Other than the occasional broken vehicle that gets released, most of the new vehicles are a welcomed addition. I do like to see Gaijin focusing on adding additional content, however, I would like to see them go back and fix some of the lingering problems, and adding more game modes.

Also, if AA vehicles (excluding the German 88mm) were half as effective at killing tanks in real life, as they are in this game, then tank combat never would have developed in the way that it did, and paradoxically, this game probably wouldn't exist. 

------------------------Gonna leave my old review below------------------------


619 hours as of this review.... I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to play as the Americans. If you want to munch on American tanks and planes, then by all means give it a try. 

Pros
- graphics
- realistic tank/plane models
- solid maps
- good gameplay mechanics
- free (kinda)

Cons
- absolutely no balance between nations (Germans and Russians are clearly superior in almost every way)
- the grind for new vehicles is insane once you reach mid tiers
- People who pay for premium vehicles have a massive advantage over the people who actually do the grinding
- Can make you want to break your keyboard in half

At first, War Thunder is an extremely fun game, looks great, plays great. I play primarily as the Americans (both Air and Ground), although i have spent a good bit of time playing as British planes, and German tanks. After spending a lot of time on this game, and getting past the first couple tiers of vehicles, you start realizing that Russian aircraft are performing physic defying manuevers, and German and Russian tanks are massively superior to their American and British counterparts. I had a load of fun with this game at first, but after putting a lot of time and effort (and a little of my money, because the grind was way too difficult without it) I have to say that I am deeply dissapointed with where this game led me. 

Basically, if you want to play as German or Soviet's, you will have a blast munching on the squishy American and British tanks, and sluggish American planes. I would love to give this a Thumbs up, because I have put so many hours into it and had a some fun for awhile, but due to the imbalance of the rosters, I cannot say that I am currently happy with this game.",1488266619,1552347166,True,1,0,0,27,True,False,False

My primary gripe is that with Gaijin, money is more important than gameplay. Do not expect to reach top tier for free unless you are prepared to drop out of college or quit your job to deal with the MASSIVE grind that happens starting tier 5.  Another blatant example of desperate cash grab is that every patch there is a new very expensive and very powerful premium vehicle (T29, IS6, Ru251, OBJ 120...) added to the game that totally disrupts the meta for a month or two until sales have become satsifactory and Gaijin finally decides to balance it. I know this because I bought the IS6 when it came out and it was nothing short of DISGUSTING. 
The latest questionable move by Gaijin has been introducing the XM1 abrams prototype at BR 9.0 even though they said they would never introduce premiums into top tier. For all the people unfamiliar withthe game that would be like Wargaming introducing a regular tier 9.5 premium for 60 bucks.

I'm a bit sad that realism, gameplay and balance are not the top priority anymore, but I can still totally recommend playing War Thunder as it's an incredible and unique game. To be honest all that it really needs is a worthy competitor so Gaijin can start taking better care of their playerbase!

Listen, I love warthunder... It does alot right, however:
Warthunder is heading down a path that worries me. Every patch they add a couple of vehicels that look, and sound great but break the game balance. Balance as of 6/13/18 is fucked. Now they are adding csgo style loot boxes ontop of the standard f2p microtransactions.

My hope is that with the upcoming release of naval forces and World War mode that the game will recieve a new breath of life allowing players to experance the game in a new way.
The current game modes are getting old and boring, the game is too much about the grind.

WT was a free play game that didn't feel like a F2P game.

A grindy but addictive, keyboard/mouse favouring flight/tank simulator that was fun for casual and sim PvP players alike.

Unfortunately becoming more grindy, less simulator oriantated with every iteration as Gaijin copy other, less success F2P/mobile games, thinking they'll lever more profit (they seem to think they're the only game in town).

Worth a look, if you haven't been spoiled by it's previous/better iterations better tech tree progression/rewards/sim support.

[b][u]History[/u][/b]

I first tried WT as a joystick controlled flight simulator in Sept 2013 but found it difficult to controll/setup and didn't play beyond the tutorial.

I came back a year later (Dec 2014), when the US tank tree was added (bought a £3.75 M3A1 Stuart Starter Pack).

After +110 hours of 'free' gameplay (in 6 weeks), I felt Gajin deserved support, so purchased a £18 'value' Attacker pack (since removed) that included a tier II vechicle (Hs-129B-2), 2000 Gold and a weeks premium time.

I enjoyed the casual gameplay and found the dailly 1st win, 2x bonus for each nation addictive (since removed).

As ground force advancement was slow and grindy, I switched to playing air but only found control  acceptable once I gave up using joystick/trackIR and switched to mouse/keyboard.

I continued playing for a couple of years, earning 'premium' vehicles in weekend events/challenges (i.e. kill 240 player aircraft with a tier III, etc.) and buying the odd 'value' pack as my gameplay hours and fancy took me to support Gaijin.

Gaijin for their part, made progress slower (while saying it's better), removed daily 2x bonus and replaced them with 'loot boxes', reduced/removed simulator battle modes, etc. etc.

Todate I'll have spent around £110 and played 780 hours in WT which I consider reasonable value over the course of 2 years.

I uninstalled WT when I found I couldn't post on the WT forums because I wasn't playing enough, despite being a paying customer. If they don't want my feedback, I didn't want their 'store' on my computer.

I calmed down and reinstalled a few months later, to see if the game had improved when a new WT update came out (and to activate an 2016 E3 bonus pack).

At the time of this review, Steam shows 1030 hours but I don't know where the extra 240 hrs has come from as I only logged in and played a couple of hours at best in the final 6 months.

Perhaps Steam thought WT was playing due to Gajin's P2P client when Steam was loaded, either way I noticed WT's hours kept increasing even though I wasn't playing.

Uninstalled a 2nd time when I found a Gajin update had installed and enabled a P2P torrent client into windows (GJ Gaijin.net agent) and started using internet bandwidth without user notification.

Since removing WT, my hours have remained static.

Addicting, has that grind and aticpation to it.

Has tanks, aircraft and boats (soon)


Cons:

Can get repititve

Requires alot of hardware to run at decent graphics and 60 FPS, unless you are willing to take the risk of either playing at low FPS at high graphics or low graphics and at high FPS.

It's a fairly large game. It requires alot of space, it's 20.94 GB for me.",1488225974,1488225974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To put it another way,  I don't play CoD, CS, Overwatch, WoT, etc, I don't even PvP in MMORPGS, so bear in mind this is the first game like this that I have really played since Battlefield 2.

What I like:
The game is free, and within reason you can eventually grind your way to just about any vehicle except for some of the super premium ones.  I don't play every day so I don't mind the grind.  To me, I need to get better at playing this games with the planes/tanks I have, more powerful ones (like my Fw190, for example) I'm just not ready for.  Other planes and players at that teir are way too good.*

The game runs very, very, well on just about any hardware that has a 3d accelerator in it, and acceptably on even more.  Consider my i5 laptop, a 4300U @ 15Watts (Dell 2n1).  At lowest settings, @ 720p (which still look on par to at least a mobile game) you'll get 30fps+ while flying.  Tanks however, cut your framerate in half.  (Unplayable).   On the other side, my little RX 460 4GB (Sapphire Nitro) and my old sandy bridge can do 4K (3840x2160)  at 'high' preset (though I untick FXAA) in the 50-60 flying and about 30-60 tanks.  I've never observed any frame issues but the game's built-in fps meter never seems to go below the 30s at the worst case.  I do get an occaisional random chop, but it isn't the video card.  In the most furious of fighting it seems completely fine.  1440p I can pretty much do whatever I want besides Anti-alias and 1080p is even better.
The bottom line here is you most likely have the hardware to run this if you even have Steam installed at this point.

I can't speak for the community, I don't play with a headset, just an anonymous drone.  What little is actually said on the in-game chat is usually civil, the worst might be someone grumbling about getting rammed, it is usually eerily silent.

The mouse-key controls are very simple, planes are very simple to fly. Tanks are simple as well but I hope your eyes are really good :).

The matches aren't always balanced super-well but that's warfare, I get wiped out fast some games, I do well in others, it is just how it is.  I've never felt  'cheated', though often confused,  when I'm certain I should be burning someone down.  It's on me though, my ping is fine ;)    I generally only play Arcade against people with some 'Realistic' training with AI.  The matches are very short so you can rip through several.  I don't play a lot, I'm not very good, but even I can manage to do some damage.

Other than time this game requires no real investment. The interface can seem overwhelming at first, but it shakes all out very straightforward in the end.

Graphically, I think it looks great and as I mentioned before doesn't require a great deal to push it.  (I ran it on a Bay Trail atom quad core..., it got 7-15fps in the air :P)   When you're in a really good dogfight, or artillery is falling around you and you're holding a position outnumbered as time is ticking down it really all just clicks and it is why I keep coming back.

There are ways to play against bots in some fairly fun missions if you don't want to play online at all, but you have to grind your way through some planes to get them and the easiest way to do that is to grit your teeth and work out some strategies on how to stay alive :)  In other words, if you can't hit a soaring plane, bomb the crap out of what you can.

The only other game advice I could give is:  Stick with your team, lone-wolfing gets you killed, and be patient.  Don't take things like lead indicator reticles and green crosshairs as a given.

The final point, for a casual fan, is the microtransactions.  I have been playing for about 120 hours since October, I have never paid a dollar.  Some of the items you can purchase feel fairly reasonable once you understand what you are paying for, but I don't see the need myself.  The game has a currency system, the most important one being silver lions.  You need them for everything including re-arming your vehicles.  Generally, you have to be pretty terrible to not earn silver lions to keep yourself afloat and have enough to buy upgrades.  You can get yourself into a situation though where you've run out.  You can either buy some for a few dollars that would tide me over a few months.  Or, what I actually do is just try a different country or switch to the free-to-repair teir 1 planes and remember how much I enjoyed biplanes.  I'm a much better tanker so I'll also just get more eagles that way.  You'll get buffs literally every day that also increase how many lions you can earn in a match.
The bottom line here is, if you're good, you'll never have to worry about it.  If you're OK, you'll probably never have to worry about it.  If you're not very good, you'll probably have to get a bit better, or grind a little longer.

For some of you this might also matter.  If you have a mouse with thumb/pinky buttons, you can fly entirely 1-handed.  If it has enough buttons probably drive a tank as well.  The mouse aim (some purists hate this) is extremely friendly and trust me the most novice of you will work it out.  Flying isn't very hard but precise shooting is going to need practice. 

I've paid absolutely nothing for nearly 120hrs that I've really enjoyed because of how accessible and attractive this game is.  The grinding is definitely grinding, the places do get repetitive, but the players don't.  Every tense 10 minutes or so is very different.  I recommend anyone even vaguely interested give it a look.  I haven't had this much fun with a flight sim since Tie Fighter or with a tank since Battlezone and I could never get into the heavy sim stuff and I can't do 360-headshots.",1488224126,1488224159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gaijin doesn't want to fix things, it wants money and for this they've made the game so unbalanced, so grindy... that if you want to progress you HAVE to throw money at the game.

So it's basically getting worse and worse, people get  pissed at how unbalanced it is, they leave, Gaijin then instead of fixing things and hoping people come back, compresses the matchmaker even more so it gets even more unbalanced, so more people leave...

Oh boy, where do I start with this beautifull creation?
War Thunder, a WW2 based aerial and ground combat simulator. Russian bias is known to haunt anyone that ever plays any other country than Russia. This game has been my favorite game for years, just like TF2. The historical accuracy of this game is amazing. I've learned more WW2 facts from playing this than from school. The game is quite balanced, except for Russian Bias. You can progress through the entire Tech Tree without selling a single vehicle or paying a single penny, as its vehicle slots mainly focusses on crew, rather than vehicle. You can have multiple vehicles on a single slot, but only one active on a slot at the time. Only in Arcade Air and Ground Battles and Realistic Tank Battles can multiple vehicles be used. The community and its modders are amazing aswell (Except for the PS4 inferior race xD)

The gameplay is fast paced . I found myself playing the Arcade mode most of the time because of the amount of crazy battles and fun you can have. If your not into the Arcade, the Simulation mode is fun too. This requires you to be more strategic about fuel, shooting, and taking damage. The upgrade tree is a very nice addition aswell. But it doesn't overpower basic planes. For example: a non-upgrade plane can still suffice against a maxed out plane. I didn't have as much fun with the tanks as I did with the planes. I feel that's partly to do with the fact that there are alot of other tank games. But there are very few good multiplayer airplane fighting games out right now.

Russian bias just like any other game made by Russian devs. The Russian planes all 1shot every other plane, and the Russian tanks armor is literally impenetrable at any tier-tier match up.

The devs also KGB any posts that say anything remotely negative about the game on forums- including account deletion, even if they've paid money. If they didn't have a clause in their ToS that basically says ""we can be complete douches"", that'd be fraud.

If you do play prepare to get ""uptiered"" nearly every game which means you'll be fielding your weak little newbie tank against far superior vehicles, including premium P2W tanks. This means you'll be getting one shotted from across the map by tanks you can't even penetrate from the rear if you were dry humping them.

America, British, and Japanese tanks are all severely underpowered with German tanks being mediocre and Russian tanks dominating every match. (The developers are Russian so...go figure?)

As WWII vehicle combat games go, this is really my only experience. Haven't played Word of Tanks, Warships, or whatever the airplane version is, so take that for what it's worth. That said, I haven't felt the need to look anywhere else, this game definitely scratches that itch for me. That said, it’s not perfect. My biggest gripe is matchmaking. It’s quite shit IMO. I believe the early matchmaking was set up when there weren’t as many vehicles in the game, and they were worried that there wouldn’t be enough people online to make games. The response was to set a rather wide spread of vehicle “Battle Rating” that would be able to fight together. The result is that you can often be in a game against enemies with armor you can’t punch through or whose guns can one-shot-kill you. Personally, I believe there are enough vehicles in the game and enough people playing currently that the matching making could be constrained a bit. Some other minor annoyances: it can a bit of a grind later on in the game to get the high-level vehicles, there could be a little more variety in game modes, or being able to choose the game modes/maps you want to play, and some countries’ vehicle trees aren’t as flushed out as others. Overall I think it’s a great game. For one, it’s free. Even if you don’t get hours of entertainment out of it like me, you won’t be out anything so it’s a safe bet. I’ll say that I do not have a premium account, nor do I buy any of the in-game extras for cash, but I don’t really feel like I’m missing any part of the main game. It’s not pay-to-win IMO, with camouflage being a possible exception, as it can give you an advantage in Realistic Battles (but I play arcade so it’s whatever). Using cash can help alleviate that grind, but again, that’s not pay-to-win. Realism is top notch with vehicles and weapons acting exactly like you’d expect. I don’t think you could find anything better out there that doesn’t sacrifice the fun factor. More stuff gets added all the time to keep things fresh, with Naval Vessels on the horizon. So yeah, solid recommend from me. I would buy this game if it cost $60 if included more of the premium stuff.",1487892670,1487892670,True,1,0,0.496688753366470337,0,True,False,False

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.

INGREDIENTS:

1 c. unsalted butter
2 c. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. flour
1 c. cocoa powder
4 eggs
1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella
5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbled


DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.
4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)
6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)
7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.

The system for penetration tanks are at best random if not broken. And doesn’t make any sense. (since it doesn’t work) and feels like winning or losing in CS GO LOTTO.

Ghost shell. If you are in a fast tank and fire at the move or move the turret fast to a target the changes is that the shell will miss or disappear to the fact the server doesn’t register that you hit the target. 90 % changes that you are dead since you now have a 10 to 30 second reload.

Battle ratting is at best broken. This do to the fact players are leaving the so higher tire players is match up with lower tire and gets a.. R…

Introduction to rockets aim tanks + aim bots = FUCKED OVER AND OVER AND OVER. I have been killed in my spawn by a rocket from across the map. Where the player could have seen me on raider or visual.

Since players are leaving the game the cost for tanks/plains etc have gone up a lot. Even the premium account. And you need a premium account to grind to all of the tanks/plains etc. 
A good example of this was when they introduce Bushes on the tanks. (Yes you read right) as camuflation for the tanks. They were expansive as hell. (gold eagles,) and they only worked on one tanks.

The game isn’t fun anymore, it feels like a choir. And As you play you get frustration and angry do to the fact the developers don’t fix problems that should have been addressed years ago.",1486845627,1487541356,False,3,0,0.466101676225662231,0,True,False,False

THE RECOMMENDATION IS THERE FOR THE DEVELOPERS AND NOT THE PLAYERS!

I personally love this game and i would give it a big yes but there are things what make me angry as hell.

1st problem: The matchmaking is unfair, having enemies 1br rank upper than your top tank means you will have a really bad time. They need to change the matchmaking into having enemies max 0.5br higher than your top tank.

2nd problem: Grinding hell, this wouldnt be too big problem for me, but seeing max upgraded tanks still earning research points what goes out of the window is painful. Please let us use up atleast 30% of that earned rp to tank research.

3rd problem: The spawn camping. Its hellish to see that you cant fight because 3 tank destroyers managed to camp up at spawn and kill you as fast as you appear. This could be easily fixed if they would change the spawn points into a wide spawning area what MARKS enemies on it.",1487439404,1487439404,False,2,0,0.498188406229019165,0,True,False,False

The biggest problem that the game has is that the Battle Rating system is very much a broken system with how it is currenty implemented. What the Battle Rating system is for those who don't know is the game's way of determining which aircraft or tanks the vehicle you currently have selected will fight with a 1.3 spread for aircraft and (iirc) a 1.0 spread for tanks, with a  spread from 1.0 to 9.0 for aircraft and 1.0 to 8.0 for tanks. Now in all fairness this is a system that I can kinda get behind because it's a flexible one. However it's an old one and the game is currently suffering from an overcompression problem. Simply the game currently has so many new vehciles compared to when the system was first introduced that it is incredibly difficult to balance the game. This wouldn't be so much a problem if Gaijin would just increase the BR spread to 15 for aircraft and possibly 12 or so for tanks. However, we currently are seeing a situation where on one occasion, my Sea Hurricane Mk.IC was facing Yak-3Ps. Extreme example yes but it was possible for it to happen. In top tier jet battles it's possible to be flying the MiG-9 but then be forced to face F-86F-2 Sabres and Hawker Hunters. Then there are times where Gaijin will give Battle Ratings to aircraft that just make no sense flat out. The F2H-2 Banshee (or F2HIV or F2H-2 Banshit as it was nicknamed in the game) originally had a BR of 6.7. Yes, a Korean Era jet fought against late war and post war propeller aircraft. Now since then the aircraft has been uptiered to 8.0 and while it's competitive at that BR it's not over powered. Now you can say that they fixed that issue which they.... kinda did. However the fact that they thought that it was a good idea at all....

Now damage models. This is an area where Gaijin has just been flat out inconsistent. Let's take the bombers for example. The B-17 is an aircraft that was quite durable in real life and in the game it can be quite durable, but then in some patches it turns into gas soaked tissue paper. This isn't something that's limited to US bombers btw, it happens with the Germans, Russians, British, and even Japan in some cases. During one patch it became so bad that it became necessary for your team to have a dedicated bomber hunter, Say an Me 410 or a 109 with it's gun pods. Possibly the Yak-3P with it's 3 centrally mounted cannons or the Typhoon for the British with 4 20mm cannons. However sometimes this didn't even help. The times where it didn't were when the guns on the aircraft became absolute shit in certain patches, usually one gun specifically more than others. One patch it was the British 20mm guns, another it was (and sometimes still is) the Russian 23mm, the German Mk103. This however isn't necessarily from Gaijin intentionally nerfing the guns into the Earth but as a result from them fixing something totally unrelated (conintued in next paragraph). 

War Thunder currently suffers from a problem with spagetti coding where the game might recieve changes to say the thermodynamics, but this fix will cause the Type 5 30mm cannons on the R2Y2 jets in the Japanese tree to become absolute sparklers and do no damage at all, sometimes it makes the US .50 caliber do nothing. 

Gaijin also has a tendancy to overcompensate fixes. Say the MiG-15bis and F-86F-25 Sabre for this argument. In one patch, the MiG-15bis will have better energy retention than the Sabre but the Sabre will have better agility. One day Gaijin decides to buff the energy retention of the MiG-15bis and drop it on the Sabre, the problem with this is that sometimes it's TOO MUCH. Now you have a Sabre that can't fight MiGs. To help counter this they'll then bring in the energy retention of the MiG, up it on the Sabre, but then make the Sabre more agile. NOW the Sabre can dance around the MiG and dodge it's attacks with little trouble. 

I'll end the review here but this isn't getting into other issues that the game has in it's mechanics and Gaijin has a VERY checkered history as far as public relations which can actually make EA and Konami of all companies look good. I simply can't recommend playing this game in it's current state and until Gaijin gets it's act together and fixes themselves and the game. However, I'm not sure if that will ever happen.

Free play means progressing with such slowness that ever getting into the top 5 in any battle is simply a pipe-dream. Your maximum points will be in the 1000 range whilst some are getting 6000+.
Your progress with aeroplanes as a free-player is hampered on purpose by the ""lack of convertible RPs"" bug which has persisted to the point of making it obvious that it is, in fact, a feature. If you get beyond the first 3-4 ranks of planes then you show a dedication that I (at some 70-80 hours) do not have.

All that said, despite some jarring modelling issues (Spitfire turning not as good as Messerschmitt for example) the game itself is pretty good. Physics is OK and the one-on-one battles are fun. Bombing is a tedious chore that is required to win in many of the random battles.

Some tips:
Do not bother bombing anything as the points gained from this are stupidly low compared to killing a plane, let others do this.
Hang back and let the newbies get into the scrum-o-death that happens in every game, pick off stragglers.
Choose your targets from the ordered points list, don't bother going after the pay-for players as they will kill you in one shot - not sure how much real fun that is for them.

At first, planes and tanks were matched fairly so there were never strongly one sided fights but after many updates and purchase packs, allied vehicles and aircraft had become extremely over powered. More often than not updates would include very good U.S and Russian tanks or planes but would either fail to provide any German equivalent all together or would give some useless POS. On top of this, the unlock system for allied trees gives you much better vehicles and planes early on and therefore provide faster rewards to players. Most players end up defaulting to the Russian airforce or army strictly because they do not have to go through the time it takes to be rewarded in the German and Japanese airforce and army. Unless you are very good, you will have difficulty playing in arcade aircrat games in that over powered Russian planes will have even better performance due to the lack of physics. I suggest sticking to Realism mode for land and air because it is more of a test of skill rather than plane. Over all, I suggest the casual ww2 air and tank battle fan to try it out because its free but anyone more interested in realism should look towards a more simulation type game.",1487132502,1487132502,True,1,0,0.501061558723449707,0,True,False,False

Well, unless this should be a review I guess I do. 

First things first: Buy it! 
If you haven't already there is nearly no point in not buying it. The Graphics are phantastic to look at, the detail on every vehicle in this game is just amazing and with this I mean the attention to detail relaied onto the original vehicels. 

You have severel game modes which allow you to get used to the game and the vehicletype (beginner middle expert). A turtorial for every vehicle type is available:too.
So you find yourselve in fourios battles in no time. 

The only thing I could think of which is a bad thing might be the possebility to buy certain tanks,ships and aircrafts. Those machinery is normaly a littlebit stronger and better in every way. So if you're a player like me that has it's very intense times playing it, just to leav it alone the next months you wind up with some decent armor and weaponary but if your paths cross one of this buying badboys...you should be hit reverse or getaway in the clouds. :D

Well than this is the game for you.
(sort of)

As of writing this coment this is my most played game with 467 hours (1,681,200 seconds (man I love the calculator on pc (#pcmasterrace))) many of my so called friends have asked me how I have played this game for so long. They tell me that it is poorly ballenced, pay to win, and extortionatlly grindey. 

My reply is ""I loaded up a realistic battle in my panther D. proceaded to sit in a bush for 15 minutes. got one shoted by a t-34-85 I did not see right beside me. and was still more intence than the disapointment I am to my parents.""

You see any old scrub can load up their WoTs and Baffel Fields jump in a tank and do well. But it takes a real 'man' to do well in warthunder. shure you can pay money to put a bush on the frount of your tank, or send your crew (totlers) to day care to make your tank ""stronk"". 
BUT.....






This game is slow both in grinding  out new tanks and in the actuall shootie bits. the stock grinds on higher tier tanks is  admittally painfull and it takes a special type of person to compleate it. oh shoot their is a word for it.....




Oh right 
""masochist"" that's it.


but all in all warthunder is a good tank game.

Plains are rubbish (ie I is bad at them)
Tiger is best girl
Techarch > Panther
The gameplay is quite rewarding

Grind, grind, grind, grind some more. If you have ridiculous amounts of free time to dedicate to one game, then this is the game for you!

I picked up War Thunder back in it's early stages. When it first came out the unlocks were attainable. You could progress up the ladder and unlock new skins, planes, and crew upgrades. After putting a couple dozen hours into the game, I got distracted by other releases and came back to the game shortly before they released ground forces. That's when I realized what a miserable experience it had become.

You CAN work your way through the ladder now without having to dump money into the game. Will you ever get there in your lifetime? No, not for a casual player such as myself. You have to dedicate hours and hours a day just to gain those measly XP points and Silver Lions to get to the next tier. Basically this game would have to replace your full-time job.

The game is fun. I especially liked the fighter planes. The fast-paced dogfights and dive bombing runs are a BLAST!!! Using a bomber was a chore because of the lack of support from fellow teammates who often left you to die while you are trying to bomb the objectives. I also enjoyed the ground units. Learning the view controls and ammo types made a gigantic difference in my scoreboard ranking, so I would recommend reading up a bit on all of the controls/ammo types etc.

Now the bad, the really bad. The game is completely Pay-to-Win. Some may disagree, but I am sorry that is the case. Sure, you do 'have"" to earn the RP before you can pay money to rank up, but you still can PAY MONEY TO RANK UP. You can also pay real money to unlock better planes, XP boosts, oh and those pesky Golden Eagles. See, by paying money for Golden Eagles you can use them to upgrade your crew. By upgrading your crew, you have an advantage on the battlefield over anyone who hasn't paid money. You see where I am going here? You can pay REAL LIFE money for an in game ADVANTAGE. That just sucks. The sour taste left in my mouth was enough to make me uninstall. Let's not even talk about the app where you can sell your soul for in game currency.

The que for joining a realistic tank battle is usually a good 5 to 10 minutes long; and if you're lucky you'll get about the same amount of game time. Mostly you won't though, because the slightest mistake is punished harshly and the first team to make a couple of mistakes gets steamrolled. So it's more like waiting 10 minutes for a game, then enjoying about 30 to 60 seconds of actual play; maybe a couple more minutes if you spend some time driving around looking at scenery.

Arcade tank battles are total crapshoots. There is no teamwork, and barely any way to coordinate with your team; *if* anyone outside of your max 4-player squadron bothers to pay attention to the map pings. Maps have no real rhyme or reason to them; objectives seem to be placed in the middle of nowhere, and the current reward system actively discourages players from going after them. Expect to lose a *lot*, and suffer in massive frustration as your tank gets shot to pieces because arcade mode reveals enemies nearby and provides aim-assistance.

Air battles are not much better; with the same random match-making, lack of teamwork, and objectives discouraging strategic or cooperative gameplay.

On top of this, Gaijin's business model actively tries to make you spend money on useless crap. Players are provided with mediocre rewards from just playing, some of which are actually unusable without paying money to use them in what is the least cost-effective aspect of the game. And of course, Gaijin installs a seperate program that manages updates; without clearly asking for permission. Wouldn't be so bad except this program cannot be uninstalled by accessing the computer's programs control panel nor through itself, and must be manually deleted.

For those looking for the Arcadey or middle ground part of the games, this one is not for you. With the amount of hours I have in this game I feel like I can have an opinion. When I first started this game I forget how many years ago a little bit before 1.35, so I cannot comment on what the grind was like in the 1.2x's. I started off in Arcade mode like most people do. 
     I did not spend long in Arcade mode however and quickly moved on to Realistic Mode, back when it was still called Historical Battles. I spent a lot of time in that mode using a joystick. But after quite a bit of battles in Historical Battles(now RB), I realized that I was completely outclassed by mouseaimers in everything except for manouvering. Sure, you could a majority of the time outfly mouseaimers in your plane, but you would never hit anything because everything was so wobbly even with good settings. 
     All that work on par with someone with a keyboard and mouse was just not cutting it for me, so I moved to Simulator battles. And I loved it. It was my favorite mode of pretty much any non-racing game I had ever played. All of the minor issues, to me at least, like flight models and and small tier differences were balanced out by the fact that it was so fun to completely outfly someone when you were both in cockpit view and shoot them down with many different types of planes. The sudden death aspect of the old Sim Battles were some of the most heart racing 30-45 minutes per-match that I have played. The feeling of fighting off a 1v3 with tracers flying all around you and shooting down at least 1 and forcing the other 2 to break off while you limped your smoking plane home were unmatched. You knew that by getting one of their planes and returing yours to base brought your team that much closer to victory. And then that's when it happened. Enduring Confrontation. 
     When it came out the Sim community was somewhat small, but the ability to get in queue with literally any plane you wanted and at least fly a game with bots on your team gave you something to do. But Enduring confrontation split the community between regular que and EC. This was not horrible as I could just play regular SB. Eventually they completely scrapped regualy SB for EC and that's when I started playing less. My first and main issue with the current iteration of SB is the requirement before you even join a game to have a plane of a specific Battle Rating  in your line up. This would not be a problem with me if it wasn't for the fact that it was perfectly fine before when you didn't need a specific BR to queue. The second issue I have with EC is that you have to pay silver lion (currency used to by planes and crew and things) just to fly your plane. This would be like paying a repair bill for a car just to drive it out of your driveway. For a lot of the higher tier planes, you need multiple plane kills just to go even. What is even better is that everytime you crash or get shot down you have to pay to take it up again. I would be fine with this if it costed nothing to fly the first time. I would play Sim tanks, but that in itself is not very sim like either, with the commander view being 3 feet over the turret, and no actual interior views. I refuse to play RB in any sense because I refuse to resort to using a mosue just to be competitive, plus it's just not as fun compared to how SB used to be to me. I see ships are coming, but I do not see them letting players use anything larger than maybe Destroyer Escorts, so that has no interest for me. I could overlook the grind if the Sim gameplay was fun for me, but it is not anymore. The Sim queues are pretty much empty and there is nothing else left for me to do besides look at the pretty war planes and fly the ones I have unlocked vs AI and solo in the test-flights. I would unlock more, but I would need to play to do that, and I do not see me doing that anytime soon.
     SUMMARY: If you are looking for a game where you can immerse yourself in all sorts of aircraft from pre-war to the Korean War from 1st person look elsewhere. This is just how I feel about the game now, and I realize reviews are completely subjective and other people may have other opinions and maybe even the opposite of mine. But I have put many hours into the game and speed a bit of money on it, so it is sad to see Gaijin neglect the Sim aspect of their game so much. Sure, bomber cockpits are nice for immersion sake, but it's a 1 step forward, 4 steps back kind of deal.

First of all, it took a while to get into a game. On other steam games it's automatic, and your just in a game. I don't know if it was something with my computer, but it kinda impacted my experience.

Second off, I uninstalled the game, and it still shows the updates screen, and I still get updates. Once again, not sure if there was something wrong with my computer, but it made me hate the game even more.

Finally, I think the game should have a campaign mode or something. All you do is play multiplayer with a bunch of people with way higher levels than you. I think that problem was with the game, putting me in a game with people that have higher levels than me.

I started playing a few months ago. The game is insanely addictive and very fun to play. Yes, it takes time and effort to unlock the higher tier tanks (Don't be expecting to get the Tiger on the first day), but the grind to unlock new tanks is both fun and rewarding. Every kill on this game feels like a real achievement, made all the sweeter by an x-ray vision animation of your round penetrating the enemy tank, showing the damage that you cause to the enemy tank. 

The tank models themselves are beautiful and extremely well detailed. The armour is modeled to be as realistic as possible, meaning that armour thickness and sloping provide realistic protection from different types of shells. This means that certain shells may not even be able to do any damage to a tank (eg. A stuart tanks 37mm gun cannot penetrate the frontal armour of a Tiger I, even at point blank range). Armour can also be angled to increase its effectiveness, but this method varies on the model of the tank. 

From my experience I have played mainly as the British, Germans and Soviets. Every nation has its advantages and disadvantages over others allowing for different tactics to be used. 

For example, at tier 3:

Russian tanks make heavy use of sloped armour and have a wide range of powerful ammunition to choose from, but most of their tanks suffer from poor gun depression, which means that firing down from a hill can be difficult. The T34s are also extremely mobile, meaning they will usually be the first tank you face in a battle. They are also backed up by heavy KV-1s and 2s and a variety of powerful self propelled guns making the Russians an extremely aggressive country to play.

German tanks generally have very good gun depression and excellent mobility. The Tiger tank provides long range firepower and excellent armour alongside very high mobility and good speed. Meanwhile, you have an excellent selection of self propelled guns, such as the Panzer IV/70 or the Dicker Max. I have found the armour on German tanks at this tier to be less reliable than the Russians, but the power of the guns more than make up for it, especially at longer range. Their tanks are great in offensive and defensive situations. 

The British are much more of a challenge to play. Their tanks range from extremely fast medium tanks such as the Cromwell I, which can flank enemies and hit their vulnerable sides, to the slow and cumbersome Chruchhill, which boasts very heavy armour. The biggest weakness of the British tanks is the lack of explosive filler in the shells, which means that damage after you penetrate an enemy tank is poor. You may penetrate the armour, but you might only do minor damage to the tanks. It requires you to know exactly where to hit enemy tanks to cause maximum damage. Also, the widely used cromwell chassis, though extremely fast, as very poor reverse speed, meaning that getting out of a sticky situation can be difficult. I have found that the British become very fustrating to play as you progress in the game, though I hear the tanks get more powerful after tier 3. 

There is so much flesh to this game, with each team requiring different tactics and adaptations. I am seriously enjoying it, and no, it's not pay to win. Anyone who thinks so is either impatient and just not very good at the game. There are micro transactions that help, but you can happily play this game without spending a penny.

It's an endless grind and the different factions are absolutely unbalanced. I have even attempted the ""pay to win"" theory, spending hundreds of dollars to purchace golden eagles for premium account, raising crew skills, camo for tanks, premium tanks  but it was all a complete waste of money. If you like a game with balance between teams and fair play, this is NOT the one for you. Unless you pick one of two factions to play, Germany or Russia, you are going to lose and lose constantly. America and Britian are utterly worthless and that is due to the battle rating system. For example, everything in the game can and does one-shot kill you and it takes multiple shots for you to kill them, if you can live that long and know exactly where to shoot. It's purely dumb luck and chance - there's no such thing as tactical advantage. The graphics are what kept me playing for as long as I did, but the immense frustration after the majority of matches I finally decided to give it up.

The good -
it's free.
graphics.
vehicle variety.
tank gameplay (in the lowest ranks)
easy flight controls make basic flying accessible to anyone.

The bad -
Layer after layer of grinding.
Seriously unbalanced vehicles in each tier.
Poorly balanced match making that makes the game harder than it should be.
Multiple ranking systems that affect gameplay difficulty that aren't explained in the game.
No real explanation of how the huge number of  menus and options affect actual gameplay. 
Some minor and a few major game mechanics that break or ruin various portion of the game.
You must learn important features of the game by trial and error or go to an external community encyclopedia.



Long review:
.....I have more than the 65 hrs play time indicated. (I had an external, non-steam, account as well.) I did not enjoy the game enough to continue playing after unlocking tier 2 equipment in either the tanks or planes. So my review is focused on the early game experience.

Basic gameplay: Choose aviation or tanks, choose a country. Each country has five vehicle trees to choose from. The previous vehicle in that tree must be researched and purchased before you can move on the next vehicle in that tree. Each vehicle you wish to actually use has multiple components that must be leveled. Each country has multiple crews that must be leveled and trained in each vehicle you want them to operate. Aviation and tank crews are trained separately. Join random public battles to earn xp and level the above.
.....If you choose one or two countries and select your vehicles wisely you can minimize the grind and still be effective. But the in-game statistics are misleading. You must go to the warthunder wiki to get accurate information about which vehicles are actually effective.


Specific issues:
ONE.....Air combat. ""Your pilot has been knocked out"" If you want to fly, get used to the idea that your pilot is the size of the kool-aid man and he's knocked out every time a random bullet comes anywhere near him. 
.....During air combat your plane may take no damage but your pilot is suddenly out. Sometimes you actually hear bullets whiz by or see tracers. But your plane is usually not taking any damage.
......This wouldn't be a problem if it didn't happen so often. You only get three planes per air battle and this happens once or twice every other battle. Imagine waiting in a queue to join a fight, choosing your best plane, and getting knocked out a few seconds into the fight by a random bullet. Then imagine that happening to two of your three planes in a single match. Sound like fun? 
.....I know you can kill a pilot. But this is arcade combat, it should take a measurable amount of damage to the plane to kill the pilot. The game suggests that you invest crew xp in vitality to reduce the frequency of this event. But crew xp points are hard to get when they die every other time they fly. The xp cost of each vitality boost is ridiculously high for the tiny benefit it bestows.
.....This happened so often it ruined the entire aerial combat experience for me.

TWO.....Getting pushed into higher tier matches with low tier vehicles. There are multiple ranking systems that affect what level of opponents the random battle will pit you against. The system is overly complicated and biased towards pitting you against higher ranked opponents.
.....In the early tiers everyone is basically on the same level. But serious vehicle imbalances immediately arise as soon as you start unlocking the next steps. Put one slightly higher tier vehicle in your hanger and you'll be forced into matches with vehicles well above your single step up. Further, since you have only one vehicle in that higher tier, your other vehicles are now cannon fodder for everything else in the arena.
.....The game claims that if you remove the higher tier unit from your hanger you will be re-balanced to fight with vehicles equal to the lower rank of your older vehicles. But this does not happen. Once you have been moved up you cannot go back.
 
THREE.....Serious vehicle imbalances varying by tier. I recommended choosing one or two countries and vehicle types to reduce the amount of grinding. However, except for the Russian bias, every country has a level where it outshines the others. At some point, you will be the weakest link and it will become very difficult to level your way to the next step. Xp requirements grow exponentially, so the higher the tier at which this occurs, the longer it will take to grind your way out.
.....In tier one tanks, the British tanks are absolute shit. they have no armor and they can't kill anything. The American and Russian tanks are super fast and can kill most enemies with ease. As you move up, that changes and another nation rises to the top. Planes suffer from similar balance problems. The entry level German planes are killing machines while several other factions may as well be blowing kisses at you.


Other items you may want to know about:
.....The arcade/mouse flight controls are easy to learn. But you'll have to set some custom controls to perform more complex maneuvers that you will need to master to win in air combat.
.....Many of the options in the menu's use unknown terminology and are not explained in the game's UI. You either have to go to the wiki or learn by trial and error.

.....There is too much grinding in the air vehicles. There are easily three or four times as many planes as tanks. Which sounds great until you realize that most of them are just minor variants of the previous plane and don't perform any better than their earlier counterparts. But you are forced to unlock multiple useless variants to get to the next step in that class.
.....Air combat is more frustration than fun. The beginner planes are ridiculously non-lethal. Air combat takes much longer than tank combat and you earn fewer points and xp for time invested.
.....You spawn in the air a considerable distance from your enemy. As dogfights drop toward lower altitudes, enemies respawn at the default altitude, giving whoever died most recently an immediate advantage. You rarely engage enemies one or two at a time. Most engagements are against multiple opponents, usually with newly respawned enemies coming in from above or behind you. 
.....Attempting to use a joystick is horrifically overcomplicated. The number of settings you have to test, modify, and retest to achieve a minimum of control is ridiculous. You're better off using the mouse. Games released in the late 90's had full analog support. The lack of properly implemented joystick support in an aerial combat game is simply mystifying.

.....The beginner tanks are a lot of fun. The maps are small, the combat is close range with obstacles to maneuver around and use for cover. There is still a lot of leveling but not as much as the planes. Tank battles take less time and it's easier to earn xp so your items level much faster.
.....There are significantly fewer tanks than planes. This is good. It allows you to unlock better tanks without having to unlock lots of junk to get to them.
.....However there are gaps in tank performance between one rank and another. Once you're finally competitive in your early tier one tanks you will be pushed into the next step where you will be cannon fodder for those with more hours in-game than you.
.....The tier two maps change the entire game experience. They have large open areas with little or no cover, or large gaps between cover. Everyone becomes a camping tank sniper and the fun level drops to zero.

.....Pay to win. The paid items are expensive and significantly more powerful than their ftp counterparts. Because the game pushes you into higher difficulty levels against higher tier vehicles, I suggest saving any investment for the end game.
.....I put this at the bottom because you can play for free and be effective. The graphics, engine, and basic mechanics are good.",1485664313,1486112002,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating.

-FREE!

STUFF I LIKE:
- The whole gameplay in general. Primarily, I like that when I get shot down, I can still save my plane. It doesn't really provide any insentive to do that, but it's still good fun nonetheless. 
- I know this is kinda little and stupid, but I feel like it needs to be said anyway. When someone gets shot down, their marker turns a kind of darker color, to symbolize that you shot the guy down, and no matter what, you got the ponts for it. However, some people (jerks), will chase after you, even after you are defeated, blowing your plane to pieces, just to be mean. The thing I like is that most people recognize that as a shitty thing to do, and go after people who do that. It sort of makes you feel like the people who play the game have a sort of sense of honor, which is rare in most multiplayer games. 
- My last point brings me to this, which is a bigger point. Things like that last thing I mentioned show a good form of multiplayer teamwork. Saving a friend's life (or plane), and being saved later by them really make you feel like a part of a team. Mostly, people dont even talk to each other in War Thunder, but you still feel a genuine companionship with the people you play alongside because there are a lot of opportuinites to save other people, as well as to be saved. 
- I really like the community (for the most part). Nobody uses the chat, which makes it harder for people to be jerks, but it seems like pretty few people just play like jerks. 
- The matchmaking system is really good. I very rarely feel wildly outmatched or stacked against. 
- I really like the fact that you can actually see the enemies' names in game, so you can specifically target whoever shot you down. That's always good fun. 

STUFF I DON'T LIKE:
- No game is perfect, and most of War Thunder's flaws lie in the funcitons of the game outside of actual gameplay.
- I don't like the fact that in the realistic (competitive) game mode, you can't use more than one of your planes. I have like five planes active, I had to actually purchase a crew for each plane (which I assume included a living pilot), so why is it that I can only use one per match? After my first plane gets shot down, shouldn't I be able to use one of my other four planes and crews in the same match so that I didn't just take off, get to altitude, find someone to kill, and get shot down all for fucking nothing? Shouldn't I be given a chance to learn from my mistakes instead of being forced to leave the game and just go back to casual because competitive doesn't offer a worthwhile reward, nor does it offer any fun at all? This is a HUGE problem, as it basically insentivizes you to NOT play the competitive multiplayer mode because I only get to play it for like 30 seconds before I have to leave the game because I died and didn't get another chance. Also, it takes all the strategy out of choosing what order to use your planes in. In the casual mode, you get to choose what planes and what order to use them in, which truly does have a strategic aspect, but this giant design flaw totally takes that all away. 
- I feel like the concept of landing the plane after getting shot down should be a little more complicated. Like maybe, if you get shot down, but your plane is not destroyed, maybe it gets fixed a little quicker. I don't know, it just seems like there's not enough to it, and there's a lot of missed opportunity to have more cool features there. 

That's about it. Well, that's it as far as aerial combat, but I feel like that's the main function of the game. It's all good fun, and in spite of my complaints, you just can't argue with the fact that at the end of the day, it's just a good time to play War Thunder.",1485364920,1485365394,True,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This game. This game is testament that shitty devs can fuck up a very good game concept. I have played this game for a long time on and off. However, over the last few patches, the game really has taken a nosedive when it comes to enjoyability. 
First, the Planes, which is the most mature and well developed part of the game. the Models look great, as does the scenery. It however, has a lot of problems, first up, the way players interact with AI ground targets is mindnumbingly dumb. On each map, the AI has a predetermined winner, meaning, that without player intereference, one side will always win, as their ground units cap the objective. This is problem number one as it promotes hiding and drawing out the game, given everybody knows who wins on which maps, which means that 90% of the time, you end up chasing some AFK fuck that is lounging at 11k altitude without having done anything...
The Second major problem with planes is still, as it was in 1.25, Flight modelling. compared to the competition, its frankly terrible. Gaijin attempted to remedy this via ""Tournament standard"" flight models, but as a few tests indicate, even these are far from standard, with frankly mindboggling behavior such as a failure to stall, wonky control surfaces and odd use of superchargers. Compared to its next to competitors (IL-2 and Wargamings World of Warplanes) it falls miserably short compared to the first, while overall, not being that much better then the second, which advertises itself as a casual arcade type of sim. 
Overall, if Planes were the only thing, i'd rate the game a 6.5/10, it can be decently enjoyable, if at times, mindnumbingly frustrating.

Now onto Tanks. Which is the middle brother of the modes, and involves 2 teams usually fighting over a cap point. My first issue, cap points, unlike with planes, are completely random, consisting of a circle somewhere in the middle of nowhere, usually in the center of the map. Whereas with Planes, you got an inkling of what your actual goal is, tanks is akin to being a gladiator in an arena, with only a simple, go kill the badguys to justify your actions. This is made worse by the terrible, claustrofobic map design which is to promote the use of 1 shot killing Howitzers (that in most modes, would suffer heavily of hte shelldrop, combined with the need to guesstimate the distance) over high velocity anti tank guns. This is made even worse by the pitful zoom that you get, making putting in accurate fire at ranges over 500meters nearly impossible.
The second major issue, is the basic game mechanics of shell behavior and armor. Both are incredibly borked, and have been so from the beginning. for a Game that presents itself as historical and realistic, its very much neither. For instance, whereas In Real life, calibers of 85mm or more would overmatch sloped armor, ingame that doesn't happen except for huge calibers like the Soviet 122mm, which, combined with the aforementioned mapdesign, makes it really frustrating for anybody that wants to drive anything else then Russians. 
The Ingame T-34 needs to plant a single hit on his opponent to kill him. the British Cromwell, which frequently faces it (and for some reason, has no reverse gear) needs to plant shots into each individual crewman, because shell spalling is only a minor inconvienience, whereas explosives are teh wrath of God.
Finally, unlike WoT, the chance to bounce is not set, and is completely RNG to the point that HESH, which pancakes onto a surface, can actually bounce off an angled plate.
rating 3/10. Horrible, buggy and frustrating, not helped by devs that are more interested in pushing out content then in fixing the mode.

Now onto the devs themselves. They are bad, atleast their gamedesign is. Balance is a mess, with many over and underpowered machines sitting at ranks where they have no business to be. official response, ""balancing is done through numbers."" This has lead to the amusing situation where you had the A6M5 zero, an aircraft that has a top speed of 540kph was considered to be a balanced matchup for the P-80C shooting star, which went nearly twice as fast, had far better controls, and was supposed to go up to equivalent aircraft like the Meteor. While some of the more special ones have been removed, the point remains, there is no idea to balance it, and any suggestion about changing it is met with a resolute mocking and telling people that having biplanes facing off against B-17's is the only alternative.
In Tanks, its even worse, given that the spread is identical, which means that its not uncommon to find yourself in a position where you are outgunned and cannot do anything really, because of hte fact your gun cannot penetrate his armor from any angle. In Gaijin's view, this is considered a fair match.

PROS:
-Good graphics even when it's set to low

-Fairly balanced game. Even though sometimes the so called ""Russian Bias"" kinda appeared, it doesn't really matter because every nation got their own ""Biased"" vehicles such as Americans with the T95's super armor and T29's super gun, Germans with the Tiger II and Panther II's gun, Soviets with almost everything, British with their Centurion and Chieftain high penetration gun, and also the new japanese Type 60's super gun and Ho-Ro massive shell

-No health bars, just actual damage model so as long you got at least 2 crew members alive, you can still fight

-1 Shot kills, in air battles this can be done with rockets, high caliber cannons or shooting the pilot and in tank battles this can be done just by simply shot the ammo racks or fuel tanks of the tanks or even killing the whole crew with the explosion of the shell or shrapnel

-Constant updates, every update fixes the bugs in the game and always include improving the stability of the client. Major updates are full of new vehicles, system improvement, new sound effects and many more

-Tons of vehicle to choose from 5 nations (+500 aircraft, +300 ground vehicles, and the new boats which is currently in closed beta)

-Very large map especially for air battles

-Nothing is impossible, you can get everything in the game by just playing because everything is unlockable except for premium stuffs, but you can still get them from warbonds and events.

-You can earn Golden Eagles from participating in an event such as monthly skin, art, and screenshot contest in the forum or simply use your Golden Eagles wager that can give you up to 1500 GE if you're lucky enough to finish the mission (kill 3 or 5 enemies) and won the battle.

CONS:
-Sometimes there are trolls who will teamkill you or other person in the game for no reason (mostly in air AB)

-The grind is kinda harsh but for a free game this doesn't really matter

-Bugs still exist but the War Thunder team are constantly fixing this issues

Please ignore my steam hours, as I played through the launcher downloaded directly from the official website, and only downloaded the steam version to review it. Now that that is all out of the way, I'll dive back in.

War Thunder is a very unusual case. It is a well made and fun game, with quite a lot of realism, especially compared to its competitor, World of Tanks (and far better than World of Warplanes). I would say that in most areas gameplay wise War Thunder is considerably better than WOT (and WOWP), and less frustrating (unless someone in a heavy bomber starts carpet bombing the tank spawn). However, There is a reason that I would recommend WOT over War Thunder, and that is the companies running the two games. Wargaming, who run WOT/WOWP, are not a particularly nice company, but Gaijin is an awful company that makes EA look consumer-friendly in comparison. Gaijin sells premium vehicles that are in some cases flat out better than their regular versions (Calliope) or just come with stupid annoying strengths (SU-100Y, because oneshotting everything from 2km away is fun and engaging), and this is just the beginning. They cannot take criticism at all, and their moderators close down any forum threads or videos on the community video site that complain, for reasons of varying degrees of silliness (some poor guy was banned for complaining about the matchmaker for ""Supporting ISIS"")
 
 Along with that, there are ""incidents"" that occur every once in a while when someone complains on a non-gaijin regulated site, such as youtube, and I will show the two most prominent examples:

In 2015, a Latvian by the name of Kirill ""alconafter"" Fyodorov, who runs a Youtube channel, had his channel taken down with multiple DMCA copyright strikes. He was contacted by Gaijin, who refused to give him his channel back unless he signed a contract that they sent him.

""I hereby undertake to release at least four video reviews about the game War Thunder per week, and I also guarantee that the content will not contain insults and materials discrediting the reputation of the game War Thunder and that may cause direct or indirect damage to the right holder of the game. ...

If the channel owner breaches the terms and conditions of this agreement Gaijin Network Ltd. may at its sole discretion (a) unilaterally terminate this agreement and/or (d) require the channel owner to pay a fine of $10,000 for each case of breach.""

""This agreement is confidential and its terms may not be disclosed to any 3rd-parties without the prior permission of Gaijin Network Ltd.""

For those who don't understand what this means, he would have to upload 4 videos of War Thunder per week, and not criticise the game in any way, or tell anyone about the terms of the contract. Every time he broke these rules, he could be fined $10,000, more that his entire yearly income from Youtube. 

Obviously, he refused, and sent his story to Russian websites, who published it. It was then translated by a blog called ""Status Report"", which released the story to the english community, and caused outrage. Gaijin then went full damage control, firing the person in charge of the operation, Pavel Kulikov, branding him as a rogue employee. While this might have been believeable then, a similar incident happened some months later:

A different YouTuber, and American this time, known a ""PhlyDaly"", uploaded a video regarding a marker cheat. Gaijin, more cautious this time, messaged him and asked him to take the video down, claiming that it had increased the use of the cheat. He refused to go as far as to take the video down, but made it private instead. The next day, on the offical forums, a poll popped up, created by the company CEO. He explained what had happened, and gave the players a choice:
either add the markers for all players, or revoke the licence of Phly and copyright strike the video to have it taken down. This caused outrage, and he had to back down. However, this suggests to me that the first incident was authorised by the CEO and Pavel was simply a scapegoat for their damage control plan.

Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.

Every country is good in their own way.
For example:
Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defence
Japanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defence
Russians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.
British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defence
Germans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defence



The game mechanics in this game are very good. 
The diversity of planes is very good.
You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)
Diverse selection of maps 
Many gamemodes

There are 3 levels of difficulty:
Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand out
Realistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of plane
Simulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.

The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.

The matchmaking system depends on two things.
1 - Tier of the plane
2 - Battle Ranking of the plane

If you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.

TL;DR
The Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking.
