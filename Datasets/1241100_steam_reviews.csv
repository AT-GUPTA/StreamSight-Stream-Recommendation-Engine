Keybinds are iffy some work others dont and you have to create an account to even play which requires email registration

I cam back to the game after i saw that its getting populated, they fixed my complaints and now there is several full servers to play back to back without wait times. pretty fun but to get weapons/attachments its very grindy at least the starter rifle is well balanced and can compete against the later ARs",1583541700,1651389269,True,0,0,0.512693941593170166,0,True,False,True

This game has very high potential to become amazing, but at the moment there is alot of teething issues as it is beta. Hopefully in a couple weeks most of that will be fixed and all the stuff that is locked will become available.

I highly recommend this game as its cheap and really fun to play with a couple mates, you can create your own server for everyone to join, there is a leveling system like COD and a few guns, you get currency from playing games so you can buy new guns (you dont have to grind much) vehicles dont work yet but im sure they will get them going in the future. 

They definitely need to advertise the game more as it just came out and alot of people dont know about it, the population is low but could grow very quick.

Hope you all jump on board and give it a go :)",1583712469,1583712469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
