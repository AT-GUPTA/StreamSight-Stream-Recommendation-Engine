a game made by a solo developer.
 
fun, playable, and you get to supervise your very own grocery store.
you can upgrade your store, more room to sell objects and hire auto cashiers to help your business along.
you buy licenses to acquire more produce to sell
i believe the game says there are more systems to implement in the near future..

i paid i think 10 bucks for it and its a total steal.

Developer if you ever read this comment, a few things i would add is a greater, more organized storage space, and an auto restock system/hired employee and it would be perfect.

This game is fun, I love the complexity of it thus far. However since there were a few bugs and balancing issues I did what any modder would do: look into the game files to temporarily fix them myself and share the fix with the rest of the community. Now, as of right now everything is open and in plain text format and easy to edit and look through if you know what to look for. 

But, once I started finding errors and easily fixable bugs and started to share them on the discord that's when one of the devs took it personal. He and started deleting my posts and said ""Should I consider adding a control that blocks the game when you edit the save file externally? This way we could get rid of spoilers, wydt?"" 

First of all its a supermarket sim, what spoilers? XD
Second, doing that would severely cripple and slow down the development of the game as that would cause the community to find bugs A LOT slower. And IMO games last 10x longer when there is open coding.

Safe to say that they won't be adding mod support. And don't like their community trying to help them quicken the games development.

Great game, Bad community relations with modders tsk, tsk",1708901381,1708901422,False,13,0,0.534951210021972656,0,True,False,True

Just a few ideas, apologies if been mentioned before, Just trying to help :)

 - I feel this needs an inventory system with mins and max for stock along with price changing chart by the day, as once you have a few items it gets messy. 
 - Also noticed that if you have 2 checkouts 1 manned with staff and the other not they still go to both, maybe the ability to ""turn off"" a checkout would be handy (waiting for level 20 to hire employee numero 2.)
 - Being able to handle more than one box at a a time would be advantageous also, maybe a sack barrow or trolley. 
 - Customers wandering around with a bag instead of a basket, just a visual improvement. 
 - Staff are SLOW on checkouts, maybe a skill level in future so that they increase in speed, and maybe lower level miss change customers etc. 
 - Ability to buy EMPTY boxes so you can move stock around, I have to get creative haha

We need to change the store name . so hopefully this is done on next update of game . As this would make game 10 plus . Also hope they add sale signs and maybe advertisment boards we can buy and put outside . Maybe to attract more customers would be cool feature

I hope they put in a sandbox game when its complete so you can just start up with a big amount money and make your store to suit you . I hope they dont add silly things like having to go to toilet and eat and buy house . This will just get time consumming as i want to run a supermarket.
If they must maybe add a tick if we want to add this to our game play.

Things I Love:

 - Store customization (which will improve as more is added to the game)
 - Variety of goods

QoL Improvements I'd Love to Have:
 - A way to take items OFF displays (this would make it easier for rearranging)
 - The stockroom is cute, but I'd love to have it be an attached room rather than the building next door.
 - Items inside a box are unloaded from back to front (like the ZAP Soda)
 - A grid/guide along floor, walls, and ceiling for display and light placement

firstly this game has a big potential if updated regularly and i'm sure it's in early access phase.
i will start with :
*the game needs to be alive , it lacks the dynamic and ambient sounds ,(subtle refrigerators sounds) , the crowd talking in background if the store is full of customers.
*npc should say something about expansive items / good prices , to aware the players
*ambient street noises (car passing by and the sound of walking etc )
*renaming the store + decoration is a must
*the ability to hire more agents for restocking automatically whenever the shelves are empty 
*analytics of products (best seller , price fluctuations etc)
*whenever the price of certain products are changed daily it should be a key shortcut to show them for exp TAB
*the ability to implicate marketing strategies and putting items in discounts (npc would buy more )
*including more items (utensils , furniture , beauty and hygiene products , electronics , clothes , etc)

At the time of writing this the game has not long gone into early access so hopefully most of the cons will be sorted when the game gets its full release. However if you can't be bothered to read all the pros and cons then let me say if you want a nice relaxing game then this game is for you. To be honest you probably already own it or know if your getting it or not but just in case your unsure then here are my Con's Pro's AND things I'd like to see added.

CON
-CAN ONLY ORDER 10 BOXES AT A TIME TOTAL IF YOU WANT MORE YOU HAVE TO PLACE  2ND OR 3RD ORDER
-STAFF STAY ON TILL AND DO NOT HELP IN ANY OTHER AREA OF THE SHOP
-STORE ROOM IS WASTE OF MONEY AS YOU NEVER USE IT
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CORRECT BOX YOU CAN'T MOVE ANY OF THE STOCK
-CUSTOMERS WILL GO TO AN UN-STAFFED TILL EVEN IF THEIR IS A TILL WITH A STAFF MEMBER ON IT
-LACK OF VARIETY  IN CUSTOMERS I HAVE HAD 4 IDENTICAL CUSTOMERS IN MY SHOP AT THE SAME TIME ARE THEY QUADS?
-CUSTOMERS GIVING ME $100 FOR A $1 CARTON OF MILK
-NO MUSIC (MAYBE YOU COULD BUY A SOUND SYSTEM FOR THE STORE ONCE IT REACHES SIZE 5)

PROS
+OVERALL GAME PLAY (DOES IT REALLY NEED ANYTHING MORE THAN THIS?)
+YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO THE CUSTOMERS AND THEY WONT COMPLAIN
+FREEDOM TO HAVE THE SHOP HOWEVER YOU WANT
+CHARGE ANYTHING YOU LIKE FOR ITEMS
+ONCE STORE IS STOCKED AND ALL TILLS ARE STAFFED YOU CAN WALK AROUND FREELY AND WATCH THE MONEY ROLL IN

WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE ADDED
*MORE CUSTOM ABILITY BEING ABLE TO PICK DIFFERENT FLOORING AND WALLS
*POS
*NAME THE STORE
*STORE OWN BANDS
*BIGGER VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS (KIDS, OAP, DISABLED, ETC)
*DELIVERY STAFF WHO BRING THE DELIVERY IN AND STOCK UP THE SHELVES (WOULD NEED TO ALLOCATED SHELF SPACE SO THEY KNEW WHAT TO PUT WHERE)
*DIFFICULTY SETTINGS SO YOU COULD HAVE 1 OR MORE COMPETITORS WHO'S STORE YOU COULD LOOK INSIDE OF
*RENT A SPACE (A SPACE YOU CAN ALLOCATED TO A PARTICULAR BUSINESS LIKE A CAFE OR BOOK STORE THAT PAY YOU RENT)
*DAMAGED PRODUCT (IF YOU THROW A BOX FILLED WITH TINS THEN THEIR SHOULD BE A CHANCE THE TINS GET DENTED OR BROKEN
*REDUCED SECTION (A SECTION WHERE YOU CAN PLACE ITEMS AT A REDUCED PRICE THIS COULD BE BECAUSE THEY ARE DAMAGED OR NEAR THEIR SELL BY DATE)

I think thats enough for now I better get back to my shop the shelves wont stack themselves. Well not yet anyway.

The full game even turned out better than the demo.

The game is very early in its development phase but it already kinda works for now if you ask me.
Some features are lacking while some are already planned.
Still lots of possibility to grow this game and the planned upcoming features all look amazing.
Definitely going to drop this review and support the dev.

Pros:
1. The system is strong and what is currently made works very well.
2. Working the till is genuinely fun and the workers also help.
3. Shelf stacking is very easy.
4. Setting item prices is very easy.

Cons: (None, just needs further development)
1. There is currently very little automation. You have checkout staff, but that's it.
2. You are the only person that stacks the shelves. Without you, the shop with die.
3. There is no inventory management.
4. There is nothing more to do, other than buy, stack, sell.

I would like:
1. Different staff types. Stackers, cleaners?, Security?
2. I would like to manage my inventory from the computer. I want to know how much stock I have of each item.
3. Player / Staff upgrades.
4. Rota system for staff. Currently the staff work from 8am - 9pm, not including overtime.
5. Additional stuff to do while the shop ticks over.
6. Snapping lights. I can't get them to line up correctly.
7. The option to upgrade shelves, fridges, freezers.
8. An upgrade to tills that automatically add the total to the card machine.
9. An upgrade to the tills that dispenses change directly.
10. The option to short change / give too much change.

It's funny, because I've worked retail and customer service jobs my whole life, so you think this would be the last kind of game I would enjoy. I love micromanaging games like this. My only issue (and this is a very weird complaint to have) is that I feel like you level up too fast, but don't make money fast enough to keep up. People are complaining that I don't have higher-level items in my shop when I can barely afford to keep up the lower-level stock items, let alone pay for the licenses, shelves, and store space needed to get the higher-level items... It is realistic, though, because as soon as you stock the items that people are complaining about, nobody buys them. That is so typical of being in customer service. People only want what they can't have lol.

Still, it's a lot of fun and nice and relaxing to play. I look forward to seeing all the future additions to this game!",1708718426,1708719012,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

- Allow grid snap for the shelves and coolers. 
- Timed lights. It sucks turning around at 5pm just to turn them on.
- Work upgrades. Something like working faster (oh dear lord they are slow). Either through payments or experience (how many checkouts they have done).
- Customize !! Be able to change so much. I don't want a lifeless stiff guy in a vest as a cashier. Want to change the colors of the walls/floor. Change the store name. That type of stuff.
- Being able to use the actual keyboard number pad for when the customers use credit cards. It isn't the best using your mouse to hit the numbers. 
- A better way to see which items prices' have changed. Maybe a filter for ""prices changed"". Something like that.
- Make the desktop easier to read. I have glasses, but come on dude.
- Add some decor. Plants, signs, speakers, etc.
- Did some exploring outside of the store. It's cool, but there was an issue with the cars just stuck in traffic. 
- Maybe add some weather? It isn't needed, but that would be a good effect. Snow, storms, etc.
- My customers always look down (like they are ashamed) after they give me the money. I don't get that....",1708712865,1708712865,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're looking at it that means you're interested and its worth the money. 
TO THE DEV:
Dude this is a great concept and game, there are some points i wanna hit on and talk about to help you improve the game.
i am also a game developer and i understand the frustration with making thing work right and doing whats in your mind, that being said these points are just to help the game and not to underrate it in any way. 
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDED, these are not optional really and need to find a place in the game sooner than later.
1. a way to use the keypad for the credit and debit card payments, the mouse is time consuming and tedious.
2. when paying with cash the screen should remain stationary when selecting the cash to avoid motion sickness, i found myself sick multiple-times and had to hire a cashier to avoid this.
3.A way to see your stock when ordering products
4.A way to sell furniture you no longer wan't.
5.a way to turn off a register for when you're stocking.
6. a way to see what prices on the market have fluctuated other than the 2 second message that no one can remember. 
THE MOTION SICKNESS IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM FOR ME AND MY WIFE, im sure im not the only one. 

Now the things im sure you're planning on adding but i just wanna touch them in case.
1. hiring a stocker, as stocking can get overwhelming at times and help would be nice
2. down the road a multiplayer option to where your friend can run the store with you would be a really great thing and most likely boost sales tremendously.
3. Customization of the store such as paints, walls, registers, and employee uniforms would be cool, but this is something that isn't imperative a this moment.

In review this is a really well thought out game, that product art is really nice and unique, it flows nice and feels good when playing, few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking as of yet. i really enjoy this game and its nice to relax and manage your store and see it grow. Game is 100% worth the money to support this dev and help it grow and become the store manager we always wanted. If you're thinking about grabbing it, pull the trigger and you won't regret it.

Realizing this hole in the supermarket sim genre, thankfully Nokta stepped up to bring us Supermarket Simulator, and as of right now (vers. 0.1.0.3) it's, well... something! It's a barebones representation of grocery store life... Ordering, cashiering, working overstock.

As simplistic as it is in these early stages, it's very addictive, and will only get moreso if the developer holds true to their roadmap of continuing quality of life changes and additional features. For right now, you order products to fill your shelves before the store opens(and sell them at an unrealistic gross profit. In reality it would take much longer for your money to accumulate making it a slog.) During the open hours, you'd best hope you have enough to last the day, because most of your time will be spent cashiering. Juggling refilling empty shelves while trying to keep your line down is a recipe for chaos and stress... just like it would be in real life.

There is the ability to hire cashiers. I've only bought the first 7 or 8 licenses as of writing this, and the first few growth expansions, so for now I do all the cashiering, because... what else would I do during the day when the store's open? Perhaps down the line it will get more hectic where I'll need help, as I am noticing bigger order sizes even this early on.

Also there's a bank loan system which I HIGHLY advise against utilizing. I was itching to get the next few expansions/licenses/more shelves, so I took out a loan and well, after spending my loan money, I didn't have much left to buy products for those shelves. Remember what the supermarket looked like during peak COVID scare?? That was my store for about 2 in-game weeks until I dug myself out of my hole of loan payments and bills which also increased because of my bigger store size and added lighting. From here on out, I grind until I have enough money to expand naturally.

Bottom line, I love this game even as it is. I played the prologue extensively, and just wanted more of the same, and that's what this EA release is. More items, more store space, more business. I have my fingers crossed that Nokta sticks with the development of this game and makes it better in the future. For right now, the introductory price of ~$10 feels like shoplifting ;-)

EDIT: The ONE thing I would wish for at this point is to be able to wield a 'scanning gun' to order items instead of walking around, looking at the shelves, walking to the computer to order, looking at more shelves, walk back to computer... etc, etc.... Even at this early stage where I have around only 40-50 items, it takes a good bit of time. I can only imagine how it would be having close to 200 items and many more aisles to traverse.",1708710278,1708710567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

2- it would be cool to have reviews on what you need to fix in game instead of customers griping when they walk out the store and it goes away in 2 seconds.  

3- this game need some sort of music or customer chatting! just hearing beeps all day can drive you crazy.

4- needs some sort of dolly or push cart. picking up one box at a time gets repetitive.

Some things that needs to be updated….

1. The card reader on my handheld device   mouse sensitivity is on its lowest yet the mouse and cursor still goes really fast for me to click on certain things especially for the reader. Maybe make it so that when we’re using the reader it latches on to each numbers.

2. When I turn while walking it’s like my character stutters/skips.

Things I hope to see in future update..::

1. There should be a section that shows how much of an item you have left of. Other than you looking at the shelfs or customers telling you.

2. Let’s you walk or end the day at your house and let’s you decorate it.

3. Gives you a delivery bike that lets deliver to people houses.

4. Add a parking garage or lot and let’s people wheel their shopping carts out to their  cars 

3. Different characters and ages. I don’t know about other I’m a mother and would love to see families come into the store to buy items especially little kids. 

4. Add chest crate or gum ball machines not only will it give you more money but will make cute decoration for your shop. 

Overall I would still recommend this game because it’s relaxing and good for past time.. plus it’s new and it’s in early access which means more to come!!…

You can not customise your shop, there is currently no cleaning aspect. To what I have played so far, it is quite difficult to manage the game, there is no indication from the customers as to what is ""too pricey"" Even if you are matching the RRP of a product, it's too much, so not sure how to combat that. It basically seems to be stock simulator, the Stockroom being in another building than your shop seems a bit unrealistic. Having to run out the store to gather stock is just strange. 
There are a few bugs, like after day 3 or 4 the customers stopped telling me what was missing, so I was never sure what stock to order or what stock was running low. 
The graphics seem to be very much like this game was churned out rather quickly, using asset flips etc. I also find the 25c option in the till a bit useless? - There are no Sale markers, and there is a sufficient lack of customisation for things like special offers. 
The game gets pretty hard without a till operator. It also gets quite hard when you up your stock options, so having a stock staffer would also be beneficial. - As this is an early access game, I can understand that this maybe a miss, so I will give it it's due.

I will admit, stocking the fridge while it was stuck on the sidewalk was amusing. I also appreciate the addition of putting a light in the storage area.

I'm a fan of tycoon, simulation & business games, so this gem hits all the right spots. Great little sim, looking forward to seeing how it develops. 

My favorite unimportant feature is the delivery dropping from the sky and splaying all over the road. Also, a morning stroll reveals way more USPS boxes than would exist naturally on a city block, but overall the outside environment looks uncannily like my neighborhood (Jersey City). The building addresses suggest Greenwich Village. Don't mind me, I play tabletop RPGs and attention to detail is baked into my nature. Proper worldbuilding helps with versimilitude in any game.

Although it may seem incredible for managing a supermarket...



PS: 

I found a big problem: this is the game as in reality, I have to see all the missing products, buy them, put each box in the supermarket (one at a time) and then fill the shelves with each box , then throw each of those empty boxes into the trash can, and this cycle repeats infinitely,

It's fun at first but it gets very arduous over time, the boxes we buy with the products should be larger in quantity and some way to transport all the boxes together into the supermarket, be able to hire an NPC to replenish stock, etc.

The truth is that it was enough for me, I had fun but now I'm tired, to make matters worse there is a huge amount of products to expand our catalog and just thinking about it I was shocked, which I mean that it is a lot of work to do just one, ( The only help I found is an NPC who works at a cash register, and he is very slow at serving customers so I had to add another cash register and also serve the buyers, and that's fun, the problem is the replenishment of everything what is sold) as an experience I liked it but it exhausted me, in my opinion there has to be a change...",1708536657,1708566073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game seems to have and/or will get everything, you could wish for in this type of game.
At the moment I have mostly only played the Prologue or Demo version.
Looking into the Early Access version right now and seeing all the new feature that this has,
I can't wait to build another huge Supermaket including these new and upcomming features.
No doubt this game will go way beyond all previus Supermarket simulatores I have played so fare.

Not only did the zoom movement to the credit card machine give me wild motion sickness, but I just think it'd make more sense for the payment to be automatic as the cash register screen has already totalled the price.

Also, the price point for the game is fairly set. After playing for some time, I have some points I would like to share that I think would help improve the game. As it sits right now, its fun, but I think with some more love, it could be even more enjoyable. 

1. For the love of God... turn the darn glare down. The sun bouncing off the cash registers is so BLINDING it gives you a headache after awhile. 
2. PLEASE make the computer screen easier to read. When buying expansions or even items on the market, it is so hard to see the pricing and lettering. 
3. Also when changing the prices on the items on your shelves or fridges, please make the menu bigger. That is also somewhat hard to see the prices. 
4. Adding grid snapping would be a BIG help when placing down furniture or ESPECIALLY the lighting. Just showing the grid alone would be great!
5. PLEASE get rid of the card number inputs. I love the counting change... But after awhile the card number pad gets SO boring and tedious. I think adding a card swipe instead would be alot more fun and not so mundane. 
6. Having timed lights would be so cool to have. Its hard to keep track of the time just to turn the lights on. Maybe add a feature that we can buy later on that would add a light timer we can set that auto turns the lights on at a certain time everyday. That would also help with managing out electric use. 
7. I hope worker upgrades will be a thing. Maybe being able to upgrade their speed of checking customers out. If not purchase upgrading, experience upgrading. ( The more you have them working for you, the more experience they would gain. )
8. How the heck do we get more customers into our store? I'm not sure if its the more cashiers you own, or if its the size of your shop. OR is it the stage of license you own? OR is it what level your shop is? Having this explained would help. I seem to sit around 25 - 30 customers a day no matter what I change or how many cashiers I own. 
9. I know it is said that decorations will be added, but just a few things I would like to see include... Store signs, plants, benches, indoor trashcans, maybe some quarter machines ( vending machines and candy dispensers ), food advertisements, and of course any other normal decorations you would find in Supermarkets.
10. Adding a loud speaker ( Overhead speaker ) would be so cool. It could play some light music in the background so its not so quiet in the store. Its just sounds so dead right now. I think it would also be cute to add some people talking over the speaker every now and then ( Just like you would in a normal store. )
11. Cleaning the store along with being able to customize it is said to be coming in future updates... but I hope that also includes being able to customize your staff. 

All in all, so far this is a pretty great game for it being out 1 day. I REALLY look forward to the updates, and seeing where the game goes.",1708497944,1708497944,True,51,0,0.827323794364929199,0,True,False,True

Both fridges are bugged out and thus half the items that are there are currently unusable. It's a shame really considering as this game had showed promise.

[Update] The game has since been updated and fixed. whilst a few pesky bugs remain it does show that the devs do listen to us. So changed my negative review to a positive. I've also made a suggestion on discord that they promote some of their discord members to community managers or that they themselves become more transparent with the members on steam.

I didn't play long due to limited time, but the little I did play I enjoyed. Controls are self-explanatory, and you should *not* need an external guide to learn how to play.  Movement seemed a little janky, but it may just be my mouse. I have not yet looked for control settings.

I haven't added any expansions to my tiny shop yet, but I still had fun. It reminded me of my first job as a grocery store cashier, and I found myself apologizing IRL to the NPCs for not being faster. ""I'm sorry, it's my first day.""  They didn't seem bothered by having to wait in line while I figured out how to use the cash register. They don't like being shortchanged, however.

I did see a lot of things to unlock, so there should be a sense of progression, although some might find it repetitive after a while.  There is some diversity in the NPCs, so at least you're not seeing the same 1 or 2 characters every single time.

I appreciate the fact that you can order things and put them on the shelves at the beginning of the day before starting that day's timer. If you close the store later in the day, such as in the afternoon, to move things around in the store, the timer will continue. So if you want to stock the shelves, do it before you start the day.

You can leave the store and run around the neighborhood, but it's closed off. It's not like a GTAV map where you can run on foot in one direction for a few minutes. It's more like two blocks. I'm not sure how much gameplay involves the ""neighborhood,"" but I appreciate the fact that you can at least run around outside a little.

I can see myself playing this game often, even if it's just for a few minutes here and there. You can save the game at any time, it seems, so you don't need to set aside a large chunk of time to play. Much thanks to the devs for that. I hate it when developers force you to wait until the day ends before saving.

Only thing I didn't like was that nobody bought my $99.99 bread. :(

I look forward to future updates and highly recommend the game.",1708478500,1708478500,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If you're interested in the game definitely try the Free Prologue first, it's missing a lot of features like credit cards, storage, bank loans and hiring workers (and more obviously) and I don't think you can transfer saves because mine broke when I did but if you enjoy that you'll love this because it's just that with a tonne more content.

Definitely worth it and I can't wait to see what more they bring to the game with future updates!",1708456002,1708456002,True,1,0,0.513641774654388428,0,True,False,True
