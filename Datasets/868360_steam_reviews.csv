This game throws you head-first into building, managing, and diagnosing in a hospital environment. 

The Good Stuff: 

-Offers unparalleled detail in hospital management. From room layouts and staffing to individual patient diagnoses and treatment plans, you're in complete control. This depth provides a truly immersive experience for those who enjoy intricate simulations. 

-Sandbox mode lets you experiment and unleash your inner architect, creating the hospital of your dreams (or nightmares). 

-The game boasts a realistic medical system with various departments, diseases, and treatments. This adds a layer of complexity and intellectual challenge that appeals to strategy and simulation fans. 

Not So Good Stuff: 

-Projects Hospital's depth comes at the cost of a steep learning curve. Expect to spend time deciphering menus, understanding systems, and mastering the intricacies of hospital management. 

-The interface can be clunky and unintuitive at times. 

-This game thrives on micromanagement. If you prefer a more hands-off approach, it might feel overwhelming. Prepare to be deeply involved in every aspect of your hospital's operation. 

Overall: 

Project Hospital is a unique and rewarding experience for those who enjoy complex simulations and the challenge of building a successful healthcare empire. However, its steep learning curve, UI quirks, and micromanagement focus might deter more casual players. If you're willing to invest the time and effort, this game offers a deep and engaging dive into the world of hospital management. Just remember, this patient requires a specific kind of care.

Recommendation:

For fans of: Deep simulations, hospital management, complex systems.
Not for: Casual players, those who dislike micromanagement, those seeking a lighthearted experience.
Final Verdict: 7/10 - A complex and rewarding hospital sim with unmatched depth, but be prepared for a challenging and demanding experience.",1708457350,1708457350,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Anyway, there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. It's a wonderful game, and nowdays I don't really run into any bugs, the only ones being caused by mods, and even then it's unlikely for issues to crop up.

As for the game itself, it's perfect if you like the idea of building a new clinic or hospital from scratch and running it yourself. There's also pre-made hospitals if you just want to jump into the action. The option to manage patients yourself and running tests and trying to diagnose problems is an awesome addition.

The game doesn't have a fancy look, it's isometric in 2D, but for something like this it doesn't have to be 3D or have ""amazing graphics"" or anything of the sort.

I think the closest thing I have to a complaint is the small selection of background music. You have 1 looping track for daytime, 1 for night shift, the main menu music, and (and I like this little detail) a special track that only plays in certain circumstances such as a patient going into cardiac arrest/collapsing and other similar life threatening events.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are pretty simple. They are not mind blowing by any means and may not be for everyone. I personally don’t mind the graphics because it’s unique, simple, and easy to run in terms of performance. I do have some gripes with the visuals in some areas. I wish night time was a bit more dark. Also the weather effects are so basic and sometimes you don’t even notice it raining. The weather effects need an overhaul for sure. Also the UI can be challenging to go through. It can feel all over the place and not that organized. Once you memorize the UI, it does get easier to navigate.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Project Hospital is a really unique sandbox game. Being able to be a doctor and take care of patients from all kinds of needs is actually a really immersive experience. All from being able to create your own clinic or hospital from the ground up is just one mechanic of the game that is super addicting and fun to do. There are some gripes with the building mechanics though. My main issue is just the lack of items for the outside. No parks or anything of that seems pretty bland. Just some lights, a bench, and trash bins. Also some bushes and trees. Also you don’t get any visitor parking. You can create your own for aesthetics, but they are not functional which was a shame. You only get ambulance parking, and that is pretty strict in terms of placement. Now the interior building is where it all shines. Making your rooms for specific jobs is easy, and they even tell you the required equipment for all the rooms so you are not lost in trying to find the needed items which is a huge blessing. You can get really creative with the builder tools. You can also hire staff as well. Every staff has some better expertise than others (with a cost of extra money), and with some extra perks. You can even create your own staff member from the ground up with their looks, age, and profession. You can even create your own character and become the doctor! Being able to do surgeries, diagnose patients, and help out in epidemics can be an intense, immersive, and unique experience that not many games have. You have tons of illnesses, diseases, and other traumatic injuries to deal with in this game, and they are all true to life symptoms. I’d even say this game is really educational too![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You can add a good amount of playtime here. I’m gonna say maybe around 25-50+ hours would be the sweet spot. If you are a fan of medical and sandbox games, then you will easily add 100+ hours.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sounds are pretty good. The music is pretty annoying, but once you mute that the overall ambiance is great. Hearing the patience being treated and staff working on equipment, it’s truly an immersive experience. Once you build a better hospital, it will truly sound busy.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]The only bug I found was the foundations when you make a second floor. The roofs will not be aligned at times. Luckily this is an easy fix. Just destroy the second floor foundation and build it again and that tends to fix itself.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance is fantastic. With the simple art style, performance was never an issue for me. I had one crash while loading the game, but that could be on my end more than the game's fault. I feel like many mid range PC’s can handle this game with ease (especially when you build a huge hospital).[/td]

    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Project Hospital is a fantastic game with a near perfect score. It’s a great game to kick back and immerse yourself into being the doctor you always wanted to be. The game can have a learning curve (especially if you don’t do the tutorials), but with practice comes success. Project Hospital is an absolute must buy for anyone into the medical field. Don’t let the graphics fool you, this is a really in depth game that can give you many unexpected challenges.[/td]

[*] Some things are a bit odd or buggy, like your staff taking the long way to get water or other stuff, even when they have stuff really close to their offices.
[*]Sometimes it's not easy to understand why some staff don't seem to be doing their job, like you need nurses for transport but you see several that are idle, idk if that is an attempt to bring some sort of wicked realism to the game, or just some minor bugs.
[*]I would prefer even better ways to visualize some stats, it's not that clear which department are the most efficient in the long run. Same with doctors that get wrong diagnosis.

You build your hospital one department at a time, hire doctors with different perks that affect their performance and try to achieve some objectives that give you access to more profitable insurance companies. 

What is special at this hospital management game is that you can control the doctors and directly diagnose the patients or sent them to many procedures. This is not a goofy simulation. The patients will die on you if they are not cured or diagnosed in time.

It's not an easy job to balance the needs of the patients, of the staff, the logistics of the hospital (so as the wards staff and the patients to get fast to the needed procedure rooms) and, of course, the money.

Pros:
- great hospital simulation
- realistic illnesses, procedures and diagnosis
- you can manually control the doctors
- a lot of objects, medical and decorations, for designing and building the hospital
- relaxing music
- workshop that will make your life harder or easier, as you like
- no bugs, no crashes
- not easy, but also not very hard

Best of all, it's a hospital sim/management game -- something that isn't showcased much in the video game world.

Beware, though. This game has a pretty bad tutorial/UI for a ""modern"" sim game.

The game as a concept is great, but there are so many little quality of life things that irk me where I can't recommend playing this. On sale, sure but not at full price.

Pros:
- In-depth medical stuff conditions and symptoms.
- Good time waster if you are creative.
- Doctor role playing.

Cons:
- Waiting rooms must be on the first floor. You can't design multi-z hospitals with all of the waiting rooms on one floor like real hospitals. This really sucks because I ended up spending a lot of time designing a hospital that ended up not working as planned.

- You can't undo more than once. You have to save before making any major changes, and reload if you mess up. You end up wasting so much money and this really bothers me.

- Money making can feel like a chore early on.

- There is no option to search for things in the build menu among all the objects. It is sorted into categories but that isn't enough in my opinion if you are looking for a specific item.

- There is a severe lack of variety of floors, wall papers, and doors.

Other:
- Most of the nice mods on the workshop are abandoned, and info about the game is kinda sparse online if you need help with something. This isn't really a game issue but it is something to note.

- Game can occasionally succumb to small memory leaks, but this is common in most Unity based programs from my experience. You may notice occasional jitter or lag spikes even on a fast machine.",1700912707,1700912707,False,3,0,0.488719314336776733,0,True,False,False

It's perfect for people with medical knowledge or who have a special interest in medicine like me, and you will learn from playing this :) I love the detail you can get into, it reminds me of using TM:PE in cities skylines- you can decide each individual action for as many patients as you want, or you can sit back and let the game do most of the work. It's never very laggy which is saying something because I'm a fake gamer playing on a 2013 macbook. It doesn't get boring because it's can be so fast-paced, and once you've learned how to treat different things you get a lot of satisfaction from saving a really difficult case. The DLC is very worth the price in my opinion, and it isn't one of those games where there's a new DLC that adds almost nothing every month. 

After 350 hours there are a few things I'd really love to see added to the game for more advanced players with bigger hospitals:
 
-More detail in the 'take over patients' feature: currently there is only the option to take over all patients for a department or not, but it would be great to see the ability to take over patients from clinic or hopitalisation, and by hazard level. For example take over medium risk or higher in the hospitalisation part of the emergency department.

-Standard Procedures: it would be really helpful to be able to set up a standard procedure for certain injuries/illnesses once diagnosed. This happens in real life for things like sepsis and would be very helpful in game, especially for more difficult cases like traumatic brain injuries or traumatic cardiac arrests. For example, brain injury x, y, or z is diagnosed, so automatically do examinations a, b, and c followed by treatments 1, 2, and 3. This could save a lot of time and frustration for me at least. Additionally, being able to automatically take over patients with certain diagnoses could be helpful.

- In a similar vein (lol) ability to cancel or automatically apply a department for specific illnesses: often very high risk injuries would be better in the ICU, but they automatically transfer to their respective specialisation before crashing. Many times in my runs, this time between diagnosis, wait, transfer, crash, treatment, wait, transfer to ICU, only then being able to start more exams or treatments, is the difference between life and death for the patient. If you could set, for example, a traumatic cardiac arrest to always be transferred to ICU in stead of to cardiology, this would save a lot of time and frustration. This is usually what makes getting x amount of days without a lost patient so difficult for me. 

Overall there are a few ways to improve, but this is a genuinely great game, and you can definitely lose yourself for a long time in it. Would seriously recommend if you're looking for a new obsession!",1698841960,1698841960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Realism: The game has been praised for its realism, particularly regarding medical conditions and the portrayal of hospital activities. Reviewers appreciated the realistic depiction of tests, surgeries, procedures, and diseases​.

Development: Regret was expressed that the development of the game seems to have ceased, which could impact the long-term appeal of the game​.
Concerns were also raised that the game wasn't further developed and the DLCs might be more a method of making money rather than genuinely improving the game.

Between leaving the doctors to sort it out or micro-managing each case, I preferred the latter which was easier to do on most occasions.

It's like playing house, but with life and death decisions and a lot more sterile gloves.

From the moment you start your medical odyssey in Project Hospital, you'll be transported into the world of healthcare. You'll create your own hospital from the ground up, and that's where the fun (and chaos) begins.

The game offers an incredible depth of realism. You'll be juggling patients, doctors, nurses, and other staff while managing your budget and ensuring that every corner of your hospital is spotless. But just like in a real hospital, chaos can ensue at any moment.

The diagnostics and treatment process is like piecing together a complex puzzle. You'll be relying on a multitude of tests, doctors, and medical equipment to figure out what's ailing your patients. And if you make a wrong diagnosis, well, you'll be praying that the malpractice insurance covers it.

You'll also need to think about layout and design. A hospital isn't just about medicine; it's also about patient comfort and the efficiency of your staff. But beware, a misplaced vending machine can cause more chaos than you'd expect.

The challenge in Project Hospital isn't just in saving lives; it's in keeping your staff happy and the hospital running efficiently. You'll need to hire and train your staff, manage their workload, and make sure they get enough coffee breaks to prevent nervous breakdowns. After all, even virtual doctors need their caffeine.

And when things do go wrong, the game can be both funny and frustrating. Patients complaining about the food, doctors having meltdowns in the break room, and janitors endlessly cleaning the same spot - it's all part of the hospital experience.

But Project Hospital isn't just about the struggle; it's about the reward of seeing your hospital grow and succeed. You'll watch as your small clinic evolves into a sprawling medical complex with state-of-the-art facilities and a team of top-notch doctors.

In conclusion, Project Hospital is the ultimate simulation for anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to run a hospital. It's a game that combines realism with humor and challenge with reward.

In my review of Project Hospital, I've identified some areas that could use improvement in terms of gameplay, particularly in the tutorial, user interface (UI), and event mechanics. These aspects play a crucial role in shaping the overall gaming experience, and addressing these concerns could lead to a more enjoyable and user-friendly game.


[b]The Tutoria[/b]l:
One of the primary issues I encountered in Project Hospital is the tutorial. While it attempts to guide players through the game's mechanics, it falls short in a few key areas. For instance, it often relies on textual descriptions rather than visually demonstrating where to click on the UI, leading to confusion among players. To enhance the learning experience, it would be beneficial to incorporate more visual cues and interactive demonstrations, ensuring that players can easily grasp the game's concepts.


Another drawback of the tutorial is its uneven distribution of information. For example, Tutorial 3 delves into the hiring process, which would have been better suited for Tutorial 2. This inconsistency disrupts the flow of information and can leave players feeling disjointed in their understanding of the game's mechanics.


[b]The UI[/b]:
Project Hospital's UI presents another set of challenges. One of the most noticeable issues is the inconsistent sizing of elements. Some elements appear disproportionately large, while others are too small, resulting in an unbalanced and visually unappealing interface. To provide a more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience, a more consistent sizing scheme should be adopted.


Furthermore, certain elements within the UI lack clear visual cues to indicate whether they are enabled or disabled. This ambiguity can frustrate players, as they struggle to determine whether they can interact with specific components, potentially leading to errors. Enhancing visual feedback within the UI would go a long way in improving user navigation and overall satisfaction.


[b]Events[/b]:
In Project Hospital, events play a significant role in gameplay. However, there is a notable flaw related to staff scheduling during day-to-night shifts. The current system struggles to manage this transition seamlessly, often resulting in errors or failures. Additionally, events occurring mere minutes before the night shift can lead to failure of the event do to the night shift[/spoiler]


[b]Conclusion[/b]:
In conclusion, Project Hospital offers a unique and engaging hospital simulation experience. However, there are critical areas that require attention to enhance user satisfaction and provide a more intuitive and enjoyable gaming experience. Addressing the issues with the tutorial, refining the UI elements, and smoothing out event mechanics are essential steps toward achieving these goals. With these improvements, Project Hospital has the potential to become an even more immersive and captivating gaming experience for players.",1575551019,1694590991,False,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False

I played it a few years ago and there were a lot of issues with what items were mandatory for what procedures.  It's made great strides to be better about making that known as you build, so things are more transparent.

Some of the RNG in the game is maddening.  Having the same three patients collapse every time the doctors in the ICU get them stable gets annoying.  Having a timer that says how long they need to remain in the hospital before they can be released would also help.  Ok, they need IV medication.  For how long?  Until the RNG wants me to let them go?  Or until the RNG kills them?  There's too much controlled by factors that the doctors, and therefore the hospital, would know.  Having it be behind RNG is just dumb.  At that point, player has no agency and there's no reason to play the game, because the game decides through RNG if you do well or not.  I can already hear every dumb, trollish fanboy pointing out there's an option to ""Transfer patients instead of having them die.""  That's not a fix to the same patient, intubated in the ICU, collapsing ten times a night before dying.  That's just changing the name from ""dead"" to ""transferred"" because the game is jacked. Not a fix.

The final thing, is when doctors get themselves in a hole because they screwed their tests and can't pinpoint the diagnosis, having all of those tests unavailable is dumb.  Another doc, or even the same doc, should be able to perform the same tests again.  Same thing with bloodwork, X-Ray, MRI, etc, etc, etc. 

Game's got a long way to go before I'd recommend others buying it.





Edit 9/11/23
Based on advice, I found a lot of stuff needs to be added to rooms instead of just using the prefabs.  This greatly reduced mortality.  Still, the game needs to be fixed so this is known.  Wikis and forums shouldn't have to carry a bad tutorial.


Dropped the campaign and made a hospital from the ground.  Been doing great, with 5 departments.  Half a million saved up, so time to add another department soon.  Working on climbing the insurance ladder to get better payouts.  The events seem, like much of the game, poorly done.  I'll get nine patients, give them all a blue label, and then drop the critical label as each one is diagnosed.  I found it's the best way to handle the influx and give those patients priority, since it's timed.  Why do you get 16 hours (real time minutes) to get through nine accident patients?  Because it is what it is.  What happens when five need surgeries?  Well, you just..  fail.

At this point, I've got four events completed.  Had to save scum one of them.  Now I have an insurance quest to complete 3 more events.  So the events really become the game.  I've got 8 out of 9 patients handled, with ONE patient that's been diagnosed, and eight ""hours"" left, but my doctors won't go give him his steroid.  I've tried save scumming.  I've got him on critical and no other patient in my hospital on critical.  Two save scums.  I don't know how to change priority other than making them critical.  So I'm just kinda stuck on a mission I'm going to fail.

The game can be a lot of fun, but you have to run it with the wiki open to get the hospital running well.  Then you run into more problems with game mechanics.  For as fun as the game is, it almost always ends in frustration because for how much ""control"" the game gives you, you really never have the ability to tell a doctor to go and do something.  Until that's addressed, the rest of the mechanics fall apart.  Events just make it that much worse, as the mechanics of doctors doing as they want, regardless of priority, works directly against the event mechanic, which works hand-in-hand with the insurance quests.  It's a house of cards in a breeze.  I'm not going into the doctor and removing all his other patients so he just dispenses meds to my one remaining event patient.  I shouldn't hand to, and at that point the player's being asked to break the game instead of play it.",1662245118,1694470578,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Building his own hospital is well done.

The UI in general is poorly design. It's very hard to navigate and understand how to read and use all the different panels.
Despite the presence of an in-game tutorial, the game will never help you understand how to do something. It's pure trial and error.
It's really hard to understand how to improve the efficiency and the overall quality of your hospital. It's easy too see that a department is missing or a specific room. ""Which one ? and How ?"" are the most difficult question in this game. Furthermore, there is no real wiki page or encyclopedia.

If you don't have any interest/knowledge of healthcare it might just seems very abstract or un-relatable. 

If you are a medic, it might seems a little dumbed down (still complex for a game but not as complex or realistic as real healthcare). Don't get me wrong, I don't think any game could capture this so it really is the best game out there in the healthcare space. Well done oxymoron

Some times you can't fully diagnosis or treat something because your clinic lacks the required facility. Learning how facilities interact with each other and where to place them is the hardest part. And how many of them you should have given the number of patients that need the same facility.

Its a pretty interesting game but it has a small learning curve. I would also say that the first mission is hard even after the tutorials. I restarted it a few times to understand how to be successful. 

One of the things i liked were pre-built rooms that you can drop in if you don't care about the requirements of said room especially when you are first learning the game. You can also make a selection to move entire rooms to better organize the clinic. Like if you wanted to add a floor and move all rooms for radiology on the same floor.

The graphics look decent and the camera angles are somewhat limited. Decorations can be placed but there's many limitations regarding posters, for example posters cannot be placed behind a small plant or behind a bench etc.

DLCs and Workshop also introduce many new diseases and departments, making the experience even more realistic. I'd rate it on an 8/10 and urge those who wish to play a modernized Theme Hospital to get a hold of this game.

It takes a more dry realistic approach to running a hospital than Two Point but gamey enough to make it a game in the business sim / base builder variety. The conditions are realistic.

It starts as a general clinic before expanding into inpatient care, an emergency department, ICU, surgeries, etc. Gradual expansion is the key - focus on the basics of each stage before overextending - don't be afraid to send people away if you don't have the facilities just yet. (and as for the ICU... well, some people just can't be saved.)

You get more patients through insurance contracts, which work as the mission system in this game and although you can only take on a few insurance companies at a time, you can drop one to take on another as you finish their tasks and take on another set, and probably by the time you've exhausted their possibilities you're in the end game of having a huge facility anyway.

Graphics are... they're effective. Old school 2.5D isometric, basically, but they get the point across. A lot of objects and decorations, building isn't difficult. I get lazy and rely on the prefabs a fair bit, although the room can defined first, including individual wards (anyone who's been stuck in a ward next to someone who groans all night will appreciate this), and then the necessarily objects placed individually to fit the rooms function as they should.
The UI has its quirks but I've seen worse. Micromanaging isn't onerous, although sometimes if I'm rebuilding a section or lab, reassigning staff can be a bit of chore.

I have no issue giving it a thumbs up; it's a solid, moderately challenging, business sim with a certain amount of flexibility in building things the way you want, and I think the devs have done a good job of delivering what's on the cover.",1689122544,1689122544,True,15,0,0.6916465163230896,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately the mechanics are very intransparent and for example it is very unclear why a certain patient is not being taken care of.

In addition to this lack of clarity, the UI is atrocious. You need to keep switching between menus to organize the various aspects of your hospital. Additionally I have difficulties knowing what certain rooms do or even where the rooms are. This is especially apparent in the campaign levels where you are thrown into an unknown hospital, which are usually badly designed (on purpose), so it is a nightmare to orientate yourself.

Lastly, this is again about the UI, there are a lot of different windows that can be opened (e.g. staff list, patient portfolio, staff portfolio, etc...). This leads to a very cluttered UI and the controls for organizing these windows is also really bad.

My favorite guide describes it as a ""Lovecraftian hellscape of hidden features, quirks, bugs and finnicky systems."" I couldn't have put it better myself. The tutorials for this game are insufficient. I have studied this game like a scientist studies the minute particles of the universe, carefully isolating variables and changing them one at a time to figure out what it is that makes it tick - where along the way did this patient die, and why?

In that sense, it's almost like a production line management game, but the rules are either obscure or just don't make any sense at all. I can place a whole table in front of the door and people can still go to and fro, but my doctors will order examinations when all of the patients symptoms are known, while simultaneously not prescribing treatment for their diagnosed illness.

Following best practices and having a plan in place from the beginning seems to be a deal breaker in the mid-to-late game stages. If you set up your labs and radiology wrong and leave it like that while you expand your hospital operations you're fucked.

What makes this game special is the building of the hospital / clinic and the extensive amount of symptoms and illnesses there are for the patients.

Regarding the building:

You can either build normally (everything costs and you are building / adding structures as you are progressing) or in sandbox. The structures, furniture, decoration and medical equipment is all customisable to a certain extent, including different colours. But it would be a shame if you would only buy the game for the building part, in my humble opinion.

Regarding the actual gameplay:

The gameplay is very unique, you start with a certain amount of money and with completing certain objectives you receive more money and unlock new departments, ambulances and the hospitalisation.

You will need to balance your finances in the later part of the game, as in the beginning the insurance companies will practically throw money at you for completing objectives, giving you much freedom to build and grow your hospital.

Some cases can be difficult to solve but the truly difficult part will be the emergency cases with the ambulances. The patients will actually die if you are either understaffed, underequipped or take too much time figuring out what the issue is with your case. They make the game more replayable, as they will give you (or at least me lol) a feeling of urgency and and stress, which is rarely the case with the regular cases. The regular cases are (except in doctor mode) assisted by the game with logical reasoning from the doctor. Meaning if someone enters with pain in the foot, it won't give you the option to draw blood or check the breathing, as this would not make sense.

The dlcs are fine, not game-changing but nice. What is standing out is Doctor Mode. Doctor Mode makes the regular cases more challenging, as you are no longer assisted by the game and have to figure the symptoms and illnesses out completely on your own.

Final thoughts:

They could improve little things like the building of the different floors which is kinda clunky. And it would be amazing to further improve the traits of your personnel and patients or even implement a request system from the staff or patients, etc.

It's got a bit to do with management compared to other hospital tycoons but my absolute favorite part is the free DLC Doctor Mode.
I've very much enjoyed the doctor mode and found it to be at least somewhat educational as well!
Being able to build the hospital is cute and I like filling the rooms with little extras.

I do have a couple complaints though.
I feel like sometimes my doctors aren't prioritizing a dying patient properly sometimes. (I've had a patient who went into septic shock like 5 times and I swear the doctor was playing tennis or something.)
I think my doctors over-analyze patients. I want them set to diagnose a patient to get a 100% certainty of a symptom but there are times where the patient will already have their diagnosis and the doctor will still send them over for labs which wastes the patient's time and floods the labs.
Doctors seem to have a tendency to overwork themselves regardless of if they have the hard worker trait or not. I would at least appreciate being able to tell a doctor to go on break instead of having their bladder explode while they diagnose the next 5 patients.

I'm not sure if the game still gets patches but if it does, I would love an option to tell staff members to go to certain areas (This would be great for janitors especially.) and a button to tell staff members to go on break to fill their needs.
Otherwise, I heavily enjoy this game! I especially like how I can play most of it using just the mouse, which is an accessability thing I very much enjoy.",1682462822,1682462822,True,3,0,0.561403512954711914,0,True,False,False

It is a lot of trial and error to figure out what works and what doesn't for the flow of the hospital. My favourite aspects of the game is the ability to ""control"" the patients in ways of choosing the next diagnostic testing, reviewing the different options of diagnosis, and prescribing the correct treatments. 

There is a lot of flexibility in the size and shape of a hospital to build as well. And I don't feel pressured to pay wages to doctors threatening to strike. There's also not a set of predetermined maps but rather a few optional campaigns to explore and play or there's the option to build in sandbox mode. 

I am still learning a lot about the game and am grateful for some of the guidance I've had and the ability to watch some YouTube videos. The mechanics of the game take some getting use to, for example you have to be in the Emergency department management mode to change the layout of Emerg or hire/dismiss Emerg doctors, plus you need certain rooms and certain number of doctors/nurses to make certain departments work. But it's fun to explore and learn as you go. If you mess up - restart and have a blast again!

The obvious Bad News is that there isn't a large list of wacky diseases and a subsequent list of wacky, one-device rooms to treat them in (RIP bloaty head).  The good news is that in terms of managing the queues, your doctors can treat entire patient lines possibly without them having to leave the GP's office.  

The game lets you build fully-furnished prefabs for every treatment line, however manually laying your rooms can be a bit unintuitive, this is one where you need to play the tutorial to understand required buildings and the hospital flowchart.  A positive to laying your rooms out manually however is that you don't require walls for all your rooms, so pathing is much easier when you want to make a 'workstation' within a greater department.  It really saves a lot of time when a nurse can leave the staff room to check on regular ward patients, and then move to the high-dependency ward and stretcher someone into surgery and then go back to the staff room without going through a single door.

But there are some really major flaws that have to be fixed by mods in order to make the game playable.

I'm not even sure the first one CAN be fixed by a mod.. The game only sends patients a set of patients instead of there just being random walk-ins or people showing up randomly in ambulances. Just doesn't feel very authentic

Another is that there's no emergency surgery options, and if you have even slight staffing issues surgery can take forever and can result in a patient dying...

Lastly the financials are a bit wonky.  You get very little back from patients, even those that have been in the hospital on ICU or taking up a bed for days on end the most you will get is about $5000 and when you're paying wages to staff that's comparable to the real world that just doesn't make any sense.

To go hand in hand with the above issue is that you are pressured with popups and warnings that you cant treat patients and this makes you want to expand your hospital but there's just no way to make money fast enough (even with the grants they hand out) to make expanding really... viable

I think the idea they are going for is that you get the basics setup then you work on getting things like patient and staff happiness up but in order to do this you need to spend money you don't have and the whole thing just feels kinda meh to play.

So protip for the devs... People don't care what hospitals loot like, they care about 2 things... cleanliness and when they can leave.",1679186405,1679186405,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One example:  I only had one lab for blood test and 8 departments sending patients for blood work. It got overwhelmed very quickly. Eventually, the blood tests took too long to come back and some patients that had serious blood diseases or complications started passing away, filling up the morgue.

1) commuting why not have car parking be needed for all your staff and their cars or the meany patients after all they wouldn't all walk in there should be carpooling and maybe even a bus stop. 

2) not every patient should be alone some should have a spouse or partner or parent and child.

3) adding in child avatars I don't know about you but as a kid, I went in to get fixed up from having the flu to getting stitches. 

4) more departments like adding kids can add in maternity or even add in things like transplants and organ donors like having someone sitting in your wards ready to die at any moment as you wait for a car crash victim who can't be saved and have to rush your surgery team to get the good parts or even having people go into comas and the like.

5) maybe a social system where your doctors can become friends or lovers or even rivals needing you to rework shifts as well as each patient being a real person coming back to doctors they like maybe even making a sort of family doctor who would know them better and know what they could have in their family and thus seeing the story of the town your hospital is running in instead of them just being random injury and sickness.

Project Hospital is very detailed, and I like that the game lets you decide what level of minutia you want to manage. I played more macro while I learned how to play and custom designed every room on my fourth build. Once I fully built out one hospital with every ward, I was bored. I like sandbox mode better than the campaign, as the campaign is tedious. I'd rather wash dishes if I was in the mood for chores. My other complaint is that the flow of patients takes an otherwise realistic sim to pure nonsense. For example, there is a disease outbreak, and everyone comes in with a different exotic disease. Like a bunch of explorers from all around Africa met at a convention straight from the jungles, so now one person has marburg fever and another ebola. It makes no sense. Another thing I find funny is there are several types of wards, but no maternity ward. I take it the developers are all single men.

The game-play is pretty much real-world, with patients presenting with symptoms of actual diseases and conditions, not silly made-up ones.  Patients can even present with COVID-19.   Project Hospital is a highly complex game with wonderful detail.

BUT -- as a former registered nurse, I cringe at some of the things I see in the game.  People with fractures of foot, ankle, or leg walking around?  Where are the wheelchairs?  A patient waiting for surgery in the morning gets up and eats a snack right before going into surgery.  That is a big no-no.   The patient I saw doing that was having surgery for her fractured mandible (jawbone).  How could she even eat at all?  Another patient came in with a fractured finger, and comes out with an arm cast on!  An arm cast won't do a fractured finger much good, really.  The finger should just be splinted.  It is certainly silly to see the patients who have been hospitalized overnight, some of them waiting for surgery in the morning, get up and walk out of the hospital as soon as it opens in the morning without having their surgery!  That's just bizarre.  But it is just a game, and we must go with the flow.

One of the biggest challenges is to build a hospital, and that is not easy to do!  And it can also be frustrating.  I put in one section of a department that was required.  I used the ""pre-fab"" for that section, a four-bed ward.   The game kept telling me I didn't have that ward, when I doggone well did, and it was one that came with all the equipment needed.  But it kept telling me I didn't have it.  So I demolished the one I had put in, and put in the SAME pre-fab in the same location, and the game acknowledged that I did have that ward in place.  There is very little instruction in most walkthroughs on the mechanics of the game.  The only one I found that does have such information is at Gamepressure.com:  https://guides.gamepressure.com/project-hospital/.  Even this guide does not cover all the mechanics.  

Some of the terminology takes some getting used to for American players.  One unit is called the High Dependency Unit.  In American usage, that would be the Critical Care Unit.  ""Orthopaedy"" is their word for what we call Orthopedics.  And so on.  It doesn't take much time to figure out what the terms mean.  The learning curve for the game is steep.  I've had to trash a number of games, but I learn each time I do that, and can get further in the game each time I start over.  I must confess that I'm 75, but I've also been playing computer games since the late 1970s.  Give Project Hospital a try.",1675584662,1675584662,True,235,11,0.929325580596923828,1,True,False,False

If you find the ""nuts and bolts"" of diagnosis and medicine interesting (and it doesn't hurt if you have at least some real-world knowledge of those subjects) you'll enjoy this game but, even then, it only goes so far.
As you advance into the last stages of a career/campaign you get a lot of variety in the types of injuries and illnesses you encounter, and even some bits of variety in the mechanics of actually dealing with them, but the vast majority of what you encounter will be typical, uninteresting ailments that you will diagnose and treat with a robotic-ness honed from the previous 500 times you diagnosed and treated a patient with the exact same condition.
The building and designing of your hospital and departments is all very well-done, and generally easy to understand and start using.
This is a game that I find I keep coming back to play in relatively short bursts, rather than one I just want to play all day. It's all executed well, and the devs should be very proud of it. I've tried all the DLC, and it's all worthwhile; adding meaningful improvements on the original product.

I spent 5 minutes trying understand what the game expected of me when I was asked to hire a doctor. I gave up when the building tutorial asked me to create a radiation room.

Hospitals deal with more than just illness and injury. I would love to see pregnancies and maternity wards, and even dealing with cancers and disabilities.

The building mechanics are somewhat comparable to prison architect, in the way that you assign and furnish rooms to make them functional. The ability to take over patients yourself and assign diagnostic and treatment steps is a neat idea.

Unfortunately, the AI is noticeably bad. The path finding is so messy that people might even walk past a door to the room they want to be in, just to walk down three corridors to enter the same room through another door (which in total takes half a minute instead of 2 seconds). That problem isn't limited to single agents either, but rather all of them will follow such inefficient paths which sums up to a lot of lost time. Often times you feel forced to design your hospital in such a way that paths are unambiguous (meaning the AI doesn't have a choice between multiple paths). Also, the AI is unable to queue for things. If they need to wait 1 second for a waiting room seat to become free, they already get the ""Couldn't sit"" debuff. If the sink is occupied when they leave the bathroom stall, they will not wait for it to become available, but rather instantly leave the bathroom and get the ""Couldn't wash hands"" debuff. When a patient collapses while a low priority treatment is queued, they doctors might ignore this patient until the scheduled treatment is done and only then start to take care of the collapse, e. g. by starting ventilation.

What's especially sad is that it feels like some of this issues should in theory be a rather simple fix. Path finding for example is pretty much figured out, especially considering that this game uses a simple 2D grid.

Even on the hardest difficulty, once you've done all the appropriate tests and uncovered all the signs/symptoms, the correct diagnosis is highlighted for you to immediately pick. I'd love it if you still had to use your own brain to pick the correct diagnosis BASED on all the signs/symptoms you've uncovered. Even moreso, the treatments are also told to you, leaving no room for you to decide how to treat what you've diagnosed.

I will say this game could use a LITTLE more polish with the U.I. and the build mode. For example, it would be nice to have some keyboard shortcuts for a lot of things that you currently have to use the mouse for. Getting to/switching between character lists and profiles can be a bit of a hassle/confusing at times. Moving an employee's workstation is impossible right now unless you build an entire new room and assign them to that one, or fire them. There's no way to simply unassign an employee from a workstation. Not having a searchbar for things in build mode. It would also be nice to set your camera to automatically follow a patient/employee around the hospital as they move. Things like this get in the way of what otherwise is a very good game.

Despite all this, running all the different tests on a patient to narrow down their diagnosis and going down the path to treatment for them is a very satisfying process, and its very fun to try to design your hospital to make it comfortable and aesthetically appealing while also being profitable and efficient.",1674496025,1674512614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the selling point of this game is it's ""realism"". There are just way too many issues to recommend it.

There is one part of this game that shines. That part being doctor mode, but only when you've built your own clinic in sandbox. However the shine fades fast as soon as you start adding wards. The more departments you add all the problems the game has multiply exponentially to the point I just completely lose interest and go back to playing with just a clinic.

The game seems unnecessarily over complicated. Which might be manageable if the UI wasn't so awful.

The UI is awful. It really has to be seen to be believed. You can't see most of the information you need at a glance, because you'd need to open a series of separate windows to see it, and then you can't see anything behind it. E.g. If you open the list of patients in your hospital now you can't see anything else.

The tutorials are next to useless, by the end of the third one I still had no idea what I was supposed to be doing so had to spend hours watching guides on youtube and making notes.

The campaign is garbage tier. It feels very much like an afterthought. There are only 3 stages, and the first one you can just cheese by selling all the equipment to pay off the debt. I was gobsmacked when that actually worked.

The problems with the UI and the tutorials are compounded by the fact I came across numerous bugs and oddities while playing and I had no idea whether I was doing something wrong or it was a bug. I then had to spend ages trawling the forums to figure it out. My ""playtime"" is misleading as at least 10 hours of that I had the game minimised while either watching video guides or searching through forums for bug fixes/workarounds.",1674086926,1674086926,False,7,0,0.500375449657440186,0,True,False,False

It seems like this would be a fun game, but even trying to find guides seem to just cover the basics and not how to deal with the confusing UI. 

Overall, a campaign that starts smaller and slowly adds rooms/departments to your hospital would have been more engaging, but as it stands I just let the game run on auto for the day shift, then seemed to need a surgeon, but there was no apparent way to assign them and I finally threw in the towel.

The UI is a bit awkward, I have to admit.  It might be the reason why less than 90% of players have ever reached the first achievement ""treated a patient""!  But after getting a hang of the UI, I see a very enjoyable game here to be played.  And it has the educational value of teaching about various illnesses, means of diagnosing them, and treatments.

I really enjoy the first phase of the game, which has nothing to do with medicine.  You get to design the building layout and all the different rooms you'll be able to work with at first, on a limited budget.  This plays roughly like a Tetris game rotating and trying to fit room templates.  If you don't want to use the templates you can design the rooms completely from scratch, which will probably be more efficient.  Once you've built your clinic, you can hire employees and once everything is in place your clinic opens to the public, and the sick people come streaming in!

The main game-play becomes a test of how to diagnose all the possible illnesses and remove any doubt as to what treatment is appropriate for a given patient.  But don't over-analyze or you'll waste time that could be spent on other patients who are suffering in the waiting room.  I do this by only setting up maybe 2 tests at a time before adding new ones, in case one test explains everything.  Finally treat the patient and send him home, and it's money in the bank!

The game could maybe be improved by showing just how brutally overpriced healthcare is for the United States.  It would be nice if the people cried or screamed ""I'm bankrupt now!  Waaaa!!""  But as it is, the game is still very engaging and has high immersion.

As an architect, you will be able to design your hospital and tweak every detail should you wish – or just use one of the pre-defined models offered. As a manager you can “contract different insurance companies to gain access to patients with more interesting medical conditions.” And as a doctor you can use the equipment you have built to “perform examinations, laboratory tests and use various equipment to solve the diagnostic puzzles”.

You’ll need to plan the construction and layout, manage staff, and research more advanced technologies to deal with increasingly complicated conditions. It's all a lot of hard work. Or an absolute treat, if you’re into that kind of thing.

This is the type of game for me where I will lose track of time, because there is so much fine tuning during the building process I face.  Much in the vein of Cities Skylines and Sim City have been for me.

It takes a bit of understanding and planning out your hospital to get the most out of it.  Hiring the right doctors, nurses, specialists, biologists and so on takes real thought.  Don't be afraid of looking at their hidden traits, because it really makes your hospital work better.  For example, don't hire those that have the dirty feet icon.  Another is the bird and owl icons.  Those professionals work better during day or night.  Learn from the tutorials and campaigns, they really help you with a start-from-scratch build.

I've only got around 25 hours in the game since I picked it up a few days ago (as of 11/2022), but I've learned an awful lot about how the mechanics of the game works.  As for replayability, I believe that is baked into the current game because in you have many things you can do with what's there now.

Oh dear, why? I like the theme, I love the graphic, I adore the mechanic, but why it's not the best hospital game I ever play?? Project Hospital has it own charm unlike any game I ever play before...

But what wrong with my love here? It's the financial problem and poor design decision. The cash flow in this game is somewhat depending too much on the real world currency?? Buying one x-ray machine or those brain scan device could cause my hospital bankrupt in a second. Otherwise I may have to play for many hours until I got enough money to get one. I knew it's very realistic, but probably too much to enjoy??

Many design decision are weird too, for example, when I recruit a new employee I got a random stat and level so wild. Just open a new hospital? Here are highest rank doctors with salary that can make you bankrupt in a week, don't like them? you can pay (not cheap) to random again, here you go, oh wait you got another set of highest rank doctors we can offer again... I mean, come on, if you try to simulate a real world mechanic, why don't you allow to have some recruitment specification here.

It pauses when things happen, so it's a good game to play for an hour while the laundry or dishwasher are doing their thing.

I don't get a lot of time to unwind these days and this game is all the complexity I want in a Simulation or Management game while still being respectful of my time. It doesn't expect you to memorize an encyclopedia's worth of data - everything you need to know can be quickly checked by clicking on a sensible icon to bring up another menu or hovering for a tooltip. Yet, it still has a learning curve and your first attempt or two will fail badly if you don't organize well.

That being said, you can't play the game well by acting as if it is turn based and only doing things when it auto-pauses.

There is some information that you must get just by watching: there isn't a statistic anywhere I've seen for travel or ""filling needs"" times, so if certain doctors or nurses are spending half the day walking to/from the cafeteria you have to see that with your own eyes and sort out what you want to do about it. Is a stool sample needed? The patient is going to walk to the nearest available toilet first, so two small bathrooms can be much more efficient than one big one. Getting a feel for a good layout takes time, and this game really is all about the macro-management level. You can use micro-management to get through a tough spot if you need to make money to fix something that wasn’t working well, but that’s quite literally the bandage you put on to give the person with a broken arm the ‘fast treatment’ mood buff so they don’t mind how dirty the floors are in this department.",1661095526,1666578291,True,70,1,0.876908302307128906,0,True,False,False

The only thing I wish this game had is a sort of infinite money mode for while you are learning the game and experimenting with the different departments and setups and layouts.

EDIT: After playing the game for a long time, I can say that I still like it but:
-Staff limits are a little bit restrictive //fixed
-Game seems to be kind of a buggy mess at times //probably my own fault, but still
-The AIs are not the best (Have had patients collapse because they went between the vending machine and the bathroom 3-4 times) //still happens, more of a design issue than anything. AIs walk slow
-Sometimes the doctors just don't treat the patients //Fixed
Overall, I still recommend the game, after all, the save files are pretty easy to hack (adding money, etc) and the game is easily tweaked and modded to support your needs (staff size can be increased, satisfaction modifiers can be adjusted, etc). If you are looking for a good building game, this is probably the game to look for. Keep in mind though, that this game can be very frustrating at times, especially when it comes to the AIs in the game.

If I had any one suggestion to the developers, It'd be to allow me to stagger shift change, so that I have an easier time with patients not dying during shift change.

Yes the tutorial and help guides do not provide much, but if spend a few hours in the sandbox, everything will come together. 

I spent 50 hours playing in the sandbox before I even tried to advance beyond the 2nd mission of the campaign. This is opposite for most games, where you follow the campaign, learn the game, then master it in the sandbox. 

Playing in sandbox I learned that while there are hundreds if not thousands (with the DLCs and Mods) of symptoms used to diagnose ailments, but your patients will only ever come into the hospital if their condition is something you can treat, with the equipment and expertise you currently have. 

As this game allows you to diagnose an ailment straight away without 100% confirming it, you can skip a few steps to get them treated if you know what you are looking for. As and example, if your patient has either Flu A or Flu B, you know Flu A will only appear if you have an infectious disease clinic, so if you don't it will always be Flu B, you can diagnose that and get them treated immediately without waiting for the microbiological test. Same thing with injured limbs, if you do not have an Othropedics clinic set up, it will always be a contusion, never a fracture or sprain. This will save you the time/resources to get an X-ray. Its the same with a lot of rare diseases, if the treatment is not something you are able to provide, the patient will likely never have that condition, so you can rule those out as being the condition. 

The game progresses completely at your pace, using the insurance intake as the throttle. If you only build a small emergency clinic with a bathroom, waiting room, and two doctor's offices, you will never be overwhelmed, as your intake is limited by reaching insurance company milestones, if you don't meet them, you don't get more patients, which keeps you from growing, but also from getting overwhelmed.

The first time I started playing and did the tutorial and got to the building - I almost uninstalled haha...I became too frustrated too quickly.

Gameplay wise, I love getting all the different illnesses and trying to decipher where to send the patients once the initial emergency visitation.

Project Hospital is a truly great game. I personally love hospitals and all things to do with medicine, but many friends of mine don't, yet they still adore this game. It mixes simplicity with real life medical scenarios, allowing you to feel like a doctor as you go around trying to treat people.

DLCs: 

I own all the DLCs, they are all amazing. I especially like Infectious Diseases, although I would recommend getting them all if you are able to. 

EVEN BETTER IF:

I would love it if other departments were added in such as psychiatry, OB-GYN, and pediatrics. Multiplayer would also be a neat feature.

Project Hospital is an amazing game, I highly recommend buying it.",1659153628,1659153628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It made me feel like I can lay back and just let it run for a couple of minutes each day to gain the achievements at hand. 

Nevertheless, it was not the case.

Getting through the Campaign 2 of the challenge was the most deceiving part of the game. You will really have to start being attentive of how you play it in order to surpass it.

Moreover, once you finally figure out what exactly is needed, then you can start enjoying the game again and overcome its challenges. This is by knowing what can be done in an hour or so of playing it.

Pros
 - Something about the graphics really makes it feel genuine. 
- The level of simulation is fantastic.
- Despite staring at my hospital for hours without blinking, there always seems to be something unique happening.
- Solid performance, never crashes.
- Replayability is endless.
- DLC adds great variety to the already well developed departments.
- Makes you feel like a designer.

Cons
- When I start playing this game I forget to do real life things, I don't think I've eaten today.
- My eyes hurt.
- No basements?

The game does a great job at portraying a patient's journey through a hospital, starting from the reception, going through the different doctors, diagnostic procedures like X-Rays and blood tests, and recovery procedures like medicine, surgery, and plain rest. It's enjoyably immersive to see how diagnosis is done through real symptoms, and each symptom has their own harmful effects and ways to suppress it; other hospital games usually act like the root cause of the disease is the one and only thing that will do harm and must be cured. There's many things you can build to support the full process, and you can eventually have a complete hospital that can support everything from heart diseases to brain surgeries. At the same time, you'll have to take care of your own staff, so that they aren't overworked and have access to food, restrooms, break times, and clean environment.

However, that's basically the only game loop. It's easy for a starting player to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of things you need to do for setting up a fully fledged hospital, but once you learn it, you just have to repeat it. There's no risk or thought process in doing so-- just get the staff with the good traits, and build whatever is required by patients at a given moment. This is extremely evident in the Challenge missions, which are supposedly the most difficult things you can possibly do in the game... and you complete every one of them by building more of any overcrowded rooms over time. Micromanaging a patient can add to the gameplay thanks to the great symptom discovery mechanic, but personally doing everything gets tiresome when you're approaching 100 patients per day, so you only *need* to do it on critical patients with a gaping hole on their head.

And so, this is definitely for more of a casual, meditative building game where you build up your hospital and then relax as you watch the workings of the hospital unfold by itself. Follow a patient around, watch brain surgeries, and look at doctors playing Solitaire on their computer while there's a patient collapsing in front of their office.",1658102652,1658102652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After plenty of years in development, the developers still keep too much information behind the scenes, and it will take us users too much work to figure out that the game does break or behave unstable with no clear symptoms unless one pays close attention.  This is symptomatic of an emphasis over the years by developers to ""deploy patches"" instead of properly working the game engine to make it stable.  

As a player of simulations for many years I can say that if there is one thing we users need from any simulation game it's stability.  One needs to know that if a simulation is supposed to behave in one way, it will.   Otherwise the game is not a simulation except maybe for chaos.  When a game has a years long track of people finding issues with the same concepts in the game, maybe it's not the people anymore that's the problem.  To the very least a developer needs to make a game reasonably understandable in its mechanics to the users.  If it's not, perhaps the developers should stop asking their customers to restart their games hopefully to avoid the game's bugs while they work on future patches (as I found in plenty of web posts addressing players' issues).  Maybe the engine was bad from the start, and a better one was needed long time ago.  Take a note from the Final Fantasy XIV playbook.  Just go and properly fix the mess.  There's nothing wrong with second chances, especially when the players' money is always 100% quality.  

It's been years that people seem to complaint of the same issues in this game.  It's the Steam Early Access mentality, where game developers are allowed to reel in a hopeful crowd into incomplete games, and often don't really go back to the drawing board to rewire the bad parts, instead focusing on ""adding and patching"", hoping to one day just do enough to get out of EA and charge for ""full release"" code.  

I am so disappointed as the game has great premise and some good details in implementation.  Yet after days of testing it, it's shocking that most issues that I have found apparently were reported at some point years back with basically the same conditions, and yet the issues are still there.  I've had it with this game.  Be careful about it!!",1655340624,1656486993,False,10,0,0.531932473182678223,0,True,False,False

While I really love this game and the different ways to play, there is definitely a steep learning curve when it comes to understanding the mechanics of both building and managing your hospital. The tutorials do an alright job in explaining the basics but trial and error (in my experience) is the only way to fully get the hang of gameplay. 

My only complaint about Project Hospital would be its lack of accessibility settings. As far as I am aware, the only customizable settings are the UI size, sound volume, and the colours of certain notifications. This game NEEDS to have the ability to rebind keys as the current set up 1) only works for certain keyboards (I play on a MacBook Air and some of the keys have other functions making them unusable in-game) and 2) isn't super intuitive. As well, with the amount of in-game text the ability to change the font size without changing the size of the UI is a must (perhaps the ability to bold text would do a similar job?). 

All this to say that I love the depth of this game and I really enjoy playing it. The things I dislike about it have nothing to do with the gameplay itself but are important to mention especially if you're someone who needs these accessibility features in a game.

I'm someone who grew up with Theme Hospital as one of my favorite all-time games, and when Two Point Hospital came out as its spiritual successor, I immediately bought it. And it's a good game too, but I realized that at this point I was looking for a medical game that was a little more in-depth. (I have no medical training or interest; I just wanted a deeper, more serious game.) So I gave this one a go.

And I'm now 123 hours into it over a period of a couple years. I finally have all the DLC (it's reasonably priced) and while I'm sure I'll get tired of the game again, it really takes a long time before you stop being surprised by things or start thinking you've seen everything the game has to offer. Literally every patient that walks into your hospital is different. Diagnosing and treating them is almost a totally unique experience every time.

It has been a while since I started but I do remember it seeming like a pretty daunting game at the start. It at least *seems* quite realistic. To have a functioning hospital at all, you'll need quite a few offices, rooms with the correct equipment, doctors and nurses working different shifts. To get surgeries going, you'll need doctors and nurses with specific specialties, as well as a functioning operating room. Every room has its own equipment requirements, but you can just build pre-fabs as well that have all the requirements met.

Like a real hospital, Project Hospital has many different departments you'll eventually need to build and hire staff to specialize in. As more seriously sick/injured patients come in, you'll need an ICU. Broken bones require an Orthopaedy (what we in the US would call Orthopedics) unit. Vision or brain issues require a neurology department. And it just goes on like that. The last two DLC's are extra departments that deal with ""traumatology"" (there is a ""Trauma Center"" already built into the game as part of the ER, but traumatology deals with things like burns and poisons) and infectious diseases - the latter of which is actually pretty difficult because the patients you receive can infect the entire hospital. So you actually need to think about the design of your overall hospital in keeping patients separate.

Patients arrive both on their own as well as through ambulances and later with traumatology, helicopters. There's a constant stream being sent through insurance companies you contract with, but later there will be ""events"" like epidemics, large accidents or terrorist attacks where you may receive many patients all at once. You earn rewards (like more daily patients or extra money) for completing these events within a certain timeframe, and are penalized similarly if you don't.

The game itself boils down to getting all your patients diagnosed and treated correctly. As things progress, this gets harder and harder. For example, late in the game you may get a patient with 10 hidden symptoms, any number of which you can see are life-threatening (represented by a pulsing icon; you can turn this off for even more difficulty). You'll need to run various tests to uncover at least the most dangerous symptoms - the less dangerous ones you can either try to find or leave alone to save time. Like in real life, knowing which symptoms are likely related and which tests are most likely to uncover them is the key to diagnosing problems quickly, before the patient ""collapses"" (code blue!) and potentially dies. A patient can collapse several times during diagnosis and treatment and it's always harrowing when that happens. Doctors and nurses run towards the patient and administer life-saving measures. Usually the third or fourth collapse is the last, and the patient dies. If you've built the required room, you can then run an autopsy to find what you missed!

If you can't tell, I kinda love this game. It's everything I was looking for. Is it perfect? No. Some things are frustrating, like when doctors are occasionally just sitting around watching YouTube or playing Solitaire while you've prescribed some important treatment for a life-threatening symptom. But I imagine that's probably kinda like real life.

Also, there's just so much you need to know and keep track of in the game that it's sometimes hard to know why something's not working. For example, you might have a patient complaining that they've been waiting a really long time for a treatment, surgery or diagnostic test, and it's often not clear why. For surgeries, you can pull up the surgical schedule for a given department to see if anyone's ahead of that patient, but you can't do that for, say, a diagnostic room or some piece of random equipment that's actually already in the same room with the patient. (Like the ICU, which has a lot of stuff itself.) You can theoretically click an actual ""code blue"" button so non-critical patients are treated like critical ones, but it doesn't seem to do much and obviously doesn't do anything if the patient is already critical.

And there is a weird design choice where only doctors in one department can prescribe a B-Complex Supplement; not even ICU doctors can do it. So if you're OCD about curing patients of at least all their identified symptoms like I am, this is a huge annoyance! There is a script mod you can do that will give prescribing rights to all doctors, but I haven't tried it yet.

Overall, though, this is a really great, deep, fun game that I'm sure I will remember for a long time and continue coming back to. It's the ""adult"" version of Theme Hospital, but it still has its share of humor and charm, especially in the graphics and sound effects.

I like for example the fact they use actual illneses with matching symptoms. There's really something to learn here about how hospitals work, how they diagnose and treat patients. There's allot of customisation and you can create every room exactly how you want it. 

Only this game lacks one thing that makes all the things it does right go to waste and that is ""intuition"". I'm no stranger to games without help. I grow up with times that games had no tutorial. Like the original roller coaster tycoon you just had to figure everything out yourself. I'm the kinda person that can sunk hours and hours into games like these. I love figuring everything out and getting things to run smoothly. The problem with project hospital is you just can't! Unlocking ambulances how? I unlocked them a few times and it's still not clear to me how or when exactly you will get them. The financials screen is really bare minimum you can't dive into the details on how to make your hospital profitable. In fact you can't even tell how or when and why there are coming more or less patients in. It just seems to be a random amount adjusted to the size of your hospital. This means your always sort of running a small profit making expansions always needing to happen through bank loans. There's departments with receptions and without, but do you need to place receptions for some departments? Because they seem to run fine without. Why can't toilets and waiting rooms be shared by departments? Do queue machines make any difference? 

Another thing is that like all these games after a while you will be playing in maximum speed as otherwise things will just move to slow but you will just be bombarded by notifications of patients missing X or collapsing or whatever out of the 1000's things this game feels they need to annoyingly create a popup for.  

What I'm trying to say is I restarted a new hospital many times thinking I learned mistakes from the last but every time I end up with basically chaos. Departments taking up whole floors but every floor basically have the same rooms over and over because every department basically requires the same rooms but specifically tagged for that department. Like when your building a ward for the 5th time because departments can't share them it kinda gets annoying. Specially when there's like 4 wards empty but your bombarded by notifications that patients cannot have a bed because one department's ward is full, yet there's like 20 beds empty in wards for other departments. It's just one of those things that really is counter intuitive and after a while all these little counter intuitive things are adding up and really start to annoy you.  You can't really play this game on intuition because many things that seem logical and obvious do not work. The game has some set limits on many things that sometimes just don't make any sense. So instead of playing with some logical natural flow, you often find yourself googling to as to why you can or can't do something and what the game's rules are.

1. The game frequently crashes or freezes. 
2. Really long loading screens even on a high end rig.
3. The tutorial isn't very clear and fails to establish the basics of the game.
4. The UI is arcane and hard to use even after nearly 20 hours of gameplay.
     4a. Why are there two different windows for rooms?
     4b. Why can't I look at my entire hospital's staff at once
     4c. Why do the single room departments require there own bathrooms and waiting rooms? in general why are 
           bathrooms, breakrooms, waiting rooms, and cleaning closets unit/department specific. you should be able to restrict 
           the rooms to one particular unit/department but it seems dumb to require it especially when trying to run a smaller 
           hospital.
5. Lots of game braking bugs.

Some of the bugs that killed my will to keep playing:
1. Un-removable objects after placing them. 
2. can't add second floor to new parts of building if you have already made a second floor. You also can't seem to remove upper floors.
3. Road ground tiles can sometimes be placed over and then cannot be returned to beginning state.

I plan to keep checking up on this title, hopefully they sort out some of the issues with the game. I really like the concept and the general feel of the game its just really really hard to have any fun with it when the game breaks every hour or so. If you do decide to pick up this title save frequently and maybe even several time in a row before logging off. I've had saves seem to not save everything done recently.

I don't dislike it and it's not buggy, but the economy is so rough that it almost feels like an idle game. You will end up playing something else on your phone while you wait for money to accumulate. Allowing hospitalization almost breaks the game as well. Doctors will hospitalize patients who don't need it and your rooms will fill up quick. I always seem to end up in the negative at that point trying to build more rooms and you can't cancel a hospitalization. You can only send the patient away or make room for them to spend the night.
Other than that, the building is kind of fun and doing the diagnosing on your own is interesting. I'll probably play it a good bit more, but this is definitely a game better suited to those who enjoy idle games.",1652050967,1652050967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am noticing a few glitches though, at least I think they're glitches because even after 50+ hours of gameplay I still haven't figured out how to fix it.

currently, I'm noticing that sometimes the nurses will just bug out trying to transport a patient. I'm not sure why or how this happens, but the patient will be waiting to be transported ( to surgery for example ) and the nurses will say they're waiting to transport the patient, but the surgery room is free and the surgeons are free. so both the patient, and the nurses, are stuck in a loop where they're just sitting around doing nothing and all of their moods lower because they're starving and have to use the bathroom.

another thing that I wish this game had is I wish it would tell me exactly which places the patient is trying to transport to, so if there's a problem I can actually fix it. for example, when a patient is waiting for a bed for a long time, I wish I knew exactly which department or which bed they're waiting for. is it an observation bed, or a regular ward bed, or an HDU bed, which department are they going to??? I have absolutely no idea so the only thing I can do is try to go check ALL of the possible beds that I have in my entire hospital to see which ones are full. usually that doesnt help because rarely are all of the beds full in a single department.
which surgery is the patient waiting to transfer to? I have no idea, all it says it is the patient is a surgery patient but they could be getting transferred to cardiology for all I know? am I missing something important, or is this just bad game design? it's hard to tell. I've played all of the tutorials and I still have this problem.

another problem I have is when there are long waits in the waiting room, why cant you just tell me exactly what the patient is waiting for so I can fix it? it could be literally anything.

on top of all that, this might just bother only me but, the ambulance noises are ear shattering and they should have their own volume bar in the menu. its unfair to make me have to turn off all the SFX just to make it so the ambulance sound doesn't make my ears bleed.

so, for these problems, I have to not recommend this game at this time. even though I find it fun and enjoyable, these seem like trivial problems that should be easy to fix or find a solution for and I still have yet to be able to do that after 50+ hours of gameplay.

I spend like 50% of my time in this game, after establishing a somewhat large clinic, just going around and trying to fix bugs or mishaps that are caused by the game, not by my own creation. I dread getting the ""patient is going to leave soon"" message because I know this is happening because of some mess up with the AI, either in the patient, nurse or doctor.",1652034847,1652035815,False,2,0,0.528991997241973877,0,True,False,False

Suggestion: To get past the learning curve, don't jump straight into the campaign. The campaign can be initially overwhelming if you don't know what you are doing. 

Do the tutorials and then play sandbox mode. This will allow you to learn both the mechanics of the game as well as learn the flow of a hospital at your own pace. 

Also, when the game tells you that you need a new department because a patient can't be treated, question the diagnosis. One time the AI doctor wanted to send a patient for dialysis based on one symptom when ultimately the guy was an insomniac.

WARNING: Ironically, this game does not have this warning (or at least noticeable). Like most simulation games, there are a lot of moving sprites as well flickering lights.

To make sure a department is running is not as easy as click A button or place X furniture, but you actually need to understand how each department/job works, so you can provide (and decide) necessary supporting items/departments. 

I found the hardest part is starting up the ""system"", there's a lot of trial/error during the gameplay, like testing how many nurses you'd need on standby, how many chairs you put in waiting room, what labs/radiology you need the most, etc etc. But once you found that nice balance between each department, the hospital can run by itself, and that's when you can enjoy the events/doctor mode to the max because you already have a running hospital.

That being said, this game actually let you choose how you would play it, as simple or as complex as you would like, which is also really nice!

The only negative part is the tutorial part, I feel it does not really highlights all the layers this game has, and it might be off-putting for new players because the learning curve can be quite steep. It's too bad because this game actually has so much to offer!

But all in all, this has been my new favorites! I can't wait to explore more departments and mechanics. New scenarios specialized in the new DLC would be really fun too.",1651923581,1651923581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mainly played sandbox so that's what I'll comment on here:

+
In the beginning it is a very fun/challenging game. You need to have a pretty efficient setup to actually start generating some decent money in this game. When everything works out though it's great.

-
The fact you can diagnose patients is cool but it becomes repetitive after a few hours as there's not that much variety, so you end up doing the same procedure over and over.

The full speed time option feels incredibly slow.

The second half of building your hospital is where the real fun should begin... but alas there are so many quality of life issues here. For example, to train your doctors you need to manually send them to study rooms. And there they will study until their shift is over and gain like 8% more skill each time. When they're done you have to manually reassign them to the same task for their next 8%. If you're training like 10 doctors at a time, that's at least 160 clicks you need to perform every day just because the devs couldn't be bothered to make a train until X% option. 

Even when you do have 100% skilled doctors they seem to not be able to do their job, so you still have to manually diagnose way too many patients to prevent people from dying in droves. 

And then there's the lag factor caused by lack of optimization. If I simply open an empty big hospital in sandbox mode my FPS will already drop to like 50 FPS and further down to 30 if I start moving the mouse around. This is pretty ridiculous. An empty hospital shouldn't create (such) lag.

Insurance companies send patients to the hospital with varying symptoms and it falls down to doctors (direct player control is an optional extra) to perform diagnostics and correctly diagnose the patient. Radiology, Pathology and Medical Laboratory departments are all available and can assist with patient diagnosis if the doctor orders. Care should also be given to placement of rooms, staff skill level, number of doctors and nurses in wards and wait times as untreated, serious symptoms (if the patient has them) can cause collapses. Collapses lead to possibilities of patient death.

The game play is additive and just like Factorio I find myself returning and sinking more time into the title. It is well worth the full price of the game and the DLCs add more departments.

This game differs from Two Point Hospital and Theme Hospital by not incorporating humour into the game. Also the repairing and replacing mechanics in those games are not present here.

Positives:

1) A good amount of micromanagement can be found in this game. From staff training, staff morale, taking over doctors, managing individual patients to placement of objects and rooms for optimal performance.
2) A good indication of if rooms are being overloaded on a daily basis.
3) No long forced game intros or movies which is a godsend after starting the game so many times.
4) Does a pretty good job of showing how pathology, radiology, medical labs and clinical knowledge all come together to diagnose patients.
5) Create a death hospital by incorrectly diagnosing patients or make them walk long distances.
6) Ambulances bring in critical patients and daily events can be triggered which flood the hospital with many patients.
7) Easy to mod game with a number of mods that will add new departments and hours more of game play.
8) Graphics are nice and crisp looking. Although staff cards tend to take up a little too much real estate at 1080P.

Neutral:
1) There are a fixed number of patients per day (outside of temporary events) which can only be increased by completing different insurance company demands. This is confusing at first and eventually becomes natural and controllable.
2) If you take the limits of staff numbers and insurance companies it is possible to create a mammoth hospital. I am up to 600 staff and around 200 patients per day (well above what is expected, I am doing it for fun) and am beginning to push a Ryzen 9 5900X, RTX 3070, 32GB RAM and a NVMe SSD during staff change and auto saves. Fair point though the developers warn you to go this far you need a powerful machine. The specs they list will be fine for virtually every hospital in the game.

Disadvantages:
1) Occasional pathfinding issues will see staff wonder to the other end of a hospital for a drink or a patient sent on a very long trip to a far away scanner. The Developer reports the algorithm used in the game is a simple one and the closest object is chosen taking into account floor numbers yet this does not appear to be the case. Over multiple hospitals and saves staff will ignore free objects right next to them to go on a sightseeing tour lasting half an hour.
2) Doctors will occasionally wonder off mid diagnosis or patient resurrection. This is especially deadly in ICU where a doctor will wonder off for a drink or toilet and just leave the patient there, the other on call doctors and nurses will continue to play solitare without a care in the world. If you do not manually intervene in this situation then the patient will die which can be very costly during events. Combine this with point 1 above and it gets annoying.
3) Difficulty moving staff en masse. This gets annoying when moving large rooms to different floors and it is only possible to move one staff member at a time.",1650220474,1650220474,True,1,0,0.511834323406219482,0,True,False,False

This game does a more of a realistic approach to medical practices than cartoony antics.
You build and manage a profitable hospital from general partitioning to intensive care and major operations with different medical departments. You design rooms - or use prefab rooms - and place equipment and objects.
You hire staff, like nurses, doctors, janitors and store clerks who will work autonomously. Patience will arrive on foot, book an examination, get a diagnosis and recommendation from your GPs and procedures will escalate from there – like lab tests or surgeries. Patients arriving by ambulance will immediately be sent to the Trauma department to be stabilized. Staff and patients have needs to fill. Income comes from successfully treating patience and accepted contracts from insurance companies. There are also some emergency events if you choose to do them. You can at any time control one or more doctors' decisions when diagnosing to patience.

After you have figured that out you then spend countless hours designing your own hospital  and that's where you get to experience the terrible coding behind the A.I (staff and patients). 

Restricted areas don't actually do anything so you find your staff and patients taking shortcuts in your hospital or entering areas where you actually don't want them to enter, and on top of that they can also walk through fences?
Elevators can't be placed per floor but all floors so you can't send patients directly to where you desire.

I prefer games where I can use my own creativity but instead you find yourself restricted in some building areas to cater to the games flaws.

The game graphics are rather good but other than that I can't recommend it.If your looking for a hospital builder I would recommend Two point hospital instead.

A few things I didn't like:
1) Patient flow - the patient flow doesn't feel natural, and maybe this is a mechanics issue. Nurses are the only ones who can move patients, and only nurses from the department the patient is currently in. it makes more sense that nurses or techs can move patients, and can be from both the sending and receiving department. Patients should almost never be moving themselves around the hospital. I do like that they finally included wheelchairs. The system is already in place. The different symptoms already convey whether they make a patient immobile or slow them down or if they can walk at a regular pace. If the patient is immobile: stretcher, if they're slowed: wheelchair or stretcher whichever is available, if they can walk: have them walk with the staff member transporting them. For ""collapsed"" patients: make a nurse mandatory for the transport so they can stabilize. Which leads into my next point;

2)
Rooms - Rooms are just strange in this game. The requirements for rooms, what treatment can be done in what room, etc. There's so much I could say here. It's been so, so frustrating with getting a diagnosis, knowing what the treatment is, and the treatment needs a specific room to make it work. There's some allowance, for example in the ER when a patient is in observation and a test is ordered that needs them to be in the Trauma Center, they get moved to the trauma center to do the test, then get moved back. That should really be the norm in these cases: if a patient needs a neuro exam but they're in the internal medicine department, just move them to the neuroexam room without needing to move them to the neuro department. Similar to shared Operating Rooms, or how the radiology and lab departments work.

3)
Patient care roles: This was a big one for me. Doctors seem to do ALL the treatment in this game. Nurses have a patient care role, but don't seem to do any assessments or treatments. Techs have exactly one role. Radiology techs, for example, can't go between X-Ray and CT and MRI. Some departments don't have techs at all - ER for example. There's lots of potential for techs to be used to transport patients, feed patients, and do basic patient care.

4)
Tests, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatments:
This kinda goes back to required rooms for treatments. Each symptom has one test that can reveal it and one treatment that can resolve it. For instance, a symptom or diagnosis might require Azithromycin which is an Antibiotic but the treatment Antibiotics wouldn't work. Paracetamol is an NSAID, and a Analgesic, and an Antipyretic, which are three separate treatments in the game. Multiple tests might be able to reveal a symptom and multiple treatments might relieve that symptom but the game doesn't take that into account. Each condition has a department that can treat it - take for instance Head Trauma. That condition right now goes to Neurology, but realistically could be managed by Neurology or Trauma, or even General Surgery in a pinch. The game doesn't allow for such nuance.

I know it sounds like I don't like the game because I've got a lot of criticism, but I genuinely like the game. I have all the Achievements and 500+ hours of playtime so that says what I think of the game. I like it, but it could be better.

This is a neat little management sim with some educational aspects to it. The graphics are pretty nice for a 2D isometric style game, and the sound and art design make it feel unmistakably like a hospital. The gameplay is engaging but not overly difficult; I mostly let my doctors run the show, but I'm constantly popping around the offices to order tests that I think will narrow things down better.
But...

Two big gripes:

- Hickam's Dictum says: ""a patient can have as many diseases as he damn well pleases."" (In other words, don't assume that every single symptom must come from a single underlying cause.)
The game says: ""Hickam who? Never heard of him."" Every patient has one and exactly one disease or illness, and the primary way you narrow down diagnoses is by rejecting out-of-hand every condition that can't explain one of the symptoms.
There are no patients with urgent pulmonary problems exacerbated by unrelated mild heart conditions, there are no patients with seemingly connected symptoms stemming from two different illnesses, and there's certainly no hypochondriacs showing up with vague complaints of headaches and nausea who really just need to eat a real lunch. For a game that prides itself on realism and medical accuracy, it's kinda incongruous that no patient ever has more than one thing wrong with them.

- The AI. Oh boy, the AI.
One of the most frustrating things in this game is being unable to treat a patient who's been diagnosed and had treatment ordered, all because they had a blood test three hours ago and they ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO get the results of every single test before they get treated for anything. So instead of going to the doctor's office and getting their prescription, they sit outside a lab for the last open hour of the clinic and then go home in a sulk. Why can't I cancel a test once the sampling's been done? Patients also bug out occasionally, such as if I cancel a test while they're on their way to Radiology, causing them to sit patiently in the waiting room there until I manually change what department they fall under.
Staff AI has its own issues. As long as there's anyone in the waiting room, doctors will stay in their offices even if they're three hours late for lunch, misdiagnosing patients due to hunger rather than taking five minutes for a sandwich and a coffee. This behavior wouldn't be so bad if there was at least a way to order them to go on a break...but there's not.
The devs have responded to this complaint by saying that doctors and nurses are so dedicated to their patients' well-being that they'll put it before their own. To which I say: horsehockey. Doctors know better than most people how important it is to have fuel in the tank, and that being exhausted and hungry and needing to take a leak increases the risk of medical mistakes. I'm pretty sure this behavior isn't a deliberate design choice based on realism but rather one of development constraints.

Now I know I've just spent 80% of a review harping on problems in a game I claim to like, but I actually do like this game! It's a solid little number with a lot of fun and a lot of heart and a lot of disinfectant, which makes the aforementioned flaws more jarring in comparison.
It's like biting into a delicious sandwich with tender beef, ripe tomatoes, tangy pickles...and lettuce that's wilted and flavorless. Whatever, just pick the lettuce off, the rest of it's good.

Doctor mode is amazing! It keeps me busy actually trying to figure out the treatment tree and think ahead when diagnosing patients. It also keeps me busy during the days so I don't just try to expand way too fast! It also leaves the nights for me to try to figure out the best way to make the most out of the small profits made before surgeries.

If you try to go for any realism then you'll play like me and build the first hospital over 3 times before going crazy with specialist departments, because you can't have TC at the other side of the map from the ambulance drop-off.

If I had one wish, that would be a cross-departmental pool of night people. Why do we need a night radiologist for every machine or separate set of nurses for every department when all departments apart from ER and ICU are on maintenance? Or send the outpatients home after hours so they don't sit in front of histology from 1am till 7am waiting for the guy.

Realistically I would imagine the patients waiting for special procedures like medical imaging would either be sent home or hospitalised for the night rather than sent to sit in front of the office waiting for a person in the middle of the night.

Also I would imagine an emergency radiologist could run several machines but maybe leave the diagnosis till the morning?",1649181307,1649181782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I play a lot - a lot - of 'run an x' sim games and whilst I love all the rest of them there always comes a point where the game plateaus and I get a bit bored of it. That's not happened yet with Project Hospital. The aspect where you can get involved in diagnosing patients with such a wide array of possible symptoms, diseases and tests is a genuinely interesting mechanic that really holds my attention through the gameplay. You can progress at your own pace, you can speed through building lots of different departments early if you want the challenge or you can really master one area before you tackle the next. I really like that the difficulty of each department is more emergent from the complexities and urgencies of related conditions, and that it doesn't handhold you into choosing simpler departments earlier - you can easily find yourself with a more complicated department than you realised, and making that mistake is never game-breaking, just a great challenge. All the different challenges from the different insurance companies, and the conflicting things to balance when designing hospitals for best efficiency, mean that even after almost 500 hours I've still got things to strive for and the game hasn't hit that plateau for me.

Basically, it's a 3 in 1 concept, offering 3 very distinctive game-styles. 
1) Hospital builder - it let's you build a huge (or small if you want) hospital, put every single wall/door/window/floor tile/furniture/equipment/decoration/plant/tree/grass tile yourself, using great room prefabs or the combination of the two. You can even build the full hospital without ever starting any kind of simulation
2) Hospital management/simulator - starting from a readily available hospital or one that you built, you let all the doctors, nurses, janitors,technicians do their own jobs,  treating patients, inspecting them, sending them to different departments. Monitor how they do their job, hire and fire them, buy equipment, assign work, training for all and do everything to let the hospital run smoothly, not leaving any patients untreated or dead and not going bankrupt while doing so (can even borrow money from the bank). 
3) Doctor simulator - take control of some of the doctors or all of them, decide for all controlled patients what inspections they have, what treatments they get, send them to other departments if necessary, diagnose them, narrow their diagnosis down from hundreds of possible sicknesses to just one, and when they are fully treated, let them go home and collect the money. Do it with all hints given to you or in ""specialist mode"" with a minimum amount of hints helping you. 

As you can imagine, all three of the above would result in very different game-play. In my humble opinion, if you want to get the most out of the game, you do a combination of them. Build something, hire the people, do some of the treatments yourself so you get to know and experience all sorts of sicknesses, diagnosis, inspections, treatments, and let them run sometimes without your help to be able to find out bottlenecks, tweak how things run. I've been doing it step by step, starting from a small simple ER clinic to a huge (almost) mega hospital now - and I haven't even finished, haven't even added infectious diseases. You can find well over a hundred episodes of Let's play on my youtube channel, just find ""maturegamerhd"". 

Further to all this, there is a very extensive mod community with awesome extensions that sometimes rival with the DLC's the developers had put up - while it seems to me that the developers have been active and listening to the player base as well. 

Over all... after decades of gaming experience, this game has become my absolute favorite. You don't even have to wait for some promotion, it's worth way more than the regular price the developers ask for, including all the DLCs...

I think the waiting area that the department is using, should be listed on the waiting area.. and that a separate window should pop up to assign specific areas to a specific room. The system that is in place now is incredibly frustrating.. to me anyway. Some rooms can share areas.. and some can't. This could be more concise I feel, especially for new players.. So say for example the hematology lab.. there could be a checklist for areas that connect only to that room, in a more clear checklist. So like waiting room 0/1 or 1/1 when you complete the linking. Or maybe I just have no idea what I am doing, and this is already in place. 

Other than this.. the game is pretty realistic in regards to departments etc. I would like to have a bigger map, and to have some of the prefabs work out of the box though. You run out of space pretty quickly. 
I do like that you have to unlock technologies as well.

Pros:
Insanely in depth, seemingly medically accurate diseases and diagnosis process
Mod support- if youre looking to spruce up your building, theres plenty of community options
Exciting events- you never know what's going to walk through the door when ambulances are activated
Satisfying to watch your day only outpatient primary care office develop into an inpatient surgical facility 
Dev support- devs have made some very fan demanded changes that were probably a decent amount of work on their end

Cons:
Learning curve. The way the hospital works makes sense once you get things going but certain processes arent telegraphed well to the player upfront
Frustrating when patients get stuck in the system and its difficult to know whats causing the holdup (ex. why is a patient still waiting to go into surgery when all the staff and equipment are available???)
Department ratings- each department rates itself on a star system and this affects number of patients you get. sometimes the score is really low despite having what seems like all the requirements.

I was ready to LOVE this game. I have 100+ hours on TPH and wanted something more realistic with hands-on diagnostics. What I got was a buggy, confusing mess of a game(?) wherein I couldn't figure out how to get through the SECOND TUTORIAL (even after thorough googling, watching some youtube videos, etc.).

I'm not an inexperienced gamer, and I generally have no issues learning new games. But the UI/UX is so bad that it prevented me from playing the game, which absolutely killed my interest in the game, because I am not into spending time on a game that seems to want to fight me to keep me from playing it. 

I do hold a lot of hope for the medical sim genre, and I really, really, REALLY want a realistic medical sim with a quality diagnostic experience. This isn't it. I wish it was, but it isn't.

The game has two main aspects, building and managing a hospital and diagnosing medical conditions. The 'Guess Who' style medical diagnostics is strong and enjoyable with no real faults. It has always been very well implemented and now expanded on with numerous DLCs and mods available. 

I feel the game is let down on the management side though, especially when you need the hospital to run more autonomously as your scope expands. Some of my major complaints are: 
- A lack of accurate costs displaying when building. A bread and butter feature for most building games is suprisingly not present.
- A lack of planning tools. Again a pretty basic feature of many building games like Prison Architect and Rimworld, pre-planning with object and door placement is not present. Can be a frustrating combo when coupled with the game's merciless refund/undo policy.
- Weird pathing. Sometimes items show as being blocked or blocking squares, but other times, people will just avoid squares for no reason or stand around vacantly. There is no real display of what is interacting with a square or person, meaning the player needs to be both vigilant and versed in the game's background pathfinding. 
- Lack of player control over treatments. Prescribing treatments earns money and prestige, but takes time. This should be a meaningful choice for the player, but there is no way to set this up autonomously and scale it past a basic clinic.
- Lack of control over doctor priorities. An unsupervised cardiac clinic will be doing nasal cavity checks and serology sampling before checking an ECG or angiogram for most patients. Players should have the option to disallow or prioritise checks, to display their knowledge of the game.
- Lack of control of AI selected treatments. Emergency doctor puts a patient with a broken nose into hospital observation, but you don't have ortho hospitalization up yet? Too bad. Even though you could treat the patient in a clinic, you now have no access to the patient. Either send the guy home or build and staff a new wing to regain access. Extremely frustrating to see basic control taken away from the player.
- Doctor management. No player control to set up staggered breaks or tend to needs at predetermined thresholds. Also every command is tethered to the staff's 'work spot', meaning that they must return to that spot before starting their next action. This makes medical labs, cleaning and dinner/toilet breaks jarring to watch. Some sort of proximity command issued from the actual characters would be a god send.

Balance wise, the game's pacing/economy is pretty basic, but extremely functional. There are clear periods of growth and expansion to support new clinics or wards, and settling/tweaking times to oil the health machine. Hospitalisation is the clear breaking point when you need a ward for every clinic you have opened, which is when many of the listed problems really start to kick in. Given how old this game is and how deep-rooted I'd expect most of these issues to be, I don't see them being resolved. So that being said, if you are looking to play a management game and have little interest in medical setting, I'd say to pass. If you have any interest in the medicine, then give it a go as the pros out weigh the cons.",1642771277,1642771505,True,3,0,0.549563109874725342,0,True,False,False

Make sure you read up on how a waiting room, diagnostics and others are linked to a certain department and not just a free for all room. It makes your build ups different to other games but it makes more sense in the real world.

Its worth the effort to spend at least a day to plan and build your hospital. I recommend to first draw the layout plan of the departments, with logical order of the flow of the clinic and ambulance patients. A key point is the location of the elevators, you should plan everything around that. For my hospital, I use 10 central elevators. The only annoying feature is that clinic patients tend to get bored and leave. You either manually manage this manually - which takes away the game experience - or accept that you will have untreated patients every day. A patch (a hospital manager type of character) would be really great. The other issue is that sometimes for events the game provides unrealistically short time for completion. But overall its a great game, worth buying.

It has decent replayability, but once you max out one hospital in sandbox mode, you've basically done all you can do besides the challenge modes.

[b]Some recommended changes:[/b]
-Progression needs to have more stuff between it (you can have all 9 departments running in only a few hours of gameplay and at that point there's not much else to do) 
-The way that patient intake works should be tweaked to not be a fixed number. Events should be random and more variable. 
-The insurance mechanics are arbitrary and feel utterly pointless. 
-It might be nice to have some sort of R&D stuff or be able to do specialized surgeries.
-This is the biggest failing of this game IMO: there's no way for you to actually look at the symptoms a patient has and the possible diagnoses and then pick the appropriate examination or do something to preempt that they have a deadly condition which they might have even if they actually just have a small illness. This game doesn't tell you what to look for and it basically lists all relevant examinations and treatments for you. It misses out on the ability to make you really feel like a doctor making important, difficult choices based on the information you are provided to determine the most effective way to deduce the problem and then solve it. There's no real way to properly understand the condition or the treatment or the diagnostic process, and even if there were, there's no incentive. This game could be twice as fun and twenty times as educational if it implemented something that involved this. 

You may look at that last point and think ""well that's needlessly complex & also it doesn't sound like fun to have to understand the conditions you're treating and the treatments and the examinations,"" and while I would agree it would have to be dumbed down, I would pose the question of ""then why not just set it to doctor control and ignore that part of the game?"" Like, if it literally gives you three possible diagnoses, it could just tell me the prime difference between them and, based on the examinations available, it could let me then try to pick the appropriate examination and, based on what I find from those examinations, the correct diagnosis, and then make the appropriate treatment. It would make this game SO much better.",1641102269,1641102269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game roughly spoken contains 2 aspects:
- Management mode in which you create healthcare departments, appoint staff and ensure smooth operation

- Doctor mode in which you become personally responsible for stabilising, diagnosing and treating your patients

In my opinion the game comes to live in the doctor mode. The options relating to diagnosing and treating patients provide a lot of detail and give you the feeling as if you're actually a doctor!

----

Cons:
- The simulation and management aspects are not very smooth. Staff and patient behaviour is (especially at the start) quite unclear and the staff A.I. is a bit dumb. You especially realise this once you take personal control of your patients.
- The user interface takes a lot of getting used to. It's quite clunky and took me about 10+ hours to understand fully.
- If you want to keep your hospital under personal control and it becomes busy, it becomes 'pop-up manager'

Pros:
- Very well made healthcare system
- Simple but effective graphics
- Detailed and engaging
- Fills a unique niche

It can be a little intimidating to get into at the start, which continues to be a problem every time I decide to play it again after an extended break, but it's just a wildly rewarding experience to gradually turn your little walk-in emergency clinic into a hospital with different departments and hospitalization. There's so much that goes into that process that it can feel daunting, but it's rarely overwhelming.

The actual doctoring simulation is surprisingly realistic, and while it's not a perfect 1:1 with reality (I'm not a doctor so I can't speak to authenticity), especially with more complicated diagnoses, it is a much more complex process that involves many different kinds of tests, labs, radiology, moving patients around a bunch of different departments, surgical units and and and... it's wild how expansive it gets.

The DLCs should be included in the base game and are not worth the price you have to pay for the content. I wish there was more to the campaign as the game gets pretty repetitive once you understand the mechanics.

2019 review: I am enjoying the game overall so far but there are still some glitches that would need to be worked out for me to recommend it. Namely, you cannot undo builds if you accidentally place a room, there is no duplicate button for flooring or wall paper so you have to trial-and-error match which wastes money, and while you are told when rooms are idle or staff have no assignment there is no intuitive way to find out which rooms the game is referring to or where the doctors are currently stations - so you have to hunt through your hospital trying to find exactly how to fix the problems thus wasting more money.

As a nurse I could complain that doctors never actually administer medication or perform a lot of the tasks that only doctors do in the game, but thats ok. I enjoy the micromanagement of the game. I really enjoy the diagnosis interventions to finding out different symptoms of the patient by sending them for different tests. 
I found pretty much a lot of the medical stuff to be accurate and was happy on that front. I find it satisfying to quickly treating patients and sending them home and getting many patients come in and treated successfully.
I got all the DLC bundle with the game which was all fun to use, i think its much better with more departments otherwise it would get boring seeing the same diagnosis.

I do have a love hate relationship with the game at times but i enjoy the challenge. It is a little difficult to learn the game, as I didn't focus on insurance goals and I was playing on super speed and not everything is not clearly explained and you need to figuire stuff out on your own. 
e.g. Room placement items: Some rooms have certain placements for items to be in specific places from other items to work and follow the blue arrow for placements, i was placing items to quickly before I realised the arrows.
It stupidly took me a while to realise I could increase the text size, I was sadly playing with very small text for a long time! 

Not so good aspects of the game: Its not 100% smooth to play, in a sense you have to manually click things that are supposedly done automatically if you want to avoid deaths. 
A lot of times there is a 100% diagnostic choice but the patient is queing waiting for an unneccesary CT and MRI (wastes resources)
Sometimes a patient will be sitting there and complain they are threatening to ""to leave the hospital"" when there is also a 100% diagnosis and could be treated 
I have a glitch when there are too many pathologists and they glitch and stand infront of the pathology room, and drain their ""needs"" to 0 stars.   
Once I reach upto like 130 patients I will need like over 7 Trauma centre rooms because everyone is dropping like flies on the floor and all rooms are taken... it does get a little annoying because you don't really need a dedicated room to 'rehydate' by drinking water.

Hints: 
Build pharmacies early for extra money
Don't expand to new departments until theres a need for it and they complain that the patient cant be treated here and will be sent away. Don't start a cardio ward until you have a lot of cardiology and radiology rooms. 
Always focus on insurance goals, as without it you cant really gain any new patients.

It's very realistic both in disease modeling and care and (some) of the management aspects. It looks great, it sounds great, never chugged and never crashed.
What killed it for me was the ""excel spreadsheet with a GUI"" approach. Let me explain.
When you start a level you are given these awesome decorated doctor offices and you are asked to cure 30 patients a day. As you watch, you realise that big rooms full of objects are crap. Your doctors and patients spend too much time running around. What you need is the smallest room possible with the fewest possible objects in it. It's just a space optimization puzzle at it's core. A sort of medical esoteric tetris.
All rooms, departments, and staff pretty much work in the same way. Also the ui is kinda broken. I was in my third mission when I realised that clinic and hopitalization in the same department work differently. 
Also also I had everything I needed to perform surgeries but my patients were leaving because the beds for pre-op and post-op were occupied... I had to google that one because the game would not give me any feedback.

Where it really shines is the hidden complexity, the layout of your clinic/hospital is hugely important, as is where you place particular rooms, the abilities of your staff members and how quickly you expand into specialist services.

Summary: 
An enjoyable game where you can build a fully functioning hospital from the ground up, just be careful not to go too much into debt (the interest rate is 1% a day) and don't expand too quickly or you will likely run into trouble.

""Bought the game about 2 weeks ago. I played the tutorial and the first mission of the campaign (took me 2 attempts).
All I did in the first mission was to build a General Surgery and some missing Radiology rooms. And then I waited for a got hour or so just waiting next to my PC. Game was running in full speed and I just waited for the money to rise till I finished the level.

I was told I could manage the hospital and manage the cases.
For the specific patients, it feels like a simple point and click mobile game:
1. Click all diagnostic options till you get a diagnostic
2. Click all treatments till patient is healthy.
I have no control over priority of patient for OR, I don't even know what the queue or why my doctors are idling after finishing an operation if there are still people waiting (it says Idle, they aren't resting, why won't you operate??)

I could not sort all patients according to bigger problems. I can't see congestion, I don't know if people are happy and healthy.

While in development, this game was constantly compared to Two Point Hospital, the latter being the ""funny"" hospital sim and Project Hospital is the ""serious"" sim. I played TPH on the free weekend now, and I had more control over the patients, the departments and the doctors. I had overlays and map filters, I had a general approval rating and I could force which doctor to work in which room. I had control.

At the moment, Project hospital feels more like a Sims game (for the building part), and watching an ant farm.
BTW, for the build part, because of no rotation and other major QOL features missing for this type of building game, I just gave up and opted for either prefabs or just placing the bare necessities.

Am I missing something? I want to have fun, but at this point, I simply don't understand what am I supposed to do in this game.""

I was following the patch until i saw some improvement but nop, and they have stoped patching the game too. GZ devs.

Edit: 20/10/2021
So... after i have no idea how long, i gave today this game another chance... let's see.

A doctor (and a good one too) after day 3 or 4, dont remember, never came to the hospital again. ofc i pay him every day :D

The game still says (it's so difficalt to do this diagnosis...) but the patients never have a disease from a department that you dont have, so you just see which disease belong to which department and you choose that diagnosis, (this make it extremly easy at the start of the game, and the player never fill the need to expant to more departments) simple as that, nothing changed from the last time i played it... good job dev team. and btw this means i never need to send a patient to another hospital...

Let's go! why steal don't get more patients other than those that the game said that we will get from the sponsors... there is no saspens each day at all.

And as i see the dev team is only patching the bugs which is a good thing but at the same time it means that this game will have those same problems for more time maybe forever.

I would like to say, that i only played the core game + the free DLC. nothing more.",1558878751,1634696071,False,13,5,0.497018277645111084,0,True,False,False

Project Hospital models the patient experience expertly - every person that enters your hospital comes in with a wide range of symptoms and the diagnosis process is often complex and fraught with mistakes. When I first got this I was afraid it was going to be another ""production line"" simulator where, as long as the wheels are greased, everything works perfectly. But it's simply not the case - there are so many variables involved and so many decisions that can have deadly consequences it never feels like you're fully on top of it all.

Unfortunately it gets let down by it's building interface. The zoning is both novel and works well, but building walls and placing furniture feels somewhat imprecise because of the perspective. Further, the way AI pathing works can often restrict your design choices.

The UI: Right off the bat I will say the UI is very, very awkward. Especially build mode. Perhaps I am too spoiled having spent many hours building in the Sims 4 and similar games.  There are so many clicks required to do the most basic things including adding, moving, and deleting items and rooms. Most hot keys can't be reconfigured. But building is a HUGE part of this game, so if it's tedious, that's a problem.

Then, even outside of building, it's awkward to try to figure out how to fix a problem. Again, there are a lot of clicks required - selecting the right ""game mode"" at the top of the screen, selecting the right department, then selecting a tiny icon on the bottom of the screen to see statistics. The main statistics page is only department wide, not hospital-wide, so you may have to click through each one to see what's going on. 

Outside of building the appropriate rooms/stations and determining a good layout, the actual ""management"" seems on the lighter side. There are pop-ups that occur when a patient collapses but it didn't seem like I really needed to ""do"" anything about that - most of the time the staff handled it fine, except for when there weren't enough hospital beds. It just meant I had to go back into the tediousness of build-mode, which I wasn't enjoying. Staff are automatically promoted and it didn't appear to me that I could adjust salaries after they are hired. The game flow seems to be: build and watch, build more, and watch/wait for the money to start rolling in.

I'm on the 2nd 'tutorial' and I can't figure out how to make it work.  The building is atrocious.  Selecting items is a pain and cannot be done always.

I can't select the trashcan without first selecting the eye chart (because they're on the same square?) and moving it temporarily somewhere else.

When I first placed some prefabs I wasn't happy with where they were.  There is apparently no way to move them.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out in the mess of icons how to demolish what I did and start over.  The rules for what you need including walls and windows is mysterious.

The most annoying fact is that the graphics in this game a very unpolished. NPCs are moving only in 90 degrees along the iso map, and they turn 90 degrees instantly, including any medical bed or other equipment they are using at the time. Watching a doc or a patient zig-zagging through a room for a destination hurts my sense of immersion very much. Personnel-patient interactions are not always parallelised in the game engine, so if a doc calls in a patient, they do not move at the same time, first the doc goes to their seat, then the patient starts moving. Wasted game time. It is also somewhat annoying to figure out how to compose a room. Some components have to be bought separately but placed in a fixed pattern, which you learn by trial and error. 
And the isometric style is in some cases a real obstacle in placing things.

I still try to overcome my negative impressions with more playing, but from my current perspective I would not recommend my friends to buy this.
[Edit] Steam asked me if I like to revise my review after a few more days of playing it. These are the things that i noticed most often as irritating:
- There are no family members visiting hospitalised patients.
- No children patients
- I did not see any traces of pregnancy or childbirth procedures
- No crime victims seen so far, or treatment of criminals in secured sections
- The clipping! Oh man, patients and personnel are passing right through each other. Nothing annoys me more in this game if nurses with stretchers slowly pass through each other, or they walk with a stretcher towards a wall, the stretcher passes into the next room and then they turn in an instant by 90 degrees, ignoring all laws of physics and immersion
- In the scenarios there is too much repetition of the same reasons for incoming patients.
- I still do not understand how shared rooms work, or if I did understand it, certainly the hospital personnel doesn't because they do not seek the closest shared room but one that matches their department.

However, if you're interested in gaining an insight into how hospital infrastructure works, I would say this is a great game to start with. Although the game is obviously not entirely accurate or representative of real life, it does push you to think about how to make the hospital space more efficient and how best to serve people through architecture. That said, the game is still relatively accessible if you want to build extremely terrible hospitals and just have fun, but I think the challenge of the game stems mostly from pushing yourself to create a polished healthcare system.

The negatives of this game are that the building is quite frustrating to deal. I would have hoped they would have a building system like Sims 3/4, but this is far from that as you cannot rotate the camera very freely (to my knowledge), walls need to be painted by constantly rotating the camera rather than ""paint all walls"" option, etc.

Why are hospitalized patients transported on stretchers?.... The hospital beds have wheels for a reason and are the way patients should be transported.

Seems odd to have no showers, baths or private bathrooms for hospitalized

 For example use of the shift key or toggling caps lock or or of adds and underscore ""_"" to the text being typed.  (When saving game, prefab, or giving the hospital a name)

If a patient returns to the hospital with an incorrect diagnoses, is handled incorrectly.

I'm a 4th year medical student and absolutely LOVE this game. The time that the developers put into designing every tiny detail is incredible. From being able to color code individual pieces of medical equipment, to the range and variety of rare diseases--I am continually impressed. While the medical accuracy of some of the symptoms/testing algorithms might need some refining, its generally the best I've ever seen in a game. 

My classmates think I'm nuts for wanting to play this game after spending all day in a real hospital, but as someone who grew up playing simcity and the zoo/rollercoaster tycoon games, I just enjoy the puzzle solving and world-building on sandbox mode with no pressure. I actually enjoy how it helps me think about the flow happening within a real hospital in an abstract way, and why real hospitals are designed the way they are. 

Thank you so much oxymoron games!

I think there is potential in this market, but unfortunately noone seems to deliver. This game is the closest to a good hospital management game I've seen recently, but it has some problems too.

Pros
- Many illnesses, many departments (still could be increased, there are mods for this), good variety of test rooms, etc.
- Well balanced difficulty.
- DLCs are pretty good. I'd prefer if they were in the game by default, but still much better than horse armor DLC.

Cons
- Terrible UI: It is difficult to follow what is going on, and to do various management tasks. You eventually can figure it out, but the learning curve is steep, and even after that it is a pain to do some tasks.
- Lack of some management options: While some policies regarding diagnoses can be set, they are not enough. Many hospital policy settings are lacking. There is also no way to set prices. The game has the insurance contacts system for this but I'd prefer to set my own prices, and then negotiate. These contacts also influence patient intake, based on fulfilling some goals. I'd prefer if this was based on prestige, prices and marketing.
- Too much micro management needed: Often you need take control of some patients. Doctors keep ordering useless tests, and they don't consider queues.
- You get paid based on the illness, not tests & treatments: This means you are encouraged to order few tests, and rush treatment. The misdiagnonsis penalty is not effective enough. I'd prefer a more realistic system, based on tests, medicine, doctor time, daily room fee, surcharges etc.. Combined with setting your prices, this would let you manage the patient intake, demand for some rooms and profits better.
- Sharing resources between departments is very limited: You should be able to share wards, common rooms, nurses, and even offices between departments, This would let you scale your departments based on your current needs, and would avoid many idle rooms you need to build or idle personnel you hire just in case you need it later. Some rooms can be shared, but figuring that out was a pain too thanks to the terrible UI.

Nitpicks
- Pathfinding is bad: Depending on the game this could be a huge negative. With this game, it is just annoying. Causes some ineficiencies, but not too bad.
- Isometric only: I get it, this is a nostalgic way of designing a game. I grew up playing many isometic games too, but even back then it was annoying. It can't be that difficult to do this game in 3D.

Honestly, if we had a better hospital game on the market, this would be a negative review. But since there isn't one, I can recommend this game if you enjoy tycoon games like I do. It's fun but frustrating at the same time.",1629569089,1629569089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has everything. From the lowly reception and toilets all the way to an MRI or a department to help cure infectious diseases. It is a very delicate game too. You need to fill every need of each department before it will run properly. You also need to manage the staff - day and night shift.

Core elements of the game are:

1 Building your hospital
2 Hiring staff
3 Diagnosing and treating patients
4 Making a profit

[b]1 Building[/b]
Lots of customization options for walls, floors, rooms etc. You can only build in straight lines, but some pretty nice buildings can be made. 
Lots of different departments available (neurology, cardiology, general medicine etc etc)
Adequate 'flavor' options like plants, posters and lamps. Could do with some more.
If you like to play around really build up YOUR hospital you can do that. But there are some good prefabs which allow you to skip much of the building parts. (UI regarding your own homemade prefabs is horrible though, but it works)

[b]2 Staff[/b]
Hiring staff has some elements of levelling up and staff has different perks, skills and wage levels. The negative skills like 'often shows up late for work' could be tones down a little. But it makes for some nice variety. For me, it usually comes down to 'hire and forget' though.
Granted, the [u]free DLC[/u] does add some depth in this department, it's fun to make your own doc and see him/her level up and treat patients

[b]3 Healthcare[/b]
You can choose how much you want to be involved with patients. From giving your staff full power to treat patients, to being involved in hard cases, to doing the whole diagnoses and treatment yourself. The game never overloads you with patients you can't cure. As your hospital grows and more tests become available, more complex patients show up. The game will nudge you to expand to different departments by sending you the occasional patient that would really benefit from that department that you currently dont have, but it doesn't feel forced. 
As someone with no real life background in medicine it's also fun to read the descriptions about tests, symptoms and medicine.

[b]4 Money[/b]
Making money is kind of easy actually. Building up your hospital is rather cheap. I hardly ever run into money problems. Don't go in expecting in-depth financials for hospitals. There are some insurance companies that you can enable or disable, a bank where you can loan (I never do), and patients pay when they are treated and leave the building.

[b]Other impressions[/b]
The UI feels clunky sometimes, nothing gamebreaking, but it could use a bit of an overhaul in the future.
For instance: how shared rooms and cleaning rooms are treated is kind of weird. (every dept needs a cleaning room basically...why?). Building something requires alot of clicking around and searching for that one thing (no searh bar)
The DLCs add depth and QoL improvements.

It's an enjoyable game! If you like building something up, watching it work and expand on it with a medical setting I am sure you will enjoy it too.

The game still feels like a Early Access game rather than a complete game and needs a huge overhaul of the general rules. The basics for this to be the perfect hospital game are here. The doctor mode alone is fantastic. And in general, is a somewhat realistic game while still being fun. However there are so many careless design decisions that this recommendation comes with a lot of asterisks attached in the hope that this changes in the future.

[h1] Building: [/h1]

Building is a bit infuriating. The devs need to copy things that has been out there since the Sims 1, like being able to color the entire wall perimeter regardless of shape with the CTRL+ key. Same for tiles.

Wall should hide, again like in the Sims. Where the closer wall gets hidden and the rest stay up, otherwise is difficult to look inside the rooms as the wall is either full (hiding the room) or nothing (you can't see the room).

A cenital camera should be easy to implement and quite useful when laying or planning floors. Sort of like the mode in Civ 5 where you only get the basic information.

A planning feature where you built everything without actually expending money until click the confirm button and then everything is build and money is spend.

Keep the game running while constructing please, there is no need to pause.

The ambulances parking spot is infuriating, can't rotate it. And the ambulances loading spot can't be place in the other street. It would make even more sense to add the ambulances to an ambulance room at the emergency department where you design an ambulance parking with access to the road.

If you somehow delete part of the main road, it can't be fix. The game complain that it not inside hospital property.

The Undo feature doesn't work in most cases. It complains that it can't be rolled back.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]

You need more roles of workers. A janitor in the main service office?? What??. If anything, create the roles of General Hospital Director or whatever. Like in Prison Arquitect. Or let a doctor be the Hospital General Manager. Same for paramedics. They should be part of the staff.

You need bonus/debuf depending of the extra equipment in the room or room size. There's not much incentive into trying to make a nice lab where the empty one, and the decorated one, get the same rating.

Same thing for general decoration. The game tells you in the loading screen that this is good, but doesn't tell you specifically what is the bonus for a plant or whatever.

Machines needs to have maintenance. Not like in Theme Hospital where the janitor bangs them with the hammer, but you get the idea.

[h1] Feedback to the player: [/h1]

The room plan where it says activity day/night in the corner is very annoying. Most of the time you can't see it because there is something on top of it and you need to stop the game, and put the cursor on top. It would be much more useful to have a list of rooms, like you have a list of medics/patients. In this list you get to see the statistics of worktime for each room; plus how much money is this room making.

Rooms should have an ID, ie Emergency Both #3 or whatever. So if a patient is waiting to be transporter to a room but can't, at least let me know which room so I can fix the room.

Staff should have a list of jobs pending, like in Oxygen Not Included. If my medic is occupy and can't attend someone waiting, I would like to know why, and how much left until it get there.

Is kinda difficult to figure it out how occupied are people or rooms in general. The statistic report doesn't say much other than Critical or Workload for the entire department. What I would like to see is per room:
- Number of patients coming in and from where.
- Number of patients going out and to where.
- How much busy in % of free time are the staff in that room.

In waiting rooms, you get a little number saying how many people are waiting for something, but again you need to stop the game to see this, and you need to also select the correct department. Just have this visible always please. Or at least give me the option to show/hide the same you have the option to show/hide objects.

[h1] General Hospital Rules: [/h1]

The progression of building emergency first, then internal medicine, is a bit weird. The first insurance company should be for people with no insurance and focus into making a functional non-emergency clinic of internal medicine. And then, when you have a functional clinic where a single doctor and nurse can take about 10 patients per day, move on to hospitalization, expanding the clinic, emergency, or whatever.

The default disease frequency is ridiculous. I have so many people with either weird diseases like bubonic plague, or borderline dying in a hospital size 50ish workers with 50ish patients/day. There is a mod that fix this partially, but you should have at least the option to change this in game. Right now I feel more like I'm running a hospital in a shhit-tier third world country which is the middle of a warzone where people doesn't even vaccinate.

There is also the issue that you will end up with about 200 personal, to take care of about 100 patients per day; which is also silly. Not everybody should require advance treatment in radiology/laboratories.

The hospitalization per department is super-annoying and doesn't make any sense. They are exactly almost the same rooms for each ward. A more realistic way would be to have a single hospitalization department where everybody goes, except for ICU and maybe Emergency. Then you are able to perform basic treatment in each bed (again, there is a mod for this that fix it partially, but this should be inside the main game). And then, you can have specialized rooms for each department where to treat/diagnose people. There is really no point of having the same advance unit and same cardio unit for each department. This would helps to fix the next point, which is the constant rolling of patients.

You don't need nurses to roll away patients. That's the job of the nurse assistance. Same for cleaning the patients for example. But nevermind this, there is a real bottleneck of nurses rolling patients everywhere. Even if you have the diagnosis/test units in the center of the hospitalization ward. And part of it is because they are rolling people from hospitalization ward to hospitalization ward to end up in the same type of bed for no reason. This really really needs a complete overhaul.

I don't know of any hospital where patients go to the lab to get blood extraction. You do the blood extraction in the nurses room for extraction, which is usually a generic room where you do basic health procedures too, like for example a scrap knee or whatever. And when you have a bunch of blood/urine/stool samples they are send to the laboratories. Either by a nurse or a technician. Then you send the results to the medic office and the patient goes there to get the next step.

It would be nice to have a budget that resemble more to real life. A MRI machine room doesn't cost 50% less than an ambulance, for example. In fact, I would say that roughly, an MRI machine cost 10 ambulances.

People professions statistics is just silly, how many acrobats does this town has? They don't even have acrobat-related injuries. Again, all of them has bizarre diseases that need one million tests.

The cleaning department should also be a thing. Although this is not important at the moment.

[h1] General Artstyle: [/h1]

It would be great to see different people size. Like overweight and obese people, specially for overweight related diseases. Tall and short people. Eventually teenagers, children and babies. A ward for pregnancy and delivery should be nice too.

A few minor annoyances here and there are to be expected but they all add up, and a few of them like the ambulance noise almost make the game unpleasant and unplayable.

-The janitor system is inefficient.  Should not be tied to a specific department and should function hospital-wide.  I could probably get by with half as many as I need.  Also, they never clean the outer perimeter of the map so after a long game all the sidewalks on the outside of the map are filthy.  I see this QoL improvement is for sale through the hospital services DLC.  I don't pay for QoL enhancements.

-UI is clunky and while you can find all the information you need about your hospital, none of it is in one easy to access centrally located menu.  Nope.

-Staff hiring... Gives you 4 options, 3 out of the 4 will be ""late/long commute"" or have some other horrible trait, and they charge you $2500 to reroll for another batch of 4 that are equally as horrible.  Either lower the reroll cost or give more staff options or better balance the traits.

-SFX - The ambulances are horribly loud and no option to mute them without muting all other sound effects in the game.  All or nothing with this game.  Deal with horribly loud ambulance sirens constantly blaring, or have no sound at all.  Your choice.  I've heard the helicopters are worse.

-Loans - These need to work better.  The fee you pay every day for them is only for interest, nothing gets deducted from your principal balance.  Why?  Also, you can only repay in $20,000 increments.

-AI - Not sure if this is by design or just bad AI but I've noticed half of my hospitalization beds being occupied by patients without any critical symptoms and not undergoing any active treatments that actually require hospitalization.  Why is this patient taking up a bed in my Ortho ward when all they're getting is a bandage and numbing ointment?

The graphics is not the selling point of the game, but the mechanics are interesting and for a management type of game, interesting mechanics is far more important than good visuals.

Now, after playing 40 hours and I now know the basics of the game, I discovered something so annoying that compelled me to write this review. The AI in this game is so stupid beyond imagination. I had a doctor next to someone collapsing and the doctor would ignore this person and carry on doing what he's doing and some technician from the other side of the hospital run over and do first aids.

OK, so 
1) why is the default AI so stupid that it cannot be interrupted just to check and see if there's an emergency happening?
2) the AI is stupid, but why can't I give direct order to control one unit to do one thing immediately? By the way, the AI nurse always does something like this: borrow a wheelchair from A, take patient at B to C, return the wheelchair to A, immediately grab the same wheelchair and take another patient from C to somewhere else.
3) If all that is too complicated to program, at least allow me to set my own priority rules.
4) I want to confine certain units to certain areas. I know I can assign room for janitors (haven't tried out yet though) but why can't I do that for doctors and other units too? I don't want to have doctors running from north to south all the time when someone is available next to the emergency. 

If what I said above is totally wrong and I can indeed make these modifications then please forgive me. I just played 40 hours of this and am still at the last scenario for the doctor mode DLC. If I can do all these in sandbox mode or other modes, well I don't know haven't tried them yet. But it is odd to me if this were the case, why not allow these in the tutorials already so I can get to know the game.

Anyways, the game is definitely fun when everything was new. Now that I passed the time for refunds, I don't know whether I'll keep playing. If the same shit happens again and again, I feel like that the ICU bed in the game would be reserved for me sooner or later. Also, I don't want to hire more staff to solve this problem. Not because I don't have money in game, but because the game is about management. Do things efficiently, not by brute force. I don't want to hire extra staff and have them be idle in 90% of the time just so this stupid behavior won't happen again.

EDIT:
So I just found this assign role function under every character info page. It can limit the unit's function to something I want. That is at least something I can try to avoid those foolish behaviors I mentioned above. I wonder why this vital function is not highlighted in the tutorial.

[b]Review changed to ""Not Recommended.""[/b]

[h1]Excellent builder, serious simulation problems. Staff management is a major headache.[/h1]

Yet another entry into the crowded ""build and manage a hospital"" market, Project Hospital nevertheless manages to distinguish itself as a particularly good title - for the most part. Although it combines outstanding construction flexibility, staffing management, and an extremely rare system of engaging the player in medical decisions, it suffers from [b]serious[/b] performance problems and UI issues that mar an otherwise exceptional game.

[h1]A Rare Hospital Sim[/h1]
If we're being honest, Project Hospital is really a game without easy comparison. It's actually three games spun into one: a hospital builder, a hospital administration sim, [i]and[/i] a medical sim, all rolled into one. Doing any one of those very well is impressive, but hitting all three is downright shocking.

You have complete control over your hospital, with the ability to use prefab rooms or to completely design your own. You can dictate the placement of every seat, bed, sign, plant, and any of hundreds (literal hundreds) of other objects. Some are simple decoration, of course, but the variety of items that have actual impact on patient welfare and satisfaction is staggering. Bare bones clinic or superhospital, it's up to you. Go for pleasing aesthetics or sterile simplicity. Mix and match. Really, you have the power. You even have [i]color choices[/i] for most walls, floors, and furniture. Yes, you can let your interior design flag fly high.

Hire staff based on competency and traits. This isn't pure ""go by percentage"" management play; many potential employees have traits that will positively or negatively impact their performance - or both. And, like real applicants, they don't wear all their opinions on their sleeves. You can find out their traits over time or pay up front, but there's a greater depth of detail in the hiring and employee management aspect of this sim than you generally find outside of a dedicated personnel management sim.

If that wasn't enough, you can get involved directly in the treatment of your hospital's patients. You don't [i]have[/i] to, but you can flex your medical muscles because the developers did their homework. Each condition is meticulously modeled, each test is accurately depicted. Some timeframes are compressed for the sake of gameplay (detailed labs take only a few minutes, for example), but the breaks from reality are acceptable concessions to player comfort. If you know your stuff, you can speed patient treatment by jumping to the (hopefully) correct diagnosis and treatment - or you can screw up royally and put them in greater peril if you don't know what you're doing. 

[h1]Something's Rotten in the Hospital[/h1]
With all those positives, this title sounds like a slam-dunk. It would be, too, if not for some irritating oversights and some outright grievous problems.

Unfortunately, while the building and design aspect of the game is outstanding, the simulation falls apart. In particular, employee simulation is endlessly frustrating. Employee management is, frankly, a joke. The hospital staff, even highly-rated and flaw-free employees, are the most irresponsible bunch of slackers imaginable. In part, this is because of how the simulation is structured: even if they're half a building away, a person can ""reserve"" an object like a toilet or refrigerator, thus keeping [i]everybody else from using it[/i] until the reservation is fulfilled. This leads to situations where person A can't use a bathroom 10 feet away because person B already reserved it from 200 feet away - even though A would've been long done and gone by the time B ever arrived. But beyond that, employees will slack off and head for a sofa on a whim, leaving their workstation unstaffed multiple times during their shift. Amazingly, even going to the extreme of putting a sofa and drink dispenser [i]in every office[/i] made zero difference - employees just went for a walk around the hospital, leaving patients without help. Real world employees like this are generally demoted to ""ex-employee"" in short order, but firing them doesn't help because the replacement will act in exactly the same way. Since you can't corral or guide your employees, you have to sit there and wait for the simulation to decide it's time for them to actually do the work you're paying them to do. It's maddening to the point you may want to just give up on the game.

As for the lesser frustrations, the UI is at best clunky, at worst a mess. All changes have to be made while in the proper ""department mode,"" which can lead to some confusion and frustration when you intend to make a simple adjustment (or realize you forgot to hire someone) only to be locked out of those controls because you haven't clicked into that particular department. (Taking a cue from where the control is positioned in the hospital is apparently beyond the engine's understanding; it needs everything spelled out for it.) There's no edge scrolling, you can't assign or rebind keys, and there are depressingly few keyboard shortcuts, so construction and setup is much less efficient than it could be. Selective object transparency also doesn't really exist, so you end up building on one or two major axes so as to not obscure your view while playing in administration mode. Now, these are all certainly fixable issues, but as they [i]haven't[/i] been, I have to call them out as the omissions they are. And they pale to utter insignificance next to the performance problem.

[h1]Final Diagnosis[/h1]
[i]Project Hospital[/i] shoots to be the top hospital building and management sim on the market. In its design, it's a roaring success for that goal; there really is nothing to fairly compare it to. The depth and detail set it apart by miles. Unfortunately, the degree to which the simulation was bungled is a tragedy, and with no fixes or even feasible mitigation strategies available, it seems unlikely to improve.

You'll encounter a lot of times where the game just says you don't have a workplace for this staff member and there is no reason as to why or a patient popup comes up with there is no waiting room available for this patient when there are tons of free seats) These are minor and you figure out ways around them quickly.

I read some reviews complaining about the graphics. You can always argue about visuals, but what's much more important for me: The graphics in this game convey a lively and bustling atmosphere with lots of love for details. 

What to improve:
The usability of this is like a grande expose of all basic mistakes there are to be made.

It holds up even to classic Hospital games like Theme Hospital and the recent revival of that 90s favourite in Two Point Hospital. It's quite important to say though, that Project Hospital is drastically different in so many ways from any such medical sim game out there. It's primary focus being immersion, realism and efficiency that offers you a lot more control over the whole process of building, staffing, managing patients. 

Do I recommend the game? Yes - with a couple of additional notes and warnings tacked on to that. 

If you're looking to purchase this game and think it will be a similar linear/storyline progression, and that is fundamentally what you want in a medical sim game, PH probably will not be for you. It has a campaign mode but it's relatively brief and more like a throw you somewhat in the deep end tutorial. After that, it's more sandbox focused, yet there's a lot to be said about that (no, seriously, I'm going to waffle on about that too). 

Additionally, the game looks set to be maintained purely for bugs from here on out and not really any more DLCs or content add ins and though no one wants this to go all EA on us, I still feel there was more that could have been done here and I would like to have seen a bit more variety in the items, their swatches and trying to make the hospital feel unique and varied between rooms. The devs did set up the game to be moddable and mods have cropped up, but I wouldn't say it has taken off and oftentimes I'm left wishing for things that short of learning to mod and create graphics myself, I will probably never see and I won't be alone in wishing for. 

Lastly on it's shortcomings, PH is shallow and unrefined in it's attention to characters like staff and patients. You have a very small selection of potential perks and negative traits, of which you'll get sick of the repetition over time and how quickly some of them become pointless. Similarly, small features like putting just a handful of names into the game made it feel like the overall immersion factor of the game aside from the exceptional effort they gave to medical accuracy was just not that much of a priority to the developers. Mercifully PH is easily moddable in it's XML files and mods are out there to add more names.



For it's more laudable efforts, PH is a genuinely enjoyable game with a really cute indie art style to it, that has a weird charm to it given that in many ways it could seem super simple and unpolished (which as I have stated, in some ways it is, but in other areas Oxymoron did not skimp on the attention to detail). You can play anything from a tiny emergency clinic to a complete hospital with 9+ departments all desperately trying to process all the patients sent your way. 

The gamefiles are beautifully easy to tweak (and there's even a game file called Tweakables to adjust some of the most requested settings) to your liking. If you think you're the best hospital director there ever was and want more patients sent your way because you like pain or you designed a huge hospital with increased capacity, you can do that.  It takes no skill and it gives extra longevity to a game you might otherwise play for a short while then never revisit. 
For those who like building, are a total perfectionist and look to optimise everything to it's most efficient; Project Hospital is both heaven and hell. In it's sandbox mode, you can play with unlimited building funds and spend many hours trying to fit a great hospital into a relatively small space of 96x96. With a couple extra DLCs adding new departments, that challenge only got harder over time. 

For people looking more for a management type gig, or even trying your hand at being a doctor, PH does this right. As right as you can do with the limitations of trying to simulate life and death in the medical field. The control feature for doctors (in which you can order diagnostics, make the call on a diagnosis and ultimately what treatment the patients recieve) is very good. Perhaps a little bit less exhilarating over time but generally fun and good for micromanagement. My only gripes with the features it lacks is being able to cancel some tests/procedures that should never have been ordered in the first place, and not always being able to take the level of control over staff and the most critical patients when you want or need to. Sadly some of the presenting symptoms like pain are annoyingly unspecific too. (Do you mean to tell me, you can walk in here, conduct an interview that identifies the symptom of pain but you cannot tell me if it's your leg, arm, ribs or your flipping backside and want multiple scans to find out?!)


Speaking of DLCs, they're decent enough, OK for their price and while nothing that blows your socks off, they do add some welcome additions for desired features and game immersion. I wouldn't recommend them to someone who isn't into large scale building projects and running long games to constantly challenge yourself; you'll only really get your moneys worth if you seriously like PH and plan to put many hours in. 


Overall, PH is a great game and a really welcome realistic addition to the very minimal field of GOOD (and fun) medical simulators with a free reign building style. It has it's drawbacks like every game, and it's quite sad that the modding community didn't really kick off and devs look set to just maintain it, however that in itself is more than many games get and Project Hospital has demonstrated significant improvement over time that has left it at an OK place with regards to the included content and it's general functionality. 

I've thoroughly enjoyed the 500 hours input so far and hope to put in many more and thus would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is happy with the content as it is, does not want anything too story driven, and just loves to build or micromanage.",1621972661,1621973203,True,78,0,0.889948487281799316,0,True,False,False

The UI scaling is broken, and the general controls are clunky, hard to learn, and clearly have not been thought out well. The tutorial is hard to follow, and even if you need help, the menu is so hard to navigate, you'll probably be there for half an hour trying to find the right option for it. I think my biggest gripe is that there is essentially no scroll bars on any menus or pop-up boxes anywhere in the game - only place I can think of that has one is the main options menu, but that whole interface gives me anxiety just looking at it. 

     But it's really fun. I'm impressed with the amount of effort that has gone into the medical background, and especially because it's based on treating real illnesses, the developers have clearly made a point to create a realistic symptom system with accurate treatments. The isometric view works well with the art style they have chosen, and again, the attention to detail with medical accuracy of the props and items is something I can really appreciate.
     I enjoy being able to follow a patient from the time they enter the hospital to the time they leave - the diagnostic process (for the most part) is great when you are at ""GP"" level, but gets harder and more tedious as the patient passes through the hospital. If you've got them hospitalised and at any point end up with both treatment and diagnoses lined up for them, you'll probably find that your doctors would rather just sit and play solitaire instead of doing their jobs. When treatment eventually happens, you may find that your unlucky subject experiences post-surgery complications - something that is a real issue for people undergoing operations.  If your patient survives til their treatment has finished, they will go home and leave you with a lump of cash depending on the illness you have treated them for - just be careful that you have treated them for the correct diagnosis! 

     In short, Project Hospital is kinda badly made, but if you enjoy tycoon/simulation games that are at least semi-accurate to real life, I think you will enjoy it.

As your hospital gets larger its less profitable, instead of being established and thriving you're just rocking the boat when you expand.  Patient numbers don't increase as you become more diverse in your ability to treat people.  Its always the same pool of patients and each time you add a new department they take patients away from other departments that were needed to maintain profitability.  

With 1 department built, it gets a lot of patients and your staff is cost effective, kept busy.  With lots of departments they each get a handful of patients and that staff you had for each is now a huge financial burden.  

There are a few other annoying design choices, but nothing quite as frustrating as that one.

Also:  Why can't I rub numbing ointment on someone if they're in the wrong office?  Go get some and rub it on.. Why does a patient have to wait for that HDU bed to become available before I can then move them to ICU instead of just canceling that move and sending them to ICU directly.. there wont be a bed available before they die.  Why do I need a trauma center (a $23,000 room) to take a stool sample of someone in basic observation, a department where they are stable enough to get up and yes, use the bathroom on their own.  Why wont my surgical teams take care of their needs between patients?  When its super busy they just sit at their desk waiting, their performance tanks as their needs go unfulfilled, THERE'S A TOILET 10 FEET AWAY!.  And the list goes on

Absolutely great fun in building hospital of your dreams. Takes a little while to understand and game still lacks many features such as: 
- departmenets: sexual diseases, oncology, maternity ward, mental diseases etc. 
- patients having multiple conditions
- treatments causing symptoms or even killing patients 
- realistic condition patients come to the hospital. Even with modes, game gives us unrealistic handicap which are patients with lucrative rare conditions requiring hospitilisations and surgeries
- lab procedures from clinic should make patients go hom and come when result is ready, not stay entire night for a result 
- also procedures take a bit too long and staff often is idel when it shouldn;t be. Still working on gameplayt fixes for that. e. g. if there is one main surgeon and at least two surgeries scheduled, any doctor that can help at surgery stays in oncall room instead of doing procedures. It can be fixed by banning the dctor from doing surgeries - still, annoying 
- more realistic graphics and sounds would be disturbingly great
Overall, it's a great simulations. Many diseases, many things to control, economics are fairly easy, but developing a facility takes tons of money. So you won't go bankrupt, but also you won't build perfect hospital in ten days. Sandbox missions are super challenging after sometime and struggling to do the events, keep prestige and have no untreated patients is the best.

- great game concept. 
- nice realism
- mostly well balanced

cons:
- lacks some important quality of life features. e.g. If you want to move a room (diagnosis/treatment etc.) you have to move each piece of equipment manually. (incredibly tedious)

I believe there is still much to improve upon within the game. Without the additional content (DLC), the base game is 60% downtime, 30% game play, and 10% wishing the DLC was within the base game. 

Suggested additions/improvments:
- Add patients with organ failure(adding dialysis and organ transplants w/ ability to harvest organs from patients)
- Add organ transplant board 
- Add ability to view x-rays of patients(just dreaming here)
- Add pregnant patients(OB/GYN, prenatal care, etc.)
- Be able to organize a ER crash team
- Directly send patients to OR for lifesaving surgery from ER or ambulance delivery 
- Patients with large medical bills can pay them overtime, creating a small increase in income 
- View patient family records/generate patients with family members(Ex. Patients family has a history of heart failure and the patient arrived to hospital for symptoms of heart failure). It would add more interesting view of the patients and their lives.
- Following the previous suggestion, add the family visiting the patient.
- Add a psych ward/department.
- Add ability to make multiple department sections/special department that do not run under the same department manager.
- Within ER and ICU have designated nurses and docs for a code team.
-Have the surgeries actually depict the surgery in the right location. (Ex. brain surgery depict patient seated with surgan conducting surgery on the brain)

These ides are suggestions that I believe can be worked on and added to the game. I have worked in ER and ambulance almost five years and these suggestions are pulled from the hospital environment.  The game itself is great in terms of realism and I hope it gets improved upon without having to pay $10+ for something that should have been in the game as a update.

I hope this is viewed by the developers and taken into consideration. If not, then this is just another paragraph to add to the list.",1616740919,1618099781,False,2,0,0.469750910997390747,0,True,False,False

Some people said that the way the game is monetized is unreasonable, personally I do not feel that way, I would gladly buy further DLCs.

I also saw a lot of negitive reviews on things that are not true, for example you can change floor layouts for every floor, you are not restricted to the same size or shape for every floor, under the foundation tab you can use one of the demolish tools to remove parts of the floor or you can build more areas and use pillars etc. for supports.

Overall I think the developers have done a really good job with the graphics and mechanics of the game, I think they just need to focus more on making it more user friendly for users. The tutorials are a grate place to start but I noticed a few people had issues with them so maybe it would be better for a button to enable to find out specific things about rooms, staff etc.

And regarding the DLC bad reviews, I honestly and annoyed that people are righting a bad review just because the game uses DLCs, I can only imagine how much research goes into the extra content, and people working on games such as this need to be paid, logically speaking if you can't handle developers making DLCs to keep the development going then Steam is not the place you are looking for, many of the developers here are small businesses with few people working on the project, some times you get big titles like GTA but 99% of the games on this platform can't afford giving free releases for this reason. It saddens me that people would right a bad review just with this one issues and yet I see this happen all the time on steam.

With that being said, the game is good, I highly recommend it, once you get to know the mechanics a bit of the game it becomes easier to play, if your more wanting more of a relaxed game play the there is a creative like mode you can enable or you could go with Two Point which I also own and is a bit more fun but is the same idea just less complex.

If money is an issue then I suggest waiting until it comes on sale the DLCs do come on sale too or have in the past, you can add it to your wish list and steam will send you an email when it comes on sale.

If you like admin simulators and hospital sims, this one is a must. 

You can build your hospital from the foundations to the gardens, heliport, floors, rooms, etc. 
You set up rooms, departments, etc as you like, respecting minimum mandatory assets to the different areas of diagnostics.
You hire doctors and technicians and they have different perks, habilities, and they evolve with practice/study. 
You have the option to assume control of your doctors, to help diagnose and treat patients as you like.
There are many objectives and challenges to ""spice"" gameplay and it gives the sense of moving forward in the game
You have many assets and items at your disposal to help build your hospital.
Simple but nice graphics and animations

Small gripes: 
Sometimes npcs have a weird pathfinding (but no harm to the flow of the work in the hospital) 
Repetitive human models (after a while they all look alike), no body differences, biotypes, etc.
Nice theme song, but repetitive after hours of play, there should be more variation.

The most annoying issue is the doctors/nurse AI, not overriding their activities to save collapsing patients or making urgent surgeries, so expect to loose lots of patients due to bad AI. Its really, really annoying how the AI is bad when managing priorities, even if you tell it to. I stop playing because of that, AI is too stupid. Endgame is, because of that, terrible, with so many collapsing patients and bad AI to save them in ICU.

There are two major drawbacks (well, three, but the third one is more personal) : 
- Not intuitive / Sucky tutorial. I had a rough start because of that, thankfully there's loads of LP's and guides made by players. Without wanting the game to be easy, it took quite a while to understand even the base mechanics of the game, know where things were and how they worked.
- Building things is mostly a pain, especially if you want to modify something. You can't select a room and move it, sometimes it's even hard to select to right object. But the worst is the lack of 'Undo' button. Once you do something, % of the time you can't undo it, and the times you can, you can only undo your last action, no further.
- The lack of scenarios. I don't like playing in sandbox, I usually never do in games.

Simple two-dimensional camera, similar to that of RCT2. You have the option to hide walls, which makes managing the hospital much easier. The two-dimensional graphics work wonderfully in this games favor. Every little minute detail was accounted for, such as scrub nurses handing surgical implements to surgeons.

Gameplay: 10/10
You can take over patients from your doctors, evaluating them, picking what exams to do, and then deciding how to proceed based on the results. I personally order an abdominal exam and a CT scan for every patient complaining of diffuse abdominal pain. 

Performance: 5/10
The game starts to slow down once you have more than two diagnostic departments (eg, general surgery and neurology). It is bearable, but I would not consider it ideal. While it is possible to make a general hospital with every department, you would have to keep staff to a minimum. It would still function, you just might not be as efficient.

Replayability: 10/10
Look at how many hours I have.

However, the game DOES have some things it could improve on, such as painting the walls (I feel this should work like the walls in The Sims, with separate construction and painting, and the ability to paint or remove the paint from the whole room by holding CTRL).

And yet even with some limitations this game is more fun than a hospital on a Saturday night and I don't even like going to the doctor.  

NOT TWO-POINT HOSPITAL
If you ever wanted a more realistic feel to your doctor building simulation game (and with better looking people) Project Hospital is it.

SOME NOTED GAME LIMITATIONS
If you like to build (think Sims style, Planet Coaster) this game is great for building.  Just remember there are  limitations such as smaller map sizes, placement of ambulance patient drop off is limited, controlling views can be wonky (a top down view would be nice), no copy and paste of individual objects and limited colors, doors, etc. (without mods).  
However,  even with such limitations if you enjoy creating and watching your building come to life after you build it, this game checks that box.  There are even prefabricated rooms so you don't have to do much building if you don't want to. 

FUN WITH LEARNING CURVES
There is a learning curve---at least two.  For some the learning curve might be learning the in game medical procedures and terminology.  For others it might be how to hire staff, room requirements,  how to use the User Interface game modes or how to build a foundation without deleting the doctor's office next to it.
For me it's been that kind of fun and more.  By the way, the first 2 tutorials were almost more frustrating than helpful.  And that's when you know it's time to jump straight into sandbox mode, put free build on (unlimited money),  unlock all buildings, and figure it out for yourself...oh and just enjoy the game.  Be sure you save your game often so you can load in a backup should something go wrong along the way.  

Highly recommended especially if you like building games and/or ever wanted to pretend you were a doctor.   Get all the DLC in a Steam sale bundle and it's a good deal.

Compared to other games of its genre, Project Hospital doesn't offer much variation in gameplay as you progress and expand your hospital. Bear in mind, I've only played sandbox/free play, not the campaign.

I would say the experience can be summed up to something like this: You build a room, and then you wait until you've earned enough money to build another room. 
Sometimes you've earned enough to open a new department, or buy ambulances. None of this changes your gameplay experience at all, and you unlock no new game mechanics to be mindful off. 
I was so excited to unlock ambulances, hoping it would shake things up. And when it drove away to pick up a critical patient, I felt so ready... and then nothing happened. Staff took care of it. It felt no different to me than a patient walking through the front door for a consultation.

In this genre, what is often very important is design of layout; where to place certain rooms and furniture, what should be close to eachother etc. In my experience, none of this matterns in Project Hospital. Are the rooms for treating critical patients far away from ambulance parking? No problem! If I need another office, I'll place it wherever I have space, and departments can be spread out all over the place. No problem. 

Finally, the most excruciating thing is waiting through the night. Your clinic is only open during day hours, with the exception of hospitalized patients (but you don't have to worry about them), and even your ambulances seem to be idle at night. So you wait, and wait until morning. There is a nice button in the game that supposedly skips the night, but it barely speeds up time further, so still you stare at the clock for minutes, every single day.

The only fun game mechanic is taking charge of patients and deciding how to treat them yourself. It serves no real purpose, as your doctors are perfectly capable themselves, but its better than simply staring at your hospital and waiting all the time.

For example, you are able to build prefab rooms or build design them yourself. You can also micromanage the entire hospital visit of a patient yourself, which means diagnosing a problem and helping that patient. Or you can have is done automatically. All this is great fun and gives the game a lot of depth. 

However, and I can't find many reviews that point this out, I am finding some bugs. They are not gamebreaking, but they are annoying. For example, when I am building, I suddenly find that I can't delete that one item. Or I suddenly am unable to move to lower floors. For now, all bugs are easily fixed by saving and reloading that save. 

Also, the game can be complicated to get into. It was not always clear to me why some staff did not register. You need a minimum of staff to have a department operational, but it does not always work and then I end up with many staff members, none of whom contribute to my minimum staff requirement for that department. I don't know if this was a bug, or if I simply did not understand it, but it was fixed by reloading a save. 

To end on a positive note; within the first hour of playing the game, I got a patient who had problems with her eyes.

Even the interface is difficult to understand in terms of flow, but that get easier with time. 

Now the issue that literally made me uninstalled the game is the developer decided to add the possibility of adding extra floors which you would think is a great idea, except the size of the first floor is copied to the other floors and there is no way to remove the extra space, so you always have the same size floor from below, whether you use it or not which result in something  that is simply ugly and unsightly.

WHAT I DO love about this game is that it is NOT ""CUTESY"" and RIDICULOUS like in other hospital games and that it DOES use ACTUAL MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY and SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE when managing the hospital.  THE ONLY PROBLEM i have with this game is that it LIMITS you to building ONLY FOUR FLOORS tall. If you try to build a 5th floor, it will not let you extend the elevators up to that floor and thus what is the point?   This game is worth the price you pay IF you are able to build smaller-scale hospitals.  But i love to be a grand architect of sorts and so that is why i ran into hard-coded limits in the game itself (maybe something only to do with my own prolific style of gameplay and maybe not really a fault of the devs or the game engine itself).  
Another problem the game has is that the TUTORIAL IS VERY WONKY and NOT user-friendly, so it still causes a lot of head-scratching just in being ""taught"" how to play the game. IF THERE IS ANY FLAW in this game, it is in the VERY LACKLUSTER ""Tutorial"" which needs A LOT MORE WORK!!!!

DLC and Doctor Mode only further this by allowing new scenarios and elements to the game. 

I love this game...

Take your time and learn all the controls and functions. Pay attention to your staffs needs as well as your patients. Or go into sandbox mode and build the hospital of your dreams, or perhaps nightmare.

If I could draw some comparisons, this gives me the same vibes as the original tycoon games of days gone by. But with much more support and modern touches. 40 hours in and I'm still learning new things.

Some of the events need to be fine tuned (I mean collapsing) - I have 2 patients collapse in the same location at the same time !! Not sure that is fully realistic, sure it could theoretically happen - but would be very rare.
As for CPU load - I have yet to run into a problem - so for those of us less CPU bound than others, multiple floors should probably increase from the default or be an option in the setup. (I am aware there is a mod)
Overall - this game does have a lot of potential and I look forward to further DLC and patches so I am going to give this a plus review for those who love simulation games

However, if you're expecting Two-Point Hospital type of game you'll be disappointed. This game is a bit more focused on realism and the art is completely different from Two Point  hospital. 

Personally for me I wish this game had the art work/animations of Two Point Hospital but with the same amount of realism. (The 2D is a bit disappointing for me. Hopefully if they create another project hospital game they can invest more $$$ in this department and make it a fully 3d game)  I personally would play Two Point hospital over this game if Two Point Hospital allowed me to free-build my own hospitals such as this game does.

Like I said, this game is fun but seriously needs graphic/game engine overhaul. Building hospitals would be so much better if I could just move my mouse and rotate the screen to the position that I want it. It would also make it so much easier when putting wall-paper on walls.

Positives 
+ Realistic
+ Very Detailed
+ Wide range of diseases and conditions
+ Random events to test your hospital
+ Presets for rooms are great if you are not into building 9 doctors surgeries by hand
+ Can customise pretty much everything so everything matches. No more plant pots not matching the wall colour!

Negatives
-Completing the challenges/ scenarios doesn't seem to get you anything. Nothing is unlocked apart from the next scenario. You may as well complete the tutorials and then go to sandbox mode.
- The tutorials don't tell you everything, some of it you do have to work out by yourself. Either that or the tutorials touch on something that is super important but seems super unimportant when you are completing the tutorial.

There are some concerns for me, which are the rotation (initially they had none), which is only in 45 degree turns and I found quite blocky. Similar to how xcom2 is, but than there is a mod that fixes it. This makes it extremely difficult to see everything you want and to move the camera to an ideal angle. Movement and people are also quite unrealistic, where they walk in straight lines, stop, turn 90 degrees to walk through a door. There is no flow. I do realize the game is setup on a grid, so they are probably designed to flow on said grid, but for such a realistic game, it would just be awesome if the people were realistic too. I mean they brought in Covid, so yea. I also don't like that in the challenges, say running an emergency clinic, if all you have operating is a clinic (no other departments), every single patient that walks through will have a symptom that can be cured by that clinic (even if they show other symptoms, it will always be the emergency one). I haven't had a single patient that I've needed to turn away due to not having the available facilities. (The game seems to be coded to make them all curable).

**NB** I compare Project Hospital to Airport CEO for reasons that will become clear later on. It’s also worth noting that I’m only playing the base game with none of the DLC (which will become apparent why later on). I’m also going to focus on the negative aspects of the game as the positive ones have been well covered in other reviews. I’ve also disabled comments because I can guarantee that I’d get an awful lot of hate for just pointing out what others have shut their eyes to.

I’m sure I will have missed quite a few of my complaints out and that others will disagree with me, but these are simply my opinions.

Building - Lets start with the very beginning. Building mode. When you’re building the ground floor things aren’t too bad. However the issues become apparent when you go upwards.Clicking the ‘add floor’ button adds a second floor as expected. However it adds the floor everywhere. Even if you would like the have some variation between floors, it adds it, meaning you have to go back and manually delete the next floor where you don’t want it, which doesnt sound too bad, but surely it would be easier to just outline where you want to build in the first place. If you decide to go down this route, then it doesn't add in the roof level and can cause issues with lifts further on down the line.

It’s also worth noting that you can only build up to 4 floors. Why not 5, or 6, and why cant you build a basement?

Lifts/Elevators - Firstly, where are the stairs in this game? Every hospital has stairs. It may not sound like much of an issue but it does cause issues with realism. The stairs could be part of the lift structure or a separate object. Why did the devs not think to include stairs in the first place? It baffles me.

Maternity/Paediatric Department - This is an often requested department on the forum with many people bemused as to why it’s not included. Originally the devs said that this was due to sensitivity for people that potentially lose children. This didn’t stack up once the infectious diseases DLC was made available that has a COVID pandemic included. Now they say that its due to additional animation work that would be required. I don’t believe this either as its not like they’re doing mo-cap for it like IW do for Call of Duty. It just sounds like excuses to me because they cant be bothered to do the work. 

Wheelchairs - no wheelchairs/disabled patients. The devs have said on Social Media and the forums before that these are on the way. But when? This also would surely require additional animation work so if they can do it for this, why not Maternity/Paediatric animation? 

DLC - at the time of writing. 3 DLC’s are available (4 if you include the Doctor Mode), Hospital services, Infectious diseases and Traumatology. If you buy these 3 DLC’s they add 50% to the cost of the game, yet based on the descriptions for these, they wont make the game 50% bigger. Traumatology especially reads like a huge rip off on the basis that there is a trauma room in the base game. With the exception of adding a helicopter and new animations (definitely shows the devs excuse for no maternity is just because they cant be bothered).

When you look at another game I enjoy, Airport CEO, that started as a very small game, which over time has been updated FOR FREE and is probably 200% bigger than it was when I first got it. Why do the devs for Project Hospital feel that they can charge so much more for so little additional aspects to the game. I just get the feeling that in 12 months time they will have abandoned the game, having first eeked out 3 or 4 more small DLC’s for a lot of money. Players have commented that the devs should be paid for their work and of course they should. I don’t deny that, but what makes them think its acceptable to pay a lot of money for half of an unfinished game. If this were EA everybody would be up in arms about it and swearing off EA games forever more. Ultimately its the playing community that birng this on themselves. By constantly paying ridiculous money for half assed games and then willingly paying the same again on DLC in the hope that it’ll become the game that they thought it always was. When in reality we should just stop buying games until devs (big and small) start giving players what they want. Completed games that engage players from the off without the need to pay horrendous amounts more to get the experience we should always have had. Hence why I wont be buying the DLC’s for Project Hospital.

So no in its present state I wouldn't recommend this game unless you can get the full game (base and DLC for around £15 total. Because its just not worth it if you have to pay £40.

Pros:
hard enough to be challenging, but game play runs automatically enough to not be too tedious or stressful
seemingly legitimate medical details  - I've learned a couple things, so that's a fun game bonus
attractive animation/details

Cons:
can be a little clunky when you need to move a misplaced room or view overall stats on your staff, etc (but workable)
would like more view options/angles

Due to the changes and recent content releases, I feel very strongly that I should adjust this to match. This game has made some great improvements in performance and gameplay and I whole-heartedly give my endorsement to this game.


[h1]What the game does right:[/h1]

	• Does a decent job to create a realistic hospital and doctor simulator
		○ I love helping with complicated diagnoses

	• Encourages you to get attached to your staff
		○ Allows you to create a doctor for a fee

	• Provide a baseline for a decent builder regardless of the limitations

	• Makes it clear what items are needed for which rooms to function

        • Gives you complete control over a hospital if you so desire


[h1]What the game does poorly:[/h1]

	• [strike]Makes you feel the dread in trying to run a hospital, always in debt and never enough earnings until MUCH later[/strike] – [i]With the change made for one additional insurance company being available, this quickly became a non-issue[/i]

•	Events timers are not made for large hospitals
o	Had a 5 floor 7 department hospital and failed an event because the last patient never arrived before the timer ran out (there were other problems addressed in another save from this one, but overall event timers aren’t long enough for big hospitals)
o	Same hospital, had everyone diagnosed, lost it because the patient decided to go to the restroom instead of get treatment
o	[i]A solution to this is granting a time bonus when a patient is treated, rewarding the player for their efforts and giving more time for possibly more complicated diagnoses[/i]

•	The game encourages you to progress too quickly, it feels like there is no time to really adjust to the demands and you are constantly building. While this may be close to reality, this doesn't create a fun gameplay loop

•	While I understand reducing the object pricing when it's sold back, the build system does not allow for mistakes to happen and actively punishes the player with funds when they make a placement mistake
		○ [i]A way around this is to allow a full refund until you exit build mode. There is a mod which does this.[/i]

	• Despite the DLC and changes, Janitors are still useless. [strike]You have to hire way too many of them for the amount of work they actually accomplish.[/strike] Janitors are much better, but dirt and filth piles up outside and there is no way to clean it currently. The outside isn’t considered a room they check for cleanliness

        • Most tips and tricks for the game are given to you during loading screens. 
       ○ I haven't checked the tutorial since I first got the game and I have completed all the challenges, but it wasn't until much later, after I saw several loading screen hints that I fully began to grasp the game.

	• No Basements, but you have Pathology (cadavers/autopsies)
o	[i]More levels have been added to the maximum levels allowed, would still love a couple basement levels.[/i]

	• No Stairs, only elevators
o	[i]This mostly matters for patients and staff to allow for alternate routes[/i]

	• Basic build mode, no ability to create interesting shapes outside of varying rectangles (RIP wavy/curved hospital designs)

	• Optimization is [strike]-POOR-[/strike] better, but still needs work
o	[strike]My computer CPU and RAM were both well under 50% usage, but still the game consistently freezes at duty changes and time of day, progressively getting worse as you have more staff members and events triggers § With less than 80 employees, and 4 departments I was getting major lag spikes whenever an Ambulance was triggered[/strike]
o	Had a 407 staff hospital running fine, it was when I was paused and trying to build there would be brief pauses and hiccups which would cause the camera and mouse to move suddenly afterwards.",1597184266,1608752781,True,0,1,0.735386312007904053,7,True,False,False

Project Hospital can really teach you how these buildings operate and with what thoughts and ideas goes into building them, for someone like me who have never seen the inside of a real hospital i already know a lot about how patients are diagnosed and what departments i can imagine to find.

You are given the possibility of thinking outside of the box, to create the perfect most efficient hospital in this game as much as in real life it takes skill, and forward thinking, you never know how the hallways and rooms will be used by the patients so it's up to you to think ahead and plan your build in order to create an efficient flow of patients, and say avoid infections to spread with the according departments.

Most certainly not a casual game. It took me several hours and retries to get the hang of it. I almost requested a refund during the first few hours out of frustration, but its charm kept me going.  

The tutorial, if anything, rushes the player to more complex scenarios than what I was ready for. By quite a long shot at that. I had to fully leave the campaign and do a custom/empty plot so I could start with a super small clinic and slowly work my way up. I recommend other players try this out as well in order to better adjust to the later mayhem that is running a fully operational hospital with labs, specialists, etc. The tutorial could be way better and I'm disappointed at yet another simulation game lacking a competent tutorial or help system. 

Unlike many other hospital or medical related sims, Project Hospital goes heavy on the realism. You can follow (even create) a patient all the way from the parking lot through reception, to the doctor's office, to the x-ray lab, to diagnostics, to operating room, to in-patient care, and back to the parking lot (many, many other routes and potential medical workflows for all sorts of problems and ailments).  A confusing mechanic you will run into fairly early on is lack of symptom or diagnosis variety. You pretty much get the same 10 or so diagnosis and that's it until you build out rooms and hire health-care providers. It really bugged me that it had me create all these specialty labs and radiology, to not have anything need them (no broken bones for example) until much later when I built-out and hired staff for internal medicine that patients started showing up with appropriate problems. None of this, of course, is explained to the player.

The game is fun, but very tedious. My biggest gripe is the lacking tutorial and the feeling of being over-encumbered from patients and their needs. Perhaps a bit too realistic! Way larger in scope than I had expected, especially with the DLC packs installed. For the wide variety of options, suites, specialties, and medical diagnosis/problems this game has to offer, the furniture, decor, and over-all building experience felt very bland and didn't appeal to me (it didn't appeal to the staff either as they constantly complained that the office looked ugly/boring). 

Having purchased this on a rather steep discount, I'd say it was worth the money. I wouldn't pay full, asking price. 

Definitely watch some gameplay videos of this before buying to better understand the difficulty, complexity, and what you're in for.

I'd go as far to say, hardcore gamers only. Definitely not a casual, laid-back game.",1608543341,1608543341,True,112,1,0.895559787750244141,0,True,False,False

This game provides a much more realistic take on hospital simulation, an approach I personally prefer, and it’s definitely not as light-hearted as its competitor.

In terms of gameplay, it’s great that you can choose how much you want to micromanage things: you could (in principle) diagnose every patient yourself, or you can just leave everything to your doctors. You can place every single object in a room, or just plop down the templates provided.

Something I like a lot better in this game than in 2PH is the ability to shape your own building the way you want it and that you have multiple floors available. As a result of the sometimes obtuse shapes of buildings in 2PH, I often find myself thinking of it more as a block-stacking puzzle than a simulation game, playing this game feels much less frustrating in that regard.

Overall, I think this is a better game than 2PH.

The game needs mods in order to function better - and I think the game should function better w/o mods.

The game isn't polished.  What I mean is there are limited options for 'pretty' or 'easy tools' or 'refined' for any way.

The final straw is all the bugs.  Seriously, the tiny things that don't work have physically made the game unplayable.  I don't understand how other people are playing but my guess is the core group are making their own mods or play with a different style than my own.  With me I see the bugs and my game fails.  

I have built, rebuilt, and rebuilt again.  Even reporting bugs is impossible.  I've asked for help on the forums, then my non computer savy self had to search my computer for hours to learn that files were hidden.  I was then told to upload the file on their main bug site only to find out I cannot even post there.

How many hours and how much effort do I have to put into in order to get things fixed and updated?  I feel like it is all one sided.  I even bought all the expansions.  I wish I didn't.

For example, You can have a separate Operating Room for cardiology and general surgery, but nothing for ortho. The ortho surgeons will still use the cardio or general surgery Operating Room if available. Or you can setup one department like general surgery to own 6 OR's and every other dept that has surgeons and cases that need an OR will use the general surgery OR's. Some doctors will also help out other depts, like if you are missing an anesthesiologist but ICU has one, they will participate in the surgery. The same goes for cleaning and common rooms. It is difficult to understand at first as the interface isnt as intuitive to see who is doing what. That said, you can decide to make a hospital that has a massive ortho clinic and hospitalization unit, and keep a couple smaller clinics for added capability... or you can max out each department. You do not need to start with an emergency dept, but the game heavily relies on the ER and clinic to get going.

You can decide to get completely involved in each patients case by taking over their case, or you can leave that up to the staff and help out when needed by getting tests scheduled or diagnosing patients in their patient card.

Building is also difficult at first, I recommend sticking to the prefab rooms at first until you figure out what works best in regards to items in the room and placement. The game will tell you what needs to be in each room and if it is missing something to function, but it is best to see the prefab rooms first to get an idea if you are completely lost. The wall interface is weird because there is no way to paste a wall type into an entire room, you need to manually drag the wall type across every room. After a while you get used to it.

There is plenty of management features in this game, you can manage the insurance that your hospital accepts, leading to more patients and different payouts. There is also some minor management when it comes to staff training, but that feature is very basic and not worth the time. It is easier to hire new staff.

Overall this is a fun game to play, Even if I try to do different things, I usually end up with a massive hospital with a giant OR block. It is difficult to make money at first, especially if you dont pick one of the easy money departments like ortho (surgeries). You have to balance upgrades and expansion with insurance payouts and bonus rewards to make money at first.

There are several aspects in the game that differentiates it from others, like:
- the level of detail:
     there are a lot of diseases, injuries, departments, cures, diagnosis, symptoms, staff types, objects etc. to work with and learn. 
- Different ways of playing
     You could fully play it as a simulation game, build and have your staff handle most of the day to day tasks 
OR 
     get your own hands dirty and work as a doctor yourself, be it guided by the game or fully based on your own medical knowledge
OR
      Go through the challenges and campaign for a different way of playing (12 levels)
OR
     Take one of the available pre build hospitals, staff them yourself and make sure it works.

For me it is a game I enjoyed a lot (even more compared to games like 2 Point Hospital).
The marketing part of the game (game price, updates and DLCs) I'm a little bit less fan about. Sometimes the extras of gameplay in a DLC are limited. OR they put great additions in a DLC while it would actually benefit the base game itself (for example wheelchairs in  Trauma DLC).
I certainly would encourage others to buy the game during its next sale, because then it worth it.

On one hand I'm glad that I've got a realistic hospital simulator, on the other hand I feel like I don't actually have much involvement in the game either. A lot of the time I was just sat idle thinking ""what can I do now?"".

The UI is clunky and does not work well. I feel that some things are too small and hard to read, yet when you scale the UI it doesn't work great. Occasionally menus overlap other items.

The tutorial was really confusing and I spent a great deal of time wondering what it was trying to get me to do. After I finally figured it out I decided to jump in to campaign mode and learn more about the game and how I can gradually build a decent hospital. I loaded the first level and thrown straight in to an already built, 3 storey hospital. It was such a huge jump from the tutorial. 90% of the hospital was already built. All I had to do was gradually reduce the debt and I had won.

I had no idea what any of the rooms were. Had no sense of how patients flow from one department to the next. Didn't grasp a feel how you go from new patients -> diagnosing -> treatment -> cure. There was no sense of progression or reward, but most importantly you don't gain a sense of learning how everything works by unlocking things and building them over a period of time. You just sort of... all get it given to you... on level 1.

Speaking of patients, I don't actually know what I'm supposed to be doing with them..? As I mentioned above, you already had a fully functioning hospital... All you do is watch them get diagnosed by a doctor and then get treated by a specialist. I had no role in curing the patient which felt very underwhelming.

Project Hospital isn't a bad game. I just don't think it's executed all that well. There are some simple improvements that they could add which would drastically improve the gameplay. Things such as;

- Adding a ""planning"" feature, so you can draw rooms/corridors and plan where you want to build things.
- Scale the UI properly.
- Let me research/unlock certain treatments or rooms over time.
- Let me be more involved in treating/diagnosing patients.
- Let me rebind keys. I have a Macbook Pro and don't have page up/down keys, or have easily accessible function keys.
- Add a search feature for items/rooms.
- Add more items for rooms.

All in all, I think if you're in to management games then it's worth a punt, but I honestly believe they need to make the core gameplay a bit more ""fun"" which involves the user a lot more.",1604033383,1604033383,True,29,0,0.769088506698608398,0,True,False,False

This game is hands down the best hospital building and management game I have ever played. Only to be let down by small bugs that shows the lack of thorough beta testing. Although, the game is still highly playable and worth buying if you are interested in a serious hospital building and management game. Oxymoron Games has a winner of a game if they can knuckle down the little bugs. 

For the hours I have played the little bugs that are prevailing are small glitches such as patients going into defined restricted areas, cards that pop-up after you have already hospitalised and ordered tests for patients stating a game condition that has already been addressed. I think these are due to slow game processing order. 

The game loses its shine due to the lack of realistic and interesting scenarios and it becomes repetitive when cards pop up that basically requires you to hospitalise a patient due to delays in lab or radiology staff coping with demand.  There is no mechanism to get rid of this type of micro-management as you get busy trying to improve or expand your hospital. The game could also do with a wider colour palette to define departments and rooms. Some other added on features aren't quite fully flushed out as the devs seem to be falling for the added feature creep without testing how it fully works. It seems a little rushed.

Although, this game is still worth buying as there is enough fun built in to appeal to older gamers that are into a semi-casual management sim. The game also has educational highlights that other games don't have. I would rate it as 83/100.

The game does keep one engaged BUT even at full speed the game can be slow moving. I have not found any bugs or glitches at this point. Graphics are OK Audio is mediocre. You have both a sandbox and campaign mode. So even casual players can have fun.

1 ] I have no unlimited undoing from any of the products that I put down, also there is no way to delete a room entirely even with furniture within it. I kept re-making a new game and going through the tutorials again, and again, trying to figure everything out. As well Waiting Rooms should be combined with existing others cause it takes up alot of space to make rooms that are mandatory.
2 ]  Doctor's Mode we should have our own offices as doctors and assess patients ourselves as players for the ""Player Mode"" option to do our own diagnostics; like the patients explains their symptoms and the percentage of choices of what diagnostic shows up all the same and so forth; basically we can make and customize our own doctor to work in the hospitals.
3 ] We, as Doctors, should be able to schedule surgeries during the day and/or during the night so that patients aren't waiting forever and a day for some availability to finally pop up. 
4 ] It is not as engaging. It would definitely feel more entertaining if at times the nurses/doctors I hired/surgeons I hired/etc. approached me sometimes through out the game to make it more engaging to make decisions of yes or no or reschedule.
5 ] Patient cards is only up to 8. For the patient cards I feel like it should be tabbed at the side of the screen and allow and showed different patient types: Inpatients (patients who need to stay overnight[s]) + Outpatients (patients who come to get diagnosed, cured, and go home), both 8 cards each.
6 ] It would be also very nice, if we could gain and/or choose which professions we can additionally have as doctors in case as doctor we hire is not available or cannot come into work due to well ""Getting drunk out at night"" or ""Accident"" or something.

The developers when making this game sat down and told themselves they did not want to make a funny simulator jokey hospital game like two point or hospital tycoon, they sat down and said, what is it like to work in health care, what is it like to manage a patient, what are the balances and compromises that have to constantly be made my staff to provide the best care they can.

You want to do every test possible for a patient? They will die before you have finished them, why? because tests are specific to diseases and you waste crucial time by sending them for unnecessary examinations. Choices like these, and what departments to send patients to, what departments to allocate the most staff to which balances out with their necessity to the hospital as a whole really makes this game stand out.

You are expected to read and understand medical conditions to a limited extent in  their free doctor mode, you are expected to try and piece together symptoms in a simple fashion and it makes a game that is terrifying as it is exhilerating. 

The fear you can experience when you took too long to diagnose a patient and they now are waiting for a free surgical slot when they should have been sent there far sooner has genuinely made me thing about how my errors in virtual care cost a patient their life.

I like management games. All the way back to the days when Lemonade Stand Tycoon was a thing at Scholastic Book Fairs. Getting to build and manage a hospital without the humor of Two Point Hospital seemed like a fun game. 

Well it is fun. It's more of a long term junk food game (junk food because it's not too hard and it's easy to jump in and out). I won't speak for the scenarios but the game is pretty easy in sandbox mode, outside of putting certain spaces at the most efficient location the game plays pretty much the same each go around and I've never had a situation where I started losing money. 

Other nice things: 
-The devs are constantly working on the game
-Ongoing updates
-DLC that adds to the game
-Doctor Mode (E.R. Lite Mode [tm])

The one con that really stands out is sometimes some good workshop mods will clash with new updates and pathing can be frustrating.

[h1]UPDATE(August 2020)[/h1]
The game in 2020 has now 3 DLCs and more features. It remains a game that needs a bit of  commitment, but this is the nature of the game.
The game is now very mature, and I think is a masterpiece.

VOTE: 9.5
+ Well designed
+ Doctor mode is a dream come true
- It's kind of harcore, so not for all



[i](ORIGINAL 2019 Rewiew)
This is a very difficult game to review (and to play). First of all, the tutorials are not great as the game is(2019). That means that to actually play it well, you will find more useful the sandbox mode: with some patience and time, in a couple of hours you'll understand the gameplay mechanics.

[i]What is it about?[/i]
Project Hospital is a bold experiment between a very complex managing simulator and a doctor simulator: it adapts to your style, as you can just manage the hospital and let the doctors do everythig for you, or also cure the patients by first hand. 
[b]This is the heart of the game: to cure people, to understand where the symptoms are heading to, and to do exams to find out a certain diagnosis.[/b] The hospital has many different departemens, like TC and Cardiology, all of them with their function and peculiar exams and treatmens.

The first thing I would advise to any new player is to familiarize yourself with pre-fabs. I enjoy tycoon games, but I'm not particularly a fan of plopping down furniture and decorations At the beginning, I didn't think I would like this game because there were a lot of rooms that required a good 10+ objects to function, and placing them all was extremely tedious. Additionally, when you encounter a new room, it's hard to tell how big you need it.

Once I discovered the prefabs, the game became fun.

There's a tutorial which is easy enough to follow but doesn't do a very good job of explaining the mechanics or what's going on. 
The first 'campaign' mission serves it's purpose of blending all the tutorial elements together to try it out and save the mismanaged hospital from debt, by treating as many patients as possible and repaying the $100k that the previous manager stole.
The second 'campaign' mission tasked me with making an existing hospital which had been losing money into an efficiently running one. That would have been fine, I knew how to build, how to treat patients, manage staff, but the tutorials and previous campaign hadn't given me any information about making it all work together efficiently. Does it need more space for people to walk around in the hospital, should I put the OR next to the ED, Radiology next to ED, General surgery clinic next to the OR as well... No idea.

The game has been pitched as a deeper management sim than 2.0 Hospital, which appears to be a truer successor to Theme Hospital, the granddaddy of this genre.  I purchased Project Hospital after playing 2.0 on the Xbox - while that game is fun, it didn't strike me as particularly deep, and the ability to focus on a more realistic set of outcomes appealed to me.

But it doesn't really matter.  The diagnosis thing - one of the key appeals - is shallow.  Leaving everything up to the computer docs usually results in a cheaper and more effective process, and no level of interaction really seems to improve either your patient outcomes or, more importantly, your enjoyment and appreciation of the process.

Building is on rails - build this specialization based on a checklist, earn some money, then build this other spec based on a checklist.  The ""career mode"" consists of three hospitals, and the scenarios consist of little more than eliminating this resource or speeding up these injuries.

Beyond these issues there are a number of nitpicky items (i.e. there are some pretty horrendous grammar issues in dialogue boxes), but they really don't matter because the game is just so hollow.

To sum up, Project Hospital is a spreadsheet simulator that happens to take place in a hospital.  It's not a game, because there is no game in the game.  Despite an attractive art style, there is no substance to justify your money - there are tons of better simulators out there.",1595557030,1595557030,False,6,3,0.524823367595672607,0,True,False,False

I would of gave this game a thumbs up had it still in Early Access and not released. I expect a $25 game to be pretty polished and, not bug free, but atleast the game devs. should fix the problem asap. Otherwise don't release the game...

1. Doctors doesn't know how to take lunch break. They will starve, hold their bladder, and get super tired as long as there are patients in line. It doesn't work like that in the real world. 
**Developers Response: ""If we make the doctor's need over taking care of patients, then the players will complain about how doctor roam around too much and instead of diagnose patients that are waiting in line. 

IMO that's a bad programmer's response. A simple fix to this issue will be, allow doctor to take lunch break, which is about 2 hours, refresh themselves then work for the rest of the day. Or atleast have an option for rotation shifts with avaliable doctors. Instead of over working themselves. (Not how doctors work in the real world btw) 

2. Reception and waiting area should  have the option to link to different departments.... like most hospital or clinics...

3. Make your doctor algorithm better. Instead of grabbing food > Go back to office> Go to the restroom> Go back to office > Go to rest > Go back to office, please make them do all those things in one go. They waste so much time to fill their need during break (If they even know how to use lunch break....) due to game dev.'s poor algorithm...

**Doctors should meet their need automatically when each of their needs reaches 2 stars or below. How do they even became a doctor when they don't even know how to eat, rest, and use the bathroom when in need? 

4. When a critical injured patient get send to the ER, everybody is just casually walking like it's a bunch poorly programmed bots...and poorly programmed indeed... It's sad to see those nurse/doctor walking casually while rolling the critical injured patient into 5 different rooms before the actual surgical procedure. They should be either rushing or running! Not realistic at all.

5. When it's suppose to be Doctor patient 1 on 1 time, Janitors just walk in like he is the DOCTOR and start mopping. Same goes to when someone is still in the bathroom stall, Janitor just walks in and start mopping the stall like he knew the person wouldn't mind!!!!! What????

There are so many flaws with this game that it shouldn't have been released. The price for a poorly programmed and algorithm game does not worth $25.

Once I finished all the tutorial scenarios and spent a few hours playing and figuring things out, I was hooked! As of now, I'm not only glad that I took a chance on buying this game, I can honestly say that it's become one of my top ten favorite games that I've ever played. 

Despite the tutorial scenarios and tips, there are quite a few things you end up having to figure out for yourself, trial and error style. Don't get frustrated (like I did), because, in retrospect, I realize that figuring out how to make your hospital thrive is a big part of what makes this such a fun game!

On it's own, this game has a lot to offer and can easily be played repetitively without feeling repetitive (if that makes sense lol). But, if you want more, I also recommend the DLCs. I've already bought the doctor DLC and will likewise be buying the infectious disease DLC in August. Unlike other games/developers, this game's DLCs provide a lot of value for a shockingly low price. Definitely worth the money.

2. no stairways only elevators... wtf?

There's nothing wrong with those games, it just depends on what kind of experience you are feeling at any given moment. If you want a more realistic management game, then this is the one. 

It can be a bit difficult to progress past the mid game. Your patients keep collapsing and taking up your resources. The game doesn't hold your hand through this kind of challenge. You need to be able to delve into the various menus and figure out how to optimize patient care to get these people in and out before they can die on you. 

I wish the am and pm statistics that you get after each shift gave you a little more detail on how you could improve. It'll tell you how many rooms experienced critical demand during the shift. but it won't tell you which ones or why. This inevitably leads to me focusing on one department or another for an entire shift trying to figure out what the hold up is. That is my biggest gripe with the game. I'm expected to improve the hospital without the data that would help me do so in a quick fashion. My only other real criticism is that doctors tend to over-test patients with stat labs even though they already have a confirmed diagnosis, which just wastes time and prevents the patients who actually need the labs from getting them on time (which leads to collapse). There's not an easy way to prevent this without micromanaging each patient from beginning to end.

Otherwise, I love this game. If you are a fan of hospital sims in general, you will like this game. It improves upon a lot of the major aspects of the other games I mentioned and makes them feel more realistic. There always seems to be room for improvement and money can be tight which forces you to make tough decisions and live with the consequences. This is in contrast to some other sim games which become broken in the mid-game when you have too much money to actually spend.",1594666147,1594666147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found diagnosing and treating patients especially interesting, but soon ended up limited by my lack of treatment facilities so ended up having to put my construction hat back on. I expanded the Hospital in order to house and recruit not only more skilled staff members but ones that specialised in different areas and were better equipt to treat my patients, like surgeons and radiologists for example. 

In terms of building Project Hospital has a fairly substantial amount of content available, I actually managed to build the Doctors Surgery down the road from me rather easily with the building tools available. One negative for me in regards to the building side of things is that PH doesn't have enough customisation options on certain objects like doors, walls, and floors. By this I mean the colours available, materials, patterns, and everything just ends up looking very similar, which isn't too far off the truth in a real-world Hospital I guess, so it may be intentional.

One gripe for me when I first started playing was that I felt like the tutorial sort of threw me to the lions far too early on, and I would have liked more time practising my skills in a much smaller building. I ended up quitting the tutorial and jumped into sandbox mode where I started a tiny little doctors surgery to practice in, this for me was a much, much better way to learn and had me enjoying PH a hell of a lot more.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a serious, intense simulator with an enormous amount of micro-management, then I'm confident that Project Hospital is for you.

2.) Diagnosing and treating patients: With Doctor mode on 'Specialist' I really enjoy having patients come in and going through the whole process of narrowing down what is actually wrong with the patient and then treating them. From minor illnesses that simply require a prescription of pills up to emergency cases where immediate intervention is required to keep the patient alive before surgery and (hopefully) recuperation.

Therefore things that appear to detailed and interesting over complicate the game whilst more complex things are overly simplified. 

Things I like
The detailed graphics
The real illnesses
The day night cycle
Having multiple floors
The fact that I work in healthcare
Music
Customisation
Getting to have wards


Things I don't like
I can't plan anything like theatre lists for surgeries.
Poorly thought out diagnosis algorithms
Rooms becoming overwhelmed with the tiniest bit of work
The lack of forethought in how people might place rooms
No porters
Poorly thought out diagnostics
(No, you do not go and have an ECG in the ECG room if you are an inpatient!)
No ability to tailor your diagnostic tree
Staff hiring and hidden perks (you aren't actually allowed to display such humanflaws in real life!)
Hidden symptoms (if they are hidden then they are NOT SYMPTOMS)
tests needing rooms for no reason
Payouts are too low
Hiring the best staff in no way improves anything other than diagnostic doctors.
Cleaning staff the only administrators
Pharmacy is poorly conceived.
No way to look at a patient deteriorating.
(The warning triangles really are meaningless)
I can't compel the surgical team to work.
Cleaners inefficient no matter who you hire.



Now pleast don't think I'm being harsh.
This is merely my frustration because I work in a hospital and I feel like just asking any hospital worker how things really work would have made this game a lot easier, smoother to run and easier for non medical people tooibstill recommend it and have all the dlc departments.

I have a lot of fun as I am quite into simulation and management game. However, there are a lot of room for improvement.

The level designs needs to be improved e.g. Campaign 3 is too easy, mush easier than campaign 2. Campaign 2 is pretty bad, it's not difficult or challenging, but just, confusing. There should be more levels where you have to save crappy hospitals, but they should be later in the game, not campaign no. 2 where you got hit but a pile of junk when you are not familiar with all the game mechanics yet. Campaign 3, on the other hand, is more like a tutorial level than Campaign 2, because it literally shows you everything i.e. how things should be placed and organized.

Moreover, sometimes you just feel like watching fast-forward paint-dry where you are just getting through the night. Emergency scenarios (missions) are challenging and they are the time you feel immersive and actually ""doing something"" in the game. They should be better utilized to get the pace of the game faster. Sometimes the time limit and penalty on the scenarios kind of does not make sense, especially the patient is getting treated and not dying. There should be a larger variety to these.

I can see there are many hours of development time spent on this game. And it is a great, oldschool game, it has the capacity to give you good tycoon experience. At this point it's not a easy game to get into, but really it should. 

There are two main problems that create the wall around the gameplay. First one is UI. This may be the most cryptic UI I have ever seen in my life (believe me, I'm playing strategy games since 8bit home computing era). And frankly, the developer already know this. There are many customization options in the main menu, such as message coloring and ui scale according to your needs (which will not solve any of the problems). I wish I can show you one of the windows in the game, such as department statistics. It looks like a big pdf document, in portrait mode, filled with very small font!  Why portrait? There are plenty of space horizontally. Have you ever tried to read a full page document in your 1920x1080 monitor? I'm sure you have zoomed in. If I rescale UI to make fonts bigger, the window got bigger and readable but part of it go out of screen and no scrolling available. Please check the given in-game screenshots, the one with ""jessica robinson"" this ""card"" is one of the most readable UI element in the game. Can you read or understand this window? Even this one is easy to understand, it will give you really hard time.

The second one is tutorial. I can see there is enough effort to make it available, but sorry, the ui is so bad, it's almost impossible to find anything asked to do in tutorial. It's a text only tutorial, it shows the general direction of buttons sometimes but generally you need to find the button yourself in the cryptic menu. Once you open the instucted window, the tutorial says ""this window has those buttons: ambulances, buget, bla bla bla..."" It literally reads the buttons on the window which I have already opened and saw them that they are there. I'm more than one hour into this game, and I'm trying hard to complete it :) And I have only managed to complete second tutorial and it was painful.

I still recommend this game, why? I can see the big effort went into this game and It looks like a complete hospital tycoon game hindered by not-so-good UI. Maybe you may easily get around the ui to play it nicely, who knows?",1593815245,1593815245,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I enjoy being able to control a patient's care, manage staff, and build different departments. The addition of the pharmacy is awesome and a great way to make extra money off patients before they leave the facility.
There are a few things that I find to be somewhat annoying. I wish you could prioritize a patient over others. I wish it was a little easier to understand where exactly you need to send a patient to get them fully cured, as sometimes it requires multiple departments. I wish you could remove a patient from ICU at your discretion.

Oh my word, what a dumpster fire of an experience. Here is the perfect example of how not to structure a game. Take, for example, Two Point Hospital. Here you have a game that starts you with a small hospital, walks you through the building and hiring process, then exposes you to new departments as they're needed so you have a solid grasp of how to play the game when you advance to the next hospital. This is how it should have been done in Project Hospital, but wasn't.

There is a lot of depth to all the various things you can do in this game, which is great, but you'll spend more time outside the game trying to figure out how to do anything than actually playing it. The tutorial shows you how to build but not much more than that. Then you're plopped down into a giant, three story hospital and given an objective with no further direction on how to accomplish it, where to start, what to do, or how to do it. You'll be basically scrolling around, wondering what everything is, what's going on, and not being sure of anything while the goal quietly fulfills itself. Really. I did have to build a few rooms and hire some staff later when the need arose, but only understood how to do that because of a video I watched before purchasing the game.

After fumbling around while the first campaign completed itself, you're sent to a second hospital (another massive and fully filled building) and told to make it function smoothly. That's it. What does that mean? How do you do it? No clue because ... THE GAME DOESN'T TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY IT!!!!! Seriously ... WTH? Turns out you can move rooms around. Learned that from another video, but the process of doing it is so non-functional that it's probably easier to delete everything and start with a clean floor plan. Why make such a complex game and then not teach players how to play it? There is a help manual but that is so basic as to be useless. 

The three ""campaigns"" are prebuilt hospitals with a single goal to meet, there's a handful of challenge maps, a sandbox mode, and a scenario section that's empty. Basically, there's a lot of depth in the details but not much for actual gameplay. From other reviews I looked at, seems like you'll need to explore the workshop in order to get the breadth of gameplay you get from something like Two Point. Maybe I'll try again after watching several hours worth of videos of other people fumbling about; should have a basic concept of how to play after that.

[b]Pros:[/b]
* So much visual detail! The developers put a lot of love into this project, and it shows.
* There's some real challenge to the game, but not so much that it's frustrating. Learning the mechanics and little tricks here and there to make your hospital better doesn't kill the fun.
* You can scale the level of micromanaging. If you want to follow every. single. patient. through their exams and diagnosis, you can! Want to let the doctor's do their thing while you watch? Go for it. (Although, disclaimer, I've always taken full control, so I don't actually know how well subjecting your patients to the whims of your doctors turns out.)
* The 93 hours I've put in are from the career mode and challenges -- I've not even touched sandbox mode and I still haven't completed the challenges. (Let's say 80 hours, because I may have fallen asleep once to the relaxing sounds of my patients getting 
* You can micromanage to your heart's desire, and it still manages to be an extremely relaxing game. This is the #1 game I go to after a long, frustrating day of work.
* The game has, from what I can tell, a great mod community.
* The devs are very active and are still updating/patching the game regularly.
* I have learned so much random medical terminology! So much knowledge I'll never use!

[b]Cons:[/b]
* Probably the single biggest con is the learning curve. The tutorial walks you through the basics, but you're probably not going to have a lot of fun unless you spend some time doing a trial and error approach or reading game guides. I personally enjoyed figuring everything, but I know it's not for everyone.
* I've heard there are some bugs, but I've only encountered a couple and they were easy to work around. The most annoying one is when I reassign a patient to a different doctor, the new doctor assignment won't stick.
* It seems there's some missing text in a few places. Typically, hovering over a examination will let you know what room is required to complete the test, but there's a few that are missing these instructions. (For anyone wondering, thoracentisis requires a Special Procedures room in Internal Medicine hospitalization.)

Overall, if you love tycoon games, get a kick out of micromanagement, are intrigued at the prospect of playing Dr. House, and don't mind reading a game guide or two, I absolutely recommend this game at full price. If it's on sale, all the better!",1593141336,1593141336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Probably one of the most detailed and robust hospital sims out there.  Engine works well and fits it's purpose well.  However, an unreasonable percent of play time is spent planning out where chairs or tables or various other knick-knacks would go instead of actually managing a hospital.  I never felt like I had a chance to really get immersed in the management or day to day operations as I was constantly quagmired with having to add a new room with this or that in it.  The placement of objects and rooms itself wouldn't be so bad, however everything seems to be this multi-step process that involves going in and out of menus that have different options in different contexts, with no short or logical way to efficiently hit all the things you need to finish your task.  Your nemesis in this game is the interface.

Even if you're not at all picky about interfaces, the game itself is fairly clunky.  You don't really make steady income by effectively managing your staff and employing them to treat patients.  It's this weird dynamic where you're supposed to seek out goals and devote all your resources to achieving the tasks set out for you.  ""Have x number of rooms with y furnishing.""  ""Treat x number of patients in y hours.""  to get a large sum of cash that you can then devote towards the next inane goal.  

I started writing this review with a neutral mindset, but the more I think about this game... the more I realize I really don't like it at all.  I never felt like I was managing a hospital.

Its challenging, yet simple. The graphics are simple, yet complex. That really describes the game perfectly. Theres a certain simplicity to the game, yet achieving long term success can be... well.. difficult at times.
You build a hospital from the ground up. Choose the color of the walls, the floors, even the uniforms if youd like. You hire doctors, techs, nurses, and each have their own skill sets and perks. You can manage several different departments as well. Theres clinics, emergency, cardio, labs, radiology, orthopedics, even (with the dlc) gift shops, visitations, cafeterias, and so so much more.
There is also a little gem hidden inside the management aspect of the game and that is at any point in time you can take control of diagnostics and try to figure out what is wrong with your patients, and the health problems are real, with real solutions. Theres no funny bone in this sim, this ones about the down dirty and bloody business of saving lives.

One thing I really liked about this masterpiece is it's attention to detail. I have a soft spot for extremely intricate visuals and from the moment I laid eyes on this game I knew I would love it. The visuals isn't set to be realistic, but it's cartoony vibe and 2D-like objects makes the game unique and beautiful on its own.

There are a few things I feel that can be improved to not only make the game more realistic, but help the over all game flow. The main aspect is transporting patients to and from areas of the hospital. In a real hospital, the person taking your x-ray, CT,, MIR etc, is the one who will take yo back to your room if you have been admitted to the hospital. 90% of the time, you are transported by wheel chair, and not a bed.

[*] [b]In-game menus[/b]
In management mode, the clinic section is on the left side which is just below the management mode button. The hospitalization section is on the opposite side of the screen, which took me a while to notice if you have a big screen.
Some of the menus are not introduced or explained, and you will just learn about it as you play, which is fine with me.
[*] [b]HUD[/b]
Most tooltips are combined per section. (If there are 3 icons in that section, the mouse over on 1 of them will show for all three. It does not specifically point to which is which and does not further detail the meaning)
[*] [b]Object\Path collision[/b]
Patients and objects just goes through each other. (It's not something I disliked)

I hope the moving the mouse at the edge of the screen can navigate (I haven't checked the settings yet, but by default it's not)

I disliked on how rotation of camera works. It feels I always pressing the wrong button
[*] [b]Status of a diagnosis or treatment[/b]
It shows whether a task is queued up, performing, or done. Great!
But during performing the task, I want to know the progress of it.
If there is a reason to hide it, let me know, but it should not be for everything. In tasks involving Medical Laboratories, there could be some indication on how long it will reveal the result.

868360,68911402,76561198107962142,0,7,4462,0,3371,1654280848,"Even though I've played this game for 50+ hours, its hard to recommend this game. It's not worth £22.50. 

There are just too many problems that ruin the game later on as your hospital gets busier and bigger.

Firstly, dirty floors ruin your reputation. Therefore you need to hire janitors to keep the floor clean. This is problematic because of how the game works. One square grid gets dirtier every time someone steps in it, by a fixed amount (unless staff or patients have the clean/dirty shoes perk). As the hospital gets busier, more patients are walking around, between more departments (a lot of the time Emergency, Radiology, Medical Labs, and then maybe a Specialised Department), and as the hospital gets busier, you need more staff as you generally have more departments open. You therefore need more janitors who also contribute to dirty floors. Because of this, the amount of janitors you need increases exponentially. At the very start of the game, you can get away with 1 janitor, for about 15 total staff/patients. When you get to later on and are accepting 100 patients, with 5 departments open, you need roughly 25 janitors to keep the place clean. It's ridiculous, frustrating, and just annoying. For a game that is meant to be realistic, this is just silly. 

Secondly, some procedures take way too long, particularly in the Medical Labs Department. For 100 patients, you need roughly 6 hematologists, and 6 histologists. There are several reasons why this happens:
Firstly, patients aren't willing to wait very long for tests/results, literally only a few hours for them to start complaining. Secondly, it takes each technician two hours to process one test. Thirdly, when patients have a confirmed diagnosis, doctors insist on sending patients for tests if there is ONE hidden symptom. It doesn't even matter whether this symptom is critical or not. I would be more sympathetic, if the doctors actually treated all the symptoms - they don't most of the time, they tend to only treat half of the symptoms, including the actual condition. 

My third point - why am I only allowed to choose three insurance companies out of the 6 available? I just don't get it. You eventually hit a roof where you can't get any more patients. I don't understand why they're adamant you can only have 3 insurance companies. There are mods available, that I recommend, that allow you to change this. But I don't see any logical reason why they would prevent you from having all 6 insurance companies. 

Fourth - The Pharmacy. People were asking for this well before the game was released, during Early Access. It's now available...............for an additional cost of £6.99. Disgusting. I can't stand developers that take advantage like this. It should've been in the base game. Okay, you get a couple of extra things like Managers for Janitors, which supposedly increases their efficiency - it must be minimal though because I don't notice any change. 

Fifth, the game is paced wrong in Sandbox mode. You make hardly any money at the start, when you have 10 patients - you get grants and stuff when you hit objectives, but it doesn't make up for the fact that you have hardly any patients at the beginning. The game sort of pushes you in to expanding quickly, but not really providing you the funds to do so. For example, you can get patients on the first day needing an X-Ray, so you'll get a pop-up telling you to sort it or the patient will leave. It can cost upwards of 20k to get an xray up and running, and at the start you may only get one patient a day using it. With wages, you'll be bleeding money. You'll then get the same with Medical Labs. So within a couple of days, the game will want you to have opened 3 departments, for about 20 patients. The amount of money you make at the start makes this hard. When you only have an emergency clinic open, you're only making a couple of hundred off each patient. At the start, you can often find yourself borrowing money to try and make money. It even costs money to lay foundations to build your hospital on. 

Sixth - Patients collapsing. Happens too often, I mean way way way too often. If you have 100 patients in your hospital, you can have anything from 10-15 collapsing. It's just silly and unrealistic. Patients collapsing from dehydration having walked past and ignored several water coolers, vending, and coffee machines. Bizarre.


Finally, pathfinding. This has been a constant problem/menace since this game was released, and it still isn't resolved. Pretty much every update they bring out has a 'fix'f for some issue related to pathfinding, but problems still exist. Example - I have water coolers in every office. A doctor literally walked out of her office PAST her water cooler, to go to the one next door and use that. Why. I just couldn't fathom it, I tried to make sense of how it could come to the conclusion that the other water cooler was closer. It was further away in both straight-line distance, and steps taken to get there. It was utterly baffling. 

I just can't recommend this game, it's too frustrating.",1589128131,1589128131,False,85,16,0.771264195442199707,2,True,False,False

The progression system of the game means that every sandbox game starts the same - build A&E (or Emergency for non-UK gamers). Build X-Ray, build a lab etc. etc. Each completed action allows more people to access your facilities. Don't follow the progression goals? No new patients for you, you'll be stuck at 10 patients each day. You could build a histology lab instead of a haematology lab first, but the game won't recognise that as the lab it needs, so no progression for you. Even though (when manually diagnosing your patients to kill the early game stage grind times) you can see clearly what diagnosis labs you need. Then you must build intensive care. Woah, $50k cost? Epic! Except nobody will come needing it. So then it's quick progression to Neurology or Internal Medicine hospitalization which can need the IC ward so you can start making the big bucks...right? RIGHT? Well...no.
Yes, some patients are charged $2500, but the cost of minimum staffing is pretty much equal to treatment charges, so here's where your profit flatlines. I had 8 ward beds, 6 HDU beds and 5 IC beds, with all but 2 ward beds occupied. Minimal staffing required, plus janitors. No extravagance...and £900 daily profit (as long as my A&E got enough higher value diagnoses each day from 55 patients). The IC ward cost $59000 BEFORE the cost of land, walls, corridors, cleaning, toilets, etc. One ambulance (which brings in ONE trauma patient daily) is $35000. On $900 profit each day? No thanks, I'm not about the grind life.
Patients all start to have repeating, basic illnesses as that's all you can cure. It could be heart disease, Flail Chest...or a bruise- GUESS WHICH ONE IT IS EVERY TIME? 
tl:dr - good fun game, eventually repetitive, too much grind, money needs balancing.

THIS IS NOT TRUE (anymore?). I found this out accidentally, when I loaded a game and suddenly the hospital was displayed from another angle.

Now about the game: Yes, there are a lot of things to do. The font is quite small to read, but it is readable. Opposed to other detailed games with a lot of tutorials, the tutorials here are not boring. Sometimes I did not continue playing games, because the tutorials were not fun.
But here, you start immediately with treating patients. It makes a quite lively impression.
The only thing I don't understand is, what impact does it have on the speed of the treatment, if I choose the kind of treatment quite early? It seems like the doctor still continues his/her usual routine, without an impact from my side.
That would be nice to know!
The design, music and the gameplay are nice and entertaining. It is almost something like a Serious Game, or maybe it is. There are some medical things to learn if you are interested in those.

- pathfinding is crazy sometimes, like when a patient is transported to a distant examination room instead of a nearest;

- hospital doctors don't prioritize between giving life-saving medicine to a critical patient and making secondary examinations of a stable patient, and you can't prioritize it manually (the only solution is to have more doctors);

- when I do micromanagement, it is often includes reassigning doctors or nurses from one department to another, but it requires too much clicking.

EDIT: Having played some more since, I've noticed some problems.

1) Hospitalization costs a ton of money to both implement and maintain, but the rewards to setting it up are basically nil.  Oh, my reward is that I am now allowed to spend MORE money, which I don't have, on ICU now?  Great.

2) Opening any department other than surgery not only has no benefit, but actually significant downsides.  By only having surgery and emergency, you can guarantee that no patient will come in requiring anything else, wages are lower, fewer rooms required which means lower janitorial staff.  Adding departments does nothing for you and a lot against you.

My main issues: 
The tutorial is laughably bad - you can finish all three and not know anything about managing the hospital - nothing on finances / loans, nothing on insurance partnering, nothing really related to large scale staff management, or how to build efficiency in the treatment process or managing supplies (if those are even a thing in this game). It also doesn't really go over all of the basic camera controls so... You only get the bare minimum basics of building walls and rooms. During tutorials it directs you to tool tips for things like hiring - which don't really help much when the UI is so terrible and 'extra pop-up' menu dependent it's not intuitive to navigate to the button the tool tip is referencing - while doing nothing to direct you to said button (even just a picture of the button in the tool tip would have improved these immensely).

The UI - Menus on menus on menus. Floating about, covering other things, have to close them all individually, tiny font yet the full menu doesn't fit entirely on the screen, and don't bother with UI scaling since many of the menus are already too big for screen at default settings.

The first campaign - After the tutorial I still didn't feel like I knew how to RUN a hospital but figured this would be expanded through the campaign scenarios. I started the first mission and was given the background information of a mismanaged hospital in need of saving. I love these scenarios so I was excited! And then I was met with a fully developed and functional hospital - all the rooms in working order, fully staffed, clean, lots of money in the bank. I turned the game to fast forward and waited... I was making money, I didn't have to direct staff, or put out fires... I just had to wait... for 5 minutes I sat there watching the screen as this hospital functioned without my intervention and I met goals related to treating patients. After that I called it quits, I want a game that I can play, not one that plays itself.

Sandbox - Feels hollow without any objectives, and the building aspect is too poor to save it.

If this game ever gets updates to take it out of early access levels of completion, I'll probably give it another shot - as it stands however this just does not feel like a fully completed game.",1588448581,1588448581,False,23,4,0.557011008262634277,0,True,False,False

For instance one of my first tutorial games I was shown a 3 story hospital and even though I clicked the ""remove walls"" icon to see what was inside, it took me 10 minutes or so clicking in the UI and thinking I missed something, to understand that if the building is showing on the rooftop, then it doesn't matter if you click to remove the walls or not, by default the mission started on the rooftop. So, I had to click to go down a few floors and then the remove wall option worked as expected... sigh

About the mechanics of the game, I was not able to go past the second campaign. For instance why is the patient unable to do this or that? Why is the patient waiting? Exactly what room do I need to build to treat this disease? And then a couple of bugs that for me ruined the game. One of them was patients in the fire hazard event or whatever, some of them, did not show up, they were literally transparent. I would click the bottom left icon to follow them as they move and i could not see them. Then, it was saying ""waiting"" all the time, with doctors obviously available but doing nothing to treat them. Then, mission failed 5000 penalty...

OKAY I PROMISE TO CHANGE WHEN FIXED BUT FOR NOW 1 STAR.  IT IS A 5 STAR GAME BUT WITH THE DLC BUGS ARE RUNNING OUT OF THE WOODWORK.  WHEN DELETING ITEMS SOMETIMES THE GAME BREAKS. 

----> I.E. placed an elevator then the elevator took the money and didn't show up.  Well that is a bummer, but that is the start of the bug.  When trying again my delete button (removing walls from failed elevator) the walls would delete no matter where I HOVER! my mouse... No clicking included.  Save and reload... that usually fixes bugs in this game.  Nope now both the emergency and surgery departments don't detect the necessary rooms ... ALL OF THE ROOMS NOT FUNCTIONAL, okay so delete and replace all the rooms that are malfunctioning.  Yes they are detected and now I can get clients again... oh save now corrupted and can't ever load it.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm New DLC seems cool though just can't wait until it works.


it is 50 / 50 if the delete buttons create bugs but it does happen.  This is the worst example but it did happen frequently enough to make me post a comment.

I loved the challenge of trying to diagnose patients and learning about medical terminology, and the freedom to sandbox, experiment and build whatever hospital you want. It's not a perfect game but definitely engaging and well worth the price IMO, which is not expensive considering the features and replayability.

Quite challenging at times so not really for the 'casual' gamer who wants to be hand-held/ only looking for a quick game. You need to try things and learn through trial and error. There is 3 tutorial 'levels' but these only really introduce you to the UI - you need to figure a lot out by yourself. The upside to this is that there is many ways to play - I keep coming back because I think I'll build an even more effective hospital layout next time... So replayability is good. There's tons to do with all the different departments and each build you choose might require a different layout and management strategy.

The fanbase is small but growing :) they just released new features 'doctor mode' and 'hospital services' ,and the developers have many more great expansions in the works, so I think I will be following it for some time.

Bugs - there are still a couple kinks in the game, but I reported a bug and had a prompt response with 48 hours that they saw the error and were fixing it. Since they are introducing new mechanics and content to a game that is already up and running I think some glitchiness is unavoidable, but I don't think the bugs will be a permanent issue.

I played around 35 hours, but then got tired because of some limits in terms of organisation of the hospital, especially that a lot of stuff like the labs couldn't be shared between departments, or that Internal medicina had OR and surgeries.

Last week, as I was scrolling through steam, I saw that a big patch for this game came out, along with a new DLC (which I haven't bought and tried yet). So i thought I'd give it another go, and I couldn't believed how much the game, which was already fun, improved. Almost all the annoying stuff was revolutionised, for example labs are now part of a specific department so all other departments can use the same labs, Internal Medicine don't have actual surgeries anymore and so on. Some stuff requires more tweaks but the developer demonstrated they are listening to the community.

Only a handful of games managed to change so much after almost 2 years, improving hugely based on users reports. So do buy this game and if there is anything that annoys you be assured it is probably going to be solved sooner or later.

Diagnostics is diverse and can test you, with multiple departments and a wide variety of tools at your disposal to uncover symptoms and find what ails your patients.  

A management and sim game at heart, you build your small walk-in clinic from the ground up into a sprawling hospital with several wings and many patients every day (and night).  The doctor system lets you jump in whenever you like and tackle a specific patient's diagnosis.  The free Doctor's DLC lets you take control of a particular doctor, ramp up the difficulty and manage all of their patients.  

The devs are very active, releasing updates about once a month and have released two DLCs to date, the aforementioned Doctor's DLC was free.  The recent Services DLC added administrative things such as staff training, gift shops, pharmacies, cafeterias and pathology, 

I look forward to more quality of life updates.  The devs recently added a much needed undo button in construction mode. 
 Currently it is hard to break down statistics given to you, such as how busy certain parts of your hospital are.  It would be great to have cleaner access to statistics.  Currently, I find it very hard to understand how busy particular rooms are.  Every day you get a room workload message, telling you if any rooms are overworked, but not which rooms.  Nor do you get any message when rooms are nearing usage capacity.  Knowing if my X-ray room is nearing max usage would help me plan and avoid a backlog of patients.

One would think after a long day of work the last thing I would want to do is go back to work virtually, but I have always had a love for management games. I have to say of all the hospital sims out there, this one by far is more accurate in its portrayal of running a hospital. 

I think that works to its benefit and its downfall depending on what you want in a game. If i didnt have the real life experience I have I could see this being an intimidating game to get in to. The mechanics are not initally easy to pick up or understand, because hospitals are complex beasts with many departments and specialization required to diagnose and treat patients. Now if this is what you are looking for and want, something complex with a front loaded learning curve you will enjoy this game greatly. If you are looking for a game that portrays real and accurate diseases, diagnosis, and treatment, while somewhat simplifying the process, this is the game for you. If you want something easier to understand and get in to I would recommend theme hospital, which isnt a knock at that game as both are great, but both are vastly different in complexty.

While this game isnt perfect, it can be bugging at times or just simply unintuitive, for example I could not figure out why my staff wernt performing life saving emergency surgeries at night resulting in some patients dieing. Turns out my nursing staff were set to transportation, which qued them to transport patients to deparments that were closed at night, resulting in them not being available to assist with surgery until the following day after completing the transport. There is no indication that was the issue besides searching the forums for others with similar problems.

On a final note, the game fails in a few areas of accuracy, which is forgivable as this is a video game after all, also the developers over time have worked on some of these. A few that come to mind, a extremely small percent of my day is spent transporting patients from place to place, in the hospital we have staff that are specifically hired to transport patients and that is their entire job. Instead much of what I do as a nurse is blended with the role of the Dr. in this game. The Dr. administers medications and performs all the treatments within this game. What would be more accurate is to have the Dr. assess a large volume of patients, diagnosing and then going back to his/her office to place orders in a computer that would then be carried out by the nursing staff. This varies depending on the specialty and department but generally holds true. If this game added transporters they may actually make the game run smoother as it opens up some bottlenecks as in its current state the Dr. is doing double the work by being both the nurse and medical provider. 

There is also a difference in the flow of the patients stay. Normally a patient comes to the ER or gets directly admitted from his/her doctors office. They are sent to a floor that is equipped to deal with their care whether they need standard med-surg, telemetry, icu ect. While on this floor though they can be sent anywhere in the hospital then come back, they can go to surgery for a few hours and come back to their starting unit, go to radiology, IR, EP, ultrasound, ect. ect. but they are always sent back to their standard care unit upon completion of treatment. Think of these units as the body of the hospital and the treatment departments as the arms and legs, being sent out but always returning.

In this game there is no body to the hospital, the game is very segregated by department. If you have someone in your cardiology unit and they need surgery, but you have no beds in your surgery unit then often times they go critical or die because the game doesnt allow you to perform certain treatment unless they are under a specific departments care. Real life hospitals are not this rigid. You can be located on any unit and floor and so long as an OR room and staff is available you can be sent to the OR you dont need to be transfered to their specific unit and take up their specific beds if that make sense.

These are some things I think can improve the game both in the flow of gameplay and in accuracy but does not reduce my opinion on the game. After all it is just that a GAME, and it gets a lot of stuff pretty damn close to accurate while also being entertaining. So if youve always had an itch to manage a hospital that involves real diseases and real treatments, give this game a shot.

Interesting game with a lot of potential to grow. Runs well and whats in it is working well.
What it needs more is more deepth to its elements.
- Specialisations all feel samey, they need more distinct rooms, equipment or requirements,
- Rooms could use stats and placing more, or more expensive elements could improve their performance,
- Staff training for skills rather than a passive growth,
- Supply chains for meds/equipments,
- More ambulance types cheaper variants and helicopters,

The only thing I find really missing is some kind of story behind the patients. For the most part, it's not needed, after the third patient in a day shows up with Bronchitis...it's just business as usual.

But when the Ambo arrives with a head injury that requires immediate surgery to do a craniotomy , part of me wishes I knew how she got that head injury in the first place.

Regardless, it's a game that probably slipped under the radar of most gamers. Two Point Hospital got most of the buzz about the same time this thing went from Early Access to release. With all the DLC that Two Point has had, it's stayed on the map for hype. But Project Hospital is a worthy game, leaning toward the more realistic side of things.

If you have medical education, you'll find the diagnosing and treatment of patients to be much easier, but even without your own degree in medicine, the interface gives you what you need to get the job done. Before long you'll be like a seasoned GP ordering CT Scans and MRI's like a pro.

The game is not without faults, I really hate the lack of an undo button. Miss clicking can cost you, because you only get half back for items you buy, and nothing back for doors and windows. Once you get used to the building and desining aspects of the game, it's not quite as annoying, but it's still a feature that is shockingly absent.

The game could use a bit more tutorial help. The current tutorial doesn't cover many of the most frustrating parts of the game, such as building a new room from scratch, and how to build on upper floors. It shouldn't be complicated, but when you can't undo a mistake and you only get half back for what you spend, not having a decent tutorial to help show the basics of it seems like an oversight.

The depth of the game comes when you grow your little clinic into a hospital. Start small, grow slow. You need tons of money to open new departments, some costing far more than others, and trying to get everything at once will likely send you down a hole you can't recover from.

The depth of the game comes from choices. Do you pick the nurse who is an alcoholic, because she's half the daily cost of the one who isn't, even though she has better training? Or do you go for the calm and gentle nurse who really doesn't any negative perks, but costs you more per day because you're recent ratings have taken a hit? Should you fire the doctor who's long commute makes him late almost every single day and hire the younger less experienced doctor who has almost no knowledge of Cardiology? Or tolerate it, and just take the prestige hit for the long waits when he's two hours late?

It's these types of decisions that keep you busy. For me, one bright shining point of the game is that you never really feel like you can just build it and forget it. You have to keep on top of running things, long after you've established yourself. Getting things built and opening the doors is just step one. Unless you get bored dealing with patients day in and day out, the game will keep you wound up with lots of things to do.

But then, if you're not interested in medicine and hospitals, you probably wouldn't be interested in this game in the first place.",1585940279,1585940279,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

- Primitive patient handling: Patient care seems haphazard and poorly-handled. Lots of patients fall through the cracks and are left sitting in waiting rooms overnight with pending labs, waiting for specialists to come back in the morning, etc. Manually shunting patients into the emergency department to complete their care only seems to work half the time. Thus every night you have two or three people sitting around all night waiting for their neurologist to come back.
- Poor staff automation: Staff don't do anything but sit in their assigned room and wait for patients. If you have a lab tech in hematology but someone needs a microbiology test, tough: the hematology tech is going to play solitaire until his shift ends. This is especially problematic at night, when you can't possibly justify having every department staffed.
- Missing analytics: There are no overlays and only really basic, general information. Want to see which areas of your hospital are ugly or dirty? Too bad. Want to see which rooms have the longest wait times or are the most profitable? Tough. Ironing out the kinks in your patient flow means staring at the simulation and guessing at what's going on by the patients' movements.
- Force compartmentalization: In a real hospital, lots of services/spaces are shared among departments. Project Hospital insists that every arbitrary subdivision have its own support staff and spaces. The Neurology clinic has to have its own janitorial closet, janitor, and waiting room. The devs say that the janitors will clean other areas, but my experience has been that they'll totally neglect areas other than their own unless they're EXTREMELY overstaffed.

Among some strange things that often happen:
- Sometimes employees ignore their personal needs and drop to zero stars satisfaction. In result they just stop working. This happens even for employees without bad perks.
- When you set diagnostics quality to high - doctors start making too many diagnostics even after diagnosis is clear and only 1 symptom remain unknown. Often they even ignore treating like first aid, bandages, drugs which sometimes leads to patient's death. This even happens for high quality doctors. 
- Reanimation actually works too bad no matter what you do - employing better staff does not solve the issue of deaths happening very often.
- Events should be reconsidered. You know anything about event except some almost useless description. There are no information about how many casualties there were in crash or disaster. There should be at least approximate quantity. And event actually should be only eventual and more regular. Though player should be able to pick how many patients his hospital can handle. Patients amount is handled by insurance companies contracts. Insurance companies interested in quality of service - they never will send patients to overloaded hospital so they die there waiting. For disasters this may be more restricted - for example player can pick from ""all"", ""half"", ""some"". This all will make game more eventual but still controllable.
- Game lacks statistics. You actually don't know anything except budget and critical load. You manage a black box here - everything must be figured out manually wasting a lot of time. Also I'd like to have possibility to find out who initially made wrong diagnosis, list of all employees with their performance, statistics for an employee (what actions the do during the day with possibility to review at least a week, time they come to work and leave, how much time in average they spend on actions) - this will allow to find a bottle necks and fine tune hospital

This all is not a game breaking problems - everything you can solve by reviewing your employees or manually handling some situations with patients.

Then came Two Point Hospital, and we had a modern version of Hospital Tycoon, but still didn't get the realism that I craved.

It has taken me 30 hours to really get a strong understanding of how the game works.  I tried two point hospital and found it far to casual and boring, project hospital has more depth and complex mechanics. I also enjoy the artstyle they went with in project hospital. I know nothing about the developer but I hope they're working on a new and improved game to continue this series.  The game as I said is outstanding, and I can see I will probably invest hundreds of hours into it. The game has sandbox where you're free to build whatever you want rather unlimited funds or try to manage your funds and start with limited cash.  There's tutorials(you will need them), campaigns, challenges, and of course steam achievements. 

It has RPG vibes with strong tycoon/management gameplay, you can go broke fast if you're not paying attention to your money flow. The staff has their own perks and quirks, and they can tend their own needs etc. they can treat patients on their own as well but you can also take over a department and make all the choices for each patient yourself. That's how game works in departments, emergency, radiology, surgery and bunch of others. I also like that once you get deep into the game it becomes a battle to actually save lives, but people are going to die so you will have to accept it happens. I find this aspect thrilling part of the game and where it shines the brightest. 

The game has some issues, there is no undo command, you can't setup your own hotkeys, honestly the hotkeys seem limited besides 1,2,3~ etc. The AI won't always pick the fastest route to things like break room or restroom, rarely but it can happen character will stand there located in a action for far to long. However, I have no crash once and I have ran into no serious game breaking bugs.

I think its def worth $25, but if you're unsure put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale? I love games like rimworld, battle brothers, crusader kings, the sims, city skylines.

It seems to hit the right point between casual play and working for improvements, a wide range of different focuses and the ability to narrow down onto one. I bought with the intention of playing it later, gave it a few minutes to see what its like and I keep going back to it.

A few complaints being the controls particularly regarding building can be a little fiddly. They could take a lot of hints from The Sims on all fronts like auto rotate for items which can only fit on walls, one click to fill a room with wallpaper/flooring and the like. The game also doesn't do a great job of explaining some of the finer details, I spent a while assuming my cleaners were working in other areas when they had spare time, and I've not found a great explanation of what each room can support, what happens if I add extra equipment, how labs work with the process and so on. Another annoyance being that windows and doors remain on screen even if the walls have been ghosted. Like The Sims it would be significantly better if doors, windows, and wall decorations disappeared when the walls were lowered, and possibly ghosting items when people are behind them (possibly only if zoomed in far enough). Just small frustrations, hopefully they get tweaked but I've been incredibly impressed by the fundamental gameplay and that is fortunately what matters most. As an aside/minigame the diagnosing aspect isn't needed but its incredibly fun. It adds a very different dimension and fits in with the rest of the game incredibly well, a big bravo for whoever thought that up.

In this game, you get to run and build a simulation of a real hospital, treating real diseases.  As such, this game can teach you a lot about hospitals and medical care.

This game does a pretty good job of what it's trying to simulate, with each part of the hospital covered by a department.  Each department usually has a clinic section and a hospitalisation section.  Patients with more serious conditions will get hospitalised (some will just walk into your hospital and collapse, which at least gets them seen quicker) and then get transferred to hospital beds, which nurses will check on and doctors will do the rounds on.  

Conditions have symptoms which have to be found by diagnosis.  Once a diagnosis is narrowed down, then the patient gets treated.  There's a diagnosis mode where you can jump in and take over patients, ordering procedures and getting results.  I generally find it annoying, as I like the management side, but the game allows you to ignore it, with only the occasional ""complicated diagnosis"" from more junior doctors when they're struggling to figure out what's going on.  

There's lots to like about this game, but what I will say is that the interface feels very much like it's from the late-90s/early-00s.  It's tortuous and you drown in too much data, or not enough.  Compared to Two Point Hospital where you can just click on a room and find out what's happening there, there's a lack of information and with the more complicated mechanics at play, it's harder to diagnose (pun intended) what's wrong with your hospital/department.  

Equally, the campaign drops you in at the deep-end and the learning curve is very steep because of that and the interface.  However, it's pretty rewarding when you complete the two later campaign missions.  

Overall, a really good game doing lots of good things, which will hopefully demonstrate that there is a niche for realistic hospital sims.

A caveat - this game is complex has a brutal learning curve (more like a cliff). But its nicely polished (minor visual glitches here and there.) It is furniture moving simulator, it can be boring tedious and frustratingly complex at the same time. I've restated my game more times than I can count as I get to grips with more of the games systems each time round. 

The level of detail is actually quite deep and I've been surprised to learn how much I actually knew about medicine. I like how I can take over a patients care and favorite them to review their progress. Its fun learning the actual medical terms for conditions and treatments. It didn't take long to figure out that while I can pause the game to review cases, the treatments and exams take time. –precious time for patients who are dyeing. The key is to know what order to order exams to find problems and treatments. (note to irl medical professionals I know this knowledge is cursory at best but for the layman its kinda cool) Its really cool watching the hospital humming away like a small city. I was struck buy the contrasts rooms with glass and metal tech and equipment for HDU and ICU wards and then the simple bathrooms and break rooms that were the supports for the expensive things. 

There are a couple of glaring gaps. Where is the laundry services? Orderlies to take care of 'trolleys'? One aspect that dictates hospital construction is the handling of air water and power and that is completely missing,. Sometimes I feel the canvas is too blank when laying out my hospital... Constraints like needing to place such facilities would foster more creative problem solving.  Also most hospitals have commercial cafeterias and restaurants or stores inside. Again missing. I also think a few more bits of information in visual overlays might be in order. To help players figure out why some systems are not working and which ones are being overwhelmed. Its kinda annoying to have to hunt for the critical room on the game map. Is this true isometric display because I'm seeing some weird perspective trickery with my eyes when trying to lay things out... 
The music is pretty sweet tho I wish there was more/variety mixes. Piano kinda has that U2 vibe more than an ER theme -love the hard drops to ambient.

Especially the Doctor Mode is awesome, so you can treat a lot of patients by yourself without having to find and click on every one of them.

I still don't know how it plays out having a big hospital but I am eager to find out.

So now Thumbs up for a much more improved experience.


Original Review back in 2018:

I really would like to love this game but I cant.

Even though the game guides you pretty well on what you need, how to treat patients and everything, from time to time some patients may get stuck waiting for studies on queue even though they are already treated. Same with doctors, they can get stuck too because they are maybe reserved for a study for another patient. So it's best if you take a look from time to time. 
Your hospital Prestige gives you a pretty good idea of what is happening: use it! It's a great tool to discover untreated/stuck patients ot medics.
If you have a surgical team, I recommend four doctors instead of three. It will be optimal so there's always a doctor on the floor treating patients while the operations take place.
Once you've got the hang of this, it's an amazing game. I enjoy it VERY much and recently there's a Workshop open so there's people already improving the game mechanics or adding other objects.

There is a few things i would like to get added in the game tho... 

1. I would like to be able to schedule treatments, staff, operations and such alot more. 
2. I would like to be able to prioritize my patients myself, and with that re-prioritize if a critical patient comes in. as it is today i have 3-4 treatments or examinations with a patient when a critical patients requires my attention, but i first finish taking the temp, abdominal palpation and blood pressure measurement with the other patient. 
3. I would also like the possibility to prioritize task for other roles, Like make sure that my critical patient gets in to the first available x-ray room, or gets dibs on getting their bloodtest done ect ect. Maybe i should be able to categorize my patients from 1-5 where the patients that gets 1, gets first pick and nr 5 has to wait. 
4. The laws of psysics would totaly let a poster hang over a chair. 
5.  I should be able to tell my janitos to focus on sertain areas, lite operaiton rooms gets cleaned the second the surgury is over, the corridors can wait.

Basically everything still stands as half a year ago. The loops seem to have been solved, but thats it. The core mechanics are still painful.
My favourites: Having to x-ray a patient at random because ""pain"" and ""bruise"" does not refer to actual body parts. Oh, and leveling a scrub to a world-class neurosurgeon is faster than training a nurse to run the reception desk...

------

I'm sorry. I can't.

This game considers itself too realistic and serious that I can overlook all its problems.

[list]
[*]Staff can get in loops. Lab technologists get stuck forever almost daily, janitors get stuck for an hour or two in some places (for whatever reason; but I think both things originate in room borders that the AI does not understand and multiple equipment sets in a room).
[*]Pathing is awful. I have the hunch that even posters can block paths, but beside that... Forbidding corridors for patients does not work in some cases (not glitches, mind you, perfectly reasonable and reproducible cases because the developers did not account for it), your staff will sometimes walk to the other end of a hospital, and sometimes they will go to the next room not the direct way but by circling around it first (via four other rooms). The pathing has serious problems when your hospital does not stick to the bog-standard layout that you can see in the stock prefabs.
[*]A boatload of things that would never happen in the real world. Makes me want to bang my head against the wall; everytime. This leads to huge efficiency loses in the best case and dead patients in the worst.
[*]The inability to actually control something. You either have to trust your AI staff (bad idea) or control everything manually. Nice that I can tell my doctor to stick the thermometer into someones ear. Not so nice that I can not set up schedules for operations (->dead patients), general rules for patients arriving via TC (you will permanently see cases of TC->HDU, patient collapses->ICU, patient collapses, dead; because you cannot tell the game that someone with serious brain injuries should TC->OP theater, cut him up now) or schedules for general procedures (especially radiology!).
[*]You can not plan anything. Most statistics and UI lists are outright useless. I have played almost 120 hours. I now know how you should arrange OP and exam tables and equipment (because I have seen all the movement now) but I still don't know how many patients a level 5 surgeon can examine in eight hours or how long the abdominal surgery treating peritonitis is expected to take. You know, stuff that you use in operational planning, like, for example, in a HOSPITAL. Therefore my hospitals are overstaffed and underperforming and facing bankruptcy.
[*]You can not stop any procedure, and neither can the AI. If a nurse is fetching a stretcher to transport the guy with the bruise to TC, then the TC is blocked for as long it takes the nurse to get that stretcher, transport the patient down there, and the procedure is done. It does not matter that it would have been a better idea to wheel the guy from above (with the brain injury) directly from the OP table down there to see if he has additional hematomas or skull fractures. As this is often the case, he usually dies after the surgery in ICU.
[/list]

Now the sandbox style is actually one of the things I like so much about this game. You have different options and difficulties. If you just want to explore the different departments without worrying about killing a patient then you can disable killing the patients as well as no building costs and unlimited money. In the game you also have to improve your hospital services, amount of patients seen in a day, and many other goals that give you much needed, at times, rewards such as cash, more patients per day or other perks such as departments or access to ambulances. There is a third part I really like about the game, outside of the mod support, and that is the controlled doctor mode which is an add-on. This feature added a lot of value because you can now create your own doctor, for a cost to the hospital, and grow this doctor. This also adds another insurance company you try to get rewards from which to me is a very underrated feature. Over all this game is fun, challenging (if you want it to be) and to me has a lot of replay value. If you are into management and building sims you will like this game as well.",1579588939,1579588939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
-Realistic diseases, diagnosis and treatments
-Staff with different perks and drawbacks
-Highly customizable
-You can select to take over the treatments of patients to help speed up or make a diagnosis more certain before going through with treatment. I also find this helpful because I can select a patient and select treatments to help with minor symptoms before they go to see the diagnosis doctor, that way the first thing the doctor does is give them the medications before diagnosing so some the patient's symptoms are alleviated. i find myself in triage just clicking on patients to see if they need anything like ice wraps, analgesics, or antihistemines so they get it faster. It's also helpful in the Emergency department to select diagnostic methods you think will be most helpful first to save time, and also provide treatment to stabalize. Plus, you can move them to a different department to make space once they are stable to get treated faster.

CONS:
-Interface is...strange. Even with the tutorial it took me a while to figure out how to hire staff. The game is organized but department and room, meaning you have to have that department selected and then go to the room you want to hire that person for.
-Crisis emergencies are either super easy or super hard to complete, and have a hefty price for failing the mission.
-Sometimes staff or patients just...don't do what they're supposed to? Sometimes I have to select a patient and unselect and reselect their treatment for it to go through if it's a busy department. It'll tell me my nurses who usually do those treatments are idle, while the patient is going to go into critical condition if they don't get treated.
-I find janitors take forever to clean considering how dirty the hospital gets, and you can't hire too many otherwise you won't have any money left.

The problem is when you start getting into hospitalization. At this point, it's basically a chaotic nightmare. The AI of both the staff and patients makes it extremely difficult to treat patients. Patients will waste tons of time on restroom breaks and getting snacks and then get upset they haven't been seen and leave. Patients will arrive at the ICU needing easy treatments to stop a life-threatening condition, but doctors won't do anything and they'll die for reasons that should never be a problem. I get realism, I get challenge, but, there comes a point in the game where the AI and pathing is so convoluted that you cannot run an efficient hospital. The ICU/collapsed patients are easily the biggest problem. Once they go to the ICU, it's basically a 50% chance they die. I staff the ICU with tons of doctors and nurses so that it will be assured they get treatment, but doctors will not do anything.

I recommend this game, but note a word of caution. I tried tons of combinations and different styles of hospitals, thinking that maybe it's my fault that I am not succeeding. But nothing I do works. Small hospitals, large hospitals, lots of staff, few staff, complex layouts, simple layouts. And that's frustrating. With the AI and pathing, it becomes impossible late game to have any success, which is a shame, because this game has a lot going for it.

I do, however, recognize this is fixable. I really would like to see the AI worked on so that patients with life-threatening conditions get better priority, that treatments are given to patients as soon as they are seen as viable, and that the pathing doesn't have NPCs taking ridiculous routes and going to far away places to meet needs.

Update: I did see the dev released an update for the game. As I noted, the problems with this game are fixable, so I look forward to seeing how it plays now.

Pro:
* The operation and control is simple, the interface clear and intuitive

* I like the simple, but not comic-striped graphic style

Contra:
* I was a nurse in a German hospital. The game is definitely not designed for German hospital operation. Why do I have to build a separate waiting room for each department and fully equip it? In Germany, we usually have one waiting room for all specialties in small to medium-sized hospitals. 
* Why are the janitors permanently assigned to the individual departments? Normally you have a janitor's room for the whole hospital. The janitors then divide up according to need.
* The same applies to radiologists. In Germany you have a team of radiologists and radiology assistants. These then use the different devices as needed. Why do I have to put one person each into night duty for a small hospital for X-rays, CT, MRI? One person is enough to do what is needed.
* Why can't I continue to plan the hospital while it's running? At the moment, you can either plan and build the house or watch the staff work. Of course you can take over a doctor and treat patients. But this is not my game focus for a management game.

Realism: 9/10. The symptoms/tests/diagnosis/prescription matrix in this game is absolutely amazing.

Gameplay: 7/10. This game is pretty fun from that angle, too, but it does have some bugs and some clunky mechanics and the UI leaves a bit to be desired. None of these flaws actually prevent you from enjoying the game, however some can raise the difficulty at times.

This game uses the same formula but upgrades it by making the diseases based-off real ones which really makes it interesting. 

Also being able to see the symptoms and oversee every step of the diagnosis is fun for a while, but it does have it downside of becoming a game centered too much on micromanagement since patients can be misdiagnosed by even elite doctors. Also, being able to create the general layout of the hospital and it's department really improves on the original formula created by Theme Hospital.

Too bad this game lacks the marketing it deserves since it is overshadowed by Two-Point Hospital. Although, I wish it had the option of training doctors on top of the RPG Leveling progression it currently has since that would give it more variety.

Still loving this game. Happy to see that it has exited EA and still receiving regular updates and patches. The latest one just came today. This is definitely a game worth supporting.

Game is working with very true-to-life elements.
Variety is high and continued adjustments are improving balance.
A game that teaches to a degree.
Some Easter eggs that are funny.
More departments, content, and improvements slated for future.

Overall, this is very much worth the value - snag it on sale and you are definitely getting your money's worth no doubt. I foresee many more hours with this for me. Highly recommend for those who like to plan, plot, and optimize!

I think those who spend all their time complaining about pathing are just poor planners.

PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW

Not sure why many people are so hung up on the pathing in this game? This might be a shock to you-but real life people be getting lost in hospitals happens all the time. That's why they have a rainbow on the floor for people to follow like kindergarten kids.

MOVE ASIDE you weak of stomach managers, you flailing inept taskmasters, those who think they know ""real"" sim games! This is not some pansy tycoon game, or an idle clicker, it's not your fake city builder. This IS a super detailed realistic hospital manager.

I love this game because it has a very puritanical approach to hospital simulation. It's more than just shuffling comic people around, you have to go above AND beyond to design not just the hospital, but staff, shifts, and flow. I think this game def needs more content (even though it already has loads) and am happy to see the dev focused on adding more.

Overall for an Early Release game it's highly playable, very enjoying, and not for the weak willed simulation/builder player. JS",1561840739,1572456547,True,33,3,0.684746742248535156,0,True,False,False

There is no way to torture your inmates or force 3 surgeries on a patient to earn money 3 times.

What a great game!  This is a little overshadowed by Two Point Hospital i feel.  However having said that, i have played that title and in comparison, Project Hospital wins.

Yeah sure, Two Point Hospital has great graphics with slightly comical medical procedures, but that gets boring when you have seen it a few times.  I also found the game in general was boring after two hours.

The AI i feel is also great in this game.  Usually when the AI sends people to other areas it can have a flaw or bug, but this game handles it brilliantly.  To sum up, i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys simulation and strategy,

My top four Pro's and Cons for the game:

[h1]Pros[/h1]

1. Great AI.
2. In depth units within departments.
3. Patients can be controlled manually and automatically.
4. Tasks via insurance are a good balance for beginners to start.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

1. To begin, the game can look confusing and takes a little while to get adjusted to how buildings are run.
2. Tutorial explains the basics, but needs something to explain about putting the same rooms such as common rooms a little better so not to confuse.
3. Would be great to have an option where patients can be handled manually rather than the default automatic feature, it is labouring having to find patients to switch this over.

I wrote the original review for this game about a year ago. Back then I did not recommend it. Since then, the developer has released 16 patches and fixed almost all bugs and a lot of gameplay issues. 

This is the only realistic hospital sim that exists to my knowledge. It is NOT theme hospital. The illnesses, diagnoses, tests, etc. are, as far as I can tell, accurate. It is definitely entertaining, and like all great builders gives this vibe that there is always something to fix and do better.

The game DOES still have some issues, mostly a sometimes clunky UI as well as the fact that workers get assigned to a specific room and do not leave it. This means you sometimes have more workers than you actually need. Instead of having just one radiology technician you need one for X-Ray, one for MRI, etc. However, these issues do not really hinder the enjoyment of the game they are mostly just a nuisance.",1541349136,1572203525,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Maybe my view is biased by the fact that I'm a medical doctor myself, but this game really highlights the hospital life in its most frenetic, chaotic and dramatic situations. The game has a lot of diseases, some realistic as incidence and rate of presentation, others really rare that appear too often (cholera every other day is not real) and maybe, if you are an health professional, you would like a little more challenge by making differentials that in the game are authomatic. 
I like the fact that you can organise the hospital as you want and the fact that there are A LOT of exams and therapies, but I would have loved a mod where you can organise the priorities of treatments, the order of diagnostic exams and maybe a more ""professional mode"" where you can choose all the exams and all treatments (risking to fail more often).

- Ability to control patient diagnosis & treatment with highly detailed medical terminology.

CONS
- UI is complex, awkward & unintuitive.
- Building can be frustrating & difficult to move rooms once already built.
- Lots of small quirks with gameplay that can be frustrating (eg, critical patients/symptoms not getting priority to resources, sharing of resources not fully realised, pathing inefficiencies)

If you continue to read you might think: He's got so much CONS why does he still recommend the game?
Well I figured as soon as you stop caring about the patients and just look at the business side of things, it gets way less annoying and all the little problems and mistreatments by AI doctors don't matter any more.

Just like IRL amirite?

PRO:
- general idea
- complexity and realistic background
- nice progression curve
- you can treat people yourself

MEH:
- controls are sometimes unintuitive (you can learn it, but it's annoying)

CONS:
- you cannot share waiting rooms 
- generally shared rooms don't seem to work like expected. (even though I added tons of janitors, large parts of the hospital don't get cleaned)
- concepts and mechanics are often not like expected (like why can't I send patients back to the emergency doctor who's the only one capable of doing some of the treatments that internal medicine can't do and as soon as I remove player control it works for the AI)
- on medium certainty the AI keeps getting very wrong results, but on high certainty the AI will keep doing tests even if the diagnosis has already been made - either way the doctors take way too long and a good third of patients keep leaving every day if I don't treat them myself
- AI will prescribe treatments seemingly at random, they're wrong way too often even if they nailed the diagnosis

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Project Hospital is a hop simulator game which you can get the job to build and manage a hospital. When managing your clinic/hospital, you get to build and manage 9 different departments such as the x-ray department, and then also employ staff with different skills. You can also choose between who should treat a patient and give it the diagnoses. NPC Doctor or you.

In the beginning, you will get 3 options to start the game with, Campaign, Sandbox and Scenario.

[b]Campaign:[/b] You will learn step by step how to build a hospital, manage staff and employment and how to deal with debt problems. After that, you will learn how to manage all the medical departments with staff and objects needed to manage the departments.
[b]Sandbox:[/b] After doing the campaign, (your choice if you want to do the campaign in the beginning or not) your all set up to build and manage a clinic/hospital by yourself. You're getting to choose different land area sizes where you could build your clinic/hospital on, or you can choose by starting with an all-ready build clinic/hospitals where you only need to employ the staff and manage the hospital.
[b]Scenario:[/b] Scenario is just where you can play all the clinics/hospitals that you have downloaded from the steam workshop.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

Project Hospital is a 2D game. The texture is in good quality but there's no actual sun in the game, so there are no actual live shades. When it turns to night the lightning will just get a bit darker and in the day it will be bright again. 

[h1]Sound[/h1]

Some soft electro piano playing with some heartbeats and emergency sirens playing. Nothing special.

I would personally recommend Project Hospital. Its basic medical education but it can be sometimes a bit boring. The game is not even 1 year old so I can see that it has more to give in the future.

Not only can you build the hospital of your dreams (or nightmares, depending how good you are at it) in its sandbox mode, there is also a career mode as well as multiple challenges. Project Hospital is moddable and there are many hospitals on the workshop already if you're as terrible at designing them as I am. Other aspects of the game include managing staff, diagnosing patients and unlocking insurance company objectives, which are kind of like mini-challenges you have to overcome to unlock new features. 

Project Hospital does have some bugs and issues however the devs are actively working on the game and provide updates with bugfixes frequently. Despite that I would still recommend the game even in its current state, especially compared to more casual hospital simulators, as it provides a lot of depth, especially when you're interested in medicine.",1562847937,1562847937,True,15,1,0.644338369369506836,0,True,False,False

It might seem to be a minor gripe but I just can't deal with it anymore. My whole surgical ward is broken beyond repair. The nurses are standing on top of their computerchairs staring like manequins. The patients are lying there and no one cares for them, besides some ""functioning nurses"" which are rated 0 out of 5 stars because ALL their needs hit rock bottom. Even though they are allowed to use all bathrooms and common rooms. I made EXTRA sure to check that. And you know what? I'm 100% sure that it SHOULD work. Why? Because the freakin nightshift in the same ward has no problems keeping their needs in check.

In this game you have up to 200 staff members. I'm no Beta tester. I don't want to spend hours checking every last staff member for buggy behaviour and reload saves once I found bugs just to see what might be the cause of that. I want to play the game. Not go on a bug hunt.

The nurses who move have completely depleted needs even though their shift started one hour ago. ONE of those stupid creatures even REFUSES to leave because she just desperately wants to give food to the patients. She is just standing there since two whole days in front of her computer not doing jack. I tried to fire her: She refuses to move. I gave her another computer in order to force her to move there: She just continues standing on the new place. I changed her shift to maybe get her to leave that way: She completely ignores any and all shift changes. That numbnut just keeps standing there thinking about handing food to the patients while her shift is long over. And that is just one of the buggy NPC behaviours I've found.

I completely lost track of what is working as intended and what isn't. I'm at my wits end. And the worst part: After I just can't get it to work, I just lost ALL fun I had until now. This might be a great game in the future. But some of the bugs are just gut wrenchingly annyoing. I just can't recommend it. Sometime in the future when most of those bugs get squished I will GLADLY change this review.. As of now it seems to be just to bug riddled to warant a recommendation.

UI does feel clunky and there's a lot of things to put into action in terms of hospital equipment, would be better if they had a quick search function or a CTRL+F equivalent to the menus.

Bugs: Mostly pathfinding and through time compression you will see patients stuck in examination beds, standing forever. You manually move them away by ""sending them to another hospital"".

It feels like you're playing a real hospital sim though with the proper equipments. And if you do things wrongly, as you can add manual input to diagnosing and treatment, wrongly doing so can lead to deaths or more serious injuries.

I would recommend this game, if the dev(s) would please fix the shitty Prestige system...  

So for people who haven't played this game, let me explain this system for you, as far as I understand it.  
You have 9 different areas of the hospital, and each a given a star rating out of 5, your hospitals rating is whichever is lowest, so if you have 7 areas of the hospital open and 6 of them have 5 star, but the last one only have 3 stars, guess what, your hospital only has 3 star rating, which for whatever reason is showed in percentage.   

If you have under 90%, you will get less patients, but if you have over 90%, you will get 5% more patients AND all patients will pay 20% more for treatments, it's super hard to make money if you don't play this game perfectly, which is almost impossible...  
But there is no way to check what you can do to improve your staff needs.. So let me explain my current issue in my current hospital.  
I have 8 areas open, 7 of them all have 5 stars and are happy and everything is nice, then there is this last area, for whatever reason having 4½ star, when I click on my staff, they all have 5 stars, but the department for whatever reason is till only 4½ star.  
This means I am not only losing patients for no reason, but I am also losing out on the 20% extra income...  

Can you please fix? Before you fix this, I can not recommend this game.

This game is good but it needs some work. It seems more like a beta/early access product than a full finished game. The 24.99 price point is fair though considering this... 

+ The music in this game is fantastic.

+ The management options is ridiculously in-depth so simulation lovers will adore this game with the endless options available.

+ There is a ton of replayability considering you can either choose to have small clinics to full fledged hospitals complete with surgeons/ICU wards/radiology and so on...

- For a bit of downside there seems to be over complex build menus. There is complexity where complexity doesn't need to be. Example you have to go into different menus to delete a wall then another different menu to delete an object then another different menu to delete flooring. There is a separate delete button depending on what you want to delete.... Why?

- There is no undo button. Accidently place a room? Be prepared to go through the above steps and delete all these things separate. And by the way while losing money because you'll only get half the money back for deleting things.

- There is no camera rotate. This is very frustrating and awkward when not only trying to build and place things but also when playing. You'll be treating patients without being able to even see them because they'll be obscured by some filing cabinet or something.

All in all this game is good and has a ton of potential. If the devs fix/add most of the things the fans want/request this game will be playable for a long time...",1541126678,1562460681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OBS: I see 2 kinds of reviews - 1 who understand a little of an hospital - areas / and Who are used to Theme Hospital and not had the effort to UNDERSTAND how things works.. its MORE A SIM than a FUNNY Dugglye BUnny hospital thematic like theme hospital, two point hospital, or even other sims before this.. 
This dev PUT A HUGE EFFORT to make things work - AND IT WORK ! you need just to understand a little by little how to do and how things works... and keep working better and better hospitals..  - the learning is like a prison architecht....

so.. 

if you want a SIM to learn and improve with time... its it !!  - And devs may be if they wanted to bill 15-30 usd for this... its REALLY VERY CHEAP ! 

you see that theres a BIG GOOD code team behind this... huge estructures working with no bugs ... 

the BEST GAME EVER.

There should be a little ""Go to Hawaii"" button you can click every so often to spend your excess cash.

The game doesn't seem to take into account that so many medical bills are so high that people will just stiff the hospital and never pay. Now that would be a real hospital simulator, Charging for said procedures at X rate to make money versus how many people just don't pay. Or being required by law to stabilize patients who never bother to pay. 

And you can have DLC called ""Open Borders"" mode where nobody pays or ""Medicare for All"" mode where the government just won't pay for some procedures and the backlog is so massive that your patients die in the waiting room because you can't afford to build more facilities because see above. Then you can have Tort DLC in which greedy patients (and some legitimate ones) sue the hospital into the ground and make your doctors afraid to put their neck out for procedures.

Yay's:
1. The building system is great. I've had plenty of room and flexibility to build the hospital how I want it.
2. Diagnoses are fun to do.
Please add:
1. Pathing that works. This is urgent, at the very least, let me restrict areas.
2. Prioritizing patients. Especially in the operating rooms. The guy collapsing every 2 hours shouldn't have to wait for the lady with an infection.
3. Shared rooms that make sense. The game tells you that operating rooms are shared but doesn't really make it clear as they are still assigned a department. Employees seem to use other department's common rooms and restrooms, especially when theirs is much closer. It's all very unclear.
4. A schedule. Let me slot times for employee breaks, shift changes etc. This is a basic mechanic of most sim/management games, and certainly part of running a large facility, hospital or otherwise.
5. Budget management. 

The developer's last news article just talks about a few minor additions and continued bug fixes. They also mention DLC. This game is insanely overpriced at $25. I got it for half that and I'm still not convinced it's worth it. The potential is here if the developers want to make a great game.

+ Graphics are fine
+ Realistic and very detailed
+ Real diseases, symptoms, diagnostics, algorithms and treatments
+ Rich hospital customization
+ Play as a doctor and diagnose patients

- The game plays by itself. Build your rooms including the required equipment and staff, and watch an ant farm run itself.
- Very weak management gameplay
- No important decision making
- No replay value, every game is the same
- Small font size
- UI is not intuitive

It's a very deep simulation - if you can do well at Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress you can do well here. It's not really a casual game. But it's very interesting.

Sometimes you do need to do things like, for example, role-restrict your surgery nurse from helping with ordinary nursing duties to ensure surgery happens quickly. But alternatively if you don't do role restrictions, various departments that aren't busy will help out the ones that are busy - provided there's overlapping skillsets. But for things you want to make sure can happen quickly like surgery, it can be worth preventing this.

If you want to play as a doctor (or just see how large operations are setup), there are prebuilt hospitals available for play. However, the main content focus is on the building and management side of the game - if you *only* want to play as a doctor you'll probably get bored relatively quickly.",1559450816,1559450816,True,18,0,0.655805706977844238,0,True,False,False

The game is fun, but there are quite a few issues I would consider significant to the playability of the game, especially with respect to sandbox and end-game level play. You are placed in charge of managing and building a hospital as well as playing a role in treatment and staff management/ hiring; however, the game itself seems almost opposed to helping you in this endeavor. Below I will highlight some pros and cons I find to be dominant. 

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]The game is fun; it permits you to be involved but also take a step back to take everything in;
    [*]The game gets patched often with bug fixes ([i]for this reason I won't be picking apart or listing any real ""bugs"" in this review[/i]);
    [*]The game has a ton of potential and I really look forward to new updates and development.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*][strike]Max staff limit: The max staff limit is currently capped at 250 with no way to increase it. For some reason, the devs instead of permitting players to scale staff limits at their discretion for performance have elected to implement a universal hard cap which makes having a large fully staffed hospital literally impossible;[/strike] [b][i]Staff limit can be easily changed by editing tweakables.xml[/i][/b]
    [*]Hiring: Keeping with playability, you pay $2,500 at a time to get a short list of staff per category (doctor, nurse, etc.), but can't screen for specific skills or qualifications, meaning you might be stuck cycling through $2,500 more that 5 times in order to get a single doctor with the General Surgery qualification. On top of the lack of filtering in recruiting, you are unable to accrue a list of individuals, once you initiate another recruitment list generation you lose your previous list. This makes hiring extremely pricy if you are trying to recruit qualified professionals, as well as extraordinarily convoluted and wasteful;
    [*]Money: The fact that there appears to be no way in Sandbox mode to actually play sandbox (as the term is usually used) is rather sad. You have no way of getting an infinite budget, which might be quite a suprise for those who decided to play Sandbox mode expecting... well... sandbox mode.

In my opinion, something that this game really needs is the ability to set treatment priority for patients.  I've had many times where patients are brought in on stretchers, and are just sitting in the ER needing stabilization while their assigned doctor is with a patient who is already stable.  Not only that, but I've had times where I've started scenarios, and patients who need to be treated to accomplish the scenario sit and wait for the needed procedure while other patients receive a procedure that they could probably wait on.

Pros:
Vast number of real-life ailments even mental illnesses, with Real medical departments like radiology with CT Scan and MRI. Not childish with fantasy ailments like the other new theme hospital type games (theme hospital is a good game tho). you will build knowledge about healthcare and medicine in project hospital (especially diagnosis and treatment); I think it is useful for students in medicine/ other healthcare sectors, or generally people who want to know more about diseases and how to treat them. Treatments for diseases is very accurate as well. I think this game has massive potential to be a big hit as a sequel. It is a well polished game, but please keep up with the realism, since that is this game's greatest asset.

Cons:
It has gameplay flaws which affect its replayability.  its hard to click and find things since its 2d.... If it were a 3d game and i have the same details that'll be cool. But there's also some bugs in the A and E (trauma) dept; adding a morgue/coroner dept as a DLC might be profitable.

UPDATE 2019 03 29

Turning the review in a positive one.
The devs have done a good job fixing the tedious glitches and now the game runs with almost no issues.

For the ones who likes strategy, it is a very hard task to find the best hospital configuration in rooms/staff for the better efficiency. The gameplay is not friendly, especially up to the building mechanics and the fixed view (you can't rotate it), but still, it is such fun to plan the rooms layout that you may get over it.

My only concern: there's still a weird behaviour when raising additional floors, sometimes it is for free, sometimes you have to manually build portions of the floor which is a lot expensive. Basicly it is more convenient to expand horizontally and then rise another floor when you're out of space. I think this is way too much limiting, but you can still work around. Plan ahead.

A simulation very well thought, even if not exceptionally developed.

This game is awesome because it is so accurate. But, there are a lot of little things I've noticed that could enrich gameplay. They could add cell phone chargers in the emergency room and have CRNPs and PAs so you don't have to hire so many doctors. Also, from my experience, dealing with insurance companies is probably one of the most frustrating things about the medical system. This game makes it way too simple. Case management is a major deal for hospitals across the US. However, I do understand the decision to simplify the interactions between the administration and the player. Furthermore, this game could do more to capture the non-medical side of hospitals such as billing, dealing with lawsuits, dealing with the police, etc. There is so much more to a doctor's day than seeing patients and handing out pills. I have been in the ER or the my doctor's office when a drug seeker is called out on their behavior.  Believe me, it is quite the show.

You can free-build or you can choose the ""campaign"" mode. I've had a few bugs where my patients glitch into beds, or when I de-zone an area, they get stuck in a weird animation just repeating the same actions over and over until I restart the entire game. Good time waster if you aren't too interested in the diagnoses and lack of zones being able to share each others work spaces. Like, you need a receptionist for certain departments, I get that. But why is my surgical receptionist walking to the emergency department to grab a drink of water when she has a common area right next to her office?

However, even with these accommodations, both doctor and patients will default to only one entrance/exit. Seems counter intuitive.

E.g., let's start the campaign, which really is to say tutorial. Horribly cryptical, as if telling me how big I need to make that room or where in a TUTORIAL is some kind of mortal sin. But OK, I make everything oversized. Already by the second mission it gets stuck not registering that I have in fact built all rooms it asked me to. And in fact I CAN'T build anything else anyway, so it has to be all of them right? 

In fact, I don't even have to guess: it's complaining about the radiology department not being there, but in fact in the management window it does say that I have one.

Look, some helpful advice to wannabe devs: I can't read your mind. If I had ESP abilities, I'd have won Radi's million dollars, and it would be all over the news. If there's some obscure piece of equipment or connection that is preventing a room from registering as functional (although there's no more stuff showing as mandatory and missing in its list) TELL me. Don't expect me to magically know what else the game secretly expects from me.

Yes, yes, I should 'learn to play', 'git good' and all that, but that's the whole POINT of a TUTORIAL. If I clicked on the tutorial I've already confessed that I don't, in fact, know how to play, and the whole POINT of that exercise is for you to fill me in.

And if it's possible to follow the tutorial faithfully and still get stuck, then that can't be working as intended. Either it's bugged and not registering that I've built all it told me to, or it's not telling me everything that it wants me to do, or how it wants me to do it. Either way, it's a fail.


Edit: Ok, I'm starting to figure things out. And it just makes me more dismayed. But maybe it will help someone:

It turns out that every single department must have its own copy of every room: its own waiting room, its own reception, its own toilet even.

So, for example, the STAT patients can use the same waiting room and toilets as the GP's office, because it's the same department. But apparently the X-Ray room right between them on the same frikken corridor can't, because it's a different department. People who just came out of the GPs office and got sent to the X-Ray can't possibly sit on the same benches they had access to 1 second ago, because now they're in another department.

This is beyond brain-dead.

Listen, dev(s). I've been to doctors that had their own X-Ray room. E.g., my dentist. Never once have I been told that I now need to sit in a different waiting room, when they wanted to take an X-Ray. The idea that ""oh noes, you can't get your tooth X-Rayed if you sit in THOSE chairs"" never ever came up.",1549856392,1549943265,False,1,4,0.448760509490966797,0,True,False,False

Damn. Nobody should have ever used the Q word in the Emergency Department. 
It is 4:02 and EMS is dispatched to a GSW.
4:47: GSW to the abdomen. Patient is critical. 38yr old lady a single entry wound towards the left flank. No exit wound. She is lucky. It looks like a low velocity GSW. Damn, if it was an assault rifle she would have been DOA (dead on arrival).  The emergency physicians do blood transfusions in the Trauma Bay, a FAST exam and page the surgeons. Our patient goes straight to the OR. Luckly, she has an ICU bed.

Or small hospital, turned into a Trauma Center is trying to cope with the increasing violence in the area. She is the 5th GSW in 2 days.

6:07: EMS with Trauma Alert: Blunt abdominal trauma. Looks like a young guy hit by a car. Was he intoxicated? Or the driver? We will never know... all we know is that we have to prepare for another trauma. It's has been 3 days since administration opened a second Operating Room. Maybe we were preparing for situations like this. 

6:30: The trauma arrives. Again it's critical. Our Emergency Doctors and Nurses do their best to stabilise our patient, But he needs surgery. And surgery is what he will get. He is transferred to the General Surgery Department, after having blood tranfusions and the diagnosis: He has a ruptured spleen. ICU beds are full and we fear for his recovery. WIll he be able to do that in the High Dependency Unit?

We are in debt. Insurance isn't paying us enough. We can't possible open more ICU beds. Maybe we will have to transfer him after the surgery.

7:00am: Day shift starts. The night shift is eager to grab a beer and decompress from that shift, where the line betwen life and death was very thin. The day team just wishes them a good night of sleep and hope they have better luck

8:00am: The clinic opens. Patients start walking in our small clinics, where our interns, residents and attendings try their best to save the world, curing a sore throat at the time, giving antibiotics and days off work.

9:15am: Patient colapses on the floor waiting for a consult. Looks bad. Feels like a ruptured ulcer. Sepsis all the way. We transfer him to the ICU, hoping to grab the last bed.

9:37: Our GSW patient leaves surgery. Our brave surgeons operating all night were able to fix the bleeding. Now she needs intensive care. Our highly specialized  ICU team. And they are ready for her. Will she live to fight another day? Only time will tell.

10:03: Another Trauma Alert. Blunt by the looks of it. We dont have much info yet. All we can tell EMS is that we dont have ICU beds. Maybe they should divert the patient to another hospital.

10:09: He arrives. Luckly he is stable and is able to go to observation in the General Surgery Ward, after the CT scan and some IV fluids.

By lunch time we start to make some profit and pay part of our loans, maybe we will be able to open a new ICU floor. Administration is hyped.
Orthopedics wards are full. They need more beds to admit patients that hang out in the ED, overcrowding the department. We dont have the money to do that now. The insurance company decides to transfer our femur fracture patient that was waiting for 3hours for a bed. We lose a few thousand dollars and the patient.

17:49: Another patient collapses wainting for a General Surgery consult. Looks like sepsis. We dont have ICU beds. All we can do take them to the ER and hope they will be able to take care of them in the Resus bay.

18:14: Our nurse barely returns from the ER, when another patient collapses in the GS floor. Looks like sepsis again. ER is going to be nuts about this, but we have no choice. To the Resus Bay.

Are all those patients collapsing because we dont have enough janitors to clean and mop the GS clinic floors? Maybe we need to hire more janitors. The floors are disgusting. No blood, as it is not the trauma bay, but all sorts of germs and vomit. Administration needs to do something!

19:00 - clinic closes. We tried to see all patients, but few of them had to go back home without diagnosis or treatment. Doctors and nurses and techs. They are also human and need to rest.

20:00 - Night shift is about to start. One of the staff was drunk. He will be late for work today. Maybe we need to do something about it. Maybe not. Who would want to work in this meat grinder? Low pay, high stress, always overcrowded, no way to do good medicine.

At least we have some profit and pay anothey part of our loan. We can start dreaming about our ICU floor. 3 ICU beds arent enough. Violence is high in this part of town. Ortho also needs a new floor, a new ward and a new OR. We need to press administration... but patient satisfaction isnt that high either. We are going to get in trouble. It is better if we just let it be and try to save lives. 

Another day, another GSW, another drama, ICU is full and we have no beds.
10/10 - feels like my day/night job.

Project Hospital still have much to improve, but so far it has been a really great experience. You will see that it is a game with lots of room for improvement, specially if you are from the healthcare area as I am, but we can create stories and see the everyday drama unfolding as each minute passes. Sometimes, when a patient is crashing I have to contain myself and not yell at the doctors for not treating it as fast as they should. But I guess it is all part of the game, and the developers are working to improve this. Also they should implement Trauma Alerts (with type of trauma as well: blunt X penetrating), blood banks, transfusion protocols, pediatrics, Helicopters (why not, everybody loves helicopters), Mass Casualty Events, and other crazy stuff that we are used to see in the Emergency Department in a daily basis.

is fun for the first 2-3 hours later it just gets super annoying. Instead of daily stats where you can see how to improve you get 1000 annoying pop ups. Well the game has stats but they re just super useless.
When upgrading from a clinic to a hospital, your ICU is getting a death trap for most people. Your nurses and doctors get stuck in waiting processes and as you re limited to 200 workers only, you will never be able to field 12 doctors and nurses for every hospital department (excluding clinic which requires additional staff) as required to keep your customers alive. Especially cardiology is super annoying and kills so many people. 
Your interms level up so quickly when working as ermergency clinic doctors but only 5 levels makes it super boring. As soon as your doctors become usefull (level 4) they re already at the top level of development.  Sadly you cant put your doctors on a rotating shift, to train better diagnostics or to not just waste the same doctor on nightshifts every day.
Pathfinding and decisionmaking by you staff is super terrible, like walking one hour to the next toilet because it is located on the other side of the wall instead of going to the one located next door or not operating as one nurse is constantly transporting people around.
Further the progress level is just super stupid keeping a clinic is super easy. But as soon you add an observation all departments start crying they want an hospital too. 
When all departments are completed all your patients are going wild which ends up in double staff required instandly. So you cant just upgrade slowly but you have to upgrade from a small clinic instandly to a super huge hospital otherwise you will kill 4-10 people per day.
To keep the player busy your doctors are sometimes really dumb, so i could do analyse illnesses faster as they could by just always klicking measure temp, chest, bloodpressure, body which are usually the first things which should be checked anyway.
Finally in the beginning you need money so hard but later you really dont know what to build, as the game has very very very limited equiment which can only be used in special departments. So you cant add a lab and a surgery to your icu or a cardio to your emergency. Well you wont do it anyway as you re limited to 200 workers.
Additionally the game starts to perform really bad when you progress. At shiftchange, midnight and when transferring doctors to other departments the game stops. Even it looks only like 2D and cant be rotated.

On the surface, it looks great. You can do everything you're imaging you would want to do with this type of game. You can build a hospital with your preferred layout, you can choose which doctors and nurses to hire, and you can customize each room to your liking.

However, the bugginess of this game makes it nearly unplayable. Every couple in-game days, I run into a problem where a patient gets stuck. He is either stuck in the MRI even after I fire my staff and delete the room. Or he gets stuck in a loop of going to the bathroom, then to the couch, then his bed, then the couch, then back to the bathroom, and never gets any further with his treatment until I eventually tell him to go home, which then causes him to freeze up and remain stuck in his bed for eternity. I have also experienced a patient moonwalking across the screen until she ran into the barrier, and then suddenly popped back into her room, I've had two doctors freeze in place while they were on their way to a collapses patient (who also froze and caused me to be unable to delete the chair he had previously been sitting in), and I have lost thousands of dollars from diagnostic items and machines that disappear when I purchase them and try to place them in a room. I have more, but I think you get the idea.

What's even worse than the obvious bugs, is the things that aren't clearly a glitch, but is more likely just poor design. I played through the lengthy tutorial (which is divided up into three parts), twice. I have also played this game in both sandbox mode and campaign mode, so I don't believe I'm just missing something here. There are so many times where I just don't know what is expected from me. There are no indications for how healthy or unhealthy a patient is, so there are times where a patient you are treating, who has no undisclosed symptoms and everything is surpressed, just collapses and dies. 

There are also inconsistencies that make the designing and planning aspect of the game truly infuriating. For example, I found that I had hired more doctors than I needed (I don't know how this happened since I always hire for a specific postion rather than dragging and dropping a doctor into place). So the logical thing to me was to look through my list of doctors and select each doctor that did not have a day or night shift specified and fire them. But for some reason, even through going through your patient list allows you to click on the person's face and bring up their card, this does not work for doctors. And that is the only list there is. So, without being able to use it makes it pretty much impossible to interact with this person who is never coming to work.

Oh, and you can't sort by anything on this list despite there being multiple categories.

Sometimes my employees disappear. Are they quitting? Is it a bug? 

For a long time, I thought it was a glitch, but apparently you can only have four floors, although this information doesn't seem to be available anywhere in game, and when you try you don't get an error or a grayed out button. Just, it didn't work.

Sometimes, when I go up a floor, there's just random black space.

In my patient list, I have a patient marked as ""unknown hazard"" although he is diagnosed and has no hidden symptoms.

Saved games are sorted alphabetically, and is case sensitive.

Staff are sometimes depressed and unsatisfied, but I have no idea how this affects my hospital since there are no indications on how things are proceeding, and I have no idea how to fix this, if it matters at all.

Sometimes patients want a treatment and I get a prompt that says the proper equipment isn't available, but it doesn't tell me what that equipment is.

Some patients needs to stay overnight to receive treatments like ""IV antibiotics"" and ""rest"" but you aren't given any information on how long this takes, or where the patient is in the treatment. How long has Frank Cole been in HDU? Nobody knows.

You can't select items on top of tables. I hope you didn't wan to move it.

There's no undo button.

And my last complaint, is that despite all of these flaws, the bugs and poor design, the team decided to create a silky smooth animation for patients who sometimes decide to do a backflip onto an exam table, but can't animate a stretcher turning around a corner.

All in all, this is sometimes a fun game, but 80% of the time I'm frustrated with another person who is stuck in a machine and I spend days trying every combination of things I can do to try to shake them out of this state until eventually I give up and restore a save.

It's a more realistic hospital management game where you create your hospital and departments and watch as your doctors diagnose patient symptoms, run them through different tests and try to guess patients illness correctly (or in some cases incorrectly).

That said the game is management game and tries for realism so doctors themselves try to run patients through tests and machines trying to exclude possibilities in possible illnesses. This is not a minmaxing micromanagement game. You will have a lot of patients which in hands of senior doctors will get their symptoms revealed in a heartbeat while juniors will continue to run people through tests and machines and can still miss identify the symptoms.

Game is not without problems and current biggest pain point is hospitalization and wards. As of writing of this review to cure hospitalized patients you will need full hospitalization and surgery capabilities on the department illness belongs to.

This game does away with the over-the-top silliness of Theme Hospital or Two Point Hospital. This attempts to create a real-life hospital simulation where patient flow relatively follows that of patients coming into a hospital. You manage the number and quality and specialties of the staff, what diagnostic and operative specialties you offer, and can create your hospital layout to make things run efficiently. The game is still in early access, and there are some game-breaking bugs. But assuming the devs follow through and continue working on this great game, I see huge amounts of potential. 

There's a short campaign mode currently which will get you through the basics, and then there is also a Sandbox mode. The Sandbox mode is good, but needs expansion to create longevity of interest. More dynamic insurance companies, the addition of competing hospitals and competing for insurance contracts, negotiating contracts, things like that would be fantastics adds. Also, visuals currently don't mean much to the hospital and patient satisfaction (like any of the furniture items), but down the line hopefully there are drawbacks/benefits to furniture outside of aesthetics.

You have to try again and again, and then build from experience, or rely on prefabs before you can make your own prefabs. Also, the number of patients is limited to the number of contracted insurances, which feels a wee bit arbitrary. There are no random events (at least in the sandbox) unless you unlock them. Why? Arbitrary again.

The UI is a mess for a management game. It's a shame that patient/employee data and hospital controls are intermixed so that you have to click around way too much.

Well my first few hours with the game was a little frustrating trying the tutorial...it quickly got me both lost and stuck so I figured I would just jump in the sandbox and start a basic clinic. That worked out pretty well although I did get hung up on placing personnel and setting up some of the more complicated rooms. A little Googling and forum searching and I had pretty much figured that out.

Next was to tackle the first scenario - emergency room master. I kept losing around days 5 and 6 but every time I came away a little wiser from the experience. Finally after playing for the better part of the evening I cracked the code and won the scenario. On a whim I checked against global stats and I see only 1% of players have even beat the first scenario! I don't know but to me that is very satisfying and the game play was good if a little repetitive at that level but it has me really excited for what is to come because basically I was running only 3 units: emergency, diagnostics (with really only an x-ray) and observation rooms.

Project Hospital is a one-of-a-kind game. It combines the proper realism of hospitalization, with all the fun of gaming. It brings content for everyone - whether you like being hands on in the Trauma Center, building a multi-complex surgery department, or even going behind the scenes of a hospital, managing the inner workings and finances, this is the game for you.

I've never played a better game, specifically on the simulation scene, this game is amazing, it's the best simulation game I've ever come across, bought, played, or kept coming back to - which I will be for a long, long, LONG time.

The game has a vibrant, active community, an easy three-round tutorial set that teaches the basics of the game in no time, and a simple UI that keeps the focus on the game, while still efficently providing the full toolkit you need to run a world-class hospital.

However, there are quite a few things that don't happen in real life as several people have pointed out. As such I do have several suggestions:

1) Only 1 big pathology lab is necessary, we shouldn't need a pathology lab built for just 1 department (that'll probably cripple all hospitals in real life)
2) several operating theatres but not allocated to just a specific department. 
3) Instead of nurses wheeling people around, we normally have orderlies
4) Diagnosing - it'll honestly be great let us/the doctor know when they started getting the symptoms (e.g. 1 day so we know whether it's acute or chronic)
5) Once we have palpated, done auscultation or done any other forms of physical examination could we get the results?
e.g. dual heart sounds, no added sounds or wheeze present during expiration 
6)have an option where we can treat all the patients that come in (without needing a computer doctor's input) - I personally think this would be quite cool. 
7) just to complicate things for the absolute nerds, could we have different types of antibiotics e.g. ceftriaxone rather than just stating IV antibiotics? I'm assuming that this would probably be best left to those that desire to mod this already fabulous game. 
8) Every action should lead to some sort of cost - e.g. putting a cannula in. Personally, I understand that some patients have been saying that several operations are clearly not well compensated for e.g. cardiovascular surgery.

-UI needs to be improved massively

If you want to play a good hospital sim, want to manage a profitable or even only a proper working hospital: hands off.

e.g most annoying bugs: 
-Patients are suffering to death, while loads of doctors and nurses are idling. Advising them manually rarely helps, most times it changes nothing, they just ignore your advices.
-Patients are collapsing and staff gets stuck asides his bed - doing nothing, watching patient dying... Advising them manually doesn't help, they are just stcuk. Sometimes save & reload helps, most times not.

However, I still can't recommend it at this time.  I don't think it should have been a full release in its current state.  There are a number of design choices and quality of life issues that steal some of the fun from it.

The department planning and room requirements feel forced and unreasonable (a janitor closet for each department?).  Assigning staff to rooms is harder than it needs to be, especially if you don't assign workers right when you hire them.  Trying to identify problems can be challenging since troubleshooting doesn't seem to be considered.  Most other life simulators will let you see the sims thoughts to better identify what needs to be addressed.

Overall, I think this game needed an early access period before release as it seems like the devs could have used some critical feedback on the systems and interface.

Pros: Interesting to begin with, learning the way the game works is interesting and you can reach quite a satisfactory point of where the hospital can almost run itself. 

Cons: Not nearly enough content. Once you've figured out how it works, that's about it. Mechanics aren't totally clear and the grinding wait time in-between funds can just be annoying and boring. Doctor experience rises so slowly there's minimal point in actually hiring a genius intern and getting them up to speed. Due to the extensive prefabrication system, you come to realise that you don't actually need to really design anything yourself, just plug and play the pre-fab facilities as there's basically no reason not to do so. The UI is pretty terrible to boot.

The later tutorials are buggy, but the sandbox mode is very polished from what I've played so far. The game doesn't do the best job at explaining some things, so it'll take some trial and error to fully understand a few mechanics and how they function. For example, the game allows you to hire interns (which is cool) but it doesn't tell you how to use them. I thought maybe interns would shadow my doctors to learn and maybe eventually get enough experience to be hired, but instead, the game just fills an actual doctor role with the intern if you hire them. This is bad obviously lol. But again, the game doesn't tell you if you can train them or anything, it just let's you figure it out yourself. And there's many more examples like that in this game. I'm not a fan of mechanics that aren't explained in-game. Hopefully they flesh out the tutorial in the next few months so we can better understand what we can and cannot do.

Project Hospital is a game developed and published by Oxymoron Games

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all and the UI in this game is simply the most annoying and awkward UI I've ever had the audacity of using

Project Hospital overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts!

I will parrot some other reviews in that it has a few flaws that need a little work. However, it is most defintely playable, and it most definitely has no more problems/bugs than any other recent release. Steam user madmaxx's review is a great rundown of the current issues that exist in the game.

The devs appear extremely responsive, and are churning out the patches. This game scratches an itch for me that has not been satisfied in a VERY long time.

Having an ever so slight knowledge about how a hospital works and some basic medical stuff will help.

Some background, I'm a medical nerd without being a professional.  I've had far too many hospital treatments and admissions than anyone should and I've been looking for a hospital sim game that was realistic and relatable as opposed to comical.

Project hospital ticks those boxes for me.  The detail is amazing, you can diagnose patients yourself by ordering a huge array of tests, the tooltips provide great context and information about both diagnostics and conditions themselves without being overwhelming.

Graphically simplistic, if you're looking for pretty pretty then this isn't for you however this isn't the target audience for this game.  The graphics are great for a management sim with this level of complexity.

The game is still being developed, though I firmly agree that its current state is adequate for a full release and I'm glad the developers did not go for early access, they have released a full and well rounded game with room for expansion.

There are some minor bugs but nothing game breaking that I have found, often a simple reload of the save is enough to fix anything I've come across.

As always there are negatives..  The model is currently that of a private hospital so you must balance your income and expenditures, I would love to see how different a publicly funded hospital would have to be managed.

The map sizes are quite limiting at the moment, you're not able to build a massive city supporting hospital at the moment since the map just isn't big enough and you are only currently allowed 4 floors (however having floors in itself is great considering most management sims are limited to ground floor only!)

My issue is that while there are multiple departments your hospital can host they all require the exact same room, staff, requirements, etc. which means that once you have implemented an emergecy and radiology department you are going to be copying and pasting the rest of them on separate floors. The way that patients and staff work should be changed IMO. You are generally stuck with 10 patients per department per day. There should be more fluctuation in the patients that are coming in.

1. Departments can't share certain resources, like labs, bathrooms, waiting rooms, break rooms, etc. This is DEFINITELY something that happens in real life, especially when you are working in a smaller hospital, so I don't see why I have to have a separate one for each department. Maybe as the hospital grows, it would make sense (i.e. the workload gets too high for one, so you have to build another, or the ""supply chain"" breaks down when they are too far apart or too many floors apart to provide timely results).
2. Can't manually prioritize certain patients. Right now, I have a patient with a broken jaw that's been in my hospital for 2 full days, but other patients keep jumping in front of him for surgery, even though they just have a broken leg or osteomyelitis (which is not as urgent as a broken jaw).
3. Once a patient is in a ""higher"" level of care, you can't downgrade them (e.g. you put them in the ICU, then as they get better, they should be able to be moved to ""regular"" hospitalization.)
4. There's no setting (that I see) that automatically assigns all patients to you or even one that gives you a pop up with each new patient. Additionally, when I send a patient home, it should automatically remove them from my watch list, or let me choose a setting to do so.
5. THERE'S NO ROTATION OF THE MAP!?!!!???!?! But seriously, WTF?! I can't see through the elevators and objects even with the walls hidden, so I have NO IDEA if there's something there.
6. The campaign setting has some things locked in place, meaning I cannot move them. Why?
7. I should be able to assign/schedule the operating rooms to run back to back cases, with the same or even different doctors. Case in - procedure - case out - clean. Case in - procedure - case out - clean. etc. The patients should be pre-op'd and queued in/on their way to the OR shortly after the cleaning is completed.
8. Two or more operating rooms should be able to share one scrub-in area, as long as they are directly connected.
9. I want to have more control over my open/closed hours for the clinic. I get like 1 ED patient a day and have this monstrous ED in my hospital (campaign). Would also like to see more departments, eventually. Maybe this is something you unlock through the campaign.

EDIT:
10. If a patient comes in with a painful joint/bone, I should be able to send them to radiology before they see the MD. Also, nurses should be doing vitals (like BP and temp) prior to the MD seeing the patient.",1543282826,1543536316,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Here you have no idea until doctors look at them. Micro manage there is, I have no idea how many times I would send the patient there rather than there we he did and in the end it went to long for him to get treated. (using cheap doctors) Expanding is not as easy in other games. Expaning to fast and you drain your money for sure, and in wrong places.. You will build MANY hospitals before you understand this game, to find a layout that you like to use. But honest to heart, I love this game so damn much. You dont earn much daily so there is a grind if you loose the money you can get for doing X things. (You have no bloody idea how many times i deleted a 30k worth equiment to make it small as possible) I do love what they have created here. So very much! Im addicted to this game, nice to have a hospital where you cant see what is wrong with someone and have to manage it all. I highly recommend this game to people who want more challange than a bloating head and need to find out what really is wrong with someone. Some times you get a message that the doctor have not enough skills to find out and you have to step out. I would give this game 10/10, but logic having corridors without walls is kinda... unrealistic.. it rain on people and it dosnt matter to them, Im sure they will change that in the future tho. so for now from me 9/10. deffently a 9 because i always return back to play it",1543518499,1543518499,True,3,0,0.530685961246490479,0,True,False,False

Project Hospital is a wonderful game.  I suppose I could stop there but why?  The focus of the title is clearly on the actual running of a clinic/hospital environment, and the simulation while not perfect falls into the way above average category.  It uses actual illnesses and injuries along with the corresponding procedures and treatments to fix them.  And while it simplifies them down to a simple animation, it does force you to have the correct rooms, staff and equipment availble to treat the patients coming into your building.  Most people I have seen micro manage every level of patient care from the time they walk in the doors, trying to min max the game, which is fine if you are into that kind of gameplay;  however it is also completely enjoyable to operate as just an administrator.  I build the hosipital, make it look asthetically pleasing, manage my staff and departments from the top rather than trying to control the patients individually.  It adds a another demension to the game making sure your doctors have good skills and levels too rather than just doing their job for them.  

The graphics are not mind boggling but the game has a clean look to it.  No you can't rotate the camera, but I've never found that to be a bother the way everything is set up.  The UI can be frustrating because you can't make the text any bigger, but it has a good set up and is easy to navigate.  If you play the tutorial missions there is nothing left to the imagination, it covers the basics of the game very well without stretching on too long or holding your hand through the whole process.  

So far the updates have been steady and well thought out.  The developers are listening to players, and often times the most requested or most complained about items are included in the patch to improve the game.  

This game is perfect for a simulator enthusiast, whether you enjoy min maxing and micro management or being the big eye in the sky it offers a play style for either.  Once you have a fully built out hospital it is still enjoyable to play with configurations and try to improve the set up, or you can take what you have learned and start all over again! 

Personally I think the cost of entry is worth it, and I am very excited to see how the game continues to improve and grow.  We will see how many total hours I end up with, but my guess would be a couple hundred.",1543431355,1543431355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far I have only played with the sandbox mode so maybe the campaign explains some things I'm unsure about. The developers have been adding patches so it appears that they are still working on the game to make it even better.

A few issues I have with the game as it stands is that there could be more micromanagement. An example being that I had a lot of customers who left my hospital without being fully treated and I don't know why. All it says is that they 'left'. If you click on the patient cards, that doesn't tell you much either. Even just a small explanation, such as 'couldn't be fully treated' or 'waited too long' would help us know where we are going wrong. 
I also find the camera (or lack of) a slight issue. You can't rotate the camera which means that you can't see behind taller objects or objects placed on walls. It would help if there was an option to maybe make objects in front of other objects transparent so you can see behind them (if there is one, then I appologise, but I haven't found an option yet).

This is first and foremost a hospital sim game - not a tycoon game akin to Theme Hospital.  It is the Skylines/SimCity4 of hospital management that takes a hard approach with actual symptoms and diagnoses for example.  The game is complete and for the most part, completely functional.  I had some small bugs and have some minor qualms about game design but nothing game breaking and I am hopeful for continued development.

The good: 
Being a big fan of sim games, this is a unique experience and I found it extremely interesting and challenging.  The tutorials did a good job explaining how to create and manage a functional hospital, and I won't forget receiving that first emergency case via ambulance with severe blood loss and having the patient die because I'm checking ears and palpating the throat.  Whoops lol.  

You can choose to let the doctors handle the patients themselves and they do a pretty good job being autonomous.  You don't have to micromanage.  And while I observed some AI issues, I think overall they did a good job and only minor tweaks are needed. And if you choose to let the game play out autonomously, the game does a good job pulling you back in by presenting cases to diagnose because the doctor isn't able to.

There is also a sense of achievement watching scores of patients arrive at your hospital and your hospital handling it well - shuffling patients around to the trauma center, ICU, and surgery.  The campaign and missions are short but challenging, and sandbox gave me the freedom to create a hospital the way I wanted.  I'm happy with the game as a whole, the graphics are 2D isometric and beautifully done, and they really took their time creating a thorough experience.

To summarize, I think its really neat to build a functional hospital, diagnose a dude who needed brain surgery, watch the staff get ready, perform the surgery, recover, and eventually dismissed.  I'm a simulation fan and I just like stuff like that.

The bad: 
My biggest complaint about the game is how narrow it can be.  In a game like Prison Architect, for example, there is a degree of experimentation with design where a failing prison still receives money and you can play and experiment.  The money rolls in, but you deal with a dysfunctional prison, death, riots, etc.  Project Hospital is more black and white and design that deviates is punished financially, the one and only villian of the game.  Person dies - not really a big deal.  Bad diagnosis - not a big deal.  Can't diagnose someone?  Just give him some antibiotics and send him home, whatever.  The real problem is, how am I going to afford to tile these floors... am I going to have to fire the night shift radiology guy to save a couple bucks?

Overstaffing early in the game, for example, can give you a crippling financial situation and prevent future growth.  The same departments are built in nearly the same order and you need a complete hospital with ideal room and staff ratios in order to handle everyone.  Its not even about optimization - if you fail to build and staff appropriately, your hospital starts to fail.  To a certain degree I felt my creativity and options stifled as I repeatedly build the same rooms, departments, and layouts I always do in nearly the same exact order.  And once you find that magic formula, the hospital runs itself.  The only constraint is money, which seems to be in short supply.  I  have, for example, built entire wings of my hospital with bare floors and walls while money trickled in to afford cosmetic upgrades.  Then, let the game run until you save up to build the next wing, and so on.  While the premise is fun, it feels like something is missing.

In campaign, for example, you build the missing departments as money comes in.  You might need to move some rooms and work on staffing a bit, but overall that's it.  And as much fun as I had building hospitals in sandbox, Im reluctant to build another hospital because I know I'm going to be doing the same thing over again.  I think the developers need to spend a bit more time on coming up with ways to engage the players and foster creativity to improve the player experience because currently it feels a bit predictable and a bit too much on rails. The same number of patients every day.  Everyone goes home.  Night is quiet except for an ambulance or two. 

I feel like there is a missed opportunity for more, some curveballs, and trade up on the money constraint for some other challenges.  Give me more money, but encourage more accurate treatments.  Let me staff more, but vary the loads and on different departments.  Give me more money, and give me an epidemic or natural disaster.  Let me play and give me the funds to do it if that makes sense.

Then there is a matter of other little things like no camera rotation and other small things that I feel other reviews have mentioned, but I don't think I need to repeat those, and honestly nothing as important as my aforementioned gameplay concern.

Conclusion:
While the game has its shortcomings and leaves a lot to be desired (I really want to see maternity ward), the game is worth it in my opinion strictly because of its originality.  The only other game(s) in this genre is Theme Hospital and its recent Two Point Hospital sequel.  But those games are so different that I feel its unfair to even compare them.  Project Hospital is bold going after a more realistic experience and I think that is enough to warrant a recommendation.  Its good enough and there is nothing else out there like it.  So even though it isn't perfect, the game justifies its own existence.  Even though it needs work, its a pioneer in gameplay and you have to give them credit for attempting it - paving their own path in a hospital sim.  I just hope they continue to make it the game we all want and know it can be.

1) Characters are extremely inefficient. For example janitors clean one room on one side of the building and go back and forth accross the building wasting an extreme amount of time. Also it is incredibly annoying to see janitors literally walk back and forth over blood on the floor and not clean it up. Also why is the janitor cleaning the operating room in the middle of surgery or in the TC with someone in it? Kinda ruins the effect. Another example is that when a character wants water they don't necessarily go to the closest water station, sometimes they walk accross the building and by the time they get back they have another need and immediately leave their station again. Also it seems they will use items closest distance tile wise, rather than path wise, meaning even if it's separated by a wall they will go all the way around rather than something down the hall.

2) I want to be able to have a set surgery team. I hate having patients die left and right because they couldn't get the surgery they needed. I tried hiring a team and setting their duties to surgery related only but it looks like they are required to perform patient related tasks. I want the option to hire a team for surgery, a surgeon, anasthesiologist, nurses etc, that are set to work together and be able to create multiple teams. Also hiring doctors and nurses qualified to perform surgery at night doesnt't make them able to perform surgery at night which is crazy. The whole surgery dynamic could use a revamp. 

3) Let me supercede my characters decision. It sucks that you cannot cancel a automated decision. For example if they have been set to go to regular hospitalization, let me upgrade to HDU or ICU easily without having to wait for free space to open. Along those same lines if they are waiting for surgery, which takes forever for reasons explained above, let the life saving treatment supercede the surgery. Why can I not give them antibiotic IV, or defib etc. until after the surgery? Not realistic. 

4) Super easy one that would improve quality of life. MAKE MY GAME SAVES APPEAR AT THE TOP. Scrolling past 100 autosaves to reach a game same is annoying so I started naming everything with an ""a"" in front.

There are a bunch of other things but these are a few of the most glaringly obnoxious to me and really need to be fixed asap.",1542236784,1542240941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u][b]Pro's[/b][/u]
[i]Great Details[/i]
From the descriptions of symptoms, causes, and treatments to the detailed dependencies of equipment, This game provides a great depth and wealth of knowledge. A good opportunity to learn new ways of looking at your health.
[i]Neo-Retro Style[/i]
like the updated side scroller games, the locked 3/4 view and sprite implementation takes me back to the vast amount of games I grew up playing in this style. Reminds me SimCity and Theme Park constantly.
[i]Sandbox Gameplay[/i]
While the campaign options feel short and rushed. The growth objectives in the Sandbox Mode make this mode feel like the designer's original intent of the game.

[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]
[i]Patient Cards[/i]
These things are horrendous. The coloring scheme is inconsistent and contradictory at times. Most of the time I only know a treatment is complete is by which section the treatment is displayed in and that the treatment is no longer pulsing or boxed.
[i]Manual Diagnosis[/i]
The manual diagnosis is a great way to get deeper into the gameplay. As you get used to seeing given symptoms, you can optimize the examinations to get to a single diagnosis effeciently as possible.  There is also an extreme limitation on how many patients you can manually diagnose (15 patients when you quickly are servicing 40 a day). This leads to a reliance on the AI and my biggest qualm with the game.
[i]Insanely horrendous AI[/i]
I have tried 5 times to start this with a positive on the AI, but I can not find one. The AI picks a route before moving a employee or patient, and nothing AT ALL can change that route. This leads to patients suddenly stopping if a receptionist decides to go to the bathroom and then another patient steals the receptionist once they have returned. A paitent coming across the street might get seen after three patients who came in across the map if the three patients got on the map one second earlier.
The horrendous behaviour also expands into the diagnosis process. Even after a diagnosis is singled out, the AI will continue to perform examinations until all examinations are performed, even if all symptoms are discovered and treated. This has lead to multiple delays and needless medical escalations that my growing facility was not able to handle. And I can not take the patients off of manual diagnosis even after I have set the cause and treatment as the AI will see an obsure examination was not done and will order it if I drop the patient from manual control. The examination orders will also trigger if I add a new specialty for a new examination. This get's so frustrating so fast, I have only now made it to Day 8 and feel no want to go further. The last con is the straw that got me to finally stop playing the game.
[i]Predictable Patients by the day[/i]
If you are treating patients and suddenly find you are going to lose a patient to not having a particular department or treatment option, you can simply reload the 8 am auto-save and build what you need. By day, the same patients will arrive with the same causes. The only variety is in the order the patients will arrive and what initial symptoms you will see. If you had 5 people show up with influenza and reload the 8 am save, you will still have 5 people show up with influenza. That carries to any extremity of cause (including surgery needs). As the game gives little to no warning to make corrections before losing a patient and the regularity from an auto-save, it starts to take the fun out of the game after awhile.

I wanted to give the game a fair shot. I have enjoyed some of the game time, but in the end I have lost any motivation to carry on beyond early builds of internal medicine departments as it is hard to build up the budget before taking out loans and getting nothing but more of what you get in the existing departments. There is no growth in gameplay after building general surgery hospitalization. And I feel no need to further play the game at this time.

If the game developers would like to discuss this review, I also have a few ideas (zoning AI decisions, class structuring for icon styling, etc. ) for addressing some of the bigger issues. I am accomplished developer working end to end concept development.",1542160947,1542161181,False,86,2,0.742264747619628906,8,True,False,False

I loved the theme hospital games but wanted a serious hospital management game, and tadaa only weeks after we got the spiritual succesor to Theme Hospital, we get Project Hospital, the serious brother.

I suppose if you compare it to other games, then building wise it comes close to the Sim. You can create all kind of rooms and fill them up with required items to make them function, but ontop of that add other details to them. To help you out they will show what items are required, what items are useful next to that and the rest is up to you if you want to use that to fill up the rooms.

A very nice feature that i like alot is taking control of the doctors. Especially in down time it's nice that you can do something else other then watching how things go. What it means is for example you take over a GP. You look at the sympthones of a patient and then decide the following actions, what will you investigate first, making sure you get to the right diagnosis. After that you can choose what the proper treatment will be. The game will tell you so if you don't have a medical degree in Real life they got you covered. It's not to complex but it's nice that it's there.
But it doesn't stop there, o no, you can also do that when a emergency happens. Someone gets brought in with a ambulance, he is bleeding, what will you do? It adds to the hospital life!

The graphics are nice, it's very functional and clean. It really adds to the hospital theme as it looks very sterile. It appears handdrawn almost, and i love it. It helps me with the immersion, i love it more then realistic graphics. 
I seen some complaints about you not being able to rotate the camera, but that is alright for me. I think it's done on purpose cause when you color the walls it colors both sides in that color. So you can just color the walls you see with the colors you want, if you could rotate the camera they would need to adjust it that you have a two sided wall that you can color seperately.

What i do miss is a gift shop! Unless i have missed it (i haven't build everything yet). And a cafeteria for patients and visitors. As people don't just lay in bed all day and night.

Shame on you for injecting your lack of cultural awareness and SJW BS in to a video game.

Now on to the game...I have worked in or around hospitals for years and it's unrealistic that a seperate operatory is needed for every  department of a hospital. We simply move equipment in and out of the operatory as needed. Common areas are simply that, common areas, and don't need to be identified for a specific section of the hospital (I.E. an ER doc will routinely be found in a surgical common area and vise versa. 

Heres what I like...the game provides a wealth if knowledge if you take the time to look at some of the treatments and remedies. The hospital works which is a feat in of itself because of all the various aspects a real hospital holds.

The fix...Lose the SJW BS. Make rooms sharable by department and add the equipment element; if the equipment isn't there then the procedure cant be performed. Also fix the ambulances, on average a small hospital ambulances will drop off a patient every hour. For large hospitals it a patient every 10-20 minutes. I want to flood my hospital with patients just to see if I can break it so put a check box in game so I can do that. Wheres the cafateria? A hospital lives and breaths around it's cafateria!

If you're looking for a zany tycoon game that focuses on the game element more than a hospital simulation then, well there's plenty of other options.
  
Project Hospital's biggest strength is that it has an extremely high level of detail that is extremely compelling if you're open to that.

For instance, the symptoms, treatments and diagnoses are all rooted in reality as opposed to wacky alternatives (ala Theme Hospital and Two Point Hospital), diagnostic and treatment procedures are animated and specific to the area affected, patients are given food & medicine and specific times and there's continued hospitalisation after surgical procedures for recovery. These are just a handful of examples of the sheer attention to detail the devs have poured into the game. All of these things I personally adore and give the game a deep simulation twist that a lot of tycoon-esque games don't tend to dive into.

The building is fun and while it has a bit of a learning curve to get used to the tools given (and not a lot of explanation offered either), it's reminiscent of the original Sims in presentation and satisfaction. Both your patients and staff have needs, traits and skills that help give individuality to every doctor, nurse, janitor, biochemist, radiologist, patient and receptionist.

While there is a very wide range of departments in the game, there are some which are notably absent (maternity, pharmacy, ophtalmology, etc), while the game merges treatments and diagnosis from these departments into others, even more depth would be welcome, either way I am sure this will be addressed by either mods (mod support is coming), future patches or even DLC. 

There are bugs, and there is some polishing to be had, for instance the odd z-buffering glitches where patients/staff will appear behind the chair they are supposed to be sitting, you can't sort saves [by date/time only alphabetically], and the game doesn't go too deep into explaining the mechanics. It's not completely obtuse, tooltips do help a lot, but it's a lot less hand-holdy compared to other modern games. It's something you can muscle on through with experimentation and looking/playing the pre-built hospitals however.

The lack of a rotating camera is a bit odd, but it seems to be due to the way the walls are done, I'm hoping this'll be changed, but it doesn't really get in the way too much.

All in all, I highly recommend playing it if you're like me and love simulation/tycoon games that are balanced more on the side of simulation than game. And in all honesty, Project Hospital is the game I wanted to play when I first played the goofy yet great Theme Hospital back in 1997.

+ I can really learn more medical english :)

- Building is really the least favorite thing for me, its buggy, you can't choose object you want, you can't move for example an examination bed if you don't move lamp above it first, you can't move a group of objects like PC on desk
- No rotation - it's very difficult, especially for building
- Patients with hidden, blinking eye symbol often dies (even on ICU), because you can't add any more test to reveal the life threatening condition
- Also I don't understant patient's needs when he's lying on ward, and has need critical, like bathroom or hunger, when restroom is nearby

My refund request was declined so I decided to play this game further.

There are lots of bugs but then there are things that didn't turn out to be bugs but the game forgot to teach you in tutorials.


Bugs I frequently encountered:
1. Item placement: when you select an item and deselect it by right-clicking, the item will vanish and will not return to its original place. They are often expensive medical equipments.

2. Sometimes when I press Regular hospitalization on a patient they'll hang around and wait to see a doctor outside the office for ages but they are ignored and leave the hospital after the clinic hour is finished.

3. Sometimes a doctor won't go home after their shift has ended and hang around for days and nights. You can fire them or change their shift to day/night and shift it back to what it was.

4. sometimes a patient is placed on a bed and will be seen floating on air. This does not affect the gameplay but it's a bug nonetheless.



Things the tutorial won't teach so I had to figure out the hard way:
1. ICU: one doctor is assigned to one patient only. If you have a collapsed patient that cannot be sent to ICU, hire one more doctor.

2. Surgery: there are 5 workers required per surgery and in order to have the department running while there is a surgery, you need to hire sufficient amount of doctors and nurses. 
I didn't know and waited for ages wondering why they won't perform any surgeries while patients collapsed one by one.

3. The game won't tell me if a worker has opened up a new trait so I can't easily check on whether they have opened a crappy traits that lead to less stars.




Not bug but annoying:

1. Items: While building if you buy something and delete then you'll get only a portion of its worth back. Instead of deleting, leave everything on the roof of your building. It sucks.

2. Building sucks. Delete your wall and doors by pressing the bulldozer icon instead of wall deleting button because that costs money.

3. things like a desk with a computer on it: you have to move the computer somewhere you can put it on and then move the desk. Same applies to items next to a wall with something hanging on the wall.

4. Desk, computer, and chair occupied by doctors/nurses/techs can't be when there's someone assigned to it. 

5. I thought I fired some workers but it turns out they weren't assigned to a workstation and came into work and spent time being idle and wasted my money on wages.

6. Don't send healthy people to ICU by mistake as they'll take room and won't be moved to other department for ages.



I am still playing Campaign 1 and have finished all the insurance quests given to me but why is the game telling me whether it was a successful campaign or not?

Item positioning is just the worst.
large portion of my gameplay time was wasted on moving things to the rooftop so I don't have to buy it again later when I need it.

Being a physician and enthusiastic gamer IRL, I've been looking forward to playeing Project Hospital for quite some time, since I was sorely disappointed with Two Point Hospital (it was simply not realistic enough - I know it doesn't even try to be).

Luckily Project Hospital rises to the task. Sure, there are some medical inaccuracies, but nothing game breaking. I'd imagine the game is a bit tricky for non medical professionals, but there are plenty of tooltips to enable anyone to actually do a bit of doctoring themselves.

However, there are some things that bother me. Mainly, there are a few bugs in the interface, and sometimes it is impossible to understand, for example, why a patient is left to die in a bed while at the intensive care unit (the staff is just sitting by their computers playing Solitaire.)

I assume this will be improved in patches though.

In summary, since the game is so cheap, I recommend it to anyone remotely interested in medicine or hospitals - this is WAY BETTER than Two Point Hospital in that regard.

Breaking the essence of game down: You place rooms and objects, hire staff and you can have fun handling your patients on your own trying to recognize their symproms and associate them with a disease. Some reviews state, you can alterantively concentrate on macro of the game but there is really not much to do. Thats like 30% of the time. At them moment you spend 70% of your game time to find out why things are not working. If you have played the game, you can feel me:

The game is far from ready. Guys, that's an alpha with 6 months to go.

- Game feels untested in many areas (many basic treatments don't work in developer-created scenarios)
- Obvious problems are literally JUMPING on you making it unbearable to play (camera rotation, blocked objects)
- Error messages are incorrect, making you search for the wrong things in the game
- NO User-Experience-Design whatsoever (menus are designed impossibly stupid, icons and writing are ridiculously small, it's like they had not played the game actually for more than 2 hours straight)

Fun for me in this game would be handling the interaction between different department in the hospital, however that is fix. You cannot make decision in the game related to the percentage of diagnosis. Resource handling between departments doesn't work at all AND you cannot control it. Place rooms, hire staff and find out why things are not working. That's the game now.

I've really enjoyed this game. The learning curve steepens the more you try and develop a larger, functioning hospital. It would be very easy to create a small clinic with a radiography department and you could tick along and make a little bit of money, but it gets increasingly more difficult as you add extra specialties to your hospital with multiple departments. This is a good thing as the game pushes back on you as you expand to do more things.

Alot of people have commented either way on the graphics. Personally I really enjoy them. There is a subtle level of detail present, like someone getting an x-ray of their arm will have a picture of an arm appear on the x-ray monitor. Someone having open heart surgery will have oodles of blood on the floor and pictures of their heart on the monitors. This level of detail shows creators who are really passionate about their product. My one gripe about the graphics is the item placement and selection. The way the game is, if you want to select say a rubbish bin, but that bin is 'behind' a shelf from another room, you have to either remove or move the shelf before you can get to the bin. Its an annoyance, but it certainly doesnt break the game.

Building rooms is actually pretty difficult until you've done it a few times, especially the more intricate rooms like HDU beds, or Operating Rooms. What's not made clear to you are the dependencies items have on other items. I know they highlight in blue to show a direct relationship but for example, building an HDU bed requires 2 or 3 things to be placed in the immediate vicinity of the bed, and unless you've not tried to cram in as many beds as possible (guilty) it's not going to work. I'm not sure how this is solved, maybe if you're building an HDU room and you select the bed tool, as you place the bed the next item required automatically appears at the end of your cursor?

Further about rooms, it gets a little tiresome having to build the same rooms over and over. There are common rooms for each of the 6 or so specialties, the same number of nurses stations, on call rooms, operating theatres, one for each specialty. I get that a theatre specialising in orthopaedics will require different equipment from one that specialises in brain surgery but we lack the ability to create a generic operating wing which patients from all over the hospital would be transferred to for their operations, like in real life. Sure, you could build your myriad of singular OR's in one spot, but the issue here is if you have an influx of brain related illnesses, that one theatre gets slammed, the others remain empty. The other issue is with all the singular on-call and nurses rooms, you end up with 12 support rooms surrounding your OR's. What we should have is a single generic on-call room and nurses station that all specialties can consume.

The AI does a reasonable job of keeping things moving efficiently, although people seem to path based on their line of sight to a room, for example, someone needing to use the toilet would walk a loop of the entire hospital to get to a toilet which, based on line of sight was closet to them, but they will walk past other available toilets to get there. There are also oddities surrounding OR's - some days not a single patient will be operated on (even though they're lying in bed waiting, doctors and nurses are chilling in their respective rooms) and other days there will be 2 or 3 surgeries in a single day. There's no feedback given if there's anything preventing the room from functioning properly or anything.. Its certainly not perfect, but like I say, I think it does an acceptable job, for now.

Lastly we have patients themselves, and this is probably my biggest issue with the game. The number of patients (at least in my 20 hours) is extremely low. A hospital which receives 50 patients a day... There's no real challenge here, you dont really have to manage queues, or people getting sicker (some collapse, yes) or people getting fed up etc. Also, its a hospital, why does everyone get kicked out at 8pm? I know its called a clinic, but its a hospital, it should accept patients 24/7, which would add to the challenge. And thats the crux of it, the game lacks an ongoing challenge. Once you've learned the magic formula and the order to build your departments in, its rinse and repeat. Patient numbers increase in a linear fashion, I do like the insurance angle, but there needs to be alot of work done on how the hospital gets its patients. 

Overall, an enjoyable 20 hours, but I'm pretty much done with the game, the challenge has ebbed off and I'm left feeling a little empty by it when I play it now. I'd recommend it, at 20 dollar for 20 hours, a dollar an hour is much better than a movie and it will be continuously updated for the forseeable future, so I will see myself playing it more as it expands.",1541674166,1541674166,True,1,0,0.50641024112701416,0,True,False,False

It's no wonder so many people might be baffled with the complexities of this game and the whole hospital building that seems buggy or hard to manage but, rest assured, after some trial and error you will discover how real hospitals work (even though the game simplifies a LOT).

It's just a case of understanding the mechanics, as limited as they may be, but from the get go I could build functional units.
I categorize this game as a simulator. I've never seen a ""Tycoon"" type game so dedicated in portraying the reality as Project Hospital. I was hyped and bought it in the first 5 minutes of it's availability and did not regret my decision.

All the downsides of this game are stuff that hopefully will get fixed / added. As complex as it may be, it still over simplifies a lot of stuff. I'm used to play Rimworld, where everything affects everything. Here I see nurses attending patients in their ward rooms without desinfecting their hands between patients. I would like to see stuff like this be dependant on the nurse's XP / traits and have repercussions on the patients (cross-patient infections).
And one of the things that really makes me cringe: the shifts have no handover! So ALL the patients in wards, high dependency units and even in the intensive care unit are ABANDONED for 30-60 minutes while the doctors and nurses go home and the next shift arrives. I cringe so hard I may break a tooth!

I should not need to keep placing an overnight on call room and facilities for every department, which is detrimental because of physical space and how far staff and patients have to travel, not to mention the staff not sharing facilities between departments (bathrooms, staff rooms, cleaners).

I know the programming logic was done in a simple way, but why not allow assigning common rooms to various departments rather than having many, i prefer to have 1 larger central common room fully equipped than many smaller less equipped ones. Same with the rooms that are common across departments. For example, many departments have their own GPs, why not combine this and just sort the patients  based on the doctor's qualification.

While i give this a thumbs up, as its scales better than 2 point hospital between small and large hospitals, 2 point hospital fails catastrophically when your hospital grows large whereas this game doesnt but lack of sharing common resources means you'll need so much space planning, not to mention how difficult it is to move a room (you have to delete room, respace and move everything and redo the walls and doors).",1541528046,1541528046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While 2 Point Hospital is a whimsical and fun game about building as many general practitioner offices as possible, Project Hospital strives to offer as much depth as possible, embracing the simulation and management aspects of the genre.

Each patient comes in with an unknown disease or condition based on a very large real-world database. Your doctors (or you if you assume direct control) must evaluate a list of possible conditions based on the symptoms the patient presents with. What's more, not all symptoms are visible, so you need to run tests (and provide equipment and staffing for various testing facilities) and make tradeoffs between diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic time, and disomfort to a patient.

The game is not without its flaws, and those primarily are around usability. It feels like there are a number of usability and balance tweaks that are still to come and,  from the look of the patch notes, the developers are well aware of this and working on it.

The game is also fairly hard at the moment. It's fairly easy to build a unit that makes a small profit, but in order to expand your facilities, you'll need to take out a fairly sizable loan as you only get a certain number of patients per day at a maximum per department and that number doesn't scale very much, meaning that as you add more diagnostic equipment and capabilities for trauma, ICU, etc. you have roughly the same number of patients to accomodate, so your budget is even more stretched.  This does make the game an interesting challenge and adds some fun, but others may be frustrated at the delays between expanding into new departments.

On a personal note, I had Guillain-Barre Syndrome a number of years back, a very rare neurological condition that affects 1 in 100,000 people. This game not only includes it as a possible condition, but the various tests, symptoms, and treatment options were spot on (well, aside from the patients not frequently being paralyzed, which GBS can cause).

Overall, I love this game and I intend to keep playing the snot out of it, possibly trying my hand at modding it, and hoping for some DLC and improvements in the next year or so.",1541483221,1541483221,True,11,0,0.596447169780731201,0,True,False,False

For me,  this game is still an Alpha game. It is more of a building game rather then a management game. The game provides very little management options. Project Hospital plays very static, you just build some stuff without putting any challenge in there whatsoever.

The gameplay is not done. For example, patient intake is static, so once you've build your clinic, you keep getting 30 patiens every day, they mostly have the same disorder, from the common cold too a contusion,  but docters are nearly always accurate in treatment and nothing really happens. There are no changeable conditions in the game which requires you to adept. Once your rooms are in place it just keeps on going without having to change anything really, 

The 2nd issue is finances, there are grants added when you build certain rooms and stuff, but money does not feel like it is an issue in this game. You cannot change salaries. There isn't anything. No marketing.

The AI is bad, I see cleaners clean everything in their department except the mess in the operating rooms. But they do keep cleaning the same tiles as soon they walk over, because you cannot control staff they won't clean the operating room. Frustrating and Annoying.

The controls are frustrating: The time it takes to place and build a room is long. yes you can use prebuild rooms but they are static in size and often don't fit properly. Which means you need to build a complete room yourself, which takes ages to do so... First, you have to build a foundation, tiles you can use to build the room on. Then you need to assign every tile to the room you want to build, which requires you to switch between building tabs. You will spend a lot of time searching for the right button.  Then you have to place a door, (and windows) which are also hidden in a seperate area. Then you have to place a lot of objects in the room to make the room function, Once that is  complete you have to paint the walls or floor if that is your preference...  

This game for me is not finished, it is missing a lot of fundemental stuff to give it the ""game"" tag. A game should be fun, there should be a game element in the game, I don's classify this as a game. It is a hospital simulator, and that is all what it is.

People have been raving about this game for some time and I have to say, it falls seriously short of the hype.

TL;DNR – Not worth the hype, don’t bother unless it drastically changes.

The main issue seems to be that there is no efficiency with running anything. So, as your Emergency Department grows, so do your overheads and eventually you end up losing money. Not because I’m a bad hospital manager but because the strict visitor limits and their demands push it over the edge coupled with not being able to have shared services meaning that each department MUST have a common room, reception, toilets, cleaners cupboards and corridors of their own when they all do the same thing.

Here are some of the low-lights of my time with the game so far:

1. You will only get a limited number of patients per department. If you manage to hit the max level, the departments that these need will be more expensive than the money they bring in. But having smaller departments isn’t an option when it comes to progression.
2. Each department seems to just be a copy and paste job. You have to have a janitor, common room and toilets for each department, rather than having central ones that can be multi-use.
3. The game’s UI does not make it easy to understand at all. The use of abbreviations and terms can be confusing. You are expected to know what TC stands for right from the off or a notification of “hospitalization is not available” and doesn’t tell you the department or any detail as to why other than a tiny icon – and even then you’re none-the-wise. The fact that you have to have wards for each department makes it even harder when you have all 8 departments running.
4. You’re able to create a hospital and not enclose it. Seriously, try it.
5. You’re not able to easily assign day and night staff without navigating a maze of clicks first
6. It gets quite repetitive after a while, once you build one set of rooms, all of the future ones seem to be pretty much a copy & paste of each other.
7. You can literally change the game by editing the base code in Windows and Notepad.
8. It’s not very advanced in game play – there’s no rotate, it’s based on a very strict isometric grid (to the credit, the illness and diagnostic system is good), you can’t add parking spaces for ambulances in sandbox (you can add non-functional tarmac though)
9. You have no way to see who is waiting for a room. You can check people, but their statuses are beautifully vague (“waiting”, “Fulfilling needs” etc)
10. If you want even a minimally skilled specialist, you may have to navigate 6 or 7 recruitment refreshes costing 2500 a time.
11. There seems to be no real point to the prestige system. Objects you add seem to not obviously affect things and only efficiency does.
12. The game does not tell you HOW or WHY something has broken. Just that a queue is long or staff are busy. It will give you the name of the procedure rather than the room it is happening with. So, unless you’re familiar with your large hospital and what’s going on in each room, you’re just going to have to live with it. The little icon will give you a clue.. but.. ugh.
13. You can have a backlog of patients but no idea where that backlog is
14. Patients will get up at 7am and walk halfway across your hospital to fulfil needs – needlessly. No John, you can’t be that critical if you’re going to use the toilet at the front of the building.
15. There is no progression. You can’t train your staff, you can’t control your clinic hours, you can’t set shift lengths, you can’t assign toilets, common rooms and cleaners to multiple departments
16. There seem to be so many missing things:
Gift Shops / Supplies Shops
Café
Religious Centres
Morgues
Family Rooms
Patient Visitors
Out-Patients Departments
Additional Departments (such as maternity?)
Kitchens for Hospital Food
Helipads

17. MASSIVE learning curve if you just go in and play Sandbox. It’s not a pick-up-and-play type of game.

[*]This is a simulation with great emphasis on depth & Realism.
[*]Outstanding game concept and the idea is one many are interested in.
[*]Love the audio which accompanies accurate procedures.
[*]Details, control and depth...impressive.

[*]For what it is and how it plays, £24.99 is too much (£12 elsewhere).
[*]UI is clunky and does not feel like high quality.  It’s a little difficult to navigate and unfriendly.
[*]2D, so no rotation of the camera.
[*]There is a lot of text to read, no way to increase the size and it becomes laborious.
[*]Bugs (these are being fixed periodically).
[*]Tutorials, although they are there and detailed…they are not intuitive (nor is the game).
 [/list]

[h1] == OVERVIEW == [/h1]
My initial feelings were very positive indeed, I was excited to learn about the game (actually Simulation) and I thought this definitely something I could get my teeth into.  Unfortunately whilst playing just the tutorials alone I discovered some issues with gameplay processing, the UI is not pleasant and there is a noticeable lack of intuitive control.  

During the tutorials important info would be quite often covered by the tutorial window (which does not progress by itself) requiring you to constantly adjust and drag windows around until you can see what you need.

Don’t misunderstand me, the realism is high, there is a lot of accuracy and depth with Staff management, building, insurance & even patient analysis and care.  It accommodates a hands on or a hands off style of play (which is great to see), it’s just that the UI and the gameplay mechanics are clunky, and seriously detract from the core excellence which is clearly evident here.

I think for me, Steam has doubled the price that this game is elsewhere, and that is my main gripe.  For £24.99 (on sale £22.49) this game does not have the level of polish I demand and expect…at £12 though I might be tempted back in, as there is a lot of quality in this title.

[h1] == What I’d Like to See == [/h1]
[list]
[*]UI Improvements/overhaul.
[*]Better tutorials.
[*]More realistic price on Steam.

Alot of options and customilization which i always like in games. 

Bit of a learning curve. When you hire people it is almost more important to look at skills for what you wanting them to do than skill level. Which may seem simple but with all the options and catagories it can be a easy rookie mistake.

They need to improve having more people for your endgame. Also would love a helicopter pad with a HH60 flying in randomly would just be amazing!  (i mean if we have a wishlist why not have a helicopter amirite?) A tooltip when you hover over rooms in certain game modes would be nice as i saw someone else mention and edgescrolling)

I hear theres a tutorial, and I definitely recommend taking that, I had no idea the game was so complex and jumped right into Sandbox mode, and spent a good few hours messing up and restarting until I got a hang of the game. This was actually fun rather than frustrating, surprisingly. The game is super in depth but it appears you can play it how you want, either incredibly small and simple, or big and complicated. I haven't touched anything beyond Emergency, Radiology, and basic hospitalization yet but there appear to be many layers to the game, and a whole lot of departments to treat your patients in.

There are a few reviews here complaining about the ""graphics"" but for me, this is an art style that I like. I personally have a VERY low end computer and it runs great, and looks great. I didn't buy this game for the graphics, I bought it for the in depth gameplay and the fun. If you're looking for graphics then I'd look elsewhere, the games about a little more than that for me, people with higher end machines may want something that looks breathtaking, but again, this art style works extremely well for the type of game it is. 

There's a couple of bugs I've run into, one which required a reload of the game, and that was a patient card getting stuck on the screen and refusing to go away, another was a patient saying they couldn't be treated when they could. Aside from that I haven't noticed anything detrimental yet (touch wood), and while I might run into some frustrating bugs, I also know its been out for maybe a week, a little more? I'm not sure but basis of this is...its new. Be patient.

Devs seem to be working on adding things to the game and I don't feel like its ""Early access"" like some reviews have suggested here. I'm only 9 hours in though so maybe my opinion will change later on but right now I love the things I can do, and the ways I can do them, and am enjoying my experience. I think sometimes as gamers when we get a new game, and we have access to reviews, and in general, we're really quick to critique and accuse a few features, or lack of, as being unworthy of the money we've spent. 

Now a couple of bad things...

You can't rotate the camera, and while I understand why that is, I'd also like the feature, things can get a little cluttered. It would be nice to be able to see the back of things, especially when building a hospital that has weird shaped buildings and the lines may not line up out of sight.

Maybe this is just my own designing deficiency but, when you build a room and it says ""Must be a minimum of x by x"" it seems like if you make the room the minimum size it tells you to, you can't fit everything in and then have to expand it. It would be nice to have the rooms state the actual size they need to be, but again this could just be my own deficiency and not an actual issue.

You learn a lot passively doing this, like what kind of tests to do (or not to do, why am I doing a blood test on a dude who obviously has cranial trauma???) and you send them where they need to go. Everything feels very hospital simmy™, everything takes time. You want to admit a guy to your ICU, get the docs up there to stabilise him, and then get him in for surgery to try and stop death? Its going to take a day or so. You can pick and choose the patients you want to monitor and treat, and the best thing is you dont have to chase em around, because you are notified when tests are done and need your input. Its awesome, and once you understand everything, it becomes addictive. Just know this going in as I wish I had: There are two parts to every department. The clinic, and the hospitalization. The clinic is where the tests are done, the hospitalization is where the hospital part comes in, with wards and surgical theatres. Play the tutorials, its a learning curve.

I've been looking forward to this game ever since it was first announced.
I'm loving the gameplay and the building aspect of the game and it is exactly what I was looking for in a hospital sim.

However the game is riddled with bugs involving patients and staff getting stuck due to how the game is coded.
I will still recommend it however since this is the only serious hospital sim in the market currently. But its a 4/5 for me due to the bugs.

Big issues:

1. When you click a patient, there needs to be some kind of visual indicators  showing which staff are working on tasks involving this patient or what is preventing them from doing so (highlight staff, show paths on the floor, red text on hover over etc.). It's very frustrating trying to figure out why treatments aren't happening. For example, it seems like you can staff a department but you might be missing a provider with a certain qualification which is preventing a treatment. Very frustrating to figure these things out when the popup keeps warning you that a patient is dying and the staff are browsing reddit in the break room.

2. Janky UI issues. For example, there is a list which shows all the people and rooms you need to open a department, but as soon as you click on the prefab build list, the requirement list dissappears. I have to take a screenshot and put it on my other monitor lol. It's not as bad as Airport CEO (this ui actually looks nice), but there's so many issues.

3. Camera rotation. It's a big problem in this game because, unlike most games where the people are huge compared to the environment, the people are scaled realistically in this game and there's tons of clutter in the rooms (a good thing), but it means people and items can be very hard to see.

4. And a real campaign is desperately needed imo. There's three tutorials and only three campaign missions. The third tutorial is a mess as most everyone has mentioned and there really needs to be a real campaign.

But I'm still really glad they made this. Much better than Two-Point if you want an actual hospital sim.

[edit] Another major issue: When you manually admit people (or your staff does) they should immediatly get a bed. Right now, if you get an outpatient walk-in in, say, internal medicine and they present with critical bleeding, you can admit them to a trauma bay in the ER. However, the game sends them to the ER waiting room where they have to wait their turn until they collapse on the floor. lol.",1541214131,1541287781,True,14,0,0.61993640661239624,0,True,False,False

I suggest the following:

Allowing clinical staff to have rotations to check patients in the wards/ICU to help the doctors thier
Allow to hire more staff in the hospital as their are very few staff 
Allow department to share labs/equipment etc to make it more efficient
allow to hire more medical staff and to recieve more patients as well as have babies/delivery section
allow to adjust pricing and open more hospitals 
allow to prioritize a patient care

Pros:
+ Deep gameplay
+ Micro and Macro management
+ Beatiful 2d designs
+ Easy to learn, hard to master
+ Good sound effects and OST
+ True sandbox mode
+ Lots of departments
+ Employee profiles matter

Cons:
- A few minor design flaws (in object placement mainly)
- A few minor bugs (some stuttering, and some FPS drops when hospital is too big)
- Campaign is not so muchs attractive
- Still room for improvement, more content can be added.

If you liked games like Prison Architect or Project Highrise, you absolutely have to try this game.

Actual Review:

I purchased this game on release day. I did the tutorials, which explain the basis of the game in about 1 hour, and you can go straight on to the sandbox mode, so i leaved it there. In the next evening, after dinner, i said, lets play a bit the sandbox mode, and wow, the time just flew away. I spend 4 hours non stop, and i felt like it was just a minutes ago i started playing. This is sign of a good management game.

I played a lot of management games, of all kinds, and i must say, this game is one of the greatest i seen. There is still some improvements needed, but for a release game, its so good. We should remember that management games usually have lots of updates post release (see for example prison architect).

So many people are undecided between this and 2 point hospital. I did not play 2ph, but i can say, for what i've seen in videos, that 2 point hospital is more for a casual player, who only wants a fun game to spend a coulpe of hours.

The main difference is that in project hospital there is always something to do to your hospital. You can always optimize, its hard to get a good valuation. Your personal skills matters. For instance: i have build a small hospital, i only have a few beds for hospitalitzation, and 3 departments (emergency, radiology and basic surgery), and because of that, i hired a few cheap employees just to let my good doctors have less work to do, and what i find is that sometimes i have to help myself the less skilled doctors in the diagnosis. 

And this is the magic of the game: you have plenty of options, both micromanagement and macromanagement, and it's so, so deep. 

For example, you have to be careful when selecting your employees, they have perks, and hidden perks that can made them more hard workers, more dirty, or cleaner, etc. Everything matters!

The Pros:
In-depth without being a chore.  I don't understand what people say about ""needing a degree"" to play this game.  I'm a delivery driver and I'm running a hospital without too many questions.
You can pick any and as many patients as you want to ""take control"" of their examinations and treatment.  Best thing to do if you're not expanding the hospital or working on something else.
When in sandbox mode, once you're up and running, the hospital will basically run itself without much needed from the player, which is good so the player can focus on observing operations of the hospital and finding ways to improve it.

The Cons:
When it comes time to renovate, rebuild, or move a department?  Your best bet is to bulldoze and rebuild and eat the costs.  Moving individual objects is paintful for a variety of reasons.  If an object needs access to it from an adjacent square, it will not permit you to place the object at all.  If the object needs to be placed on a table? Find a table, an empty one.  I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but it gets really tedious really fast.

That being said about the cons, that's really my ONLY complaint so far.  I would give this game a solid 8/10 as of today, nine hours in.",1541144615,1541144615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As it is, though, it absolutely doesn't require these things to be worth the money. I'm having a ton of fun with it. Here's a quick and dirty of my pros and cons:

PROS:
- The scales of gameplay work well together. You get to manage the macro, buying equipment and hiring staff, keeping the cashflow positive. You can also manage the mid-level, working hard to make sure every patient and staff member stays good and happy, if that's your biggest concern. Then if you want..
- You can take over control of any patient's case, and this deserved its own ""pro"" entry. The micro level of gameplay involves following your doctor(s) as they question the patient, then narrowing down the possibile diagnoses with various tests of your choosing (depending on the facilities you have available), and finally choosing a diagnosis and treatments. It's really intense when you're doing this with emergency cases, and you can also manage long-term patient care this way.
- The ability to go as big and complex or as small and humble as you want. You could legitimately sandbox for days with just as small general practitioner's clinic and that'd be perfectly fun.
- Doctors and patients both feel like people. Everyone has their own traits that influence their work or how easy or difficult it is to diagnose them, and they all have their own tracks for needs that affect their happiness and performance.
- Lovely aesthetic, reminiscent of the isometric style Xenonauts uses which I also appreciated. It's light on your hardware while still looking nice on the eyes.
- Sounds are nice. Good bit of realism in the ambiance when all the sounds fit the function that's being performed, and the game does a good job of keeping things from getting to ""audio-hectic"" even when there's a lot going on, which helps sell me on the fact that I am in fact in a medical facility.
- So far, everything I expected to be in the game is there, plus some more. That's always a pro in my book.

CONS:
- Could stand to have camera rotation. It's possible it does and I just haven't found it yet, mind.
- Would like one more step of inward zoom, but that's just a personal preference.
- A bit limited on the visual diversity front. I don't mean racial or anything, just the selection of hairs, clothing and facial hair that patients are generated with. The name generator pool is a bit small too, but you're also free to hand-edit the name of any patient or staff member which somewhat offsets that.
- It appears favorited patients are no longer under player control. I'd prefer it if I could favorite a patient and also have personal control over their treatment. (This is another one I may be seeing wrong, however.)
- Moving objects with stuff on them is fiddly. You have to buy a surface to set the thing on, move the original surface, then move the object back to the original surface and delete the temporary surface.

WISHLIST:
- Treatment variety expansion. Dentistry? Baby deliveries and infant care? Children as patients? Veterinarian expansion?! Who else wants to treat a horse in a full-feature hospital?
- Mod support, largely so the community can tweak visual things, add some more variety to patient names and such, or add diagnoses (granted, there are already a TON).
- The ability to purchase land to expand over time, rather than being locked into a specific map size.",1541106249,1541106249,True,28,0,0.713278055191040039,0,True,False,False

Project Hospital captivated me right from the beginning after seeing some of the preview videos popping up on Youtube.
I knew I had to get my hands on it to try and design my own efficient clinic - soon to be an hospital upon expansion.
I immediately began analyzing the workflow and all the different possibilities within the game [as previewed at the time, in its early stages], just so I could best figure out how to properly optimize the composition and distribution of rooms, so as to properly manage their dimensions and spacings, given that I really enjoy the strategic element in these type of games.
 
Comparing it to Theme Hospital (or its modern iteration, Two Point Hospital) is inevitable, but it's clear that Project Hospital takes it in whole nother direction by getting rid of all the fantasy, humor and the surrealistic exaggeration that defined the classic tycoon game, replacing it with an emphasis on realism and simulation instead, something that was much needed given the lack of realistic iterations. This means that the developers had to recreate a credible hospital setting, with real symptoms for real diseases, accurate hospital departments and a proper attention to detail, quite an ambitious goal, one that I thoroughly appreciate. I think they've done a fantastic job here, this'll be a fun, challenging and captivating game to play, one that I most definitely recommend for its great sandbox experience.

But one should not expect these two games to be similar save for their theme. PH has a very serious approach to hospital management while the other is more casual and funnier. Two different concepts that are both good but may not appeal to the same people.

I have not played TPH, instead waited for this one which I definitely recommend. 

The [b]About this game[/b] on the store page explains perfectly what this game is so let's jump to the pros and cons.

The management is very powerful. One department, say the general clinic, offers a lot in terms of management so running a big hospital with all the different department is a challenge which I have yet to face. 

There are a lot of info on different health issues which I like to believe are correct. Patients suffer from a lot of diseases. So far I have met mostly usual cases, broken bones, colds and the like but I believe later the game offers very complicated cases. 

It is nice to manage your staff and see them improve, arrive late with a hangover and missdiagnose a simple broken hand. One can rename a doctor and follow his career improvment in the hospital. Or one can fire said doctor. 

In terms of graphics, while everyone can praise Red Dead Redemption for its astonishing graphics, those of PH are simply a matter of taste. You like it or not. You mind or not. I think they are nice though and fits the theme of the game.

The soundtrack. There is not much soundtrack to speak of. I don't really mind either, this is not what I expect the game to be about. I play Dr. House's music in the background and it's enough.

My cons are mostly about the building aspect. I enjoy the many possibilities to build different buildings and such. But I think the building mode UI is a bit clunky and not very polished. Sometimes you want to click on a object and select another instead. It would also be nice to be able to select several objects that are linked together (say a desk with the PC and printer on it) and move it together. Or I missed how to do that.

------------

It's definitely a good game. It may not appeal to everyone though. It's a genre one likes or dislikes. But so far it holds on its promises very well. I'm sure it will ofer many hours of gameplay.

The management part of the game is well done, I'd say. You have to really scrutinize and methodically plan your hospital to ensure the most efficient and effective flow and treatment of all your patients. The game goes as far as to introduce other aspects that play behind the scenes, like how your employees have traits that can both negatively and positively impact the flow and functions of your hospital or clinic as well as the patients that come through. The amount of detail that the developers put into the various room designs that are possibile are amazing; There are so many different walls, floors, and types of furniture to pick from to decorate and design every individual room. The actions your medical staff carry out are also well detailed ranging from surgery to basic diagnosis. Although the game is super well made, there are so major issues that do affect the game play. I have noticed there is no eye dropper button or copy and paste button for the rooms and furniture. If they added these to the game, I think it would make building the hospital a bit quicker and more efficient. Also, we really need an undo button and a rework on the placement of items. If you misplace a room, you have to one by one destroy the room and then replace it. For the furniture, there is a weird issue that I cannot delete or move certain objects before I do so to another. Below is my simplified list of what I really liked and disliked.

Pro
+ Great detail in room design
+ Encourages a lot of critical thinking for managing and building the hospital
+ Tons of opportunites for growth and expansion
+ Animation of medical staff carrying out observations is fun to watch
+ Immersive in how a hospital must operate
+ Fun to watch your hospital come alive

[list]
[*]Nice graphics with a cartoony setting
[*]You get the chance to diagnose a patient yourself which makes for a fun minigame in which you're really analyzing the sitauation. There are so many diseases! 
[*]The sound design is well done. What struck me as particulary funny is that when you exit the game you hear a heart monitor failing.
[*]There are so many customization options for each room and department. Sometimes I felt like I was playing The Sims!
[*]You can build multiple floors.

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]There is no ""story"" and the campaign is only 6 maps (of which 3 are tutorial maps). There are 6 other challenges and 12 sandbox maps, however it felt a bit lacking.
[*]You cannot turn the camera. Not a huge problem but it presents another odd situation: walls only have ""1 side"". That means if you build a toilet next to an operation room, they share one and the same wall. Since you only see one it's not a problem, but it's more that you [i]know[/i] one wall in the operation room has a toilet wall... 
[/list]

[b]Project Hospital or Two-Point Hospital?[/b]
In a short period of time two hospital themed strategies came out in the form of Project Hospital and Two-Point Hospital. They are very much alike, however if you are looking for a pure nostalgic callback to Theme Hospital with a modern look, go for Two-Point. It has the same style and humour, and a better campaign. If you are looking for a bit more serious game with more depth and options, pick Project Hospital. A small benefit is that Project Hospital costs quite a bit less than Two-Point Hospital right now (about 30% cheaper)!

I didn't get far enough to find many other major issues as I refunded the game, it just doesn't feel finished or worth $25 at this time and needs some adjustments to be a great game.",1540984998,1540984998,False,16,4,0.509070158004760742,0,True,False,False

Doubtful about purchasing this or Two Point Hospital, I have to say that:
- Project Hospital costs less (about 22€ versus 31€, both on sale);
- Project Hospital is heavily micro-management focused, whereas TPO is more casual-players oriented;
- Project Hospital represents a more serious intake on hospital world, and better represents its procedures and challenges;
- Two Point Hospital has a better artworks (graphics + audio);
- Two Points Hospital has got more rooms to build;
- Two Points Hospital can be more funny, because it's very cartoonish (I prefer a more serious approach, because of the delicate arguments being treated);
- Both have a Sandbox mode, but Two Point Hospital was more Campaign-oriented and got Sandbox mode only days ago, so it has more campaign scenarios;
- Both hasn't got Multiplayer (and it's better so, damn!).

Project Hospital isn't an Early Access title. This can be a good news - people can't complain about devs fleeing in Bermudas with their money - but also a bad news, because devs could left the boat after delivering the shipment, if you know what I mean.
Actually, only two things drives me mad:
1) The impossibility of rotate the camera -> design a tight room on a 64x64 hospital can be a real pain;
2) Audio compartment -> I must shoot the Volume level of my speaker to the stars in order to hear a [not so pleasant] babbling of medical staff and patients, that seems recorded with a laptop mic or something; and the music is almost not existant, but I can bear that.

***
For the devs, if they're reading: I heartly suggest, even if this game is very good, to drop the price in a 15-20 bucks range, at least when it's on sale!

The Graphics are fairly detailed around the building but strangely childish when it comes to the peoples faces on their cards, like the style of people in a pre-schoolers reading book. Strange art choice in my opinion for a ""serious"" sim but I guess you get used to it. Hopefully mods can change up the peoples icons to remove this odd choice.
 From what ive played, this seems solid with plenty of depth and actual management which requires considering multiple things with every choice (not the simpletons ""Is this by a radiator? then its ok"" level). Hopefully there are mods which address the graphic stlye soon.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the game is that there is lots of options for Sandbox.  Small, medium or big empty yard.
Small medium or big Hospitals, already functional Hospitals/Clinics. The choice is yours. 

The music has a great ability to remind you that you are in an hospital. Beating hearts and Beeping hospital machine noise incorporated
in it, its just great music. I noticed the menu music changed to a more calm one after you start the game and I also noticed right away that you cannot rotate the camera. 
Not a big deal since you can remove everything in your view, like The Sims, you can chose 3 type of view ( Complete, Half wall, Nothing), but it would have be nice to have the option.
There is quite a bit of options in it to tailor the game to your taste such as Notifications you want to see, and size of UI. Blood on/off.  No keybinding as far as I know.

So I started Sandbox mode right away as I usually do not care for Campaigns in these types of games. The first thing I realized is that I do not understand
anything and I should probably play the Campaign as its most likely a tutorial type. 

Ah, indeed, I open Campaign and I am faced with yet, more decisions : Tutorial 1/2/3 and Campaign 1/2/3. Also have some challenges in there, 6 in total ranging from 
Emergency to Neurology. So of course I click on Tutorial 1. 

I enter the Tutorial and what is in front of me is a small clinic. I get a window explaining to me what to do. The details...THE DETAILS. They are all there. I wouldnt even
be surprise if there is a way to find out what the patient ate the day before.  So the tutorial tells me to do a Skin Allergy test and I do so. Again, the details... THE DETAILS,
are all there. The Doctors tells the patient to wait in another room. Eventually, the doctor arrives. Goes into her desk to take tools, Take the client shirt off, starts to do the test,
clients whine a bit.  It is just so great. Never before have I seen such details in task in those type of games, and I am pleasantly surprised by this. I love it. 

We finally discover that my patient is possibly suffering from Hay Fever. We are then presented with a choice of multiple treament if we wish to do so. I can order her to rest, to have Nasal drops,
or to put her on drugs. Of course, I am a bad Doctor who will prescribe drugs to everyone and make the world more chaotic, and so I chose to give her drugs. The game is now telling me that depending on
the success of the treatment, patient may or may not return later.

In-Game time seems good for treatment. It took us 45 minutes to give the next patient a X ray scan. ( You are able to fast forward, and Id say its about 3 seconds real-time per in-game minutes).
I am now task with doing everything on my own and treating 4 patients, as I am guessing, this is nearing the end of the tutorial 1.  I feel completely lost as the little helping windows isnt there
to tell me what to do anymore in this big world. (even though its just a small clinic ).  

Happy to find out there isnt another patient anywhere in sight so far, so this will leave me some time to look around.. My second patient ( the X ray one) went to the bathroom, and then came back to the waiting room.
Where I will prescribe her Drugs. As other patients starts arriving, I noticed one of them went to the doctor to complaint about her sympstom. This is when I noticed that whenever she tells the doctors about her symptoms,
a new symptoms appear in her info card. Wich is great. This makes its seems like real conversations are happening.

Well I could go on and on, but overall, I would recommend this game  and I barely played it. Will it be ridden with bugs later ? This I dont know, its just a first impression review.
