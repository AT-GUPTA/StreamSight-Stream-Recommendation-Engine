Seriously HOW DID THIS GO TROUGH 16 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT AND QUALITY CONTROL AND THE DEVELOPERS SAID:
""yes its finished and the last version.""
Like it's so bad the gameplay changes don't even matter anymore.
It's the most unpredictable game that runs on the Source engine I ever owned ,sudden main menu background changes, crashes for no valid reason,not launching and my favorite,crashing at specific parts of the game and developers refusing to fix it.

This dev team did a fabulous job of remastering arguably one of the greatest FPS single-player story games of all time. Lots of detail and care went into this game, and it showed. It dragged me back into my 10-year-old self playing the game for the first time. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug! Anyone who has never played the original Half-Life before should consider this game; it's definitely worth it for the ~12-13 hours it will likely take you to beat it the first time.

My first playthrough was great, but then I decided to go back and get the achievements I missed in another playthrough. Boy, was that a mistake. Possibly two of the most annoying achievements I have ever seen in a game; pretty much carrying two items to the very end of the game sounds easy, but those items were very buggy.

Black mesa is a step up from Half-Life in almost every way possible, but particularly fixing a lot of confusing level design and pacing issues the original Half-Life has, particularly with the new XEN, which even as a person that liked the original XEN, I must say that this one is much better designed, although I prefer the aesthetics of the original one, and do think that this new version is a bit too long.
I though that Black Mesa was going to be just ""Half-Life but it's actually Half-Life 2."", but it's a lot more than that. Even my fear of it being a bit too stale without the Bhop that HL1 had quickly disappeared as I discovered that this game has a really fun ""slide"" mechanic, which basically allows you to conserve a lot of speed if you crouch after jumping.

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Like the original, it‚Äôs a fun, linear first-person-shooter full of scripted events that make the world feel alive. The best parts of the original game are still here.
+Greatly improved graphics, textures, models, sound, music, and physics.
+The Xen chapters are beautiful and the gameplay in Xen has been improved a lot over the original game.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-Just like the original, there‚Äôs not much story and Gordon is a silent protagonist. Dialogue with other characters is few and far between.
-There‚Äôs so many locked doors and blocked exits, with typically a single path through the entire game.
-New to Black Mesa are the achievements, which are a mixed bag. A lot of them aren‚Äôt close to anything you would call an achievement.

[b]The Ugly:[/b]
---There‚Äôs a game breaking bug involving a puzzle in Xen that still exists years after the game‚Äôs release. I didn‚Äôt realize I had triggered the bug until I spent more than twenty minutes trying to solve the puzzle to no avail. I gave up and went online to find the puzzle‚Äôs solution, only to discover the puzzle was bugged and I had to start it all over again. Good thing it autosaves before the puzzle!

I appreciate the remaster of this classic game but cannot recommend except for the most die hard fan or new player. It lacks that Valve polish and clearly missed on playtesting/QA. No fault of the devs, them being fantastic modders and very skilled artists, but the kinks show. Again, I do not fault the devs. I praise them immensely for accomplishing this difficult feat. They definitely did better at creating Half-Life: Source than Valve. I am glad this exists! Still... Play the original first and if you like the original, or are a diehard fan of Half-Life, ONLY THEN try this one. 

tl;dr If there was a neutral option, I'd give it that. Else, it's a 5/10.

To be most specific, it irks me that it plays more like an arena shooter similar to Quake or Doom than the original which was unique in its own gameplay. I mean, from it spawned HL2, TF2, CS, Portal, and more. All of which are mods that find their root in the gameplay of Half-Life. It's hard to explain unless you play it and experience it. It's not quite Halo, definitely not Doom, and not CoD. It's.... well... Half-Life. It's its own genre with its own shooter mechanics. It's a sandbox puzzle platformer shooter with hitscan. Sounds weird when you try to break it down, right? The original is forever perfect. Play the original. Then play this. But, I suggest that you do not play or buy this without having tried the original. 

Lest you experience soft locks (like being trapped in an elevator shaft with no way to exit it) and bugs (like the hitscan boxes being off). 

At the very least download the mods that patch the issues!!!

This is only MY individual opinion!


p.s. I am not a Half-Life fan. I did not grow up with the games. My first HL game was HL2, or particularly TF2 and CS. Heck I only liked HL2 for the story. I am a Halo fan. I say this an an attempt to argue my lack of bias, objective observation, and respect for the Half-Life franchise and its gameplay.

Gameplay is just what you expect from a Half-Life Game, quite fun and not too hardcore.

Xen imo is the weakest part, despite how amazing it looks, the maps feel too long and extra puzzles felt too stretched.

A few bugs were encountered by me during my playthrough, but they aren't too gamebreaking. However if you are going for the Hat or Pizza achievements, you most certainly might feel genuine rage during your playthrough, the game wasn't propely tested for these purposes and throughout the game, carrying the props with you just wasn't given enough thought by the developers, therefore props will get stuck in invisible barriers, get lost in unclipped map brushes, and sometimes refuse to stay in your hands during some game sequences.

There's a lot of little things here I personally dislike, the enemy AI, especially the soldiers seems neutered, the weapons also feel a lot worse compared to the original game somehow. The new additions to the weapon roster are actually very nice in contrast. Most of the music here is just pulled straight from the original but re-recorded/re-arranged to mixed effect. Some of it sounds better, some of it sounds worse. 

The changes to the Xen level in particular I'm very conflicted with. There's good ideas there as well as some very tightly designed, engaging sections, but it meanders too much. There was no need to make Xen nearly as long as the ""rest of the game"" so to speak in my opinion. The puzzles added in these sections would be acceptable if they weren't repeated nearly ad-nauseum 3-4 times in any given level. The final boss is a straight upgrade from the original and deserves praise.

10 years of development, we waited at a standstill almost a decade ago when it was announced.
The source engine this game is run on is beyond dated. When Half Life was first released, at the date it was put out, it had set a standard for gaming that words can not describe. 
I've followed the Black Mesa team for nearly a decade. 
Where Half life had set a standard and made a name for itself within the gaming industry, with groundbreaking work and an engine to support it, 
Black mesa feels; lackluster. 
I played the preview back in the day upon it's original release. 10 years of development bottle necked by the original source engine. The game does not at all hold up to the newer standards. 
Yes, it's an independent mod, yes it's a low profile studio, but for the decade of development this game has been in, this feels beyong underwhelming from the original mod I played for free. 
If games like metro can release a free version of their updated game to their users; why can't black mesa do as well?
In regards to the source engine, i've seen children as young as 16 release garry mod gameplay that was more involved and better presented. I'm disheartened. It is half life, it is half life with better textures, but a decade of consistent development and this is what we get? Nothing blew me away. And in that regard, with an understanding of gaming development; I'd recommend the original over a medipocre game released with competitive titles in the era matched with it's release date. This game is a retexture, while certain components are critically changed mechanically for the playthrough, nothing about this screams modern, nor updated. This sucks, this is disheartening. If you're looking to experience the series as a gamer who has seen the way gaming has changed between the 1990's to late 2020's, this game is disappointing.",1708633202,1708633202,False,0,0,0.433070838451385498,0,True,False,False

The combat is like HL2 on crack, with the variety of HL1, enemies are faster and more aggressive, this compliments the Sprint taken from HL2 and makes the fights more fast paced and react based, BUT with less planning and THINKing! Some enemies like Vortigaunts, Alien Grunts and Controllers can dash and dodge to make you miss shots, the Alien Grunts can charge you, the Controllers can actually control aliens and objects, WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE HOUNDEYE SOUNDS!? The Human Grunts use tactics that will really hurt you if you are slow or don't pay attention, flanking you, throwing grenades if you hide for too long, rushing you if you come close or are near death; sometimes with sound cues and warnings so it doesn't come too unexpectedly, maybe they are TOO coordinated, more than the Combine hive mind it seems. These mechanics makes for some intense fights and encounters. But still, the AI will sometimes get stuck for a second or alternatively it will kill you really easily because they can ATTACK WHILE MOVING now (something that in the original would be an integral part of the combat balance and tactics, if they attack, they can't move, and viceversa).
Strangely the barnacles don't die with one hit from the crowbar like in HL1 and HL2. Although is very easy and fun to throw a grenade into their sticky tongues thanks to the grenade coming from the middle of the screen, better than HL2 where it comes out at an angle making you miss sometimes.
Ammo capacity has been lowered, the first game gave you a lot to work with but here you can find more ammo if you take a moment to look for it. Still the Revolver, Crossbow and SMG Grenades are very limiting which is bad in my opinion.
Another annoying thing is that the Shotgun sometimes doesn't shoot instantly while reloading like the original game, or after a quick reset like HL2, this happens because of a realistic mechanic I think (Explanation in Comment), but it's annoying because the faster speed of the game doesn't match the slow reload, the same could apply to the Crossbow.
A few parts have been shortened or skipped, I think because the original's pace was a bit slow in some parts and to some people it was badly desingned, but it feels dissapointing that some sections you remember from the original game that you are expecting to come up are missing or never show up. C'mon is a remake don't take things out, improve them and add them!
Sometimes it's a bit hard to maneuver, you jump lower here like HL2, a few times I got stuck on some props or maybe there are some bumps on the walls that messed up some jumps or escapes.
Some puzzles are easier (even though they weren't hard in the original) and there are a bit too many plug puzzles (ESPECIALLY IN XEN), like the block the laser safety puzzle in Questionable Ethics is a plug puzzle now (you just need to unplug it lol), or the box pushing to get to a high ladder moment early in Office Complex is skipped (you can just climb it from the ground), although it would have been perfect for the Source Engine![spoiler]
The original Half-Life didn't give you a lot of ammo and enemies for the Tau Cannon and the Gluon Gun so players didn't get the chance to use these weapons that much, here in the longer Xen chapters the scientists teleport supplies to your location and later you will encounter green energy crystals that replenishes your uranium ammo giving you more time to fully explore these weapons, in the last parts of the chapters there are arenas filled with green crystals and enemies, and sometimes there are straight up endurance tests, when, coupled with the music, can make for an intense finale as you fight against the last lines of the alien army, although some sections are too tough and ridiculous.
The last boss Nihilanth is very different, the original game had him just shoot electric orbs and portals, but here, he can do all sorts of attacks, like sweeping lightning across the arena, airstrikes, big charged up shots, launching rocks at you, raising the floor trapping you, shooting walls of fire at a pattern. I think that there should be a mod that makes the fight look like a top-down shooter and it would look great. One thing I don't like is the lack of verticality, in the original fight it felt like you were getting on his level when you jumped up to take a shot at his exposed weak point but here you stay exclusively on the ground, Really!?[/spoiler]

The graphics are fantastic, really impressive what the developers took from old and sometimes bare levels and reimagined them to be fully furnished and detailed locations with realistic lighting. Obviously the Source engine is a bit rough now but they still manage to squeeze it and make the levels breathtaking (at the cost of FPS). Some models are very detailed but some look a bit out of place sometimes, a few models have cheap reflections and lighting or look weird through glass, the Human Grunts and Aliens look very good, the guards and scientists are sometimes off, like when they're standing still, their arms go a little through their bodies, the scientist bodies sometimes seem a bit bulky and the guard's arms skinny, sometimes their face can have weird shadows or their clothes don't react well to specific lightning, the worst is unfortunately Kleiner, sometimes his face looks terrifying with some shadows making him look like he has lumps all over.
The animations could use some work now, specifically the friendly NPC's, sometimes too stiff or jumpy, other times they clip a little though themselves.
The lighting looks pretty realistic, a few times the game was a bit too dark for me, ironically the first half of Power Up is such a good idea that it makes the original's chapter feel like it lacks something in retrospect. The flashlight is a bit too wobbly with the shadows that it casts when you move around and sometimes if you crouch through some rubble or walk near boxes it blocks the light.[spoiler]
Surface Tension is wonderful, longer, full of detail and with beautiful graphics. The setpieces are gonna leave you in awe as the war between you, the Marines and the Xen creatures look intense accordingly, it shows more the power of the Xen forces and it explains better the retreat of the Marines from the base.
The Xen Chapters show off the creativity of the team behind this game, there is new flora and fauna, new gameplay additions, but the length is a bit too much, this feels like you are visiting a new world with different ecosystems and life, but the point of Xen was a quick mission in a small nexus world (although it felt like you were teleporting around randomly), even Gearbox understood this!
You start far in the outdoors natural areas, then to human scientist camps, to alien villages and then to the controlling factories, it's a good progression, but some parts inbetween feel like filler. The scientists teleport supplies to you making them more concerned and useful, rather than them just sending you out and praying that you do it with all the ammo that you find is from dead science members like the original. I would have like to meet scientists in Xen, maybe to explain some things and to make you feel less lonely.[/spoiler]
The gore is a bit exaggerated, it's a little immersion breaking seeing that every time you use the shotgun's double barrel shot on something, it always loses all of its limbs and head leaving a nugget body all the time, or when using a mounted turret all the enemies instantly explode also, I think that should happen only to smaller enemies and when explosions happen, or use a less extreme or more sophisticated version.
Some gory momments from the original now use this system wich can look dissapointing, the worst is probably very early in the game, in Unforseen Consequences there's a guard that in the original gets cut in half by a laser, but here as soon as the laser touches him Bam! Nuggeted.

The gameplay is really smooth, and while I don't get some of the design choices of the team (like introducing a weapon after the ideal scenario for those weapons, like the Shotgun and the Offices), the overall experience is solid. I like the introduction of lore elements into gameplay, like the fights against controllers and vortigaunts (which was a minor detail mentioned in Half Life 2), and the inclusion of energy reloading in Xen. However, the AI seems dumber than the original, with enemies standing still doing almost nothing.

Xen got expanded to the point that is almost half of the entire game, and while I like the idea, it overstays its welcome. The first hour of that was Zelda's Magical Forest something something. What were they thinking? The good thing is that Xen is way more varied now than the original.

The music is a hit and miss. Contrary to the original, the music is more of an epic orchestra rather than rock/tech music. This change is very noticeable in Xen, and IMO it doesn't fit really well.

Overall it is a pretty solid game, it exploits almost all of the Source engine capabilities and looks almost as good (and taxing) as modern games.",1708447858,1708447858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics look great, I think the music bangs, the game felt good back in the day and it feels great now. No complaints with the core game. 

Small Problems: Tiny graphical issues with a couple plants in Xen (there were a couple pixel-wide lines that just jutted off of some plants, seemingly randomly).
Collision issues with some models in Xen (A grate at the bottom of a drop-down didn't have collision, so when I crouched it looked like my head was on the floor)
The pacing of the music (excluding the final sections) felt off, music would play, reach the end of the song, then silence. No looping or ambient music sometimes. Bugged me a little. When they did play though, I loved them.

Spoil-ish warning: . . . . . The first half is the old Half-Life that we all played, just modern, the last half (Xen) felt like a whole new experience and I was all for it.

Nostalgia √© um servi√ßo de apelo espec√≠fico. quando seu servi√ßo tem como principal ponto a nostalgia voc√™ estabelece que ele ser√° melhor apreciado por uma determinada gera√ß√£o de clientes. Uma vez que a nostalgia s√≥ se materializa em rela√ß√£o ao passado, muito do que √© apresentado pode n√£o gerar interesse nas gera√ß√µes mais novas.

Half-Life foi lan√ßado em 1998 e, em sua releitura do g√™nero de tiro em primeira pessoa, se tornou eterno. Muitos atribuem a perenidade de Half-Life a CounterStrike. Mas n√£o, Half-Life tem em si uma base de gameplay e narrativa que funciona muito bem. Eu perdi as contas de quantas vezes zerei o primeiro jogo em speedruns ou fazendo uma revisita mais curiosa, brincando com os sistemas do jogo, procurando detalhes.

Em 1998 eu tinha 14 anos de idade e no fen√¥meno social que HalfLife gerou, a√≠ sim entra tamb√©m a coisa do Counter-Strike, indiscutivelmente teve parte na constru√ß√£o de quem sou hoje aos 40 em 2024. 

E por isso essa f√≥rmula de nostalgia funciona t√£o bem... voc√™ pode sempre jogar o original, mas Black Mesa oferece mais que uma revisita. Black Mesa traz uma leitura modernizada do primeiro jogo proporcionando um tom de nostalgia √∫nico. 

√â um jogo incr√≠vel que eu me arrependo muito de n√£o ter comprado antes... mas... talvez tenha comprado no momento certo.

-----------------------------------------------

agora que voc√™ j√° sabe que eu recomendo esse jogo com ou sem desconto, vamos a alguns fatores t√©cnicos.

 [h3] (+) Gr√°ficos: [/h3] A moderniza√ß√£o funciona muito bem dando ao jogo a ambientaliza√ß√£o atual de Half-Life 2... que j√° tem tamb√©m 20 ano. No geral a apresenta√ß√£o visual √© satisfat√≥ria, o jogo √© realmente lindo e a moderniza√ß√£o fez de XEN um ambiente muito mais interessante. Apesar da tecnologia j√° 'velha' os desenvolvedores fizeram um muito bom uso, dando √† releitura o tom de perenidade que o original tem. E isso √© n√£o √© f√°cil.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127496169

 [h3] (=) Mec√¢nica: [/h3] Basicamente, Black Mesa repete a mec√¢nica de Half-Life2, isso d√° pretexto para algumas modifica√ß√µes logo no in√≠cio do jogo, para que o jogador fa√ßa uso das fun√ß√µes f√≠sicas que s√£o dispon√≠veis em Half-Life2, permitindo que o jogador se defenda ainda que n√£o tenha pego o famoso p√© de cabra vermelho.

 [h3] (+ - ) Remasteriza√ß√£o: [/h3] O jogo usa muito da composi√ß√£o visual j√° caracter√≠stica de Half-Life2, n√£o h√° muita diferen√ßa at√© sua chegada em XEN. √â em XEN que voc√™ vai ver a maior parte do que foi adicionado pela CROWBAR COLECTIVE e tudo ficou realmente muito bem ambientalizado. Mas, como XEN √© a √°rea na qual os devs aparentemente tiveram mais liberdade criativa, esta tamb√©m acabou, para mim, muito mais longa do que deveria... especialmente INTERLOPER. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3133084227

As armas s√£o bem modeladas e correspondem √†s expectativas, os sons de algumas  delas foram modicados outras armas como a pistola 9mm t√™m sons mais pr√≥ximos do original. Nos monstros que j√° conhecemos n√£o h√° qualquer inova√ß√£o... inclusive os vortigaunts por algum motivo parecem super desinteressantes. H√° alguns monstros novos em XEN que tem apar√™ncia interessante que deixa claro que a equipe poderia ter feito melhor em rela√ß√£o aos vortigaunts e outros monstros cl√°ssicos.

Os inimigos humanos (HECU) n√£o mudam em quase nada na apar√™ncia. Em a√ß√£o, parecem menos espertos do que deveriam ser. Claro eles n√£o eram super espertos em 1998, mas corriam menos na dire√ß√£o de Gordon, mantendo dist√¢ncia e matendo o grupo coeso. 

Em Half Life2, 2004, combine soldiers tamb√©m n√£o eram muito espertos, mas o posicionamento e o formato do mapa faziam dos encontros com eles eventos muito mais tensos e interessantes. Em Black Mesa os militares apenas correm de um lado para o outro em uma mesma √°rea por um tempo antes de correr atirando em dire√ß√£o do jogador ou, em alguns casos, ignorar completamente o jogador. E em alguns cen√°rios h√° um posicionamento quase malicioso desses inimigos para compensar a falta de capacidade destes em reagir de acordo com as a√ß√µes do jogador.

Uma vez que a unica mobilidade que HECU apresentam √© correr em dire√ß√£o ao jogador, estrat√©gias como usar tripmines ou satchels charge se tormam quase cosm√©ticas... apenas para registrar achievments. 

Hitboxes e balan√ßo das armas tamb√©m s√£o antiquados, eu entendo um zumbi ter que levar at√© 2 tiros de 12 na cara para morrer... mas um tiro de 12 a queima roupa na cara de HECU soldiers quase nunca os mata de uma vez. Se esfor√ßar para marcar headshots com qualquer coisa que n√£o seja a magnum √© simplesmente in√∫til.. a menos que seja doido por achievments, a arma que o jogador mais vai usar √© a escopeta de modo que ele pode at√© esquecer que tem outras armas a sua disposi√ß√£o.

Voltando √† parte de XEN, o √∫ltimo inimigo funciona de modo diferente do original, sendo mais um BOSS tradicional que vai exigir muito tempo para ser destru√≠do. N√£o porqu√™ seja de qualquer modo complexo, mas porque √© excessivo mesmo.

Isso fez de uma parte que eu realmente gostava em Half Life 1998 algo mais frustrante do que divertido em alguns momentos.

 [h3] (+) WORKSHOP: [/h3] Assim como a comunidade  de moders do primeiro jogo sempre foi super criativa e produtiva, com BLACK MESA voc√™ tem acesso a itens de workshop incluindo mapas, releituras do jogo, modelos, sprites, tudo que voc√™ (se √© do meu tempo) procurava em BananaFPS h√° algumas d√©cadas.

 [h3] (+ -)Desempenho: [/h3] Aqui h√° um pequeno problema. Em alguns momentos espec√≠ficos do jogo (OFFICE COMPLEX, uma parte de SURFACE TENSION e INTERLOPER) h√° quedas brutais de FPS, especialmente quando voc√™ est√° para efrentar um grande grupo de soldados. N√£o h√° nada que justifique essas quedas e √© um problema j√° velho.

No geral, √© um excelente produto que traz consigo alguns poucos defeitos p√≥s lan√ßamentos, quem sabe tamb√©m um efeito da moderniza√ß√£o do t√≠tulo, mas ainda assim d√° aula de como remasterizar um jogo. Com uma competente reprodu√ß√£o visual e mec√¢nica do original e inova√ß√µes bem medidas e bem colocadas.

N√£o reinventa a roda, faz uma mais bonita.

While some ways the more hardcore fans will not be a huge fan from the changes that have been made, I believe it is a more than adequate re-imagining of a 25 year old game. While personally I have the belief that the original Half-Life is and will most likely always be the definitive way to play the game, I also understand that the modern audience may not have the same appreciation. 
As the game while stands a great test of time, it is still dated in some ways, and to me any exposure to Half-Life is good exposure, and Black Mesa is more than potent to get new fans onto the franchise.",1584128863,1708364770,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

The constant increase in scale of power, environment and enemies left me in awe, wonder, and sometimes even terror. More importantly, as the music escalates with these amazing setpiece battles where the fact that you're alive is miraculous, I began to think, who the fuck is this guy?? Which, it turned out, is exactly what I was supposed to ask. There's no difficulty slider, and this game is hard, so overcoming challenges felt insanely rewarding. This game basically pits you versus the world and the unknown and expects you to survive, and it is glorious. The pacing is largely great, weaving in slow exploration and exhilaratingly fast gunfights, although I think Lambda Core and Interloper could've been cut down some. Even while playing on lowest settings so my Steam Deck didn't explode, Black Mesa stands out as quite pretty. I can't say it performed perfectly, but shaky performance was better than not being able to play it, and the few major FPS drops I had were not in combat zones, so it was usually ok. Playing on controller was never a problem, although it's clear the game is tailored for mouse and keyboard, so if you can play on a PC you definitely should.

Penrolz's Note:
After playing for 8 hours, I regretted it and stopped playing because, first of all, when you start, it feels like average campaign gameplay; you do objectives and so on. However, after several chapters, the game feels like repeating itself, and besides the source engine's default entity system coming with the Hammer Editor, I see nothing more than architectural modeling in its maps. The game also broke my save file while nearly finishing Chapter: Surface Tension, and I lost all the progress there because my save was corrupted too and I couldn't load it, so I kept playing from chapter selection, which is the feature. Luckily, they added it and I played more, but I still saw the repetition, so I quit it. I was actually expecting more stable and clean progress since the game calls itself Half-Life Relive; however, Half-Life 1 is still a better choice if you have an old PC that can run it.",1708275085,1708275085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some notes: The Xen level stretches a bit and could have done without [i] at least [/i] one of the puzzles (as seems to be the consensus online).

Pros

The details and music are very well done especially if you enjoy late 90s early 00s music. 
Some parts have been reworked or shorted. Overall for pros there has been alot of quality of life improvements leaning more towards visuals & variety. Most of my issues could be fixed as they are just tweaks in AI or level design. 

Cons

Enemy AI is a little too erratic for me. 

- soldiers don't behave human and wave about in the open rather then take cover & flank

- They charge into close range even when they have ranged weapons \ attacks 

- Alien range attacks effect too large of an area & you often get no warning that feels unfair or cheap

Level \ game design 

- There is often no clear path to follow and you will often ask yourself where do I go now. I understand they 
  wanted realism but clear visual \ auditory paths are necessary to help the player . 

- Small gripe but I couldn't hit the snipers with the darts and had to use rockets - are they real models ?

- Feels like too much COD leaked into Half life. You might like it but I had issues as I'm not an FPS fan

Sound 

- The voice \ music \ ambience volume  fight against each other or too load \ quiet 

Overall 

It needs some tweaking & falls into some game design issues but for what it is a fan remake yes I'd recommend this game for ~¬£15

      Movement and shooting mechanics are great, making for satisfying gameplay, with parkour being somewhat clunky in some sequences.
   
      One thing that i cannot recommend is the Interloper chapter. Even on highest brightness i got lost several times because of how dark the areas were. Start of the chapter was good, the escape sequence outside the complex was great, but everything else sucked. 
      Terrible parkour parts, boring gameplay loop of shoot this red thing to open this thing or shoot this huge ugly thing to get rid of electricity, the worst enemy spawn with the worst enemy types in small areas. I would recommend just skipping this chapter completely. The only positive thing about this chapter was soundtrack at the final elevator battle.

      The rest of chapters are moving somewhere between good and awesome. I absolutely recommend Questionable Ethics, Surface Tension, Forget About Freeman and Xen. 

      And the last thing that i have to mention is soundtrack. Its a damn shame that i cant buy this soundtrack on steam. Every single track is awesome. Joel Nielsen did a fantastic job.

[strike]Half-Life[/strike] Black Mesa is as classic as you can get... Wait a minute...

Black Mesa is a fan made remake of Half-Life, and to be honest, it's my prefered way to experience this classic.
Everything that made Half-Life great makes Black Mesa great.

Black Mesa still has the base of Half-Life's methodology ""Run, Think, Shoot and Live"", but it is enchanced with thoughtfull changes to controls and movement. Weaker chapters have been improved upon with more tuned level design; weapon tweaks make the whole arsenal more appealing and already excelent setpieces and excelent sequences were improved upon - something I thought was nigh impossible.

The pacing of the campain is excelent, from one encounter to another encounter, the flow of everything is on par or sometimes greater than in Half-Life. Still escaping the failing facility through it's different sectors, finding survivors and discovering more and more about the facility; it's still all there and witnessing the fallout of our actions is still captivating.

And Xen chapters itself are impressive - they are no longer bad!
Reworked and completely redesigned into something new while retaining most of the beats the original had and conveying them better than ever. Beautiful alien enviorment with sparse interference of Black Mesa temp-facilities scattered here and there, that are joy to explore and retaining all the level design principles and knowledge that Half-Life is known for.
Problem of slowly depleeting resources in later chapters are absent thanks to frankly good move to make scientists from overworld sent you care packages, making them actually help you.
Interloper chapter has still little pacing issue, but it is not bad as it is penultimate chapter and it being longer feels like final stretch to reach finale, so that basically resolves itself.

I would still highly recommend playing the original HL before Black Mesa to appreciate video game history and what an amazing game it still is. But Black Mesa is better and absolutely amazing. A worthwhile play!",1708083702,1708083702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before getting to the post Xen chapters of this game I would've given this game a thumbs up, with minor gripes, like weirdly sticky ladders, grenade throwing which is somehow worse than the original half life, and the overly long and unending Surface Tension. 
But God, things that took 10 minutes in the original take 2 hours now. And yes I get it, it looks way better. But boy does it lose novelty fast.
Who wants to do platforming for an entire hour on Xen with barely any combat. 
Who wants the 10 minute battle with Gonarch to become an artificially scripted hour long slog where you just run.
If you thought that Black Mesa stretched Surface Tension too much, wait till you get to interloper. Unlike surface tension which gives you really good and rather difficult combat sections that force you to master the combat mechanics, in interloper, you get EXTREMELY TEDIOUS PLATFORMING.
And just like the other stretched out levels, this one is twice as long.
The original interloper also had platforming, but it also had challenging combat. But in this game? It's just tedious platforming that is absolutely unending.
WHY DO I NEED AN HOUR OF CONNECTING CIRCUITS THROUGHOUT THE FACTORY?
Why am I fixing the production line for alien slaves to proceed in the level?
I have not finished this game because interloper is just sheer pathetic boredom.
No amount of improved graphics justifies how pointless the post Xen sections of the game are.
They've truly managed to do the unthinkable, take the already criticised Xen levels of the game, and make it somehow unbearably worse.

EDIT -  I did finish the game, and the end of interloper did get better, but not by much. It has this repetitive pattern of introduce a new puzzle element, then make you do it again with a bit more complexity, then another with further complexity, and then a 3 part puzzle where you have to solve three of the same puzzle to proceed, it becomes such a repetitive pattern it's almost funny if it wasn't so boring.
What this game needs is an editor, who can trim the fat and just keep the good parts of the game, because the Xen parts of the game are needlessly long and boring.
One part I forgot to mention about the game, is that the Hound Dogs and Bullsquid have for whatever reason been made far more annoying than they were in the original and I have no idea why. 
The final boss fight against Nihilanth is actually pretty fun and exhilarating. G-man voice acting was an attempt for sure, not a whole lot good about it.

If I had to give this masterclass of a game any faults it would be that the progression can feel a bit weird sometimes. You'll often find yourself in a room that feels purposefully misleading, looking for vents or ladders or a button to push when the solution was actually just behind you the entire time back in the room you just came from.

Other than that, if you can stomach the occasional hiccup on your first play through, then this game is near perfection all around.

Also be forewarned that this game is not for the faint of heart. I'm usually not at all scared by horror games but the entirety of the final act in this game had me screaming like a girl pretty much the whole time. The fact that it can consistently get that reaction out of me should speak volumes on what you can expect to find when you get there.

There's also a lot of gore and violence and spooky elements in the game but at least the soundtrack hits hard.

I've never had the chance to play the original Half-Life. I've played everything else, including Alyx. With the Overwhelmingly Positive review average on Steam for this fan remake, I knew I had to try it out. I'm very glad I did, as it looks like this game has improved from its predecessor, and I enjoyed it a lot, but I'll say that unlike the majority, there's specific points that definitely irritated me throughout my experience. Here's everything I liked (or didn't) about Black Mesa:

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*] The story is what kept me on the edge here. I'm a big fan of the lore behind the Half-Life universe, and I think it's a franchise that excels with storytelling. Black Mesa is no different. I was on the edge of my seat during the whole game, even though I was already familiar with what was happening in the first entry, thanks to numerous YouTube videos and such. I was still extremely immersed from a narrative point of view during my playthrough.
[*] The gameplay is perfect. If you enjoyed the simplicity yet the punch behind your arsenal in any Half-Life title, this game does it even better. You feel like a superhero, yet the slightest mistake or overstep can result in a punishing drain of health. The fluidity in your movement is still a big thing, and the puzzles are great (and have been mostly upgraded from the original, from what I've heard). The singular physics associated with Valve are even more polished while staying true to their roots. It's honestly a winning gameplay recipe that not a lot of games are able to reach.
[*] The AI feels great and has been improved. The enemies feel coordinated and can punish you for your mistakes (ex, reloading at an improper time). It made the fights even more thrilling. [/list]

[b] Neutrals [/b]
[list]
[*] The graphics have been upgraded, and they definitely retain Half-Life's aesthetic. Unfortunately, this remake has been in the making for so long (and they stuck with an old engine) that they do not reach the standards of realism from other games released in 2020, even Indie games as such. Nonetheless, that didn't matter to me. I was just glad it felt like I looking at another Half-Life title, even if the graphics aren't beautiful.
[*] On occasions, the game may stutter a bit. I didn't happen to me too often, but it happened most likely during key action packed moments, often resulting in losing a big chunk of health, or even death. I was playing on a high-end rig, definitely above the recommended settings, so I guess this is just a stability issue from the game. I also crashed once, for some reason, at a completely random moment during the Xen chapter. Stability could have been improved a bit, performances are great though (my FPS were nearly always maxed out with any drops aside from the ones caused by the stutters). [/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] The game's got decent level design for the most part, with sometimes a little annoying backtracking, until you reach Xen. The supposedly improved final segment is extremely annoying, dull, and feels tremendously stretched out. The mix of parkour, repetitive puzzles and never-ending invisible walls nearly made me drop the game. It's a shame since the rest of the game is so great compared to this specific part.
[*] To 100% this game, you'll need to a lot of runs with very specific demands. There's also tons of Easter Eggs nearly impossible to figure out on your own to get all the achievements. You'll definitely guides, blood, sweat and tears to unlock everything. If you're going for a normal run and don't care about achievements, you'll probably feel like the game drags on for a bit too long (maybe 2-3 hours more than required?) because of the last Xen segment I already mentioned. Be ready to face a more tedious part at some point before going in. [/list]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
If you like story-driven FPS, you'll like it. If you like the Half-Life franchise, you'll probably love it. But there's some downsides to it, and I feel like most of the reviews here tone those down. Just be aware of them before purchasing it. I feel like even with some major complaints, the pros overwhelm the cons and you'll end up having a great experience, thanks to the immersive story, the snappy gameplay, and the nostalgia brought by such an iconic franchise.

Many of the additions/changes bring the Half Life spirit to a modern FPS audience.

My short list of complaints include the last couple chapters drag on a little to long for my taste, the movement can sometimes be a bit floaty (this is especially irritating when you are trying to get somewhere quickly, i.e. Gargantuan run), and the 4+ achievements requiring the player to stop having fun and carry a stupid object through the entire game - clearly a nod to the Gnome achievement in HL2E2.

I don't feel like writing much more here but:
[i]There are two bugs that I encountered that I do (and in some cases don't) have fixes for:[/i]
- Crashing after getting sucked into one of the vents in [spoiler]interloper[/spoiler] (I think this is where it happens). To fix this one just load an older save and go into the vent like you normally would. This fixed it for me.
- Pause Menu / Menu UI artifacts. (I have no idea how to fix this one other than maybe going to old game ui, is more annoying than anything and I didn't end up going to the old one)

Black Mesa was a fun ride. Combat was above average, and taking out enemies felt great. The puzzles were mostly good, though a couple really stumped me for a while. Despite that, the game kept me interested, even though I'm not usually big on tricky puzzles.

And shoutout to the Black Mesa devs! Comparing the footage of the original Half-Life and Black Mesa, it felt like they really nailed it. Especially Xen ‚Äì it went from meh to breathtaking.

1) Visual Overhaul: Black Mesa‚Äôs graphics are a breath of fresh air. The Source engine brings the environments to life, and while some textures may show their age, the overall improvement is undeniable. The sterile halls of the Black Mesa Research Facility feel more lived-in, with environmental storytelling adding depth to the experience.

2) Gameplay Refinement: Combat in Black Mesa is smooth and satisfying. Gordon Freeman, clad in his iconic orange power suit, feels like an absolute beefcake tank when fully charged. The crowbar swings with manic speed, and the weapons retain their classic feel. Real physics enhances the immersion, even if they‚Äôre rarely used for puzzles or combat.

3) Liberties Taken: The development team wisely trimmed annoying segments from the original Half-Life and injected more of what works. NPC interactions, well-acted and peppered with in-jokes, add flavor. The game‚Äôs pacing feels tighter, making it a joy to revisit the interdimensional invasion.

4) Nostalgia with a Twist: Black Mesa evokes nostalgia while introducing fresh elements. The loading screens, though occasionally jarring, transport us back to the late '90s. The original music, while not always a perfect fit, finds its place on the alien homeworld of Xen.

5) A Triumph of Fan Passion: Over eight years in the making, Black Mesa stands as the most impressive fan game ever created. It‚Äôs not a 1:1 remake, but that‚Äôs part of its charm. It‚Äôs a lovingly crafted take on a pivotal moment in PC gaming history.

In summary, Black Mesa isn‚Äôt just a replacement for Half-Life; it coexists alongside it, offering a modernized journey through the Black Mesa Research Facility. So grab your crowbar, suit up, and relive the adventure! üöÄüî•",1707652915,1707652915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the greatest games. EVER. 
1. Visuals: The VFX are stunning, altough HL2 used source mainly for the water and some gun effects, Black Mesa absolutely milked every possible particle (and for good reason). A game like Half Life, which unlike HL2 is full of futuristic stuff like machines, gizmos and what not needs some great effects. Shaders are crazy, at some moments this looks like real life. Unreal Engine? Nuh uh, Source is the way.
2. SFX. These developer blokes are crazy, they found actors that sound EXACTLY like the original VAs. It's really weird when you first hear something thats 8-bit turned into crispy, crystal clear ear massage. Weapon sounds are great, and I enjoy the fact that they changed the sound on that Xen jumping pad thing.
3. Chapters: Before Xen, this game basically copied everything from Half Life and maybe made some places bigger (like the sattelite launch platform) and added a lot of teeny tiny details and secrets that would be impossible with GoldSRC. Now, Xen chapters... A lot of people HATE the fact that they made Xen, Gonarch's lair and Interloper 10 times longer, but I absolutely respect that. Xen has so much potential. A potential that was absolutely impossible in 1998. Now Xen looks absolutely staggering. I really love the fact that they turned Xen from a group of small floating islands to a bunch of huge floating islands. Most of the chapters seemed easier, including Lambda Core and even Nihilanth, which had beautiful visuals but didn't quite feel like a boss battle. Instead, Gonarch's lair which took me like 2 hours feels a lot harder. 
4. Gameplay: As I said, most chapters felt easier. I enjoy being able to G R A B objects, just like in HL2, but this time in a facility, full of laptops, computers, monitors, everything you can think of. One thing that was weird was that in Apprehension, you had to put some barrels under a bridge to make it float, just like in HL2. You also had to grab some cables and put them where you need to to divert electricity.
In conclusion, this is a bloody masterpiece. Half Life was already a masterpiece, but Black Mesa absolutely blows it away!",1707593434,1707593434,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Lamda core is when things get intriguing because is a transition to a new chapter for Gordon and the world, lamda core still gets you lost like the original, lamda core does a good job at the teleport sequence and looks visually appealing, its does a great job of making you feel prepared and ready for the next world into feeling anxious and curious as what lies beyond the portal, getting told those words ""it's ready you must go now"" sends chills every time. xen is perfect and replaces the OG xen with its beautiful,living world, black mesa make xen feel alive and looks like a ecosystem, the scenery is gorgeous, the music is 10/10, its not rough on your PC and all of this is achieved by the source engine, 15 years in the making was worth everything it also brings a new era. my only con with the black mesa remake is barney Calhoun he is not seen anywhere in the game except the tram start (you see him starting his journey knocking on a security door), in the original he is your companion/fighting buddy that owes you a beer. however all of this can resolved by immediately playing the black mesa blue shift mod in the workshop. the black mesa blue shift mod has the same remake styled feeling that modders put love into, its a love letter to half life fans. this mod should be released as dlc or own game to black mesa because if achieves everything black mesa did. check out the mod on the steam workshop its free and worth the install. 10/10 remakes",1688334177,1707589875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've enjoyed the game so much until the end. The Crowbar Collective have done an incredible job overall, Xen was also so good! But Interloper chapter + the final boss fight has definitely killed the game for me. The Interloper chapter was way too long and too tedious and simply not fun. They've improved the game by shortening the On a Rail chapter but then added Interloper which is much much worse.... After all that frustration completing Interloper, I was looking forward to face the Nihilanth, but the end boss fight was so over the top, the made the Nihilanth such a bullet sponge, it was simply ridiculous, I thought I was playing a completely other game... So, I still recommend playing this game, but do yourself a favour and don't let the balancing issues spoil your fun and go for the god mode if you need to get closure...

After so many years of development I totally understand them to want to finish the game but, with less content and less exaggeration, they could have made the ending match the rest of the game in terms of quality...

[Final Release Review]
Black Mesa became such a masterpiece. Grunt AI has really been drastically improved, and also all of the graphical glitches I've encountered in early access versions have been fixed. Oldschool (in a negative sense) and frustrating parts of some HL1 levels have been improved and modernised. All of it without losing even a tiny bit of HL1 vibes
This is a true love letter to the HL1! 
Well done Crowbar Collective, your longterm commitment has really paid off!

[Early Access Review]
Its an awesome remake of HL1 plus some more improvements. One can see that Crowbar Collective have put so much love in this game. Well done!
Graphics are really good, sound is also improved. Some NPC conversations are really hilarious!
I've encountered some glitches... In office complex, plants near a door started to move on its own, real curious stuff but well its not yet finished...
The only thing which annoyed me in this game was the AI. Something is really off with it. 
In both Half-Life 1 and 2 enemies are much more responsive. In Black Mesa, they sometimes just stand there and do nothing. Or don't come after you. (in normal difficulty)
I hope Crowbar Collective can fix it...",1515531208,1707524685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While playing the game I couldn't help but noticed lots of tiny details that make experience much better. It was clear to me because of the that developer put lots and lots hours of care, love and hard work. It was much more obvious when, after completing the game, I looked into some compression videos and found out for example how was redesign xen, all the boss fights, lots of single objects and details they had to add to make every single room more believable, more realistic and more live. I respect the original game but after so much time you should agree that there was not much to go off. 

Sound design is also great, lots of music turns out I was listening to remixes before knew about the game. Huge rework and redraw of all weapon, characters and locations, while trying to preserve the same feeling and same map as was before. 

For me as a guy who didn't play half-life games (just half-life 2 a little, and huge fan of portal played all games and mods) it was so fresh going around 
 without objective task, minimap, compass or arrow to next task. You always had to figure out yourself, but the clues is always there either it be a green light near the next door or path you should open or go, or red something blocking the way. Overall level design in my opinion was great and I caught myself on an that idea especially in the beginning to middle of the game. (except few minor moments but more on that later)

Crowbar collective did a tremendous work, especially for such a cheap price and this game imo was a great force to invest me into the half-life story.

The game is not all shine and rainbow, but hat's just a few minor hiccups that killed my love to the game a little bit, still game so good I can forget it easily.

[h3]Level design[/h3] 
As I said game does not always clearly indicate what you have to do.

Firstly there was door in the coolant tank 02 in Lambda core, where you have to find this little door bellow in the corner, I even get there but didn't saw that door was open neither consider it. 

[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/10uprc/question_about_coolant_tank_02_in_lambda_complex/]Reddit thread proofing I am not the only one having this issue[/url]
[url=https://youtu.be/opEXpTyewm4?t=656]Video with this in-game moment to get the idea[/url]

Second there was an explosive room while making portal in Xen with clever puzzle which I almost figured out but I neither saw nor consider that door in use too and was stuck not understanding why the force field didn't work.

[url=https://youtu.be/uUY8e5EugPA?t=834]Proof that some youtuber also stuck here[/url]

[h3]Technical issues[/h3]
Huge bummer for me was sometime corrupted saves in the beginning of the game, sometimes I just could load and have to use previous save instead of the last one. I didin't care much about it until it climaxed in the explosive room where for some reason every other save become unloadable before and after puzzle, so I have to load the exact level map through developer console. I skipped the part where you stabilize portal and jump into it (not the part fixing all three lasers), so it was not huge miss but it killed immersion for awhile.",1707475393,1707475540,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's a great remake and it's even more impressive when you consider it's a mod. It's probably the second best fan remake I've played (AM2R probably being the best). The game, however, makes a lot of changes from the original. Some are welcome. Some of the more tedious aspects of the game are made a bit more bearable, for instance. Some changes are odd. There's a lot of changes that seem to be made just for the sake of being different. A lot of areas are just different in a way that doesn't add or subtract anything. Some changes are outright terrible. Many areas and encounters have been significantly simplified. Puzzles are changed. Some are made way too easy, while others have just been made unintuitive. Xen goes on entirely too long and some of it is actually worse than the original (which is funny considering the original Xen was a rushed mesh). If it sounds like I'm being unfair, remember this mod costs money so I'm going to hold it to the standard of a paid game.

Still if you like FPS games or you just want more Half-Life this is a good option. The developer clearly put a lot of work into it and it's well worth the money, despite it not measuring up to the original. The big caveat is that the original Half-Life is just a better game in almost every way. You should probably play that before this one.

After getting an upgrade a good while later, something in the back of my mind kept drawing me back to this. Maybe it was the high acclaim, the promised source port that would give us ragdoll scientists or a combination of that and my love for the series

But there wasn't a Xen yet.

So I waited, checking in every so often, hoping to god they finally did what a lot of us hoped we'd find on the other side the first time we played - or even watched - the OG. No longer a woefully rushed video-gamey play area with mismatched textures

Then it finally dropped, and went on sale shortly after. I was on that like a c()ked-out cat on a laser dot

Yeah yeah, the Black Mesa facility itself is cool and a lot of the environments look much better and more realistic which immerses you more than the original ever could, in my opinion; but I just finished the thing and my bias is about to begin

It took a good while and even a long hiatus, but I finally got to see what I'd waited so long for, and I don't care how long it may take to get through, Xen is absolutely glorious. It truly feels like a living breathing ecosystem clinging to rocks in an endless void of stardust. 
Do the octo-dogs even wanna be there? 
Damned if I know, but the environmental design sells the concept so well that I can only describe it as inspired

I've been in so long that it feels like I was last in the Black Mesa facility a month ago, but I never minded once

I didn't realise just how good the Source engine could look when given to the right people, but I enjoyed every second of it and took an ungodly amount of screenshots. Bad habit but I'm justified this time. 
It almost felt like a completely different game at times but they did a fantastic job of keeping it grounded in the HL universe and the odd familiar site brought it back. (Trust me, they changed a lot, and for the better) 
I even stayed invested during some of the puzzles I bungled so many times. My fault, not theirs

The fight with the Gonarch felt a million times more thrilling and it truly felt like a titan you can only delay from fighting until the climactic confrontation in its lair. An *actual* lair that doesn't feel like a tiny room but a gosh damn cavern teeming with albino crab babies

Speaking of, the music elevates so many moments in this game that I'm in love with the original tracks for the memories they've helped create. Especially in Xen. *ESPECIALLY* in Xen.

Then Interloper started and explored the concept of Vortigaunt slavery better than the inference of the slave collars in the OG and not only shows you, but throws the thing in your face, and makes you feel satisfied when killing the Controllers, instead of relieved at killing the annoying floaty enemy

I detected a little inspiration from DOOM (2016) at this point, especially when first entering the place, and that's all good in my books. After five minutes they just made it their own thing. Makes you wonder just how big the Combine is if all of what you see in this chapter is a doomed last-stand

The climax feels awe-inspiring too, beating down those airborne fetuses with zero remorse and destroying everything that moves - machinery especially - and feeling yourself getting nearer and nearer to the particularly big fetus who was sending aliens all up in Black Mesa's business.
Good lord I spent an egregious amount of time tonight stuck on one of the final gauntlets. I had to be sure I didn't accidentally sunburn a vortigaunt with the Ghostbusters Proton Pack

The final fight itself is leagues above the original, feeling more like a fight for your life and everybody else who got zapped in hometown BM. I particularly liked the creative way they justify getting more ammo but like hell I'm spoiling something so insignificant

Then bam, I lasered a big baby in the cranium until God - or something - had enough of my overused jokes and [REDACTED, seriously play the game already. If you're even vaguely into FPS's and somehow find games before 2013 """"unplayable"""", then just jump into this and let it be your introduction. I won't judge]
 
Then asthma man told me to step out of a moving tram and I felt pretty good for getting through ceaseless genociding. Also by the time I was on the very last section of Interloper, I truly believe that Gordon Freeman must have severe PTSD by this point

No wonder he went mute after that

It [was] midnight but I feel compelled to profess my love for this and just how much it exceeded my expectations, Xen especially since more is better when a whole sci-fi concept or ten has a lot of gameplay and story potential

This is absolutely what a Half-Life retelling should be and I'm so glad I got to experience it.
Stack of Crowbars you are truly a bunch of pretty cool guys for getting this off ModDB and shaking off the usual high-concept, limited-execution stank to the point that it stands by itself as a worthy investment

10/10. I don't think I can come back to the original; my imagination isn't strong enough for that.
Will most likely play this again in a year tops

I tried the original game, but found it painful to play modern standards. I think this game is much, much better than the original if you're a modern gamer looking to experience the classic game in an updated package. 

That being said, if I were to judge this game on its own merits, not knowing that it's a remake of a classic, I wouldn't be impressed at all. There are rampant technical issues: save corruption, soft locks, weapons turning invisible, sound effects playing 5 seconds too late, your altered settings resetting themselves to default in the middle of a play session, and the list goes on and on. This is one of the most janky games I've played in a long time. 

The gameplay is also severely mediocre. It's better than trying to slog through the original, but that's not saying much. The game also over stays it's welcome by quite a bit. It should be half the length and even then, not much happens. Constantly waiting for the game to load the next level section also gets quite old. 

The only reason I finished this game was because I played Half-Life 2 as a kid and I was always curious what happened in the first game. Well now I know and the answer is a very generic bare bones story with mediocre gameplay. Half-Life 2 is orders of magnitudes better than this game. 

Overall, I can really only recommend this game if you are desperate to play through the HL 1 story line. In that case, this game is the best way to do it, but it's still not worth your money or your time in my opinion.",1707372326,1707372326,False,10,4,0.537598371505737305,0,True,False,False

[i]I forced my friend to play this with me watching. Sadly I'm unable to play these kind of games anymore due to a handicap. [/i] 

[h2]An absolute classic modernised [/h2]
When I think of classic FPS's, Half-Life is certainly one of them. Much slower paced than Doom and Quake, and in a true science fiction setting. The game starts quite ordinary, as if the real world. With the fantastic opening sequence into the Black Mesa facility. But, going back to old games can be tough. So when HL2 released, fans recreated HL1 in the new engine. I remember early in 201X I downloaded the game and the soundtrack from their website. I never got to playing it. Since Valve allowed fan-made HL games to be published on Steam, Black Mesa could come to Steam as well. 

Compared to the original a lot of artistic extrapolation is required. Most original levels are near empty, relying on sprites on walls. Many rooms are bigger and more furnished, because now we can. But, the game pushes the old engine beyond its ability many times. No matter what computer or settings you use, the game stutters at times. And this is a shame, seeing how beautiful everything is created. Maybe a future recreation? These type of games warrant faithful recreations forever, because a classic like this is gaming history!

Black Mesa
-------

The most fitting thing that I can call this fan-made remake of the original Half-Life game is ""an obvious labor of love."" Many years went into the development of Black Mesa, and it clearly shows in its presentation. The graphics are stunning, the voice acting is superb, the gameplay and combat are highly engaging, and the environments feel real and ""lived-in"". It's a fantastic entry point for players new to the Half-Life series, but those who have played the original HL1 should also be very pleased not only in how well the original environments have been re-designed and rendered (to the point where some feel like a big step up from the originals) but that Black Mesa includes a few surprises, including a couple of new enemies and environmental hazards as well as a completely revamped section of the game.

On the negative side of things, those who are considering purchasing this game do need to be aware of some bugginess with the physics engine, which can occasionally include things like ""teleporting"" NPCs and elevators that cause your body to explode when they move. Also, make sure to save often, as sometimes, you'll get saved into a bad situation like partially in a wall or right at the moment of death, and you may need to backtrack to an older save point. It's annoying, but for me, it didn't break the experience completely.

It's also worth mentioning, too, that some combat scenarios (especially when on the higher difficulty) can almost feel like mini-rage games sometimes, being incredibly brutal and overwhelming on occasion. With that said, I never felt frustrated while playing and instead felt encouraged to try a failed enemy encounter again but with different weapons and tactics.

To conclude, I told a friend before I wrote this review that, after I had finished Black Mesa, I felt like I had experienced an epic event more than like I had merely played a game. It's fun to play AND very cinematic and polished in presentation. I highly recommend this one, especially to Half-Life fans.",1706837774,1707217139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

	Developed by Crowbar Collective, Black Mesa is a re-creation of the original Half-Life in the source engine, announced way back in 2005. For the longest time, the game was nearly complete, but just lacking the last few chapters set on Xen. Being the final obstacle Gordon Freeman had to overcome in the original game.
	After fighting your way to the center of the Black Mesa base, you had to cross over to the borderworld, Xen, to kill the alien leader, the Nihilanth. The quality of these last few levels have been a point of contention ever since the game's original release in ‚Äò98. People were anxiously waiting for what it would look like in this remake.
	And after several years, it was released. And though I am very late to both Black Mesa, and the Half-Life franchise in general, these levels are millions of miles ahead of the original game, so that's what I want to spend this review talking about.  Whenever replaying the original game, I tend to stop playing after finishing Lambda Core, just because of how bad these levels actually are. 
	Xen in the original game felt very rushed. It had sloppy platforming, a huge difficulty spike out of nowhere, and unnecessarily dragged the game on for another few hours, when it really shouldn‚Äôt have. Even people who worked on the original Half-Life (Gabe Newell included) said that they weren't too happy with how Xen ended up in the retail product. This makes sense, as you only need to play it for about 5 minutes before you realize how sloppy it actually is.
	Starting off awkwardly long jumping from poorly-textured platform to the next, and if you missed a single one, you would either die, or suffer crippling fall damage. When researching, Crowbar Collective spent all this extra time on the worst parts of the original game, I didn‚Äôt have too much confidence. Somehow though, these guys managed to make the Xen chapters actually fun to play.
	First thing you notice once you actually land in Xen, is the visuals. And I‚Äôm going to be honest, this is the best the game has ever looked. The first area you get dropped into is simply amazing. There is also this really great ambient soundtrack that almost feels at odds with the chapter‚Äôs violent undertones.
	The music for the entire game was composed by a guy named Joel Nielson, whose work in the other chapters felt very hit or miss at times. Most of his stuff throughout the Xen chapters though, really seem to work well. They also somehow managed to mix things up pretty well also from area to area. 
	You will long jump across floating platforms, explore caves with basalt pillars, and there is often alien algae hanging from the ceiling or from massive stalactites. Combine it all with the gorgeous lighting and water effects, and you have yourself a pretty damn good-looking game. 
This comes at the expense of the performance though, and there are some spots where you can expect the game to chug along. 
	I think artistically, these new chapters are just fantastic. Can‚Äôt really fault the performance issues when it looks so good. Definitely different to the original levels, but I think that's for the best, as most of those levels were pretty unremarkable.  In what is a simple, but very effective change is the long jump module is now bound to tapping space bar twice, which makes way more sense then pressing crouch, and jump at the same time in the original game. 
	You will also be putting this mechanic to use, by either effortlessly leaping from platform to platform, or in combat, as it makes a pretty handy dodge move during boss fights. There is very little to actually complain about, with the exception of it looking a bit more aquatic than alien at times. Something I really like about these earlier stages is that it does a MUCH better job at establishing that Black Mesa had really explored this place before Gordon‚Äôs arrival, which is something they only kind of touched on in the original. 
	In Black Mesa, you will come across various camps and makeshift labs that help establish that the Lambda Team really set up shop here. As you get deeper into the levels, these outposts become fewer and farther between, emphasizing that at this point you really are in completely uncharted territory. 
	My only real complaint with these first few areas is the overusage of the Houndeyes. There were a few of these in the original game, but not THIS many. On top of that, there are also brand new variants. Including smaller ones that explode when killed, and a bigger armored kind as well. There is this one area, where you have to avoid a bunch of trip mines that make no sense lore wise. Why the hell are they even there?
	Still, these first few levels are pretty enjoyable and creative compared to the original game. Combining platforming, combat, and some basic puzzle solving. Moving things along at a nice pace and never feeling bogged down. First impressions are definitely the most important, and Xen is off to a good start on that front. 
	Up next is the boss fight against the Gonarch. Again, this whole area is very visually impressive. Maybe even more so than the first chapter. She won‚Äôt show up until you turn on these switches, but when she finally does in something of a cinematic, it plays out pretty similarly to the original game. By that I mean you need to hit her with every single one of your best weapons before she runs away. Something I like is that you have to actively use the long jump to avoid her projectiles. On hard mode, this first phase is an absolute challenge. Getting hit by her once or twice is back to the start of the phase, and you need to be a lot more cautious with how you approach things. 
	Like before, after you deal a bit of damage to her, she runs off and you go pursue after her. However in the original game, you got back to fighting her almost immediately causing the fight to go super quick. Only being about 10-15 minutes. In Black Mesa though, you play a lot of cat-and-mouse. This chapter alone tends to take about 30-45 minutes compared to the original.
	At the end, it plays out pretty similarly to the original game, just blasting her until she explodes. This whole chapter was decent. All the stuff in-between the Gonarch fight was definitely the highlight, as otherwise the whole confrontation would feel identical to the one in 1998. Interloper though, is where things start to fall apart.
	Interloper starts off as you move through some more alien-looking landscapes, fight through some rank cave systems, and then start getting chased by a few Gargantuas, where you really just need to haul ass out of there, and some points definitely had a sense of urgency and tension.
	Then you get to the factory, and that‚Äôs where it all goes to shit. Moving up all these never-ending conveyor belts, shutting down force-fields, and a bunch of really repetitive cable puzzles. This was also where I experienced the most bugs, and got so frustrated that I had to take a long break from it after completing just to get my head straight.
	Despite most people already knowing it, I don‚Äôt plan on spoiling the end boss, but I will say that they thankfully turned the whole thing around for the finale. The final boss has been tweaked slightly to be less tedious, which I appreciate. The low gravity is gone, so it doesn't feel like you are moving underwater, and the boss doesn't shoot the teleportation portals anymore. It also puts the long jump module to use strategically to dodge all the attacks that are used, and there is a definite charm in seeing the ending getting redone in the source engine. 
Black Mesa is a real ‚ÄúSum of its parts‚Äù kind of game. If you look at Xen by itself (which is what I‚Äôve been doing this entire time) It is very easy to nitpick things and find all of these faults, but in the grand scheme of things, the remake as a whole is phenomenal. Fixes pretty much all of the issues the original had. 4.5/5 Stars. Probably the closest a fan game will come to perfection.",1707010950,1707095736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Black Mesa is a 2020 first-person shooter game developed and published by Crowbar Collective. It is a third-party remake of Half-Life (1998) made in the Source game engine. Originally published as a free mod in September 2012, Black Mesa was approved for commercial release by Valve, the developers of Half-Life. You are Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist at the Black Mesa Research Facility. When a routine experiment goes horribly wrong, you must fight your way through an interdimensional alien invasion, and a bloodthirsty military clean-up crew in order to save the science team... and the world!

    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üíæGraphics[/td]
        [td]Black Mesa uses the Source Engine (same as Half Life 2, Counter Strike Source, etc) and I have to say that the game looks incredible. This is a remake of Half Life 1 and my goodness they nailed the visuals perfectly! The atmosphere is much darker than the Half Life 1 and it‚Äôs a needed change. The lighting is superb, the weapons and character models look incredible (especially on the Source Engine). Xen (the other world) had a complete overhaul and it looks 100x better than what it did in Half Life 1. The UI also looks modern and really good. Honestly this is a fantastic remake visually and I can't find one complaint in terms of graphics.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üéÆGameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is pretty good and quite similar to previous Half Life games. You have some creative platforming puzzles, good gunplay, many challenges, etc. You have some really cool weapons to use here, and the enemy redesign is fantastic. The level design is pretty similar, but you will see some drastic improvements in some areas. Black Mesa takes advantage of the Source Engine and gives many creative puzzles and the big bump in level design is incredible. The overall gameplay is a huge step up and It‚Äôs just hard to find a flaw here. Xen is completely overhauled. Many chapters feel different in Xen and I think they did a fantastic job. The final boss design looks really good and many sections before the final boss is truly challenging and a huge step up. In Half Life 1, Xeno was a complete chore to go through as it was both uninteresting, ugly, and has the more lousy level design in the game. Here it‚Äôs a completely different story, Xeno is fixed and it‚Äôs beautiful, filled with mystery, and even has some fun sections. Only one chapter called ‚ÄúInterloper‚Äù dragged a bit, but besides that Xeno is a near masterpiece improvement compared to Half Life 1. The only flaw in terms of gameplay is the Helicopter boss fight. The helicopter moves way too fast for the rockets at times. The Rockets move extremely slow and can be frustrated as h*ll.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üìúStory[/td]
        [td]The story is much better here. Has anything truly changed? Not really, but with the better dialogue and voice acting, it truly feels much more filled with life. You will see more cinematic scenes and overall give the characters a feeling of importance. I enjoyed the story a lot here, way more than the original. Maybe it‚Äôs the cinematic, maybe it‚Äôs the voice acting, but it just feels like a huge improvement in my opinion.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üïõPlaytime[/td]
        [td]The main story is around like 15+ hours. It‚Äôs a pretty good story mode (in terms of Length). You also have many mods in the Steam workshop that can add tons of replayability as well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üéßSound[/td]
        [td]I love the sound design. The music is so incredible! The soundtrack is really high quality and AAA material. The voice acting is a massive improvement compared to the original. The weapons sound good too. They are punchy and all sound unique from each other. The only problem I have is that there is no dialogue sound option in the audio settings. At times the voices can sound pretty low.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]‚ùóBugs‚ùó[/td]
        [td]I have not really experienced any bugs from my gameplay. Maybe some minor clipping issues but nothing really serious. The game felt pretty optimized in terms of bugs.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üîÖPerformance[/td]
        [td]Performance was pretty solid. I was playing on max settings and rarely had any issues. I had some rare fps drops (although minor) in Xeno during one section, but besides that it was really good. I did have some crashes when I changed many graphical options (this was not every time, but did happen).[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]üîóConclusion[/td]
        [td]This is the true Half Life experience! I may get flak for that, but I can‚Äôt find one section better in the original than this. Black Mesa is filled with passion and love. The creators really poured their hearts out in this game and it truly shows (I mean it got improved by Valve)! You have to give this a shot, especially if you love Sci Fi games![/td]

And then you reach Xen.

Absolutely mind-blowing experience. It takes the most uninteresting and boring chapters of the original and flips them into the absolute best. Xen looks GORGEOUS and feels like a completely different game (in a good way).

My only complaint is how annoying it is to get 100% achievements. Remember that funny gnome from HL2 Episode 2? Well here you've got not one, not two, but THREE different items you have to carry around across the WHOLE game, featuring a bunch of hair-pulling moments of ""How the hell do i take this item across this part??"" (especially when climbing ladders). Not to mention there's a ""Get Some Grub""-like achievement where the last thing you need ONLY appears if you took with you one of the previously mentioned items, just why???

My only minor gripe is the difficulty of the game. Perhaps its just because I've played this game multiple times, health and ammo packs are so plentiful, I'm confident that throughout my most recent playthrough I was above 75% health and had full ammo on all weapons nearly the entire game. Especially in the Xen chapters. The enemies certainly deal less damage and are less bullet spongy compared to the original.

But even so, this is an extraordinarily fun game, even to just fuck around with the friendly npc's. Highly recommend.

Completely fan-made, one wouldn‚Äôt always expect greatness from a title paying homage to another, but this game always first comes to mind when I talk with anyone about quality remakes of games.

Black Mesa is fantastic, solidly loyal to the original material of the first game while bringing in new elements, upgraded visuals and engaging gameplay. For those who haven‚Äôt played the original, you play as Gordon Freeman, scientist at a top secret underground laboratory in the desert. It starts off as a normal day, until a massive rift opens up and aliens start pouring through ‚Äì not the best start to the working day! The labs are quickly compromised, and you essentially work your way through the labs looking for a way to escape and saving as many colleagues as you can.

The game is an FPS with a subtle blend of action, horror and platforming with a few puzzle elements thrown in, and is pretty linear in its progression through Black Mesa. Segments of the game are clearly separated depending on what the objective is ‚Äì you‚Äôre met with dark atmospheres and tense echoing silence during horror sections, head nodding techno mixes during gunfights and science fiction synth as you take in sprawling new areas.

This games big moment for me, without spoiling anything, is when you get to the end of the labs. There‚Äôs a bit of a debate whether the new version of this section is better or not, but I personally think the remake did an incredible job reimagining this section of the game, though I will agree that a particular area of this dragged on a little too long (the conveyor belt section). That said, the parts leading up to that were so intensely atmospheric, engaging and otherworldly compared to the original, I can‚Äôt consider it a detriment to the game at all.

A must buy for any fan of Half Life or story-driven FPS games in general, and an absolute steal during sales. I think I purchased for around $5 which is insane value for money!

[b]Pros:[/b]
A remake so good, that I consider it the definitive experience.
Great soundtrack.
Fantastic blend of gameplay styles that keep things interesting.

It can sometimes be a little easy to get lost.

---the plus :

The game runs well, it's graphics aren't on par with current AAA games but I never felt it slow down or loose framerates.

the enemies are decently rebalanced, and the NPCs are well voiced with a welcome cameo, (although distracting for some, which I can understand)

the art direction is quite good, if a little less cartoonish than what Half Life aimed to present, which doesn't serve it's dark comedy moments. there's also a few more lens flares than I would have liked, but that's just me.

finally the music, and especially once in XEN, is phenomenal, and has earned a permanent spot in my playlist.

it's easy to mod too, some mods like Blue Shift even offer a whole new (WIP) campaign, other replace the [Redacted] with Dr Coomer from HLVRAI (also worth a look)

---the bad :

A few levels however, and especially the second to last (Interloper), feels rushed also. the improvement on gameplay and art direction sill left us with a bloated and confusing level, where the texture work is honestly a bit ugly and some puzzles could, and should, have been cut entirely.

a few of the effects, like the blood particles coming out of destroyed bodies, feel a bit dated and cheap. as well, the body parts feel to rigid and samey, like a Lego character was just disassembled.

buy the game. buy it because you loved Half Life, buy it because you want to discover Half life. buy it because oyu like fun shooters with awesome music.",1706704788,1706704788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite having a really old PC, Black Mesa performed really well while also having impressive visuals.  

Enough of that, Black Mesa's a fantastic HL1 Remake.  HOWEVER, i found Xen/the last few levels pretty dull and here's why...  
- not enough combat/shooting stuff
- too many puzzles and platforming
- performed like dogpoo & got real back framreates during specific sections
Now, I'm very biased 'cause I generally enjoy fast paced shooters with zero cutscenes and constant action.  I can't even fault the developer of Black Mesa for this.  While Xen in the original HL1 was different, it still included tons of platforming.

I'm still overlooking my lackluster opinion of Xen because the rest of the game was so much fun.  If you played the original Half Life 1 and/or it's sequel, then it's frankly a no-brainer to pick this up.

I remember following this project when it just started and being super excited about it. I played one of the first ""full"" versions where you downloaded free packages from their website and installed it using Source SDK. There was no Xen at that time. And now when the game is finished, Xen completely ruins the experience. It's unnecessarily long and boring; all the fun environmental puzzles they come up with are duplicated many times, so you are sick of putting the same three cables into some machine or shooting a red blob to unlock another leaf.

[h3]Playing on Steam Deck[/h3]

I played in desktop mode, and the performance was terrible. Everything before Xen I was able to play on Low settings with 4k resolution with most of the stuff disabled, getting 30-40 fps. Xen and everything after it - a complete lagfest. I had to drop the resolution to full HD and disable everything, and still only getting 15-30 fps. Other Source engine games run significantly better.

On top of performance problems, I was getting constant crashes. Sometimes these crashes happen during autosave, making this autosave broken, so you have to replay some parts. So I had to Quick Save constantly",1706683488,1706683567,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

this is made even worse, by the game over staying its welcome, platforming sections (jump and try to land on something). the flesh bounce pads which have inconsistent effects.
there were various times i could not figure out how to proceed, whether it was the wrong way to view a situation, not seeing something or something being destructible and i thought it wouldn't be.
so i had to stop and seek guides to progress which became annoying. others may not have this experience.


the best parts of this experience to me, are the AI which may run away, crouch or hide behind cover. which for a 1999 game was impressive.
also cheats which summon NPCs is really fun. since they will fight each other if not a part of the same faction.
also some of the weapons are unique and fun to play with.

The puzzles were kinda fun at first but every puzzle is copied 2-3 times just to make you do it 2-3 times like why?! All the charm and excite meant is gone after the first time but they're still gunna copy and paste it a few more times don't worry.

The level design is extremity unintuitive never following the rules it sets for more then a few minutes before throwing what you thought would be a consistent mechanic out the window. Not to mention throwing countless forks in the road at you for no other reason then a dead end of wasted time.

I understand the physics engine is old but there is no attempt to add setting to try and help it function on modern hardware; there's no frame rate cap in the settings and the game constantly jumps around between 180 and 250 FPS causing it to just fall apart half the time launching me into a wall or 100s of feet in the air killing me or preventing me from continuing without loading a save.

The jumping puzzles wouldn't be so bad if the game felt any bit responsive, there's constantly jagged hit boxes around terrain that doesn't even come close to the actual textures leaving you to bonk your head or side causing you to miss a simple jump and reload yet again. Then half the time your climbing the ""intended"" path the terrain has so many jagged edges that climbing up a simple ledge is a horrific jump spamming mess.

Xen was cool for about an hour and now I'm the most miserable I've been in the game yet. It's long, visually and puzzle repetitive once in the factory, and the sense of direction is thrown out the window.

Maybe if you're an old school gamer this was cool or revolutionary but, to play this as a normal gamer in 20234 was a long from fun experience, I just wanted it to end.

Black Mesa took around 15 years to complete, and it was well worth the wait, as almost everything has been improved upon.

[h3] THE ENEMIES AND WEAPONS [/h3]

Crowbar Collective did a magnificent job remaking the Half-Life 1 roster, as well as adding some new ones, like the Alpha Houndeyes, Explosive Houndeyes, Water Barnacles, etc. The weapons all work as you'd expect for the most part. The MP5 feels a lot better than its HL1 counterpart, killing things a bit faster. The Gluon Gun is an absolute beast, that disintegrates things even faster. My only complaints being, that the rocket launcher has slower projectiles, and the hand grenades feeling janky to use.

[h3] THE ENVIRONMENT AND WORLD BUILDING [/h3]

The environments in Black Mesa have been expanded upon, giving them a much more lived in environment, as well as selling the seriousness of the alien invasion more. A lot of the friendly NPCs were given distinct personalities to distinguish them from one another, which in turn made me feel more invested in them. And Crowbar Collective clearly knew everyone hated On A Rail, because they rightfully shortened that chapter, while making others longer, especially Xen, but that will get its own section. Overall, I love most of the changes that were made... Interloper is still a pain in the ass, though.

[h3] THE MUSIC [/h3]

Joel Nielsen did an excellent job with the sound design and soundtrack. The music ranges from fitting ambience, sad melodies, and action-packed rock and/or metal tracks when the need arises, while Xen has its own take, with the angelic choirs. Also shout out to his wife and her ass, for providing some of the ""sound effects"" in the game.

[h3] XEN [/h3]

For most Half-Life fans, Xen was always the most disappointing part about the OG. Not Black Mesa. After 5 years of just working on Xen, it came out perfectly. Black Mesa's Xen is absolutely beautiful and much longer, having its own ecosystem, as well as labs set up, showing that the science team was there before. Gonarch's Lair in particular easily became my favourite chapter of Black Mesa.

[h3] THE PAIN [/h3]

Black Mesa is almost a perfect slam dunk, but there are some things that drag it down. Interloper has WAY too much platforming, and it honestly felt like it was overstaying its welcome. The hardest achievements in the game? The hat and pizza ones? Suffering. Ignoring the fact, that it was absolutely painful to drag those through Xen, if you also try to grab the hat/pizza and immediately start running afterwards, you just drop them. You need to wait a good two seconds before you start sprinting, which can be difficult, if you're being chased by a Gargantua or Gonarch. Also, for some reason, in Interloper the hat decided to ignore the laws of physics and flew all the way into the sky box, just to add some more pain into the mix. Thankfully, this is mostly a perfectionist's pet peeve, and most people won't even go for these achievements.

Overall, I give Black Mesa a 9.5/10. The 0.5 point deduction was due to the achievement pain. If you're a fan of Half-Life, or a newcomer to it, I'd highly recommend. The Crowbar Collective are incredibly talented.",1706465349,1706465507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Incoherent thoughts ensue: 

Somehow Surface Tension feels like it drags on for less than usual but it's still a slog, nevermind with the harder military grunts. A lot of mixed feelings on the lighting obscuring buttons/levers/valves up until Lamba Complex, particularly in Power Up. Changes to places like On A Rail (one of my favourite chapters) are understandable, but it also makes navigating them more of a joke, the atmosphere is impeccable but it feels like the level design in that chapter is patronising, instead we're just focusing on ""plug this into this and unplug that"" HL2-ness. Oddly enough this is done in a stellar way in Xen. Walking until We've Got Hostiles feels nice and moody/atmospheric, then you just hope you don't get hit by a shotgunner/grenade/pinpointed by something. Thankfully ammo and health are plentiful so restocking is not an issue (especially for HL1's fall damage at times), but I also don't want Gordon to be feeling like a battered walking tank. As much as the game wants to be accessible in places like Blast Pit and the aforementioned On A Rail, then it throws buttons that can't be unpressed and cause a soft lock if you know, you're taking your time in the nicely looking atmospheric action-and-sometimes-platformer. Which again makes it so wild that Xen, completely remade, is just done basically flawlessly. I really like HL1 except for Surface Tension and the Alien Grunt spam in Lambda Complex, and considering how long these pre-Xen chapters have been out for I'm surprised that they've mostly been downgraded and stretched out in their re-imagination at about the Blast Pit/ post Blast Pit point. The ""press buttons until it works"" in Residue Processing or ""I guess violence is the answer"" in Questionable Ethics is also weird. Also what's up with the buttrock OST that requires you to also play with subtitles because the audio mixing is absolutely horrendeous (again, the Xen OST is really well done, I cannot stop gushing over the atmosphere and at times ImSim-y done platforming and puzzle progression). ""Gordon, you saved us, but you got ambushed, can you hear us over the buttrock? Gordon! Come in!"". I guess no bulletsponges are a welcome sight for Hard playthroughs as a positive note to end for. 

I am very mixed on this package but it is ultimately a recommendation with many caveats, just play HL1 on anything but Hard mode, then play Black Mesa Xen.

The answer is different for everyone ,it's up to you to decide. For me it was simple ,i went for the remake for more content and better graphics. Made with Half-Life 2's Source engine,this was the perfect foundation for me to start a entire Half Life series playthrough. It's amazing Black Mesa is allowed to be sold as a standalone game, Valve earned a lot of respect and popularity from gaming community because of this. 

To be honest Black Mesa was my guilty pleasure to delve into the Half Life universe,a perfect excuse to try an old title for the first time and a perfect introduction to Half life 2. 

What stands out from the original game is the final chapters of the remake for me. The Xen section and some boss fights are on another level of quality and design and some areas are completely new. The visuals are breathtaking ,you just don't expect something like this from a Half Life remake. 

Experiencing the story for the first time was beautiful,it's sad they don't make games like this anymore. The multiplayer lobby most of the time are empty but from time to time you'll find some people to play with.

In my opinion this is a must-play ,if before people like me had an excuse to skip the Half Life 1,with Black Mesa remake it's almost mandatory.

Pros:
-one of the best remakes 
-good story (same as original with some changes to fit better with rest of the series)
-solid fps experience

Cons:
- sometimes it's not clear how to complete a puzzle or how to progress

My review score:
Story   - 10
Gameplay- 9
Graphics- 9
Sound  - 9

Overall - 9.25

And that's sad, cause I really wanted to. I never played Half-life when it first came out. Everyone has always told me how amazing it and the sequel were. I thought this would be a fine way to get into it.

It wasn't.

The settings menu was a mess. 
The sound mix was off from the start. For some reason the noise made by the icons in the game's menu is THE loudest thing on the face of the earth. Unfortunately, unlike many games these days where sound settings are divided into 5-6 bars you can balance separately this only has 3 (Master, Effects, Music). Which isn't really enough when I'd like to hear characters speak but also wouldn't like to lose my hearing if I need to navigate the menu.

Even when you do get things the way you like them, you'd better take a pic as the settings menu will forget what you set it to when the game closes and reloads. 

First person platforming. 
Who? Who in the history of the WORLD thought first person platforming was a good idea?
IT'S NOT! First person platforming is not fun! And there's one chapter in this game that's practically ALL platforming from start to finish. It's NOT challenging, it's NOT fun and it's NOT interesting, It's just a tedious slog.


I like the weapons.
I DON'T like how cumbersome switching between them is. This is especially painful when you're in the midst of a firefight with a dozen scumbag soldiers and 3 of their near-omniscient turrets that can hit you a mile away if you so much as show a hair.

Again, I really....really wanted to like this game. But after 9 hours I just want my time back.
I think the worst part of all this is that I can see a really cool game here. The game I heard so much about. A game with a nice story, look, and action. But what's here is just not good enough to offset the negatives.

Perhaps there's a combination of mods that effectively assassinate these flaws. Maybe in the future, I'll look for some and perhaps give this game another go.

But for now, I'm done. It's just not fun.",1706240921,1706240921,False,0,0,0.459930330514907837,1,True,False,False

Talking about Xen, the graphics are great too, you are mixed between being impressed, and mildly concerned about what will attack you next time. The feeling of discovering a new world and what happened to your co-workers... it really is my favorite part of the game, along with the last fight with the marines and the aliens.

The boss are overall very good, except the last one which I found a bit too easy, even in harder difficulties... same for its music, I don't ask an ORCHESTRAL GOTHIC ALIEN 80'S WAVE, but it would have been way better than this... or I had a bug, I do not know.

The artstyle is too different, and the sounds are drastically changed, the ragdoll effects combined with the lack of death animations can make it hard to tell if you killed your enemy or not, especially headcrabs or other alien creatures that already lay on the floor. Some sound que's seem to be missing, and sometimes the game feels really empty and unfinished, buggy and some of the changes they put into the game made no sense. Visual quality is extremely inconsisent, sometimes you get beautiful environments where everything seems to fit in, and other times it looks worse than the original half life due to poor textures and bad lighting in some areas.

There's too many wires in the game, and repetetive simple puzzles that just feel clunky to do, especially in Interloper in Xen, the worst chapter in the game by far. 

I know I have critiqued the game quite a bit in this review, but i still highly enjoyed it and I very much still recommend it... Just bare in mind that I think the original is the superior game even though the efforts they put into this remake is insane and incredible commendable. And i wish the devs a prosperous career in the game industry, I can imagine this was a pain to make so I highly support this product at the end of the day!

+ Enemy variety is great

+ Fixes some levels with level better design
+ You can tell Crowbar Collective really have a passion for this project

- Marine's voices don't have the radio filter (A mod fixes this)
- No Half-Life 1 expansions (Though I think someone is making a mod for them)

The game is great, to be honest it is really good but not without some negative view :
- While the graphics aren't garbage this isn't as good as what I would expect from a modern game. I know source is a old engine and the game has been developed for years but I would wanted a bit more. Also too many loading screen.
- I felt lost so many times. The game is hard because there is many times where I was looking for what to do. From small green light to see to non-intuitive path the game lost me too many times.
- At some point the game feel a bit to much extended. After XEN chapter it is in my opinion a bit too long for nothing with repetitive mechanics. I felt the game design was made from scratch at some level.

Negatives: 

- Even though they reworked the last chapter, which looks so much better than the original, it still doesn't feel great to play and feels a like a bit of a slog (especially on second playthrough). 

- I had to do some serious re-routing of the button layouts in order to play this with a controller, I was able to find good settings eventually but it took a while to set-up and get right and I feel this could have been streamlined a bit more. 

- Long loading screen (which I'm willing to ignore a bit seeing as this game is clearly a labour of love)

Positives:

- This game gives you freedom in ways that lots of modern games fail to understand

- The environmental story telling is really on point and I love how it's always clear where to go without any map or character blatantly telling you where things are. Everything is clear without long text to read or conversations that go on.

- Exploring the areas is lots of fun and very rewarding

- The original game was ground-breaking, and the renewed graphics of this game make it possible to re-live a piece of history that inspired so many game, and does it in a very pleasing way.

The project took more than one and a half decade, but the final product is one of the best Half-Life related media, in my opinion almost rivaling Half-Life 2 and it's episodes. 

The game runs on the Source Engine, but it is one of the best looking game using the engine, and you probably wouldn't realize by just looking at it that it uses a 20+ year old game engine. Although the Source Engine jankiness and physics appear sometimes, just to remind you how much work has been put into this game, to have it look like this. Black Mesa doesn't replace the original Half-Life as some things were done differently. The biggest difference is the Xen part, I personally hated that part of the original game, and I still don't like it to this day, but in Black Mesa it is one of the many highlights of the game. Xen looks gorgeous, and the music elevates it's beaty even more. The music is also one of the parts that Black Mesa does much better. 

All in all Black Mesa feels like what the original Half-Life would have felt like, if it was made in the second half of the 2010s. Everything feels polished and has comforts that modern games provide. 

With all the graphical improvements comes greater system requirements. The Source Engine was streched to it's limits with Black Mesa, and it can be felt sometimes. I haven't played it with my new GPU, but my RX480 had a bad time with the game from time-to-time. I never dropped below 60 on the highest settings tho. The Blue Shift remake is even worse from this stand point, as it was literally killing my GPU sometimes for no obvious reason.

When I started playing I quickly realised it was the original Half Life 1 just with slightly better graphics. I was disappointed at first but found myself slowly falling back in love with one of my all time favourite games from way back.

Upon completing the Black Mesa storyline and being teleported to the alien homeworld I was excited to finish an old classic and put it to rest with more pleasant memories.

** However, to my dismay, the game didn't end. **

The alien planet was seemingly redone and was now another 12 hours of ridiculously tedious jump puzzles and brain teasers.
There were bare fragments of attempted lore from the alien side which you could piece together or miss completely, all the while the Vortigaunts are constantly mumbling the same line, over and over in your ears without adding anything extra.

Yes, you CAN kill them but I'm not a monster (you can figure it out pretty quick they're not evil).

Honestly, I almost quit playing, multiple times during this waste of time but I hate to leave a formerly great game unfinished. It just kept dragging ON and ON and essentially ruined the enjoyment I collected from replaying the original story.

If I could go back, I would not have purchased this remake and left a fond memory just the way it was.

It feels like I'm back to my home town to meet my best friends that I've been friends with my whole life, only in this case I've only met this friend a few days ago. The game manages to be subtle about its gameplay and only push the ""hell yeah"" button in rare moments that truly deserve it. It doesn't have neither the ""story mode"" nor the ""nightmare difficulty"" but it doesn't treat me like a baby. It somehow manages to switch between the puzzle, the platformer and the shooter modes without being blatant about it and I only realize I'm at the puzzle stage when it's almost over so I never get frustrated over overextended sections of gameplay.

Would I recommend this game to other players? Hell yeah. Three days ago I was looking for a top-notch 2023 shooter that would make my GPU melt but here I am hitting headcrabs with a crowbar and having the time of my life.",1705473104,1705473104,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Positive points:
- The reproduction of Black mesa is really well done, a lot of details and animations, as a HL fan it is just a pleasure to re-discover the environment done with the source engine 
- First part of the game follows almost perfectly HL1 and is quite smooth 
- I really enjoyed the action during the game, the game is quite dynamic and the fights with enemies are quite fun
- The Xen world is just amazing, I think just for that part the game is worth it
- The musics were overall quite good

Negative points:
- I had an issue with the flashlight that was not working properly for most part of the game, very annoying in dark places, it is to me a critical issue as it could block many players from advancing.
- Some issues with the textures 
- The Xen part felt extremely long and repetitive with too many puzzles, you spent most of the time connecting cables
- Not always easy or obvious to know what to do or where to go, maybe it is an issue to know HL1 so well as I was most of the time thinking to solve puzzles in the same way but the solution could actually be diffrent in Black Mesa
- Music sometimes a bit too loud

I would like to give a big thank you to the community and to the developers for the amount of work put into the game, I had overall a great experience.
Then I would probably recommend this game for Half life lovers, for the others I would recommend to first start with the original which is simply a master piece.

Not even just FPS games, though it's insanely important to the entire genre for being one of the first to not be arcadey (a-la Doom or Quake) and to merge a coherent story with gameplay to make a whole experience. Before, you'd get a text crawl if you're lucky, or else you'd just have to go to the manual. Or there'd be Cutscenes. The game itself is a masterpiece in almost every way, so in 2005 or so, a group of crazy people wanted to remake the entire thing in the source engine (as opposed to Gold Source which was built off the quake engine) and the results we have are Black Mesa.

What can you say about a game that so lovingly recreates a game like Half-Life. It doesn't change what made Half-Life good, even keeping in jank like crouch jumping and other similar quirks of the source engine. It looks and plays like a dream. It follows the game to the letter but sprinkles in some added stuff to make it stand out in a way. The biggest addition is the expansion of Xen, which I'm torn about. On one hand, it feels great and looks beautiful. You can see how much effort into making the alien world look as breathtaking as it does. It's long enough to feel like it's own game separate from the rest of running around Black Mesa. On the other hand, it still kinda has the same problems Xen had, that being that it's not really a satisfying conclusion to running around the Black Mesa compound. Making it longer just has the same issue.

Another issue i had was getting it to run. It gave my dang 3060 ti a run for its money and i was chugging a lot at some spots. Particularly during the outside segments and some parts in Xen. Granted, i was playing on the highest graphics but still, be weary.

Overall, i would say to play the original Half-Life first, but don't skip over this if you're a fan. It's a 15 year love letter to one of the most important games ever made. You can feel it in every inch of the game. Cant wait for them to remake it in Source 2 now in another 15 years.",1705299484,1705299484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Fantastic job in the design of the world/areas. Large open spaces with great atmosphere.  
- The sounds are well done, and the music is good. 
- The story is well done. 
- Puzzles that make you pay special attention to details, leaving you to really have to think. 
- Fun combat. 
- Including some of the best sci-fi worlds in all my gaming experience. 

 
Negative:
- Walking is rather fast.  
- Controller does not automatically work. *Remember to select a controller profile through steam.  
- No navigation radars.  
- Controls are fine but there are drawbacks to using controller such as weapon changes where you must use a keyboard for over two items. 
- No objective menu, so you had better pay attention to hints.  
- Some parts are hard for anyone with sensitive vision (screen vibrating). 
- Enemies are not always very memorable. 


 Conclusion:

Black Mesa really took me off guard. Despite a few challenges, most of the game was quite well done. At one point, I thought it had reached a satisfying ending, but it was solely a primer to what was about to unfold.  

The environments in the last few levels were some of the best I have ever experienced in Sci-Fi gaming. They were magnificent and majestic with some parts being gloomy, translucent and organic. I can still hear the sounds and almost feel the unique atmosphere. A+  

I had frustrations getting the game set up but in the end it was fine. I also had a moment where I felt the game had ‚Äústopped being fun‚Äù, which was related to one challenging puzzle. Apparently, I am not the only one with this experience. *It may just be a controller issue. 

Putting aside my complaints, this is a must play title for any Sci-Fi FPS fans.

The story, progression and gameplay, remain the same but all the assets are new and the maps have been modified. The original used an improved Quake 1 engine (1998). The Source engine version used (2013), obviously allows for vastly improved graphics, animations, facial expressions, AI, physics, more expansive maps and gameplay features such as more NPCs and carrying items. Almost certainly many of the improvements were desired by the devs of original game but not possible to implement due to engine and hardware limitations.  The 75% of the game that occurs on earth has mostly been left intact. The devs did alter most of the maps to varying degrees in order to improve gameplay. But this is debatable. For instance, they reduced ""on a rail"" and altered object placement so that the cause and effect of some puzzles could be immediately correlated . But maybe ""on a rail"" was meant to be long and tedious, and I found it gratifying to do something, then backtrack some distance to observe the result of my action, as in the original game. Nevertheless, the earth part is cohesive with seriously engaging gameplay and recognisably HL1.  

Where the devs really exercised their design chops is in the Xen parts. In implementing their vision of the border world, they kept the original four chapters, but these are (much) longer, more expansive, more expository, and more detailed. Xen was rushed and incomplete in the original (the HL1 devs talk about this in the HL1 25th anniversary documentary). Crowbar Collective also consulted the original game's Xen design spec (much of which was left out in HL1). The result is a breathtakingly beautiful and immersive border world, a pleasure to play through, explore and discover, and a natural extension of the game, probably closer to the original vision, all accomplished whilst not exceeding their poetic license.   
 
No game is perfect. HL allowed backtracking in most of its chapters, something I appreciate and enjoy. So the levels where this is artificially prevented (unexpected rockfalls blocking an exit, lifts whose buttons frizz out when the destination is reached) break the suspension of disbelief and degrade the experience. Unless forced due to an engine limitation, I really wish this wasn't implemented, even if it is just mimicking the original game (with a vastly less capable engine). The same goes for fleshed-out rooms with locked doors. Let us in if doesn't break gameplay! I don't care if this is done so that players don't get lost and confused; games of this era didn't hold your hand much. My other bugbear is that some of the puzzles in the Xen level were not intuitive.  Even when demonstrated in a walkthrough, I didn't see how the player was meant to discern the solution. 

Audience #1: Want to replay Half Life
BM is the obvious choice. You get to experience the environments and events of the research facility again, just in a more detailed, realistic environment, with more NPCs and interactions. The iconic story, progression and core gameplay remain the same (in fact, gameplay has been enhanced; I don't recall being able to physically carry items, including excess hand- and gun-grenades, in HL1, and use items as weapons by throwing them at enemies). Foregoing the massive improvements of the remake in order to indulge in the pure nostalgia of the original version (even the 25th anniversary edition) is too high a price.  I was in awe of BM's graphics and stunning vistas, and the outdoor map sizes have increased significantly,  and that's before Xen.   You will not experience the border world as it was originally-intended, and will miss out on a hugely improved experience of it, if you don't experience Black Mesa.

Audience #2: Played HL1, undecided if it's worth replaying it in the BM version.
Yes, it is! This is me. I played HL1 years ago, and have no hesitation in recommending that you experience it again, in this version. And did I mention Xen?

Audience #3: haven't played Half Life.
Half Life is seminal. A fps gamer not having played through it is a contradiction in terms. If you want the 1998 experience, play the 25th anniversary edition (it's close enough). After which you'll fall into audience category # 1 or #2.  If you're not a purist, go straight to Black Mesa. And if you haven't played any of the Half Life series, BM leads you seamlessly into HL2 (and yes, HL1 or BM is a prerequisite for HL2). 

To summarise, Black Mesa is a stunning and refreshing remake of Half Life, and probably closer, in parts, to the vision of the HL developers. I recommend it as the default version of a seminal and compulsory fps experience and regard it as a necessary HL2 prerequisite. And as I discovered, it's well worth reliving the events in the research facility and the border world through the eyes of the Crowbar Collective.

Edit 1: The two major changes are the massive expansion and graphical tour-de-force of Xen. There seems to be very little disagreement that this is an improvement over the original. I am more ambivalent, however, about the chopping of ""on a rail"", wondering if this wasn't exceeding their artistic license. I understand the devs motive (they felt it was way too long), but in retrospect I would rather it was included. After I finished the definitive edition, I subscribed to ""the definitive on a rail uncut"" (OaR uncut & the loop mod) in the steam workshop and thoroughly enjoyed playing through it. According to the OaR uncut  dev it is not finished, but I was but I found no errors, other than I could not continue with the next chapter once I'd completed it.

And if you didn‚Äôt really enjoy Half-Life, Black Mesa is a major improvement on Half-Life in just about every regard, so I‚Äôd recommend giving it a shot.

It should be noted that Black Mesa is a remake of Half-Life, not a remaster, and some people don‚Äôt like that. They just want Half-Life but with actually decent HD models, which is fine, but if that‚Äôs the expectation you go in with, prepare to be disappointed. The music is different, the maps have been changed (some areas are significantly different), the NPCs have more lines, and of course, Xen has been completely reimagined. Basically all the changes are for the better in my opinion, but if you‚Äôre a purist, you have been warned.

I will admit that I was not the biggest fan of Joel Nielsen‚Äôs score at first, but it has certainly grown on me, particularly the Xen soundtrack. Another change I was not fond of at first was the HECU, as being Combine-based, they are far more intelligent and formidable a foe than the Half-Life HECU, and they are present in far greater numbers than in Half-Life. But as I kept playing, I came to realize it was actually a great decision: because it‚Äôs so much harder (even on Easy), they actually feel like, well, Marines ‚Äì a well-trained, professional fighting force that seemed to be able to handle just about anything, at least until they met the inhabitants of Xen...

And speaking of Xen, I cannot understate just how much I love Xen in Black Mesa. In Half-Life, it felt unfinished, and Interloper in particular just felt like a massive slough for no good reason that really made you worry about your ammo. Then the Nihilanth battle happened and it was just annoying with all the teleports. It felt anticlimactic, which was especially ironic given G-Man's lines after you beat it.

Black Mesa's Xen, by contrast, actually feels lived in, like a real place. Rather than a place that‚Äôs been explored by a few unfortunate souls, it‚Äôs got an entire research outpost for their deep incursions into the territory. Gonarch is actually challenging and kinda scary, Interloper is still a slog but an interesting slog with some really fun areas where you get to go ham with the Gluon Gun like a classic boomer shooter power-trip level (Half-Life‚Äôs dearth of ammo for the Tau and Gluon meant I rarely used either, and they never really got their time to shine as a result), and it‚Äôs also gorgeous. Plus, the Nihilanth battle is both stunning and difficult, even after you learn the ""easy"" way to kill him for the [i]Late for Work[/i] achievement.

Another thing I enjoy about Black Mesa is that it actually encourages the use of the entire loadout. In Half-Life, you could get through the entire game with the MP5 and shotgun, but Black Mesa‚Äôs strategic ammo placement basically forces you to use everything, and I enjoy that a lot. They all deserve a time to shine, and Black Mesa is very careful about encouraging just that.

One of my favorite things about Black Mesa is its attention to detail. Obviously, Half-Life set the bar quite high in this regard, but Black Mesa went above and beyond, particularly in its environmental storytelling. Having read a fair amount about Half-Life‚Äôs development, some of the biggest challenges they faced were the limitations of both GoldSrc and the hardware of the era, and I think Black Mesa really takes advantage of both Source and modern hardware to amplify the original story of Half-Life.

Take the HECU‚Äôs chatter ‚Äì in the original, there were only a few areas you heard the grunts say much outside ‚Äúsquad, report in,‚Äù ‚Äúsquad, get Freeman,‚Äù ‚Äúsquad, stay alert,‚Äù etc. But in Black Mesa, there are lots of places you get to hear the HECU talk amongst themselves, and it really humanizes them and makes you feel bad with how badly they get routed, especially since you get to see how good at fighting they are. In Half-Life, during Surface Tension, I was like, ‚Äúfuck yeah, the military is screwed!‚Äù In Black Mesa, by contrast, I was like ‚Äúoh fuck, the military is screwed‚Ä¶‚Äù

And speaking of screwed, one of my favorite details of Black Mesa is in its radio broadcasts. Radios are an underrated indirect exposition device in my opinion, and if you‚Äôre just rushing through, you‚Äôll miss most of them, but Black Mesa includes several radio broadcasts from both the military and civilian side which are entirely original and they are honestly chilling.

In Office Complex, Blast Pit, and Surface Tension, there are civilian radios broadcasting emergency alerts, and it does a great job of communicating just how utterly screwed humanity is. It starts out as a 75-mile evacuation order by local authorities for an unknown disaster, which soon expands to a 150-mile evacuation order by the state government that lists out symptoms of radiation exposure (since they were still trying to cover up the incident), but by the time you get to the end of Surface Tension...

[quote][EAS sign-in tones] The following message is transmitted at the request of the United States Department of Defense. This is not a test.[/quote]

At this point, the DoD is ordering the entire state to evacuate, the president has declared a national emergency and acknowledged the true nature of the disaster, and they are asking anyone with a gun to help with the fight because the military is so hopelessly overrun. That broadcast was genuinely frightening (the only time I‚Äôve felt that way from a video game), and it really drives home just how bad things have gotten, and a harbinger of what‚Äôs in store for the rest of the world.

It makes me wonder why more games don‚Äôt use the Emergency Alerts System like this. Those tones are designed to be unsettling and attention-grabbing, and you can lay down some truly devastating exposition with them.

Follow this up with a grunt asking for help while bleeding out over the radio shortly thereafter, and I was in tears.

Overall, having played this game multiple times through and having earned every achievement, I only have a few minor complaints:

[list]
    [*]The native Linux build is trash so I have to use the Windows build under Proton, which tends to crash a fair amount.
    [*]Some of the captions have minor deviations from the lines and some captions do not consistently trigger (e.g. breaking the window on some doors only results in a glass breaking caption when done from one side).
    [*]Interloper should be tightened up, like On A Rail.
    [*]Some of the achievements are a bit buggy. For example, I had to redo Interloper multiple times before it acknowledged that I had, in fact, earned [i]Laser Immunization[/i].
[/list]

Even at the list price of $20, this is well worth it, and is a complete no-brainer when it regularly goes on sale for $5. I have gotten more out of this game than many $60+ AAA titles. I would keep talking but I'll hit the character limit, so I'll leave it at this: This game is a true 10/10, amplifying the story of Half-Life in a truly incredible way. It puts the Tension in Surface Tension, makes Xen feel truly alien, and has bosses that are actually challenging, all while remaining faithful to the original.",1705120635,1705120635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the game is gorgeous on max settings, not everyone can run their graphics that high without getting random frame drops, especially in Xen.

In hearing that, you may be confused as to why I would then deem the game ""not recommended."" Really, it's for attention.
Obviously, if it was really between playing it and not playing it, you should play the game. Black Mesa is very cool, and at times it is definitely very fun. The developers clearly loved the original Half Life and you can feel their passion oozing from every corner. However, there are so many things holding this game back, that while my overall experience was still positive, I can't help but think about what this game could have been instead of what it is.

Let's start with my first gripe, which is the smallest. The game is generally very dense with content, and different things that you will encounter and have to deal with. However, once you get to Xen, the game suddenly becomes a walking simulator which spans several hours. I found myself becoming bored with all the walking and platforming that you must do, and especially sections like the incredibly long conveyor belt section went on way too long and more than overstayed their welcome. But thankfully, movement suddenly becomes a lot more fun once you get to Xen, which helps this ""walking simulator"" section a little, though it still tends to be tedious.

Secondly, some of the puzzles are too vague. There were [i] several [/i] instances where I got stuck on a puzzle, wandering aimlessly for several minutes until I stumbled upon the solution. Granted, I never had to look up a guide, but there was a lot of the aforementioned aimless wandering until I figured out what the game wanted me to do. Some mechanics were very poorly explained to the player, if at all. Some more clarity would do the game wonders.

Thirdly, the crashing. I lost count of how many times the game would randomly crash for no reason, and near the beginning of the playthrough, it would wipe all my settings to default and force me to set them all over again. This is borderline unacceptable, especially for this game being nearly 4 years old with these issues not being fixed. It may mean having to fight Source Spaghetti, but again, no game should EVER have to deal with crashing during [i] completely normal gameplay. [/i]

Now, fourthly, and most egregiously, the combat. Now, this game has lots of different weapons, and definitely encourages being creative when it comes to encounters what with the limited ammo. However, the enemy AI in this game is some of the worst I've ever seen. The soldiers are the worst offenders by far - their reaction times are quite literally instant, they can see you through walls, and they have nigh perfect aim. Most other enemies also have pseudo-aimbot or are heavily affected by RNG, making it essentially impossible to not get hit. Certain enemy AIs are also incredibly sporadic in how they move; particularly the dogs and female soldiers. They lack any sense of momentum and change speed / direction on a dime, making it impossible to predict them and completely breaking immersion. It's perfectly okay to have fast enemies, but again, they need to have believable momentum. Certain sections of the game make it feel like getting hit is the intention, or that it being impossible to not get hit is okay because there are health pickups scattered about. But a player should never be encouraged to take damage, and it should always be realistically possible to use skill to avoid damage, because otherwise it is quite literally unfair. Designing a combat system where the player is expected to become complacent with taking damage is incredibly silly. And keep in mind, these complaints aren't coming from either of the harder modes. These are things I gathered from playing on normal mode. If normal mode combat is unfair and undodgeable as is, how can I be expected to realistically complete - and especially have fun playing - the harder difficulties? The abundance of health pickups will only work as a band-aid fix up to a certain point.

And that's everything I've got to say, for now. Again, this game is definitely cool and worth playing, and the developers clearly cared about the product they were crafting. But there were so many things that I found wrong with the game, it was very frustrating at times. This game is almost 4 years old; with it being so flawed after so long, I would hate to have experienced it at launch. But I really hope this project isn't dead in the water; I would be over the moon if the developers could create more patches and continue to fix issues, and possibly even address some of my points. Because really, at the end of the day, video games are meant to be fun, and I simply didn't have fun with some elements of the game, and I'm probably not alone on that. There will still be people like me, who will experience this game for the first time after all these years; I don't see the harm in making it the best experience for them.",1705021829,1705021829,False,0,0,0.419600933790206909,0,True,False,False

This is a definitive, near-perfect way to experience Half-Life. It tweaks the game in the right places and preserves the bits that made the original work. The free Zen area, which was the weakest area in the original Half Life game, looks gorgeous and is 1,000 times more interesting. It has a more than reasonable price tag. What more do you want aside from absolute perfection?

More details:

The thing to remember about this game is that it's ¬£15.00. So we're talking an extra story pack DLC sort of price.

Pros:

- Things that made the original great like the physics puzzles and variety of gameplay is still there. In some cases, it's actually refined and there's more of them

- Although Zen isn't perfect, it's actually a substantial addition for the asking price with lots of interesting world-expanding ideas. The developers clearly knew what Zen was meant to be and it was a joy to explore, look at and do the new puzzles.

Neutral:

- Graphics. This is tough. The actual objects look freakin' awesome. Just look at the screenshots... but the engine is old and holds back some animations slightly. For the price, it's fine.

Cons:

- Engine for a 2020 game is outdated, so the physics could be better but it's not awful

- One or two uninteresting new areas. Sadly, one is on the new Zen area even though Zen is overall a substantial improvement.",1702486245,1704991381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game is great enough on its own, but my oh my, check out the great Workshop this game has, from cool weapon reskins, to comical meme sound packs such as the Sr. Pelo Gluon gun, there's a mod that will surely enhance the already great game.

And let me tell you you, the wait for Xen was completely worth it, I got the game in 2017 and waited 2020 for them drop it and it was worth the long wait 100%. Xen is actually a playable, fleshed out area instead of the rushed mess it was in HL1 back in '98. Everywhere in Xen is visually stunning, I'm shocked the Source engine can look THIS good quite frankly, every area has a unique visual style, from the flora covered caves to the basalt-crystally areas, every new section presents it's own unique aesthetic.
The Nihilanth is like... and actual boss now. With multiple phases (the last one tanking frames but looks awesome non-the-less).

In short, buy if you want more HL2.
It's pretty good from a gameplay perspective until the more annoying segments of Xen.
The choice to cut content (On a Rail) and then drag out other parts (all of Xen) is a strange and a downside to me.

Bugs and glitches- Source jank is not completely eliminated and sometimes walking through prop-strewn areas will send the player flying, or a seemingly empty area will be impassable.
Occasional deaths will result in a CTD, ex during the assassin arena fight.
Some scripted sequences have issues, for example standing back and watching a zombie crawl out from a hatch in Unforeseen Consequences allowed me to kill it, but after a reload being close to the sequence rendered the enemy invulnerable. Similarly, some set-piece animations are unavoidable and play even when they make no sense, eg an MG nest being blown up despite my having removed the responsible HECU first, or the out-of-control tram that locks you in place even if you want to let it run and get out.

NPC wrangling can be difficult or impossible, with NPC-impassable invisible barriers in places. Enemy interactions are also reduced, with infighting no longer happening between ""Nihilanth"" forces and ""Xen Fauna"" creatures- for example Vortigaunts and Bullsquids will ignore eachother and work together vs the player. Not yet confirmed whether headcrabs follow this behaviour too.

Enemy placement also suffers from a lack of care, for example in an ambush during On a Rail HECU will spawn in directly in view of the player, denying you the chance to snipe them from afar. Similarly, tactical opportunities are denied the player through mapping mistakes or decisions- during the rocket launch site fight, there is only one way to enter the arena, which is demarcated so thoroughly the player is not allowed to fire through fences which you would normally be able to, or break the (previously used and signposted as breakable) lock on a gate to make yourself an alternate angle of attack. The railroading obsession extends to subverting established behaviours of existing mechanics like explosive barrels and spawning enemy encounters twice (both can be seen in the Apprehension 3-crusher room, where the bullsquid will appear twice if you backtrack WITHOUT a loading screen inbetween, and if you try to use a barrel creatively to avoid the ""puzzle"").
Expanded map sizes make things look good, but combat suffers as a result- almost all weapons are short to mid range only, while the AI has no trouble attacking you at long range. This forces the player to make poor decisions and is balanced towards lower difficulty run-and-gun tactics.

Autosaves are made in extremely inconvenient spots such as during a firefight or seconds before death, depending on how you play.

Art direction is pretty good until Xen again- it's nothing like the original, a total reinterpretation.
There's some really excellent and immersive model/texture work, like being able to read the instructions and markings on medkits. Level design also suffers in Xen with repetitive ""puzzles"", over-complicated geometry and irritating platforming segments requiring manoeuvring onto very small moving parts.

Worst however is the immersion-breaking inclusion of modern elements to set dressing in a game depicting the 00s- the concept of ""boosters"" didn't exist until 2020 and seeing those posters really took me out of an otherwise excellent experience. I play videogames to get away from current affairs and want none of it in my escapism.

Of additional concern is the apparent inclusion of spyware to the game- having the good grace to include a privacy policy about it doesn't absolve one of the issue. I'm already using Steam, isn't that enough?",1683020273,1704820598,False,8,1,0.496618360280990601,0,True,False,False

Visually it looks great, and if they had just kept it at that, this would have been an excellent fan remaster, but instead they decided to give their own spin on Half Life and that's where they lost me. Simply deciding to cut out huge sections of the game like the chapter On A Rail because it ""was confusing and too long"" and then making the Xen chapters half of the game are just mind boggling decisions. As many have already pointed out, the Xen chapters are visually stunning and add a lot of depth over the original, but it gets extremely repetitive and quickly overstays its welcome. It also feels like too much of a departure from the original and is practically its own game at this point. Trying to ""reimagine"" such a beloved game when all the fans wanted was a next-gen graphical update was really stupid. Also the soundtrack is just awful, there were several times where I wanted to mute the music entirely.

It's long and full of action, puzzles and changing environments. Designs is great, with some outstanding art. The long second half, in the alien world of Xen is way better than in HL but it should have been heavily edited to cut overlong, repetitious sequences. Overall, I admit I find the Xen world (in HL and Black Mesa) a bit vacuous, as the complete unreality and disconnectedness of this physics-defying world, means the writers have no plot constraints or journey logic to follow. It lacks the gritty post-apocalyptic, real-world atmosphere of HL2, which made it almost unique. Plot is pretty feeble throughout Black Mesa, with none at all in Xen, other than the basic goal to get through all the challenges to a tough boss battle at the end. For example, it's a shame that the plight of, and new relationship with, the Vortigaunts is unexplained. There is none of the engagement with characters and plot, which made HL2 so rich and memorable. But that's really a criticism of HL itself. Black Mesa is still a great game to play and definitely worth the low price.",1704806247,1704806247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yeah I mean, it's a remake of the original Half Life, what can I say? Apparently this thing's been in development for like, 15 years or something but as far as I understand it's mostly finalised at this point?
Anyway, Half Life is, like, a [i] really [/i] old game. But it's also considered a pretty revolutionary one. Having played it, I don't really know exactly [i] what [/i] was revolutionary about it, but I guess you kinda had to be there, since it's likely a lot of the things I take for granted in games today were started there.
Now, the original Half Life had a lot of pretty great things that still hold up today, but it also had some maybe not so great things. I am happy to say that this game handles updating this classic very well. For some parts, it's pretty much Half Life HD, and that's pretty cool. Other parts have been changed and streamlined a bit where they may have been confusing or otherwise questionable, which is also pretty cool. The end, however, has seen a [i] massive [/i] overhaul, and frankly just blew me away. It's the one place where they shied away from just recreating what was in the original and instead took the ideas that were there and made them into something of their own, and I'm happy to say it turned out incredible.
If you're a fan of Half Life, then you probably didn't need to read this review to know this is a must-buy. If you're just looking to get into Half Life, this is far from a bad place to start, though if you'd rather try out the original that broke grounds all those years ago first, it wouldn't be a bad idea either. As someone who just got into the series this Summer, I opted to do the latter, and played through the entire original series before coming back to this. I think it was a good way to experience Half Life, but the choice is up to you. Honestly this game holds up on its own, but you would be missing out if you let Half Life 2 go unplayed.

Long and tedious chapters like ""on the rails"" have been made better paced, and boring chapters like ""xen"" have been made actually interesting and captures the feel the original game seems to have been going for.

If you never played hl1 go ahead and start here, go to hl2 and its episodes next, then loop back around to hl1 mmod and its other chapters.

It may be a controversial take but I honestly can attest to this being the best way to experience half life, especially with the introduction to some characters you will meet in hl2 like isaac rather than the generic same 5 scientists recycled in the original.

If you already played hl1 like me still play black mesa, its worth it and you can feel both a respect for the original game in this as well as alterations that you would most likely agree with like how ""xen"" is different.

Its not perfect though, the smg has weird tracers on the bullets and some of the alien enemies feel dumber and less dangerous than the original.

The game itself is amazing, a great throwback to Half Life 1 and most definately a worthy ""spiritual twin brother"" to it. From the Valve-worthy custom soundtracks, impactful weapons, amazing graphical updates, smarter AI (Well considering HL1 came out in 1998, I guess its no surprise that AI would've been a huge leap better. But they're still amazing even by modern standards), cute tiny quirks and easter eggs, excellent voice-acting that easily puts some ""AAA"" game to shame.

So why am I giving this a thumbsdown? It's because of these horribly lazy devs. Bear in mind that Black Mesa was initially avaliable since late 2011 (before official launch on moddb). That till its inception for sale on Steam, 3 years had gone by. and between its inception on steam and now, so has another 3. That's roughly 5+ years (i'm counting 5 ish because it was in its final state towards the end of 2011) with nothing but small improvements and tiny bugfixes.

Back before they released this game for sale in 2014,  I could get that because they're unpaid (eventhough they were accepting donations, of which plenty including myself have done so over half a decade ago), they couldn't work on it 24/7 like regular studios. However, i find it utterly inexcusable now that even after launching this game with Valve's blessings 3 years ago, they are still not done with the Xen levels (Xen, Gonarch's lair, interloper and Nihilanth. Also endgame mini level i suppose). This year alone in 2017, a single update. [b] ONE [/b] ""update"".

Honestly any of you who are still gullible to believe their lies that Xen level takes over 4+ years to develop (thats atleast 1460 days mind you) are just pathetic sheeps. I guess its so easy to look good while not doing anything. Just trickle an [i] ""update"" [/i] with some vaguely written words and ""production proof"" every couple of months and the average gamer will eat the excuse up. 

If I sound bitter throughout this post, you bet I am bitter about this. I've personally known two friends who had passed away since BM was out for the general public. And boy were they huge fans of Valve games. One in early 2016 of a skiing accident and one recently last March from accidental electrocution while bathing. 

And to those of you wanting to cite Valve's own treatment of HL3/HL2:EP3 to ""defend"" BM devs behavior, its differen't. I get that we may never see the light of day of HL3/HL2:EP3 from Valve because from a business standpoint, they have no incentive to do so when Steam, Dota, CSGO and virtual item market in general are significantly more profitable. In hindsight, Valve aren't lazy about it, they just don't want to make it. And i can get by that. Moreover, they have not sold us an incomplete game. Imagine if valve sold Half life 2 but it only contains 3/4 of the entire game. And even after 5+ years, that remaining 1/4 is still not finished. You see the difference now yes?

In short, I can get by with lack of motivation or lacking reasons to push foward for a product when since it doesn't make much sense from a PR (Valve are still generally considered one of the more benevolent devs out there) and financial (They're making load of money through building the E-sport scene, virtual economy and their online store platform Steam) perspective.

But laziness, that's utterly atrocious and disgusting. Absolutely disgusting practice. And to think people bash CD Projekt RED for taking 4+ years to make Witcher 3 when Black Mesa's team couldn't even pull through 4 levels (Xen, Gonarch's lair, Interloper and Nihilanth) in 5 YEARS.

edit: This negative review stays because it while the final product is practically flawless, it doesn't absolve them for being lazy for nearly TEN years ( Counting since moddb launch, and by their own admission on articles/forums over the years, coined ""busy"" by them despite knowing full well they took money and had no excuse after going gold on Steam) and that my friends still passed away, paying full money for a product they never got to see to the end.",1498052729,1704744169,False,825,72,0.609295189380645752,86,True,False,True

Gameplay: We are a Theoretical Physicist graduated from Harvard University named Gordon Freeman, being new to Black Mesa, and we arrived late on the first day of work in the middle of a test in the animal materials sector, which tests the theory of teleportation. .

Achievements: They are divided into two sections: One in Black Mesa and Two in Xen the border world. Including somewhat challenging achievements when replaying it.

Soundtracks: Joel Nielsen, composer of these incredible songs, we thank him for creating the best soundtrack and themes for Black Mesa. In my opinion, there is none that he cannot listen to even if he is not playing.

Later I  played HL2  several times and loved it. So, now Black Mesa. With the good reviews and  the need to catch up  I gave it a try.  Maybe this makes my review difficult. Because it is a remaster, I really don‚Äôt  know , what was changed. And because it is kinda a fanmade, I feel less entitled to throw shade on the makers, but I have too. It is strictly a review without a look on the original.

Playing this was a frustrating experience, most of the time. Little time it felt like a good Half Life game because of the annoyances. 
The design decisions made here, didn‚Äôt ¬¥t feel intuitive. The environment was often confusing to navigate. There were no clear objectives. No clue what to do, besides a little exposition from some npcs on the way forward.  Just advance through the level. Yes, got to the surface. Fire up rocket engine to go past an annoying enemy. Take the rail card to start a rocket. What rocket. But why? This couldn¬¥t even be considered a story. I caught myself reloading several times, because it felt like I locked myself out by not taking the right path. And then got awarded an Achievement  for taking an alternative path. But obviously I was just running around disoriented. On another note. I stopped by a radio broadcast or radio chatter in hopes for more exposition. I liked these efforts,  but overall this part was minuscule. As the protagonist with two PhDs, an HEV suit, loads of weaponry I still know less than a simple guard, who tells you where to go next., but not really why. And yes, they can go along and fight with you, but perish fast or stop at the next corner and say: This is as far as I go, Dr Freeman.‚Äú 

While trying to find clues how to kill my first boss: After unloading half of my ammo, I reckoned it is bulletproof, I strayed further and thought I skipped the fight unwillingly. After another hour running around and activating this and that I suddenly circled back to said boss and switched another switch to defeat it. Nice progress. The platforming is abominable, especially with the floaty movement. I spent over an hour and dozens of deaths in the waste disposal section looking for a way through. And when I thought I got the right way, I circle directly back to the beginning of the section. Thats not fun!!!

Enemy A.I was overly odd, often laughably bad. Marines were hitting me pinpoint from afar or shooting  through walls and boxes. Sometimes they lock themselves by shooting where I was a second ago, like a wall or vent entrance, shouting ‚ÄûHe¬¥s hit.‚Äú  One time I switched to a grenade and cooking it, while hiding behind a corner and  a Marine was shouting ‚ÄûGranade‚Äú before I even throw it in his line of sight . Same place after a reload (because of low health). Same marines fearlessly began shooting at said corner and then end blowing up themselves. On another occasion I managed to walk directly in front of marines and they didn‚Äôt  notice me at all. And their taunts are were out of place and cringe at best. Listening to marines chat could add to the story and immersion. But it was mostly idle chatter.  ‚ÄûYou got nothing. NOTHING!‚Äú Yeah, nothing to immerse me.

Weapons felt bugged too. Shotguns shots to a zombie head or a headcrab to my feet failed to register entirely, while a marine running erratically left and right was hitting me with a shotgun spread from 10+ meters (or 11yrds ;) away with every shot. Same  goes  for the  MP5. Marines can snipe you with theirs, when the recoil of your MP5  makes it a pain to shoot even on short distances.  Not to mention I never noticed a marine reloading his weapon.

Autaosave function was and is particularly annoying.  Clearly you quick save on your own, when needed. But the game makes also saves without noticing at the inconvenient of moments. Nearly every time I ended up being autoloaded in the middle of a tough fight with low health  or simply while falling to my death.

Xen, as I know, got the most remade. It was nice to look at and  I got a little environmental storytelling out of it. But really was dragged out. On one hand Gonarch boss fight could be considered intense. But  also badly designed. While getting chased by her, in some moments you see the opportunity do some damage. Too bad.  Nothing tells you, that in this particular section she simply is invincible. Oh, but later with no way out you suddenly are allowed to do damage.  At that point I didn‚Äôt care anymore.  Here the normal game loop: go there, press this button, use this switch, felt dumb, because it conveniently forwarded your progress, while it¬¥s a hostile and alien environment. Logically you cannot know what this alien switch does, but conveniently its distinguishable by a red or green colour. F*** unforeseen consequences. Here vortigaunts were stupidly unbothered by your interference in their work as slaves. In other places they actively help you. 

These overwhelming positive reviews  were written through rose tinted nostalgia glasses of our 17yo selves and how groundbreaking the original was. ‚ÄûOh, I remember this part, now it‚Äôs far better made.‚Äú  Maybe reviewed it positively solely because they appreciate the work put this remake by people, who maybe are also gamers and not developers. As we know, gamers very often make a game better.  But good intentions don‚Äôt make a good game. I can not tell you, if they made the original better. Of YOU feel so, and you liked Black Masa, i am okay with it. I can tell you, I was not satisfied playing this sorry effort at 90 percent of my playtime. At some points I wasn‚Äôt enticed to finish it particularly, when I became ware of the numerous flaws. I cannot shake the feeling,  the same gameplay with the same levels, but without being Half Life, would be far worse received.

However, there are a few things that generally put me off of giving this game a third go.

The music honestly feels like a downgrade, and in choosing this modern-era version of an older game, it loses a lot of the OG Half Life charm (while still creating its own, however).

Marines and their turrets need a bit of a tone-down. Their reaction times are instantaneous and their aim is nearly perfect, neither of which were issues even in the original. It makes encounters with these enemies a little less enjoyable than they could be, although they certainly don't ruin the game.

The biggest issue with this game is the final handful of levels, those being any after entering Xen. The pacing drags to a total halt, the game preferring to make platforming puzzles and plug/switch puzzles a priority over the otherwise amazing combat. Half Life was always a part-time puzzle game, but not to the extent that it took over the helm. These levels go on for an absurdly long time and massively overstay their welcome, to the point where both times I played this game, I really felt the urge to just give up on the experience altogether.

Still, Black Mesa is, as previously stated, an awesome Half Life game and is honestly probably my favorite Half Life in the series, even if technically unofficial. Not to mention, it is the best looking game I have ever seen on this engine. For an entirely fan-made project, it is one hell of a feat.",1704601029,1704601531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, play the first Halflife. The OG Halflife. You won't appreciate Black Mesa as much without that experience. (And you'll miss the Zen section of the OG Halflife after you play the Zen levels in Black mesa.)

First off. I love Halflife. I do. Admittedly, I would have to say that Halflife 1 is my least favorite of the games, but none of sequels would've existed without the first, so for that I am thankful. With that being said, This game is a remake of the original Halflife. How does it do? Well, it is definitely more visually appealing and more mechanically solid. But, Its very, very different. Some of the mechanics from Halflife 2 are present in the game. (Which I love) But It does take away from the original's formula admittedly. Also, whoever axed the train cart section, I wanna kiss you  on the lips personally. That was easily the second worst section of the OG Halflife and I'm glad Black Mesa got rid of it. With that being said, Whoever signed off on the zen levels... I want to personally gouge your eyes out. At first Zen is cool! Its so pretty and fun and the parkor, while a tad silly, is interesting! But after that, It goes downhill; quick... I get it, you had to do something to make Zen different. Zen was also a sore spot for HL1, so you didn't have much to go off of. But you took it too far with this Zen. The entire factory section was a bore. I could have lived without it. If anything, I wanted to see myself team up with Vortigaunts akin to the last few levels of HL2 and fight the Controllers and the Nihilanth and free the Vortigaunts and earn my status as ""The Free Man.'' But no, Even the Gonarch fight is tedious and overly drawn out. I HATED the Gonarch fight in HL1, And I will admit I did Enjoy the Gonarch Fight more in Black Mesa, I must admit it's weird how much time we spend running from it. Lastly, The Nihilanth boss fight... Its more cinematic, I'll give it that, but it's not much of an improvement on the original. I wish the Zen levels in Black Mesa were more condensed and were shorter. The factory section did not need to be that long. Zen as a whole did not need to be that long. Other than that, This game is good. I don't want to say its better than HL1, This game is very different mechanically and structurally, but it is a good remake. its not a remaster, Its a remake. 8/10.",1704578123,1704578123,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It is a great re-imagining that mostly works and injects a new nostalgia-like excitement into the 25-year-old original. Outside of a little jankiness here and there (getting stuck on geometry, the ladders are still a problem and some crashing), if you like Half-Life, play it, it is good. 

HOWEVER, when people look back at 1998's Half-Life they tend to think the Xen chapters are weak and... they are. They are frustrating, unbalanced, and ugly. Luckily, those chapters were brief in the original game. In Black Mesa, the overhauled Xen levels are a lengthy, frustrating and monotonous slog. Without Valve's original level design as a guide, the expansion of these levels feel out of place. The initial excitement of seeing the beautifully re-imagined Xen quickly melts away as you're forced to do one PLUG PUZZLE after another. These padded out chapters completely kill the momentum of the game. Should that keep you from playing Black Mesa? Absolutely not. 

Black Mesa does do a few things right with Xen. The long jump is better, the Vortigaunts' plight is more fleshed out and the final Nihilanth battle is far more satisfying.",1704399888,1704400060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest gripes are with weapon damage, enemy health, the pacing of some chapters, and a handful of achievements that are a slog to get. If you are playing Half-Life for the first time, you would be much better off playing the original first.

SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE GAME ARE IN THIS REVIEW

Black Mesa is a remake of Half-Life that tweaks the original game's mechanics, overhauls graphics and sound design, adds many new sections to several chapters, completely revamps the last few chapters of the game, and includes achievements for completionists. For a fan remake, it is a very impressive project that deserves to be celebrated as a tribute to one of the most influential video games ever made. That being said, as someone who is a huge fan of the original game (around 70 hours in the original as of writing), this remake disappointed me in several aspects. By the time I was finished with my playthrough on hard, I was glad to be finished.

The first issue I had with the game was the graphics and sound design. The environments do look aesthetically pleasing in many parts of the game and the sounds aren't annoying or intrusive, but they go for an extremely realistic look that takes away the character and charm from the original game's graphics/sound. That's not to say that realistic graphics are inherently bad, but Black Mesa lacks its own unique identity in that regard and feels generic with the exception of the Xen chapters. Most of the sections inside the facility are uninteresting, grey, and have sporadic lighting across different sections. Also, the soundtrack tries to go for a more epic vibe throughout the entire game which feels at odds with the original game's more grounded tone. The worst example for me was at the end of Blast Pit as I did not appreciate music suddenly blasting as I burned the tentacle monster. You don't need music to tell you how to feel in any important given section; that was the beauty of the original using music more sparingly.

Next, there are the changes made to damage scaling and health. Unlike the original game, Black Mesa on hard difficulty is very generous with the amount of health and suit armor you get from charging stations, and for good reason. Black Mesa's enemies can drain your health and suit armor in moments with plenty of enemies being buffed. A great example is the bullsquid, who now fires a spread shot at you instead of one projectile. This is an issue because of the numerous times you go around a corner to be greeted by a bullsquid blast to the cranium. Enemy health is also reduced, but the changes feel entirely unnecessary and makes the game completely different to play, despite there not really being much wrong with the combat mechanics in the original game. One chapter, specifically Lambda Core, replaces many of the alien grunts from the original game with vortigaunts, making most of the chapter's difficulty entirely negated by just running around and using the shotgun on everything.

The military AI is also a low point in the game's design because most of the time, they just decide to fire in the continuous direction you're in and throw several grenades at you, despite this being illogical and implying that they have infinite ammo. Rarely do they try and advance upward, which is bad because the player is left doing nothing except waiting around for an opportunity to sneak a few shots in, which isn't very fun. During one section in On A Rail, there was a point to where I waited for five minutes straight around a corner because there were six military soldiers just constantly shooting down the doorway. I eventually just decided to tank some damage because I had no other option.

The Xen chapters, while much more interesting and beautiful to go through, are also significantly longer with plenty of achievements which resulted in me spending nearly half of my playtime in Xen. Specifically, Gonarch's Lair and Interloper were elongated to include more chases from Gonarch, an abundance of plug puzzles during Interloper, and an extended stay in the factory which included dodging lasers and fighting off alien controllers. Interloper was by far my least favorite chapter in the game because it was long, tedious, and had two of the most painstaking achievements which included dodging lasers for the whole chapter and not killing any vortigaunts for the entire chapter. The chapter is hours long by itself! The Xen chapters also have you finding 64 protozoans that you have to shoot across three chapters, a Cyanogen tank you have to carry around for one chapter, and several one-off achievements that essentially make half of the achievements locked behind Xen alone. If you play the game, I would recommend just not going for achievements once you get to Xen, they're not worth it.

Speaking of the achievements, there are two achievements included that are very irritating: one involving carrying a hidden hat to the end of the game and another where you carry an open pizza box halfway through the game. I did not do these achievements because Black Mesa is significantly longer  than the original and I did not want to awkwardly carry around items through a 12 hour game twice over. I already did it for one chapter and that alone required several loaded saves.

The changes to the level design and areas are sometimes good, but I only found a couple of the chapters to be improved upon, specifically Office Complex, ""We've Got Hostiles!"", and Questionable Ethics. In the case of Unforeseen Consequences and Surface Tension, significant rooms are shuffled out of order and the chapters are made longer even though they were a solid length in the original. For On A Rail, they shortened the chapter greatly and removed many of the spontaneous military encounters which made the chapter engaging and exciting. Those are just a couple of examples, but if you are expecting to relive the chapters in Half-Life, you're likely in for a rude awakening.

Lastly, story elements are also missing or tweaked in this fan remake. One great example is how in On A Rail, the conversation between the two soldiers has them say Gordan is ""killing marines"" instead of ""killing my buddies."" This might seem like a small change, but it completely removes the personal touch of that scene. The Nihilanth at the end of the game is also more powerful and missing the chains it had in the original, changing it from a being something which is merely a slave to greater overlords to seemingly the one in charge, completely muffling Nihilanth's role in the greater story.

Black Mesa isn't a terrible game; if you are a fan of the original game, you can get some enjoyment out of seeing the classic stages and environments redone in high definition and seeing how the fans reimagined the scenes. Some changes are really good too, like making some cryptic puzzles in the original more obvious and making unfair sections like the snipers in Surface Tension more telegraphed and fun. My opinion is very mixed, but I gave it a negative rating because I'm curious as to why they didn't just make an entirely new Half-Life inspired game if they were going to tweak nearly every single aspect of the game other than the characters and settings.

If you do decide to play this game though, ignoring the tedious achievements near the end of the game, playing on an easier difficulty, and having sprint always be turned on are my recommendations for getting the most enjoyment out of the game (always sprint is off by default, I couldn't imagine how slow the game would be without always sprinting!).",1704319224,1704336342,False,19,1,0.593244969844818115,2,True,False,False

Almost everything from the original game has been improved to such a degree that I can say for certain that this is the definitive way of experiencing it.
It's so damn atmospheric and immersive, even more so than the OG, things just have so much impact, and you're constantly with this feeling of dread and hopelessness due to literally everything being against you at every moment, with everything you have to accomplish, yet, somehow you manage to pull through and beat the odds everytime, and it's just so good.
It even has new crazy good additions, like the completely redone Xen part of the game, which is such a beautiful and vast improvement, I can't even put it into words.
I have barely anything to criticise about this, the only things that come to mind are the voice acting being a little mediocre at times and the sound design for the guns that could've been better.

A couple areas where this game made some key changes beyond the graphical and engine update is the Xen levels and the music, both of which put the original game to shame. Xen never ceases to be gorgeous and the music is always captivating. 

In fact, there is almost too much extra Xen. Where the original game's end levels could be knocked out in an afternoon, now I swear it is almost half the game. Finally, I really wish the developers didn't require you to push two buttons to jump.

I really do actually enjoy the gameplay of both this and the original. I don't know if it's just me that's terrible at it, or if Half-Life is just eternally cursed to have terrible platforming. I might just be having one long Cuphead moment, but Residue Processing in both the original and this make me want to pull my eyes out of my skull in frustration. I like the visuals and design and SFX of everything I've experienced thus far, it's literally just that I can't make a jump to save my life.
Anyway, whining about platforming aside, it's very good, and I'd recommend it for the time I've spent on it.
I HOPE for a remake of the DLCs since they were also pretty dope, but I don't imagine it'll be given the green-light. Nonetheless, despite how unlikely it may be, I wait for the day when the path to paradise shall be opened.
TL;DR: 8/10, good stuff, minor complaints with platforming, plus there's a couple visual glitches and weird little things that I've noticed while playing, so it's definitely not perfect, but I'd be telling a massive lie if I said I wasn't having a good time.",1704146751,1704146751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Black Mesa, the Half-Life remake, offers a genuinely good experience, although my preferences still lean towards the original (non-Source) version of the game. The changes to AI behavior left me somewhat disappointed, as the original's nuances and tighter gameplay are missed.

While the remake's effort in modernizing the classic is commendable, the Xen levels, even in the original, weren't a highlight. In Black Mesa, these levels, unfortunately, drag a bit, compounding my mixed feelings about the overall experience. Despite these reservations, Black Mesa serves as a decent entry point for newcomers to the iconic series but may not fully capture the essence of the original for longtime fans.

The level design also makes a lot more sense  due to the adding of a lot more labs security stations or rooms to just explore. Xen to is also vastly improved even though interloper is still a chore. HOWEVER this game has a lot of flaws game play and ( contradictory to what i just said level design wise mostly in questionable ethics, and surface tension. The games combat is way harder than in the original half life especially on hard mode, and no this isn't a good thing. The game ads several extra gun fights that weren't  their in the original game. and these rant just easy fights, no they give you 20,30 solders to fight with barely any healing afterwards, just to throw you into a similar fight a minute later. ( though the soundtrack during those fights is very good). I counted 5 fights threw the end of questionable ethics and the beginning of surface tension all 30 seconds- a minute apart. I wouldn't mind a couple extra gun fights in the game hell the fight in the end of questionable ethics was in my opinion necessary , but don't give me another 4 fights after that one of equal difficulty. All in all if your looking to play half life for the first time play the original 1998 version and then play black mesa, if like me your already a die hard half life fan than yeah id recommend giving black mesa a go it will definatly be a fun new experience.

You can run the game under Proton to bypass all the issues with the Linux port. However you'll crash after a few maps loads. My theory is the game doesn't seem to free up video memory between maps, so so once you've loaded enough maps you'll fill up your video memory and the game will crash once you've run out. (AMD only issue, to my knowledge)

I managed to power through the crashes and finish the game yet again, but it was annoying beyond belief. At least my graphics card has 24GB of VRAM so I can at least load 4 maps before crashing. But it just seems like a huge joke to me that this game somehow still, is in a completely broken state on Linux. I've played for many hours on Windows, but I have since moved on from that operating system since Microsoft has made many questionable choices on their operating system over the years, and I have simply moved on from their joke operating system.

I honestly don't understand why the game continues to act like it's a completed product when you advertise Linux support. You clearly don't support it, and should simply remove that version and only distribute the Windows version. Seriously devs, play the Linux version for 20 seconds and you'll see what a broken piece of shit you have released. It's a fucking joke. 

I've thoroughly enjoyed this game since it's first release in 2012, and followed you all the way to Xen, and the definitive release. I bought this game multiple times for my friends and family because how amazing I thought it was. Only to discover a couple years later that your Linux port is plain broken and was never addressed.

It's great to play the old game without worrying about the old graphics
For example, XEN looks really alien when you first see the world.

There are a few minor points:
a long game is good, but sometimes it feels too long, and it shouldn't be that way
A big problem for me was the error NO FREE EDICTS.
The design team seems aware of this, but it can't or won't be fixed?

ambitious is the only positive attribute to this attempt of a remake

It‚Äôs about a physicist name Gordon Freeman where there‚Äôs an experiment gone wrong where a bunch of aliens warps to their world from Xen and wreaks havoc onto the Black Mesa Research Facility. It‚Äôs up to Gordon to stop them and figure out where the source is coming from just so they won‚Äôt come to his world. This was the first video game that I played in years that I decided to return to and beat all the way through. I‚Äôve been meaning to play this because I‚Äôm a fan of the Half-Life series, and I remember this being in development for almost a decade until it‚Äôs finally released. Since I already know the story of Half-Life, I‚Äôve seen gameplay footage of the game in the facility and Xen itself where I knew I had to get it. I bought it years ago but didn‚Äôt play it due to a lack of motivation to even play video games in general where I didn‚Äôt see the point. That is until I gained over 1000 followers on TikTok where I can livestream video games where I finally have a reason to go play Black Mesa. So I set it up, played it, and absolutely loved it.

The story is relatively the same, which is still amazing. It‚Äôs relatively simple, but it gets the job done to go from point A to point B, and you‚Äôre left with the gameplay, which is the main seller of the game. The gameplay is a lot of fun that you never get tired of getting rid of the aliens and as you progress through the game, you get new weapons that look amazing in design and pack a wallop that gives off such satisfying sound effects to the weapons. My favorite weapon is the Gulon that has such an impactful beam that is an absolute delight to use that I‚Äôm glad the remake made it just as effective. The graphics are a massive improvement over the original game that I‚Äôm genuinely surprised that this is the same engine Crowbar Collective used as it was used in Half-Life 2 because of the details that you can tell they worked so hard on, and it shows.

This is probably about as challenging to play as the original, if not more so, but it never felt unfair as you have to be strategic on how you play the game against enemies that are not easy to beat. Especially when you face harder enemies in the later parts of the game that can be a pain in the ass to take care of. The score by Joel Nielsen does a fantastic job of recreating the score of the original that fits with the atmosphere of the game while also adding some new stuff that works to the game‚Äôs advantage. Especially when you get to the Xen level. My God when you get introduced to the level, not only does it feel like a different game while still keeping the Half-Life gameplay elements, but it looks so beautiful. 

When you hear the singing in the background while showing Xen at its full potential, it‚Äôs absolutely wonderful that it feels so otherworldly like you discover something on your own and cherish this discovery. While I wasn‚Äôt too fond of Xen in the original game, this was expanded like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. See with Crowbar Collective, they finished the main part of the game where you can play it for a long time, until you get to Xen, which wasn‚Äôt finished at the time. So it took years for that to be finished, and the wait was worth it. It‚Äôs a lot bigger and longer to get through where you feel the world of Xen around you that you understand why it took them so long to finish Xen. The puzzles were harder but still felt ultimately rewarding that you felt good about it. The only issue I have is that one of the Xen levels was so long to get through that it almost became a chore to beat and I just wondering how long is this level going to be. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs terrible, it just felt slightly tedious and the enemies were becoming more of a pain in my ass. But the last part of that level was the most therapeutic part that I just felt like a God at that point. Black Mesa is one of the best remakes I‚Äôve played that I‚Äôm glad the number of years in development leading up to this that is quite an achievement.

What I don't like is the entire factory section which I think is near the end of the game.  It is nothing but conveyor belts, crates, trampolines, and mobs.  I am not sure which set of alien clowns designed this factory where crates fall off of a conveyor belt, onto a trampoline to get launched hundreds of feet into the air to land on another conveyor belt.  

The clowns at Crowbar Collective were probably sitting around one day asking, ""How can we take this 10 hour game and extend it to 15 hours?""  ""Oh!, I know! Let's add en entire section dedicated to stupid human tricks that has nothing to do with the story line!"".

There are way too many changes to list, so i'm going to only name the most important ones for a short overview. 

The remake adds overworked graphics including much sharper textures, new character models and better effects, revised and improved level environments (Xen just looks beautiful), enhanced gameplay including a way better weapon handling and smoother movement. You will have to overcome a good amount of cool oldschool puzzles, while listening to a very atmospheric soundtrack, that really underlines the tone of every different setpiece. 

Black Mesa enhances the original in every way possible, while also being able to preserve the core soul of Half Life. Remaking an old classic title does not always work and can lead to a completely screwed up experience for the player. Here it just worked in a phenomenal way. The people who worked on this game can truly be proud of themselves. You should really give it a try, it's 100% worth it.

It is just plain awesome, has incredible graphics for the source engine and with Xen having an absolutely stunning visual style. The transformation of the maps from the original to the remake is also incredibly impressive, they really went out of their way to make it so great.

The gameplay? Expect to be much slower paced than original Half-Life but that is not a disadvantage at all, it tells the story just as great if not better sometimes and Xen... you need to play through original Xen and Black Mesa Xen to understand just how great it is. There's also built-in multiplayer though it seems most people have forgotten about it, apparently you can even play co-op with your friends too.

And then there's the soundtrack; it captivates the feeling of the world perfectly, especially the Xen tracks which just go all out on you, you'll definitely be living in the moment when you're playing through the game.

Additionally, you got the steam workshop which provides various addons on top of the existing game or flat out entire mods/modded campaigns.

When you're fighting enemies, you're experiencing an adrenaline rush. In order for the game to be satisfying, the rush should slowly decay on its own, as you transition from one point to another, to then be either refueled with adrenaline, or for it to fade away completely. However, in this game, the moment you start getting an adrenaline rush, it abruptly ends in a very unsatisfying manner, while you're left there wondering how to get to more enemies. Never realizing that you entered a new puzzle. The puzzles are really annoying. The locations are like navigating a labyrinth, and combined with the confusing and unsatisfying puzzles, the whole game just starts feeling like torture. The combat doesn't help either, but it is the best mechanic in the game. That does not make it great, however.

This game gets a lot of simps who bump up its rating, as they have nostalgia with Halflife, which this game is a recreation of.

Don't judge a book by the cover, judge it by the hat. I could tell you so much about this allegedly wonderful game but so far I only have seen [b]The Hat.[/b] I think there were some beautiful sights on the way and this isn't even touching on Xen yet, of course as it should have, the game showed us what GoldSrc never could but it's just unfortunate for me because all I could see was [b]The Hat.[/b] I can only guess the intention the devs had on mind when they launched these primitive and uninspiring achievements to possibly ruin all the good impression that might have been of this so called amazing game. I'm sorry but in my time of dying, crying and lying to myself, [b]The Hat[/b] was all I did see in front of me. I wish but I wasn't as fortunate this time around, I wanted to enjoy the game, have fun and glaze at all the graphical advances I heard you have made but each time I threw my eye with hope I saw reflection of a clown face smiling back at me wearing that very [b]HAT[/b] on top..

[b]The Hat, The Pizza &...[/b]

You know I tried to reason but I'm only human, I only can do this much to hold it back. And when [b]The Pizza[/b] came in, I started losing it through and through. Suppose you wanted to give us an arcade, a challenge. Prolonging the hours, eh? Giving us something you somehow thought we would enjoy, I see. I don't care what the idea was, you only nullified all that impressive work you all did because all I had time and mind to care for was, you name it, [b]The Hat & The Pizza.[/b] I was too scared to lose sight of it because as we know it, this product isn't capable of sustaining itself and you can never rely on the fact that this thing costs money and it's being released on Steam, it still will crush sometimes, it will freeze and eventually crush later. All that while juggling what? Right, [b]The Hat & The Pizza.[/b] Pieces of what had left of me by that point managed to keep life in me albeit in a diminishing manner, it's at that moment that I spotted [b]The Cyanogen Can[/b] laying on the table there... I didn't want to do it anymore, the game consumed me. I totally forgot about the plot, reason and time. Felt like I was in a dream, very bad one. In hindsight I did it, but it was the ultimate worst gaming experience I ever have had, because.. Because all my life revolved around [b]The Hat, The Pizza & The Cyanogen Can.[/b] I didn't not enjoy the game, I hated it and I hated everyone who had anything to do with it. They ruined everything they worked on, to do such a gigantic job and then throw it all away on such imbecillic achievements is a feat not many can replicate. Nothing remains but the utter disappointment of what could have been and what we have gotten for a fact. You don't have even a proper mechanic for props to interact with you, to pick up and carry. It's still broken as hell. Many a texture layer isn't even physical, only visible, props go through it and get lost forever. This game is a torture, all you will ever see, do and know are [b]The Hat, The Pizza & The Cyanogen Can[/b]. F*ck you devs, just so you know, I did the achievements. Not for you to be angry, but for me to be glad. The game is a mess and it takes overlooping of special kind by special minds to not once, not even twice, but three times a charm you're adding this neanderthal challenge to this otherwise a great game. You didn't remake sh*t, you didn't revive nothing. You killed your own potential master piece with, come on kids, [b]The Hat, The Pizza & The Cyanogen Can[/b]. Hope you're happy now? It's a stinky crap!

While it largely sticks close to its source material, Crowbar Collective wasn't afraid to shy away from it either in an effort to improve upon the mistakes of the original title. Half-Life's universe defined my teenage years, due in part to its excellent world building, atmosphere, and gunplay. Black Mesa lives up to the standards set by Valve Software, building a world made to envelop you as you set foot in the Black Mesa Research Facility, and beyond as seen in the later chapters. As a fan, I loved exploring every nook and cranny of the research facility, there really is an admirable level of attention to detail. That being said, I think it's important to mention its faults too; I found a few chapters (notably Xen) to really drag on. Love it or hate it, this game isn't without its fair share of Source Engine jank, but to say that this title doesn't push the engine to its limits feels like an understatement.

Do you want to experience a modernized and better polished Half-Life 1 experience? Forget it. Just download the original and use mods.

Let's start with the good thing about this game: It's really pretty. It's really nice to revisit old areas with the much better level design, and higher quality models and textures.

Now the bad. You better sit down because it's a long list. This game not only refuses to fix the old problems the original game had, but also makes some of them even worse and noticeable.

Let's start with the presentation. The devs did not think that the majority of the players of this game already played the original game to death, and the last thing they want is to sit down for 10 minutes and three loading screens and watch the annoying tram ride. And then another 10 minutes going through the labs getting your suit. Dude, we have done this a thousand times. I don't want to do this again, even with the new fancy graphics. Please, allow players to start off from chapter 3.

When the intro ended and I was ready to start smashing some headcrabs with my crowbar, here is the first disappointment. They changed the levels for the worse. You don't get the crowbar right after the resonance cascade anymore. You need to go through a ridiculous new section unarmed where you must babysit a braindead AI guard. You must use flares (??????) to light up zombies (which is very poorly done by the way) until you can find the crowbar several minutes later. Things started off bad.

The original tedious and soothing atmosphere of Half-Life received no care either. Most of the game is still dead silent and most of the audio comes from your footsteps and a few ambient sounds here and there creating soothing white noise. They could had added some new ambient music, more interesting ambient sounds to create a tense atmosphere like how Doom 3 did but nope. It was completely ignored.

When you get real combat starts, you there was no improvement at all. Today I noticed a glitch happened that allowed me to choose any chapter, so I decided to try Surface Tension and check the real combat. And for my disapointment, the marines are even more boring to fight than what I remember. Enemies are bullet sponges that poorly reacts to your attacks. Everything is exactly the same, except instead of having their own death animations, they just have generic ragdolls. Guns received no improvements and still feels dated. Games such as Left 4 Dead and Day of Infamy (also made by a small indie team with a small budget) have proven that this engine is still kicking and is capable of making great gunplay, satisfying gore, enemies that reacts realistically when being shot at. And unfortunately none of the polishment went to the combat. The bad aspects of the combat could be ignored in the original game with old graphics, but for the modern standards, they cannot. The new HD graphics makes the bad combat even more noticeable and harder to ignore.

While I appreciate the effort the devs have put to make the game look better, the things that really mattered, the real problems Half-Life 1 had, none of them were addressed, and new problems were inserted instead. And this is really disappointing. This feels more like a Half-Life 2 mod than a proper new game. It was supposed to be a remake and it feels like it came in 2010, and could already use mods and a new remaster to improve the experience.  You may notice this game has overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews. This is because all these people wanted was HL1 with better graphics, at any cost, even if the cost is making the base game worse. If this is what you want, go ahead, but this definitely not for me, I'd rather play HL1 with mods.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

EDIT: After giving this game another try 4 years later and after several patches, my opinion still stands that this game is not fun.

Level layout is confusing. There are SO MANY doors that can't be opened. Added absolutely nothing. If you compare to the original game, most doors that cant be opened used to look visibly broken or different from ones that you can open. Here, they look all the same. Many times you will die trying to escape an Vortigaunt attacks and soldiers fire while trying to go for a door that you can't open. So many dead ends. So much pointless routes. So much pointless vent crawling. I grabbed the free version of the OG game to check if I am not being mistaken by rose tinted nostalgia glasses, and nope, the original game had none of these issues I am mentioning here.

You find out that the mappers really didn't knew how to do their jobs when you get to the freezer section early in the game. Now there is a HL2 styled puzzle of finding the missing valve for an elevator to cross the gap between vents. This wasn't here in the original game. You google ""Black Mesa Freezer section"" you will find out that a lot of people had problems with that. This indicates that this, and many other puzzles/areas were not added because devs wanted to improve the game experience, but just to artificially stretch the game's length and justify making this a commercial product. This adds nothing to the game. It's not fun. And most importantly, it's not necessary.

Again, the effort taken to make this is surely monumental. But the result is not something worth money.",1583539472,1703384161,False,21,13,0.331160038709640503,4,True,False,False

Visually impressive.
Good audio and good music (however I found the NPC's voices to be a little too quiet and decided to turn the subtitles on).
Good but standard controls.
For story and world building I consider this the de facto Half-Life 1 experience now. So much was built and expanded on, much more life added to characters, events, and things happening in the background (but you might not appreciate it as much if the original game wasn't a new experience for you).

The new Xen area was particularly great with so much life breathed into it compared to the original game. Seeing a proper alien world with alien life was a lot of fun for me. I feel like it was treated as lost chapter or book, and they showed the story tie in to the second game.

Longer than the original game by a few hours, though still not a long game as you can see I beat it in 16 hours (on normal difficult) and I spent probably at least an hour of that time just breathing in the upgraded and new environments.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

And I've played Half Life 2 all the way through on hard. This is basically like a visual improvement of Half Life 1 of the Earth part and a remake of the Xen (alien world) part.

Half Life/Black Mesa is a game of hazards, surprise attacks, and tense FPS combat, with many various enemies in many various environments, situations, terrain, etc. It's also got a bit of ""science"" puzzles throughout, that you have to solve. If you're easily frustrated then you will have a hard time playing through this game, especially on harder difficulty. If you do manage to make it all the way through the game, though, you'll definitely have proven something. It's a real challenge, in many different respects, that I don't think I've experienced in any other games I've played. The storyline is somewhat compelling as well.

Just keep in mind: Be ready to save and load a lot, and die repeatedly in a couple of areas; that just comes with the nature of this game. You can be extra careful, and still end up dying a lot. You can move quickly, and die because you were moving too quickly and rushed into danger; you can move slowly, and die because you were moving too slowly to avoid harm. You can look around, and get whacked in the head by something while you weren't looking ahead; you can have tunnel vision, and something will jump out at you from the side or behind. You can conserve ammo, and lose your battles; you can expend ammo, and run out. It's all annoying, complex, difficult, challenging, hard to predict, and tense; but, that's also why I like the game, there's not really any one ""right way"" or ""best way"" to play the game. You just have to kind of learn and adapt and have a multifaceted approach to beating every type of challenge the game throws at you. Definitely pay close attention at all times (what am I missing? what do I still need to do? have I looked around for enemies? is this area safe?), and be ready for tense combat, in which you need to move, hide, run, strafe, peek, snipe, aim, shoot, reload, jump, etc., all in a few seconds.

Most of the Earth part of the campaign was more-or-less the same in this, as far as I can remember, as it was in the original. It's probably better than the original just for sheer improved graphics. The Xen part of the campaign (alien world) is like 80+% different than what I remember; it definitely resembles many aspects of the campaign from the original, but it's still different. Worth playing through, for sure, even if you played the original (and liked it). (P.S. The Xen soundtrack in this game is great!)

One thing that is pretty cool in Black Mesa is that it bridges the gap between the one type of aliens going from our enemies in Half Life 1 to our allies in Half Life 2 (and no I don't really consider that a spoiler). In the original, they're purely our enemy, throughout the whole game; in Black Mesa, it shows how they're actually kinda not. If I say more then it would be a spoiler, but suffice it to say I liked what they did with this concept in Black Mesa. It's also kinda cool how they show a lot of Xen things to be the equivalent of something that you interact with on the Earth side, even though they look completely different or whatever. It makes it feel more familiar even though you're on a totally foreign planet, a very interesting dynamic.

TL;DR
its a retelling of the events that took place in black mesa with its own identity (gameplay, artstyle & music) that has a very rich understanding of the original and the larger world of half life.
to me its storytelling is one of its biggest strenghts and the gameplay is also pretty fun and challenging, although i may preffer the simplicity of the original, i only say this so that people also consider giving the original a try,  its definitely a great starting point if youve considered playing through the half life series",1703235618,1703235618,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Lack of attention to detail, badly scripted events that didn't work well, npc's waiting or getting stuck during scenes.
The crowbar feels like HL1 which is for the better, except almost all material properties have been set wrong.

I always adored the attention to detail in Half Life 2 where hitting something with the crowbar would sound right. Plastic would sound like plastic, metal like metal. Dirt, sand, bricks, flesh. All would have it's own sound.
Much to my dismay a lot of the rocks in Black Mesa apparently consists of plastic, as does many of the flesh and metal pieces in Xen. Hell the metal elevators in xen even made plastic crate physics sounds when moving which can only be an oversight. 

I gotta admit I was turned off. Recycle bins that would tip themselves up again, like there's a force added to their upright parameters, Random can sounds often playing.

I got stuck in on rails due to a bug where I couldn't go back and get the train cart for a part where it was necessary. I couldn't find a save, nor any way to know how far back it would be.

I've seen better G-man impressions than the voice actor for him in this game.

Weapon feel could be better, and I miss the vacuum sound of the gluon gun. But weapon feel is just the source engines default.

Leaving the negatives behind, seeing the game for what it is and it's price. It's actually good. I began enjoying the game in the latter half, from around chapter 12. 
I wanna praise the hard work you did on Xen and keeping it out till it was finished. It was the right call. Xen is amazing, and the music feels great. The twists of Xen seem amazing too, it feels like what Valve would've done if they had time. A great interpretation that I would recommend over the original game.

I think Black Mesas biggest issue is not deviating even more from the original - would've loved more fan-lore in Xen. The deviations are actually the strongest points of the game.
Xen and the chapters leading up to it is why I will recommend the game. Being fair it'll always be worth 14,99 - especially if you haven't played half-life 1 before, or you wish to revisit it.

While the original had a focus on taking advantage of enemy patterns to make a move, Black mesa makes it so the enemies constantly attack you, giving you very little window to plan your own strategies, this being specially evident with the HECU soldiers, which were only able to attack while standing still in the original, making their moves when needed, thus, giving the player time to kill them more securly, making thinking and shooting the most important part of the game. Black Mesa in comparison, resembles too much the combine from Half Life 2, just being hitscanners, making their combat arenas more of a glorified cover shooter than a fast paced one.

Xen is certainly and improvement over the original, but it just drags on for way too long, by the time you encounter Gonark you already begin fighting Nihilanth in the original, and sadly most of it just feels like filler, considering Xen was the climax in the original, it made sense for it to be short, the player had already gone thru a lot, so most of Half Life's cards were already shown, there really isn't that many new things to encounter aside from the bosses and the alien controllers, so for it to be so long just makes it more tedius than interesting specially considering this is a remake, so most players already played the original and just wanted to revisit it.

I love Half Life, but Black Mesa as a remake sadly doesn't quite reach the highs of the original, If you are a player who has not played it before, and plans to experience Half Life, In my honest opinion it's just not a very good option, I's suggest playing the original with MMOD which is listed in the community mods page on steam, in my eyes original will always be the superior alternative, still better than Half Life Source tho.

(Edit, like it even less now, also optimization is pretty ass in xen, runs at like 40 fps in some sections, makes sense due to the held together by duck tape nature of the game, I add this because I have better pc parts now, even with a good cpu, performance is just pisspoor, considering, if u ask me, that the interloper chapter of Xen looks terrible, please make yourself a favor and pick up the original, that's it, updated score)

I grew up wanting to playing a lot of early games in the 8 and 16bit era, and just due to path of life, I played a lot of games that others didn't, you grew up playing mario, I had Halloween Harry.

So many atribute halo as creating and doing things that hadn't been done before, that we had been doing since terminator : futureshock/skynet in the 90s.

When Half-Life came along, the hype just didn't hit me. It had done things we'd seen before, but a lot of others hadn't and wrapped it up into a package that blew many peoples minds.

It didn't blow my mind, I respected what it had done, it was allright, I didn't mind it but it was just a game to me.

I was told to give black mesa a go as it wasn't a direct remake it was a major ""re-imagining"" version of half life with modern features and to be honest, i've tried pushing myself into it and it's just not clicking for me.

This is very much a product for those that already loved the original half life, I have played every half life game, and when HL source came out, I expected that to be like half life with the HD pack from blueshift but in the updated engine and it wasn't even that.

So when I had people telling me from day one where this mod was going I thought awesome for them, half life fans will love that.

Then it became a charged commercial product...... which again I get, it's become a fully fledged game.

But unless you live and breathe half life..... it really feels like ""we have half life at home"" where a lot of changes seem to have been done to avoid infringing, and a lot of other stuff just feels off.

While I can appreciate the work done to make this...... it feels like someone who could have made a completely new game, made an off brand half life.

After forcing this far into it, I played the anniversary addition of half life... and that feeling playing that game for the first time where it's not doing anything new, it's the same game that I played back then where I was like yeah is is ok, others will love it more. It has that feel, it feels like half life.

ah yes, black mesa one of the greatest remake version of black mesa (very better than the remastered of half-life source), the first person shooter uses half-life 1 and half-life 2 based of gameplay developed and pubished by crowbar collective made in modifed and heavily tf2 branch engine, orignaly back in 2005 half-life source came out (note has less bugs before) and it became very bad because almost all features feels orignals so the team worked on black mesa with some footage of it got released from 2008 before the tralier came, it was supresed to be release from 2009 but didnt because the studios didnt finish the game yet, so it came out free from mod version in 2012, the devs said they didnt finish anything yet so they putted it has for beta version, then somehow few months/year valve found out that their remake is good so they asked CC that they want it to publish to steam version and they did, it was published at may 5 2015 (note it was changed to mar 6 2020 after 1.0 version released) they updated and added some graphics, npcs that not featured in original half-life which they trying to making it look like it was refenace to half-life and it did


[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

Black Mesa uses half-life 1 and half-lfie 2 gameplay which i said it earlier.

[h2] Gameplay, Maps, etc [/h2]

Weapons are good but the only change is that they reduced magazine ammo and maxinum ammo, the crowbar feels like original half-life 1, what stands for me is the loud and powerful .357 magnum, the crossbow now has scope (note if you hate it, you can change it in gameplay settings) the rpg now reloads much faster, the soldiers are no longer idiot and asking weird questions (note if you play on normal diffculty and they still feel like idiot try to increase dlffculty), the puzzles are now much smarter and varied but sometime you can get lost in many of the level, the xen is much alot of improvement with beautiful of details and creatures. (note sometimes there is crashes at chapter 17 if you have AMD GPU), Black Mesa also has mulitplayer but almost all players not playing it but hey you can try it by yourself

[h2] Mods [/h2]

Black Mesa also has some mods which is cool features however you have to create custom folder and put it in custom folder, however some mods are outdated which is not recommend to download if you dont know what do i mean about custom folder then check this guide

[h2] Rating of the game [/h2]

This game is doing alot of great job after 16 years of development but there are some issues with it and sometimes there is crash with AMD and they no longer updating which the lastst was june 26 2021, the reason is because they making a new game and no it isnt half-life remake, also the controller doesnt support so you have to follow these steps by yourself, so my rating is 8.9/10",1588680089,1702948250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maps redesigned, some layout changes made the game flows better, all the main elements remained. Xen was completely different. 
Boss fights, they are generally an improvement especially the final boss. Its more intense and overall better experience.

The Gonarch stage started off by Gordan shoot Gonarch enough so it runs away, then the rest of the stage turned into Gonarch chasing Gordan till the end. Why?

What the hell am I supposed to do here?"" and sometimes that can be annoying. Also I refuse to carry a hat for 10 hours. 9/10",1702928843,1702928843,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In general this is a quite polished and nice game. Although this still is a problem for, since this takes quite some of the original feeling. Most people may never think about it but sometimes one felt lost in Half Life - which is exactly how one would feel if entering a science complex, but in Black Mesa one never has this feeling. This is great game design, but takes some of the original feeling, at least for me. 
That said, the game is good and fun and still ahs a great story. So depending on what you'd like you should decide to go either with a modern Black Mesa Half Life or with the old school Half Life.

Old Review:
Guess I'm the only one who disliked this, and I'm not happy to say that either.

But I don't give anything about graphics, I only care about the gameplay. Sadly this like a polished stone while the original half life had it's corners end edges.
On one hand you really have to hate certain spots, some are even useless and just annoying but - those are the situations you remember. Although HL:BM has great graphics, it fails to really catch me. The only areas where I had the old feeling were on (or in?) Xen. There have been a lot of annyoing areas and I really liked that and thats sadly the only thing I can remember of HL:BM. A lot of puzzles have simply vanished or been simplified which I personally think was a bad approach.

But then again, sadly most people want to play only polished games they may not remember in 2 years, I still remember when I first crawled into the server room and a headcrab was crushed by a falling server.",1585384796,1702918627,True,0,0,0.547140598297119141,0,True,False,False

To compare the two directly would be a bit of a folly, I believe. It's been 25 years and, after Valve's lacklustre attempt to recreate their classic title in Source, Crowbar Collective make it work in a satisfying and rich experience. I'd still encourage others to play the original, but there's so much that Black Mesa does right - Xen, for one, though seriously longer than its predecessor - feels like the build-up and dramatic journey it should be to the climax of the narrative.

Xen definitely needed a heavy rework and this did a great job with making it more enjoyable but overall I felt the reworked Xen overstayed it's welcome.

I was very much looking forward to playing through a cornerstone of my childhood, starting out in this felt like returning home. Unfortunately what what in 1999 was a ground breaking story line, is now a pretty 2 dimensional, often tedious and VERY long FPS that feels more like a marathon simulator with weird physics than anything else. Not Crowbar Collective's fault, they did a great job trying to revive this, but the bar has moved and the HL storyline can't ask this kind of time from people anymore. 

I'm now 14 hours in and haven't enjoyed the gameplay for the last 5-6 chapters, only pushing on so as to tick this off my bucketlist. I'm grateful that Crowbar collective built this, and glad I gave it a shot, but this is me officially checking out part way through Surface Tension and continuing with outdoor life IRL.

Visually, while a bit dated (probably due to the long time it had been in development, around 15 years!) it has a ridiculous amount of detail and it's a vast improvement over the original while staying faithful to its design. 

Sound-wise, the voice-acting is fantastic and has a lot more lines than the original did. The soundtrack is movie-worthy, although it lacks some background tracks and can be a bit too sudden and on the nose at times as it goes from 0 to 100 and then to 0 again.

While On A Rail was too short for my taste and Interloper was a bit repetitive, the sections that have been reworked are generally very good. Besides everything else it does well, the game would already be worth a buy just for Xen alone; the visuals, audio and level design in this chapter are stunning, and it plays much better than the original did; I also loved the added visual storytelling in the final chapters which gives encounters a little more meaning. The changes to the bosses were also great, although Nihilanth was underwhelmingly easy even on hard mode.

I did encounter some pretty glaring bugs which I did not expect considering the game had been in development for so long. The worst offender were the buggy menus, but I also encountered layering issues, a couple of crashes, floating props, got stuck after loading the game, a few holes to the void in walls...

The M134 Minigun is an American 7.62√ó51mm NATO six-barrel rotary machine gun with a high rate of fire (2,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute).[2] It features a Gatling-style rotating barrel assembly with an external power source, normally an electric motor. The ""Mini"" in the name is in comparison to larger-caliber designs that use a rotary barrel design, such as General Electric's earlier 20 mm M61 Vulcan, and ""gun"" for the use of rifle ammunition as opposed to autocannon shells.

""Minigun"" refers to a specific model of weapon that General Electric originally produced, but the term ""minigun"" has popularly come to refer to any externally powered rotary gun of rifle caliber. The term is sometimes used loosely to refer to guns of similar rates of fire and configuration, regardless of power source and caliber.

The Minigun is used by several branches of the U.S. military. Versions are designated M134 and XM196 by the United States Army, and GAU-2/A and GAU-17/A by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy.

History
Background: electrically driven Gatling gun
The ancestor to the modern minigun was a hand cranked mechanical device invented in the 1860s by Richard Jordan Gatling. He later replaced the hand-cranked mechanism of a rifle-caliber Gatling gun with an electric motor, a relatively new invention at the time. Even after Gatling slowed the mechanism, the new electric-powered Gatling gun had a theoretical rate of fire of 3,000 rounds per minute, roughly three times the rate of a typical modern, single-barreled machine gun. Gatling's electric-powered design received U.S. Patent #502,185 on July 25, 1893.[3] Despite his improvements, the Gatling gun fell into disuse after cheaper, lighter-weight, recoil and gas operated machine guns were invented; Gatling himself went bankrupt for a period.[4]

During World War I, several German companies were working on externally powered guns for use in aircraft. Of those, the best-known today is perhaps the Fokker-Leimberger, an externally powered 12-barrel rotary gun using the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser round; it was claimed to be capable of firing over 7,000 rpm, but suffered from frequent cartridge-case ruptures[5] due to its ""nutcracker"" rotary split-breech design, which is fairly different from that of conventional rotary gun designs.[6] None of these German guns went into production during the war, although a competing Siemens prototype (possibly using a different action), which was tried on the Western Front, scored a victory in aerial combat.[5] The British also experimented with this type of split-breech during the 1950s, but they were also unsuccesfull

There are very few games that deserve such a rating, but this is one of them. It is a great fan remake of a PC classic. It doesn't simply remake the original 1:1, but expands upon the original campaign. It goes without saying that the redesign of Xen was needed and the game is better for it. Would I still recommend playing the original? Yes, and its subsequent expansions (even if Blue Shift was rather short). Black Mesa is a love letter to the Half Life franchise.

Some small notes:

First, I would definitely not recommend playing this game on harder difficulties. The enemies can become quite bullet-sponge-y, which is especially a problem for human soldiers who have extremely good accuracy even while running (something that they couldn't do in the original), chewing through your health and HEV suit in seconds. Sure, you could say it adds challenge, but in practice I just sort of cheesed most combats through various means whenever I could, because otherwise it either required too many tries or left me with health that was so low that it would require too many tries in the next combat.

Second, there are, unfortunately, still some minor glitches. Most aren't a problem because of the ready availability of quicksave/quickload functionality, but some can be quite sneaky: for instance, I got cheated out from one achievement because one NPC just disappeared at some point while I was on a different map.

Lastly, some of the added content can feel a bit repetitive, which is especially noticeable in the largest departure from the original: the Xen levels.",1702634778,1702634778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

two with the xen levels the first section before the gonnarch's layer is just way too long, and honestly I would skip it and get right to the fight, as it needs to be trimmed down to a third, same thing with interloper, like theirs alot of great world building but theirs just too much

and my brain instantly knows what the developers thought process was behind Xen's art style, and in knowing that from the time period when the game came out, the original back in 99'

its kinda hard to not notice that and have it cut into the enjoyment of it

also I'm reviewing this 3 years past when Xen first came out, and finally allowed players to finish the game, and you can tell it was a passion product thus causing those issues

ironically timing this on the 25th aniversary video OF half life that valve just released as I was going through this and finishing it up, where they go into a wonderful amount of detal about the thought process

(at the very same time I was doing on a rail and then had them flatout say they electrofied the rail in the orignal to keep the player with the cart or they would walk the entire stage without it, which is exactly what I did to avoid the traps! like sometimes they missed things like that)

anyways the main thing being what they did back then was got all the levels together and said is this fun and then strung it together, or got rid of it, and alot of it in xen could have used that, as the tempo only really picks up in the latter stage of interloper, then dies out

and then finally starts to build in the final crecendo towards the final boss battle, which is very well done with how chaotic and amazing it is, its just alot could have been cut or simplified and condensed in the two prievious levels to get there and it would have built to a far stronger ending like the original had

so overall I recommend it, but know it is a mod and a passion project, and Xen is where they went off script to build it upon some of the old concepts, and it shows, like the game could use a directors cut to try and mimic it better

and dont feel bad about not having everything maxed out or the anti aliasing not hiding all the rough edges, and sometimes flat out really rough textures in interloper at 2560 x 1440, namely, shockingly with the grates when you get to a camp of Vorts after the flying islands with the tenacle monster from black mesa making abit of an apperance, where its abit like how did they miss that

as remember its a mod taking place in a 20 year old source engine that had to be completely rewritten for Alyx in 2019, with them even finding reminants of the old 2003 source engine code still in it, and me finding that grate that was definitely a texture taken from the level just before black mesa east

as I've played it enough times to know where it came from, but thankfully in the entire game, that was literally the only time it ever happened, I just really wish the anti aliasing was a hell of alot better than what it is, as that is literally the only thing holding it back from coming across as a true modern remake of the original half life

and even after all this time theirs some issues that need to be ironed out with the menu sometimes flickering as well

also I really, REALLY miss the old scientist and guard voices at the start, like towards the middle and the end it really doesnt matter as you start to get used to it given their spaced out and far apart so you dont get alot of the same guys clumped together like in the original and they have unique dialogue for their situations

but at the start you really, REALLY miss the OG VA's because of that, like they should have mixed them in or got them to do some re recording or something

as their by far one of the most iconic things about the original half life, and its abit like Eli in the original games vs half life alxy, once you get used to that tone of voice, no matter how good an impression it is

you just miss it too much and it flat out takes you out, like I almost would say they should have done completely different tone and dialogue, just so you dont know its coming

that way its not a redo of an old joke told by a new comedian, as no matter how much or how well you land it or make it, you always know its not the original 

so the best thing to do is throw it out and do something else, 

and honestly I would look for a mod pack that puts them back in, atleast at the start, like a half and half mod of the original with the new

which would really make it feel far more like half life",1702348845,1702607643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most AAA companies could only dream of making a game like this. Despite that, this game was originally a mod made with nothing but passion and love of Half life, which is truly impressive.

This is without a doubt one of the best games ever made and is not only faithful to the original masterpiece that is Half life, but manages to fix the small imperfections the original had. The developers clearly identify and understand what made the original game so good and nothing says this better than the Xen section of the game. 

Xen was originally the only section in half life that left players feeling disappointed. It was bland, boring and very clearly rushed, lasting only a few hours. Xen in black mesa is exactly what it always should've been. It goes on for MUCH longer, yet not a single second feels boring or uninteresting. You could even argue that Xen is the BEST section of this game, which is extremely impressive considering what it is being compared to.

The only criticism I have is that the music is generally a BIG hit or a slight miss. Some of the music in this game like ""Forget about freeman"" is some of the best I have ever heard. However, other music (Like the Gonarch fight/general singing in Xen) can be off putting or unfitting and is VERY loud with default settings.

I would personally love if Valve gave crowbar collective permission to re-use the original soundtrack, and add it as an option in the settings. The original is one of the few parts of the original game that still holds up flawlessly today.

While Portal 2 is graphically beautiful for a source engine game, I would have to say that this is without a doubt the best looking source game ever made. The models, graphics, lighting etc seem impossible for an engine so old.

This game is a MUST PLAY and stands right beside all of Valve's other masterpieces, which are also Must-plays.

A GREAT remake!
If you have played the original I do think that it is different enough to play this and still enjoy it, but it is also similar enough (from what i have played + heard, EXCEPT XEN*) that people who want to start with the half-life series can enjoy it without the pain of 1998 jank (no offence HL1 we still love you!)

Physics
being on the source engine it comes with the inclusion of the HL2 physics, and while it wouldn't have quite fit in with the original, the Black Mesa Devs have 'slightly' changed the levels and puzzles so that the mechanic makes sense, but as always, the typical source physics is always fun goofing around.

Bugs
While most of my experience was positive, I did have some issues with some major bugs; At one point I turned on subtitles (about half way through the game) and it was fine for a bit [spoiler] (Blast pit tentacle monster) [/spoiler] but then all the interact-able objects (and some not) started bouncing around whenever I moved, I think I fixed it by turning subtitles off but then a key item for a puzzle [spoiler] (the electrical water pit in on a rail, the plug wasn't there) [/spoiler] I fixed it by starting a new save but I never would have known that there was something wrong, if not for Walkthroughs, so that was pretty annoying. It did crash a lot when throwing grenades during those levels also, but there weren't many more bugs other than those

Graphics
Although (correct me if i'm wrong) it has been out in Early Access and then the full release (with Xen) from 2015-2020 but it still holds up beautifully against other games released recently. And obviously it is LEAGUES ahead of the original Half-Life!

Xen
While I haven't personally played the Xen levels in the original, I have heard that they were quite lifeless, but that is completely different here, It is BEAUTIFUL here in BM and i can't really imagine it being any other way, The world of Xen is a diverse place, but at some points (Looking at you INTERLOPER) went on for way too long, so it was a little stretched, but everything else, such as the long jump were awesome.

TLDR:
Awesome game,[spoiler] the pizza is a lie,[/spoiler] some bugs, Xen is beautiful,  8.5/10! best way to be introduced to the half-life franchise, Can't wait to play Half-life 2!",1702452355,1702452355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a lot to like, but also enough to dislike and/or just not prefer when you have the option between this and the original.

Just about everything is completely re-imagined, most of it being still very faithful to the original.
The level designs and maps have been changed up, but will still feel very familiar to those who played the original. Certain events may not happen as soon as the original, puzzles may have been altered so you don't just immediately go for what you knew in the original, new puzzles being added, and so on. The map overhauls are made to make more sense realistically while still sticking to the awkward Half-Life level designs where you're doing things like walking on seemingly random pipes and inside ventilation shafts.
The game's atmosphere and lighting have gotten a major improvement, making the dark parts look like something out of a survival horror and the brighter parts showing off more of the environment with great detail.

The last few parts of the game, Xen, has been almost completely redone altogether, all the way up to the last boss, with completely new levels and almost a whole new story within. While a lot prettier-looking, they expanded upon Xen a little too hard, as it's now like, 10 times larger in length than the original. Combine that with the now-lengthy Black Mesa section of the game, it just feels like it outstays its welcome.
Probably the worst part about this remake is how it uses Source engine. While a great engine in and of itself, put that together with extremely uneven terrain and it just becomes really annoying to deal with, especially when fighting the bosses of the game. In Xen, where uneven terrain is highly abundant, it just makes for very unpleasant gameplay.

The game is somewhat prone to corrupting its own saves. If you go hard on quicksaving because you're traversing instant-death obstacles or whatever, there's a very small chance it can get corrupted, meaning the game will crash if you try to load it; corruption applies to the game's auto-saves as well.

There are also apparently some removed content and events as well.
The leech enemies you find in the water, for example, were removed, because they were apparently ""too annoying"" based on play-tester comments, so instead of trying to make them as tolerable like many other annoying things from the original that they actually made tolerable, they just outright removed them the game.

I'd rather re-play the original over this again. The original doesn't outstay its welcome, the physics engine is somewhat dated but silly and very easily manipulated, and crashes & save corruptions are almost non-existant.",1702266693,1702359126,False,0,0,0.410703182220458984,0,True,False,False

In fact, the whole game is almost perfect, except: 
1. Metroidvania style bosses which NEVER work in 3D.
2. One of the final levels, Interloper, is too long and samey. 
3. The music is incredible, but the way it is integrated into level design could be better. Sometimes, it starts blasting and you still have boxes to break, pickups to pick up and can't even see the next bad guy. Both HL1 and HL2 placed music at points of no return that also had sequences longer than the music. This is is the way to do it, IMO.

1. Alright, folks, let's kick this off with a bang! Black Mesa isn't just your run-of-the-mill Half-Life remake; it's like Half-Life's cooler, younger sibling who just graduated from college. It was born in 2020, but trust me, it's more than just another clone of the OG game.

2. Remember those sleepless nights when you couldn't tear yourself away from your computer screen, swearing you'd go to bed in just ""one more minute""? Well, get ready for d√©j√† vu because Black Mesa has that magical power to keep you glued to your chair for hours on end. Say goodbye to sleep; Gordon Freeman needs you!

3. Physics, baby! In Black Mesa, you can go full Hulk and Hulkette on almost anything in sight. Grab, toss, and watch things explode. It's like a stress-relief simulator for all those pent-up frustrations in life. And yeah, I know it's 2020s, and physics engines are dime a dozen, but this is Half-Life we're talking about here!

4. Graphics that'll make your eyes pop! Remember the blocky graphics of the original? Well, say hello to the 21st century, where Black Mesa has gotten a facelift but kept its charming, old-school soul. It's like your grandpa with a new hip, still grooving like it's 1998.

5. Brace yourself for a twist! Not only did the creators spruce up the visuals and physics, they've also thrown in some plot curveballs. You'll encounter events and enemies that'll have you questioning your Half-Life knowledge. It's like reading your favorite book and discovering that someone's added a few spicy chapters.

6. Now, who doesn't love a bit of nostalgia? Black Mesa is like the ultimate '90s throwback. It's like going through your old photo album and finding that cringe-worthy picture of your teenage self with the mullet. Except in this case, the mullet is replaced with updated awesomeness!

7. It's not just a game; it's a labor of love! You can feel the passion and dedication that went into making Black Mesa. It's like when your grandma bakes you cookies with extra love ‚Äì you can taste it in every pixel.

8. Puzzles and brain-benders! Black Mesa isn't just a run-and-gun fest. It's got puzzles that'll make you scratch your head and ponder the mysteries of the universe. Or, at the very least, the mysteries of Black Mesa.

9. The suspense is killing me! This game knows how to build suspense better than a Hitchcock movie. You'll be on the edge of your seat, heart racing, as you navigate through its beautifully crafted environments.

10. And last but not least, it's Half-Life, man! Gordon Freeman is a legend, and Black Mesa is like the director's cut of his adventures. So, what are you waiting for? Grab that crowbar, suit up, and dive into the madness of Black Mesa. You won't regret it!",1702210690,1702210690,True,2,0,0.528781771659851074,2,True,False,False

Fun to play, graphics although look dated for playing in 2023 but if you consider it's a remake of Half-life 1 which looked infinitely worse it's still pretty good. Also stylistically it was trying to be closer to half-life 2 which it achieved.

Gameplay wise I‚Äôd say they are straight up the same game, but the graphics of the original are horrible dated through the eyes of someone not nostalgic for it. Which really sticks out to me considering just how much I love how SM64 and the classic Crash and Spyro games looked. I enjoyed my play through of the original half life overall but comparing it to all the changes and additions they made in Black Mesa I was actually rather disappointed time and again how plain and empty certain areas were that they re-imagined in Black Mesa. And I really mean that from the perspective of just looking at the original Half life. So many areas with lots of detail that give it life and and equal amount of other areas where they just said ‚ÄúEh it‚Äôs a big area sure, but it‚Äôs not the main center piece for this chapter so just put a table here and a box there and we‚Äôll call it goodüëç‚Äù You don‚Äôt see that in Black Mesa, work of art beginning to end. I‚Äôll say two things about OG HfLf: the fact that it actually has a tutorial is a note worthy upside and I agree on the notion that playing the original first will probably give you an even better experience of Black Mesa to better appreciate all the changes they made. If you would really call yourself a fan of the series from first playing half life 2, play both!

It has everything that a more modern audience should expect from a shooter, and does some genuinely interesting iterations and positive changes to what was originally release in Valve's Half-Life (1998).

That being said, I think that this game is highly tailored for Half-Life series fans, both of the original and the Half-Life 2 series of titles. I think that some parts of the game will reward or work best for players who check out those games first. Genuinely and honestly, playing the original Half-Life is rewarding and stands squarely with Black Mesa, despite its age, and still offers a lot that new players can appreciate. Half-Life is a game I always have and will return to, and Black Mesa doesn't ruin or interrupt my love for that game. I highly encourage for players to also check out the original, and at least the Opposing Force expansion.

Black Mesa, overall, has a feeling of being ""Half-Life Abridged,"" in that some sequences have been changed, shortened, or expedited for game flow, leading to a generally quicker play through than the original. In the original, danger was constant and the fun of combat was figuring out how to use limited skills and the environment to work through enemies. Black Mesa, on the other hand, gives the player a slight edge on enemies, even if their AI has been improved, resulting in quicker sequences, but with enough of a challenge still present.

The development team should absolutely be proud of the environmental designs, animations, models, particle effects, and sound design in Black Mesa. Half-Life was a masterclass in environments in 1998, and Black Mesa lives up to that legacy, breathing a new life into iconic set pieces. 

100%ing the game is a challenge, especially when some of the achievements are definitely there for the hardcore Valve fans who launched a gnome into space in Half-Life 2 Ep. 2, squashed all the grubs, and have committed to memory the original's scripted sequences. Because of the difficulty of some of these achievements, I would highly recommend testing a Half-Life 2 series 100% before Black Mesa, to see if you have the patience to complete it. Achievements will likely require multiple play-throughs, which can be tiresome and repetitive when going through scripted sequences and boss fights over and over again. I would recommend saving often, and keeping those saves for when you need to return to earlier parts of the game.",1702132413,1702132413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUTTERMILK PANCAKES
What ya need: 

2 Cups all purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups buttermilk
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (not a fan of imitation vanilla extract)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted) 

What ya do. 
1. Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl creating a large well in the center of the bowl. 
2. In the well of the new bowl, crack two eggs right in the center. Pour in the buttermilk, and vanilla and butter.. 
3. Mix together, do not over mix. You want it to be slightly lumpy. 
4. Let the batter sit for about 30 minutes so the buttermilk does its work.
5. After 30 minutes or so, with a large ladle take the batter and ladle it onto a nonstick skillet with melted butter. 
6. Cook pancakes. You want the panckaes to bubble on the other side. Cook on medium heat and until golden brown. 
7. Enjoy some buttermilk pancakes with either house syrup (butterworths, log cabin, etc), or maple syrup, or nutella.

It is not the original half life. To sum up the experience completely it is what half life would be if it was made as a half life 2 game. It has physics based sections, puzzles, and grand set pieces that far surpass the original in fidelity and scope. But it is all based on the original ideas and concepts and does not veer away so much that it feels too distant. It's also done to a professional shine. It's biggest improvement by far are the sequences involving zen and all a.i. components of the game. 
this games existence while fantastic and bold and just genuinely well done in every way is not a reason not to own the original. This I believe was done on purpose.

The brutality of old effects and sounds is simply gone. The laboratory complex is now pitch black, so I hope you like having a flashlight on 24/7.

Something that stood out to me about Black Mesa was the feeling of scale.
 
In Half Life, the chapters are a series of vastly different areas that don't make much sense leading into one another. On the other hand, Black Mesa really feels like you're navigating the remains of a giant underground facility with the placement of rooms and departments making more sense. Half Life had things like giant vats of acid a few rooms after an office complex. Black Mesa fixes issues like this by modifying the pacing and transitions between chapters.

I can't stress enough how impressive this game is, and I truly think this is the definitive Half Life experience.

The soundtrack alone elevates the game, in terms of tone and sophistication, far above where the game deserves to be (I listen to the soundtrack fairly often; it's just that good). 

For the actual modernization, though, I feel like the developers didn't go far enough and some of the game just left me marveling at how stuck in the past it is in terms of playability/control and experience.

The story is the same as it was, which is fine, though some of it is made more visible, such as the actual invasion. That's nice. More depth is always appreciated, especially if it isn't contradicting canon.

The visual design is so much better than it was in the original HL, and really brings this game closer to HL2. The Xen environments are sometimes outright fantastic in terms of visual design. It's really a shame I can't finish the Xen chapters. Which leads me to:

Bugs. I can't finish this game without console/cheat tactics because ""Interloper"" has a massive bug that crashes the game at some point, and the saved games in that chapter crash the game as well. Since it's a GRUELING, LONG, and SLOW chapter, there's no way I'm going to restart it in the hopes that the bug doesn't get triggered the second time around.

The developers have shown no interest in correcting the bug since players are so defensive of this game and of the developers, and everyone seems to just offer the suggestion of ""try again"" or ""load the next chapter to continue playing"". I'm not interested in either.

If you want more info about this specific bug, see the discussion area for the game.

Ultimately, the time I spent on this game was a mixture of enjoyment and rage, and I cannot advise someone to buy it, only to risk a similar experience. I am uninstalling it at this point to free up room for newer games, since the developers aren't interested in fixing their own mistakes. I do not bow and scrape or walk on eggshells for developers who sell their product. This ceased to be about purely the love of Half-Life. It's a product, and I paid them for it. In the end, I cannot finish it, because they have a game-breaking bug in it that they wont fix.",1701747377,1701747377,False,13,1,0.61180567741394043,0,True,False,False

I remember the first time I heard about Black Mesa and just how hype the first glimpses were. Glad that the team didn't give up on it, well worth the wait.

But, it's not perfect. The textures on the walls are stretched in many cases which leads to weirdly detailed but still somewhat blurry textures. There's bugs like the ties on the scientist models sticking out a foot in front of them. The AI can sometimes act pretty dumb. 

But then again, it's not like the original HL1 doesn't have all of these problems as well.

The gameplay is serviceable. The Snarks and the laser weapons were fun to use, but the rest are just standard guns and traps. Exploration consists of walking through corridors or vents with an enemy appearing or an event playing out every now and then. The worst part of the gameplay is honestly the physics. You and/or objects get stuck CONSTANTLY and it often times feels out of your control. For the first few chapters where you're just in the facility and you're surrounded by flat walls, this isn't much of an issue. But in the later chapters, this gets really annoying. There are so many situations where you have to deal with the janky physics because that's just how the game is. There's so many times where I just have to reload a save because I get stuck in something. The biggest offense in this regard is when you're trying to get out of water. Sometimes you get out of it fine, sometimes you flop up and down five times as a fish monster takes bites out of you. You also get invisible walled constantly.

The story is... fine. I probably missed a lot of subtext or whatever, but I just can't get into the story of this game. Like, I get what's happening, but I just can't connect with any of it. Freeman is a boring protagonist and none of the NPCs were memorable, save for the odd funny guard/scientist. Honestly, the aliens (as well as their world) were the stars of the narrative for me. They aren't the most interesting creatures by today's standards, but there's an air of mystery in them that I found interesting. It also helps that they are distinct from one another design-wise.

The other aspects of the game, the graphics and music, were great at the time and still good now respectively.

Overall, I can't really give the game any less than a recommendation. It's far from a bad game, and all the parts are at least average, I kind of just expected more I think.",1701518402,1701561712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I don't remember necessarily not liking it, it wasn't an experience that stuck with me quite as much as HL2 and its episodes did, and I have never revisited it since. I remember Surface Tension and Xen dragging on for too long (everyone does) and I remember some bursts of fun - being chased by a Gargantua, the appearances of the tanks and helicopters, a handful of fun setpieces that were well executed despite being a little rough in comparison to more recent games. In short, I am a bad person to say whether this is the definitive way to experience HL1, but this was quite a fun game on its own.

Black Mesa is, in strict terms, a remake - it follows the structure and pace of HL1 and any liberties it takes from the original game are minor (though there are a few sequences that I think were moved around, and I know of at least one sequence that was not in the original game and I did recognize major changes to one boss fight, for the better). In my view it is a huge success - there were some parts that put a big smile on my face as I remembered the simple joy of a well-designed level where the player is able to keep pace with changing elements of gameplay, but only just barely. I remembered HL1 being punishingly difficult, so I played through on the Normal (default) difficulty, and found it maybe a little too easy for my taste - probably 95% of my deaths were to environmental hazards rather than enemies. If I were to replay this game I would probably raise the difficulty, and I don't think someone new to the series would suffer too much from turning it up a bit.

Visually the game looks great but is still a Source game at heart - you would never confuse it for something made in the HL2 era, but it still has some seams here and there, especially in the early parts of the game which were released as a mod in 2012. The latter parts of the game (especially Xen), which came out only in the full game ~8 years later, are actually visually impressive even now. There is some physics jank, which made me nostalgic for Source-era games, but would probably annoy newcomers to the series. Some (almost all) of the music is shockingly good but I had some problems with audio mixing where occasionally dialogue would get drowned out by music or loud sound effects.

The best thing I can say about this game is that it made me realize how long it's been since I've played a game with a single player campaign that is as engaging as some of the things Valve made when they were still making games (this is only sort of a joke). Yeah, it is a remake of HL1, but I don't know that I'd ever have revisited it without this remake, and the team behind it deserves commendations for carefully rebuilding an artifact of gaming without either sticking too closely to the original (thus making the remake pointless) or bringing in too many new elements (and ruining the original experience).",1701547243,1701547375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But that wasn't the case with Black Mesa. You can tell this game was made by passionate fans of the original Half-Life. From the very first moment of the game till the very end it always feels like a proper Half-Life game and not just a fan remake.

If someone told me Black Mesa was made by Valve themselves I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. That's how good it is. Visuals aren't the only selling point of this game, Crowbar Collective have changed a lot of things and for good. For example the MP5 in Half-Life could hold up to 10 grenades but in Black Mesa that number has been reduced to 3. Other than that they also added more features which the original Half-Life lacked. For example the long jump module is now very simple and straightforward to use, gone are the days of using that obnoxious crouch jumping just to get from platform to platform in the border world.

The soundtracks have also been reinvented just like everything else in the game, while still keeping the vibe of the source material. Other things that have been significantly improved include Xen, Yes that notorious xen that people used to hate on so much in the original game (personally I like the original too).

There is a long list of positive additions that I can just keep going on about so all I can say is yes this is a GREAT REMAKE and definitely worth the money. But now comes the most important question...


Is this the best way to experience Half-Life? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT, I still recommend playing the original game first, while Black Mesa has certainly been a great remake it can definitely not replace the original. IN MY OPINION you need to play both games to truly appreciate this franchise. Black Mesa wouldn't be what it is without the original.

Many of the classic or half-finished half-life levels are reimagined from scratch. This is the definitive way to experience start of Gordon Freeman journey in 2023.

While, Black Mesa is a spectacle pushing Source engine to it's absolute limits in terms of visual presentation, some of the content should definitely be cut.

It captures everything I loved about the original but makes it all feel fresh and new again. The attention to detail and the passion of the devs is plainly obvious from beginning to end.

A special note should be made for the Xen levels and onward. While in the original HL these levels felt a bit rushed, sparse and repetitive. Now in Black Mesa, these levels become the true crescendo to the game you'd hope them to be. Luscious and stunning scenery and fun gameplay right to the final boss.

It's a labor of love that beautifully and masterfully brings the Black Mesa Incident to modern graphical and gameplay standards, and with such passion came a direct hand from Valve themselves who gave the team at Crowbar Collective their approval and the newest version of the Source Engine to them to continue development. Black Mesa pushes the Source Engine to it's absolute limits, especially noticeable in the Xen chapters of the game.

Black Mesa isn't without fault, with my biggest issues being visual inconsistency with some of it's models, most noticeably the bullsquid, alien grunt and hivehand, though all these examples are models still from when the game was a mod or changed around that time.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The increase in graphics didn't help much with immersion when the high texture resolution makes things sparkle, which looks a bit tacky, as opposed to the softer textures in the original. The detailed textures are used for comedy gags on the prop brand names, which also pointlessly undermines the immersion of what is otherwise a classic sci-fi story. The crossbow magazine appears full even if it's supposed to be empty. The bee gun seems to tank the framerate. There's floating objects (ones that clearly shouldn't be floating). Some of the effects are underwhelming (or glitchy). The crowbar generates sparks no matter what material you hit, which contrasts against the immersive detail in the original game.

[h1]Level design[/h1]
Some of the layout has been changed, but missed the opportunity to improve the flow of gameplay - the path forks off in a lot of places, which can feel more aimless than satisfying. At times I resorted to the maze-navigation trick of only taking left turns to ensure that you're eventually making progress - some bits are pointlessly confusing though, where the path of progress is obscured by being hidden above you; there's triggers that don't make any sense. Some of the forks are utterly pointless, and serve only to bloat the longevity of the campaign, but not in a good way as it gets watered down while you wander around the levels, which start feeling modular as you notice that a lot of the environment is a copy-pasted series of tunnels. Towards the end, the level design gets more and more nonsensical, where the gameplay loses any sense of flow because there's no intuition to the design, so the game feels like a chore.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Some of the voice acting feels like an imitation (particularly Eli's voice). AI voicelines often feel out of place, and the sound effects include ones heard in other games years earlier, which seems pointless if they're also mixing in some new sound effects, like the replaced houndeye noises (which I think sound worse than the original). Some reload animations feel out of sync with the reload sound. The volume across the game is inconsistent, such as the deafening menu sounds, and even if there was a setting to turn the menu sounds down, the settings don't save. The replacement music was good, but I'm not convinced it was good enough to replace the original soundtrack.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The AI is underwhelming. Houndeyes are way too janky. The boss fights are confusing when they could have been made more intuitive. The flashlight is far lower than your view which sometimes makes it useless. The train is a bit glitchy, and the guns don't always let you fire. The items (and their debris) are annoying and seem to make the framerate choppy (the game is unplayable if you blow up some boxes). Ladders seem even more awkward than the original. The jumping sections are poor (if jumping even works on [i]upward[/i] inclines (and the jumping module doesn't work a lot of the time even when it's got spare charges)). Trying to jump onto something has an annoying mechanic of throwing you over it.

You get stuck on low steps for some reason. There are invisible walls. Enemies see (and shoot) you through any concealment. If you had low HP then there'd be no point in continuing because some parts more or less guarantee you taking damage. You can die often due to nonsense, and without an SSD the deaths would be especially frustrating because you have to go through loading each time. Multiplayer is the typical Half-Life deathmatch, but with players spawning inside eachother. The achievements don't feel like achievements, so they end up being distractions. The game crashes frequently.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
It's not as interesting as the original because it's not innovative; the story (recycled as it already was) is not fleshed out any further, and it didn't spawn a modding scene. If a remake wasn't going to be polished for quality then what was the point of abandoning the groundbreaking (and nostalgic) charm of the original? Graphics were the only consideration, which is convenient to try to drive sales by making the game [i]look[/i] good, but gameplay would have been the important factor, which has been neglected - the butchered Xen gameplay is disappointing, which distracts from the effort to give depth to the environment - if you kept getting stuck and had things thrown at you before you had a chance to react to them then it's difficult to get a sense of enjoyable immersion from it. The game feels overrated, particularly because the Xen section drags on.",1442477992,1701315134,False,0,0,0.561971902847290039,0,True,False,True

Remember the celebrated Half-Life with its seamless gameplay, riveting narrative, immersive ambience, thrilling shooting sequences, and more? Brace yourselves because its recreation in the form of whatever this game is, is far from the original, morphing it into a gaming catastrophe.

Infested with gameplay and performance issues, Black Mesa stumbles and staggers, completely overlooking the fluidity that was the hallmark of Half-Life. With perceptible input lag interfering in the experience, firing a weapon, for instance, could take an exasperating 500 milliseconds post-clicking the left mouse button.

Random crashes, after reaching the Xen section, add to the mounting frustration.

No functional fixes can be found.

This game has come a long way, and for a life long HL fan, this game is a thing of beauty. While the game is a bit more relatable for newer gamers than the original Half-Life, I don't recommend this be the first experience someone has to the franchise due to several factors I will mention in this review.

The shooting is very slow, the shotgun is unusable due to it's low reload speed and the amount of time it takes to pump. You basically soak in non stop bullets while you try and run up to an enemy for it to be effective. Honestly one of the worst shotguns out there, and about as fast as the infamous Doom 3 shotgun. The crossbow is a far cry from the original game's and the revolver loses it's one shot capabilities leaving you needing to reload to finish up your third enemy, which takes a while and again you soak up bullets. Your enemies are basically bullet sponges, with head shots having no noticeable effect, and while that was the case in the original game as well, that gets a pass as it was the late 90s. i don't remember the original game having so many weapons feel useless.

This game is confusing at times, and in all the wrong mundane places. Yes the original game was confusing at times as well, but again that was the late 90s and map layouts have come a long way. In the 20 some years since the original you think they could make some of the little pathways or vents a little more obvious. This game is not a 1:1 recreation of Half-Life, so why do i find myself getting stuck in some mundane hallway or canyon area because I couldn't see the small teeny tiny switch? Honestly because of the lighting and textures of the time, it was easier to find my way through some of the more confusing areas in the original game. In a modern game there shouldn't be those frustrating lulls in game play that just kill the experience, especially when this is an homage and not a facsimile of a game from the late 90s.

All that said it is still worth a play through, even if it is more of a pilgrimage than a fun-filled vacation. Eli and Dr. Kleiner have dedicated skins in this, and it really does feel more connected to HL2 than the original game did honestly. While it surely is no replacement for Half-Life 1, this game provides a much appreciated modernization of one of the greatest PC games ever, and it's faults are no more than the original games.

EDIT: Just played through again as part of my Half-Life 25th anniversary pilgrimage, and the gun play felt much improved, I had a wonderful time with it. I still wish head shots with the glock/smg packed more of a punch on marines though. Xen was much more enjoyable this time around as I vaguely remembered most of the puzzles, and combined with the soundtrack was as breathtaking as the first time I witnessed it.

With that said, there are minor nuisances. First is that the voice actor for Eli sounds nothing like him, However my main issue is the environments. Everything is so dark that the flashlight now doesn't need any power, it can be permanently on, and this is necessary because the environments are way too dark to show off the dynamic lighting. 

In addition to this every area is packed with crates and random tools just laying about, as if the entire facility is old and falling apart, it's normal to have a ladder and toolbox around or two, but the game being packed with them and crates and little props everywhere feels less realistic than the basic, geomtric hallways from the original game, it's just too game-y, like a 2006 game that's trying to show off the physics engine.

Black Mesa rectifies the issues that had more to do with the technological limitations that Half Life 1 had to deal with and remakes chapters that most people seemed to either claim were boring or just outright hated, it expands upon what the original attempted to imply story wise with its final chapters and doesn't just make you forget everything you were taught up to this point for the sake of thematic elements, keeping in line with the gameplay design taught to the player in the early chapters.

Black Mesa shares however, in terms of gameplay design and story beats more similarities with Half Life 2, which is intentional, the devs wanted this game to serve to people as an entry point into the Half Life series and not feel like you've just suddenly swapped genres from horror-survival shooter to fps-gravity manipulating shooter.

Finally, the graphics of Half Life 1, are to a lot of people untolerable mostly due to the movement speed and the old graphics causing simulation sickness to some users, Black Mesa, obviously, running on a far newer engine which even today looks formidable and beautiful, however outdated it might be and this is the primary reason why I choose to recommend to my friends this game as their starting point into the Half Life series, I've had some experience with friends just outright dropping the original Half Life due to them feeling sick just watching Gordon move at mach 5 while blowing up everything in sight.",1701193090,1701193090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a very well-made recreation of the original Half-Life; the textures, polygons, and props are all very well placed, despite being made in an older game engine. It extends the original game with a different set of challenging mechanics, which can make the gameplay rather hard, depending on the difficulty mode.

What an amazing and long adventure it was. Just like half life 2 but for me this title was even better than half life 2.  

The levels are very similar to the old half life with a little twist of level blueprints. The game does not look bad either. It runs amazing and looks amazing. The remake is so well done it is mind blowing amazing. 

I love how the game gradually gets more and more puzzled. You need to solve different tasks to proceed the levels.

On top of that, Black Mesa adds small tweaks (and in some cases large tweaks) in gameplay, level design, and more which enrich and enhance the experience.  They completely (and very thoughtfully) reworked the Xen levels making them FAR more engaging, much more powerful, and really fun.  Ultimately, this game feels just like Half Life and in many ways feels even more like it belongs with the other games in the franchise than the original does.  It is a great improvement upon one of the best video games ever made and is an incredible achievement.

Also, I second all the praise the game has gotten. It's insanely fun, looks incredible, has basically all the design flaws of the original ironed out, the music is gorgeous as well. The work that has been put into this is absolutely unbelievable.

I have 3 points of critique:
[b]1. There are a bunch of fake doors, valves, buttons and machinery that looks interactable.[/b] That's really annoying, when you're trying to find that one switch, that isn't just decoration. It's probably no issue for people who are very familiar with the original, but I just wish there was something better to put on a blank wall than a locked door.

[b]2. Not every pebble on the floor needs to have collision.[/b] Especially in the Xen Levels there is a bunch of janky or weird collision, I found myself unable to jump or getting stuck quite often. It's probably best to keep the floor collision as smooth as possible, or at least add some sort of ""stair-effect"" to smaller obstacles that are lying around. It becomes frustrating after some time.

[b]3.[/b] Probably a skill issue on my part, but [b]a bit of coyote time (or a bit more, if it's already implemented) might help with certain jumps[/b]. I found myself quicksaving like a madman, whenever there was a gap, because there was always something weird about the leaps you have to take. I was also bumping my head on all sorts of random things while trying to jump over stuff, maybe cut down on the collision on ceiling decoration and tiny pipes or whatnot as well.

All in all, a must have for every fan of the half life series, and also for those who want their minds blown by the sheer, obscene beauty an independent team of fans can create in their fucking spare time.",1700968061,1700968061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since its release it has spawned a sequel with 2 follow up episodes, two companion games Poral 1 & 2 set in the same universe, the imminent release of a flagship VR title and an unimaginable number of mods some of which became games in their own right. 

Black mesa formally known as Black Mesa: Source started off as one of those mods. It was developed and published by a group of eager fans that now go by the name of Crowbar Collective. Black Mesa is a ground up recreation of Half-life that utilises the newest version of the source engine.
The project was initially announced in 2005 after the developers wanted a better experience than the source port of Half-Life that was offered by Valve. It was partially released as a free standalone mod in 2012. Anyone could download it and play as long as you owned Half-Life 2. It Then got green lit on steam and entered early access on May 5 2015. Valve was allowing the crowbar collective to sell the game on their platform and as you could imagine this was great news for both the fans and developers.
The only thing was‚Ä¶ at this time the game was not complete. These initial releases did not contain the final chapter ‚ÄòXen‚Äô. It would be another 4 years until the Xen chapter would be released to the public on 24 Dec 2019. A sort of Christmas present to the fans. 
  
The Crowbar Collective were sometimes silent throughout the last 4 years of development but would drop some information or a screen shot every now and again to show off small pieces of what they had been working on. There were multiple engine updates, to improve both visuals and sound bringing the games look and feel to a 2019 standard. They were hard at work releasing fixes and there were even mods from the community created in this period but what we were all waiting for was Xen and the final release of the game.
And it was worth the wait.
 
The game puts you in the shoes of the silent protagonist known as Dr. Gordon Freeman, a scientist working at the Black Mesa research facility. The first chapter sees Gordon starting his day like any other, making his way down to the test labs and suiting up in his HEV Mark IV hazardous environment suit. His day takes a strange turn when all hell breaks loose as the experiment he is involved in results in a ‚Äúresonance cascade‚Äù. 
From here Gordon will fight for his and his fellow scientists lives as he battles strange aliens that are being teleported into the facility and earths military that are trying to clean up the disaster including any witnesses‚Ä¶ And let us not forget about the mysterious G-Man.
The combat in Black Mesa is superb. There is a pleather of weapons to choose from ranging from military grade, experimental lasers like the Gloun Gun to alien bio technology. When you are not fighting you will spend your time over coming environmental puzzles ranging from shifting boxes to get up somewhere high to dodging mines in a mine field or powering up systems by completing small tasks. Black Mesa tried really hard to utilize the Havok Physics used by the Source engine by incorporating it into a lot of the puzzles meaning gravity, movement and timing play a huge part in succeeding in this environment. 
 
While the combat and puzzle solving are the main elements the keep the player engaged what I personally really loved about black Mesa and Half-Life before it was how the story is told. Black Mesa does not utilise cut scenes or videos. The narrative is told through the environment and the dialogue from the NPCs around you. From the very start of the game you are drip fed information by either speaking to people, reading signs and computers or just exploring the halls and watching people go about their day. The story builds and grows as the character does. These three elements are what made Black Mesa and Half-Life what is still considered one of the most influential games of all times. 

Black Mesa did a fantastic job of modernising a game that is over 20 years old while staying true to the original feel and atmosphere. The team over at crowbar collective have achieved something truly amazing. This Game was a labour of love‚Ä¶ and we sure do love it.

It leaves the core gameplay and key moments intact. The stuff that worked in 1998 is still here, The enemies got some new tricks up their sleeves, but the combat is just as thrilling as it was back then.

The things that needed changing (especially some pacing issues like in ""On a train"") have been changed for the better. There are some changes where your mileage may vary, like the rework of the MP, the implementation of Half Life 2 style puzzles or the changed controls of the long jump module, but I think these are good changes/additions.

While most of the experience is on par with the original, where this game really takes the lead the Xen chapter. Not only does it look gorgeous, it is a completely new experience that is actually worth playing instead of getting it over with to finish the game.

It is still not perfect by any means, but nowhere near the nose dive in quality the original Xen used to be. It does overstay it's welcome though. There is probably a good third that could have been cut for pacing reasons and it gets very ""gamey"", especially in the factory.

As a Half-Life remake, Black Mesa does the majority of things right. Seeing the iconic moments recreated with a modern sheen is definitely something special, it reminded me of how levels like 'Blast Pit', 'Power Up', 'Questionable Ethics' etc. left an impact on me. This remake's commitment to also make the game tie into Half-Life 2 further is admirable and feels authentic in execution. The adjustment of certain characters, sprites, or some new additions to the campaign are mind-blowing, and you will greatly appreciate them if you have played Half-Life 2 and its' episodes.

[h2]Gripes[/h2]
That said, I have some minor grievances; such as how ""On a Rail"" was simply reduced instead of being creatively reworked to be more enjoyable, or how 1 or 2 puzzles were cut out here or there throughout the campaign. In many ways, this is still the original Half-Life so some of the issues still persist here.

[h2]Xen[/h2]
Then there's Xen, which I must admit looks great here and takes some of the more underutilised elements from the original game, implementing them further to achieve new heights. 
The early and mid levels of Xen are a solid time and help make it a memorable experience where the original game fell slightly short. Yet once you get to the penultimate level, ""Interloper"", it starts to outlive its' welcome. This level is drawn-out with repeating puzzles and gimmicks that make it feel like it lasts a quarter of the game's run time with how tedious it becomes. Despite the reworked Nihilanth boss fight being a satisfying way to conclude the game, it doesn't fix the damage done by Interloper, which made me think back to some of Black Mesa's annoyances, which I was able to ignore and look past due to the otherwise enthralling high effort experience that went into this work. While Xen wasn't particularly great in the original game, I think Black Mesa's version still ends up quite a mixed bag, even if some parts are great.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Still, this is a great way to experience Half-Life, and while some changes and omissions it makes are major (and not all of them stick the landing), the game feels more up to modern standards and new enhancements help elevate it in some cases above the original product.",1700867199,1700867199,True,1,0,0.516574561595916748,0,True,False,False

I loved every part of the game. I replayed this game so many times I never get bored playing it. 

Achievements were fun and I got them all by playing of course. 
It also has good mods, like Blue Shift (modded by different developer) and optimal settings (at some parts frame rate is below 60 or even 30 on high settings, mostly over 100 fps). 

I don't think there's anything I disliked in this game, because it's beautiful and perfect in many ways.

[b] If you have never played the original Half Life and the original's graphics are too much to stomach, buy this game immediately it is still one of the greatest video games ever made. That isn't nostalgia talking its incredible in any era [/b] 

Level design is top notch, the interaction with NPCs and the little vignettes that you seen in front of you or in the sides of the Black Mesa facility tell a story better than any cut-scene. 

I'll highlight the level Surface Tension, it tells an entire story all while you the player are running around trying to survive. The marines start out in a good position, then slowly lose ground to the aliens, and you see it all play out in real time.

Another great thing is Half Life never forgets about its enemy types. You think your done with houndeyes because you haven't seen them in awhile? Guess again they come back in a way that is challenging. Finally done with the black ops soldiers who are annoying SoBs? Nope they are about to pop out of some cargo containers and akimbo you to death. 

Video games need to bring back silly instant deaths due to environment. It actually makes the game more fun and adds entertainment when you walk into a room and a random laser beam kills you, or a hail of bullets messes up your grill. 
Sustained enemy fire will kill you very quickly. Dying does not seem like a set back because of its save system, but it adds an additional level of challenge knowing that you have 10 health and need to kill a whole room of soldiers, you have the tools to do it and you can do it. 

Even if you are incredibly unlucky and have to pay full price, it is worth it for a game that respects you as a player and seeks to provide a brilliant mix between shooting, platforming, and puzzle solving. 

I really can't recommend this game enough, and I hope more games in the future take this 25 year old formula and run with it. Modern single player FPS like Prey or Control tend to follow the System Shock 2/ Bioshock formula with their RPG elements, but you don't need all those systems. 
Just design a game around enemies and then create levels that highlight those enemies' strengths. Make every gun do something different and useful. Make sure the player has stuff to do and see every 10 seconds. Make the game hard enough that the player may die at any moment, but if they change their tactics they can succeed without having to bang their head against a wall Souls style. 

10/10 needs to be in everyone's steam library

It's a third-party remake of Half-Life made in the Source game engine*, and done very well. All of the assets have been upgraded/updated, and look as good as, if not better than Half-Life 2. 

This version adds and changes various parts of the game, such as (not exhaustive):

- Graphics have been improved across the board
- Maps have been somewhat tweaked, some layout changes here and there, and enemy placements have been changed in certain areas
- Weapons have been more fine-tuned and improved, including handling, spread, animations, etc
- New enemy attacks and animations have been added
- We used to get around quickly by bunnyhopping everywhere, and this has been replaced by a more modern FPS sprinting system
- Some minor enemies have been removed
- Xen, widely considered to be the weakest part of the original Half-Life, has been HEAVILY overhauled and is completely unique from the original game.

I would recommend this game to veterans of the series, as well as new players that have not necessarily grown up with the series, or just don't like the graphics of the original. The amount of work and care that went into this game is easy to see, and this game definitely deserves all the love it has been receiving.

This is simply created by fans for the fans and one of the only few fully completed fan projects out there (Carmageddon: Max Damage and System Shock also comes to mind), but there are lots of them that hasn't gone anywhere, games like original SiN, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, just to name a few and there are probably lots that I even haven't heard of. It's a huge shame because the success of this game is the result of developers having the freedom of realising their passion, no pushing from the studio or investors, no forced current day bull***t that every remake has to have now but in spite of that it does not bring anything valuable to the project it can actually take away some. Dead Space remake comes to my mind, overall it's great but there were few things which fans criticised and make no mistake, whatever there was that you didn't like or at least felt weird/out of place, that was probably the suits or diversity managers who interfere in almost every part of designer's work. This was actually confirmed by one of the developers who worked on Dead Space remake and he also mentioned that they are even more intrusive now when they want to remake the second game and it's very frustrating (no doubt) for them because it limits their vision for what they want to do with it and forced them to prioritise things which are pointless to the story, narrative and gameplay. So yeah, Black Mesa is the best example when the people who work on it are free of the corpo horsesh*t.

Black Mesa is not just a simple remaster, but a complete overhaul of the original game, with improved graphics, sound, level design, and gameplay mechanics. It also adds new content, such as an expanded Xen chapter, a multiplayer mode, and a workshop for custom maps and mods.

Black Mesa is a game that respects its source material, but also improves upon it in every way. The graphics are stunning, with detailed environments, realistic lighting and shadows, and smooth animations. The sound is also impressive, with a remixed soundtrack, enhanced voice acting, and realistic sound effects. The game runs on the Source engine, which allows for dynamic physics, destructible objects, and interactive elements. The game also features a variety of weapons, enemies, and puzzles, which keep the gameplay fresh and challenging.

Black Mesa is a game that fans of Half-Life will love, as it recreates the original game with modern standards and adds new content to explore. It is also a game that newcomers will enjoy, as it offers a thrilling and immersive experience that showcases the best of the first-person shooter genre.

First things first, it is an easy recommend and I would even skip half life 1 if you are new to the franchise as it is simply outdated. Now, I myself would consider Black Mesa itself to still be outdated. It feels like taking half-life to 2013 maybe, not 2019. The old source level loading and certain areas of the graphics (which I'll get into later) are what make me think about it in such a way.  The overall remake is still an easy recommend since the game does what it says it does perfectly, and even improves on half-life in the areas that aren't direct remakes of the older one. 

PROS

Here I'll get in to the good. The gameplay, levels, animations, models, and enemy design are all great from a hl1 perspective and they should be good for people coming from more modern games as well. The few boss sequences in Black Mesa are good and the music is great, in fact the fact that they are used too sparingly could be counted as a con. The game doesn't stray too far away from half life one gameplay-wise and when it does, it is usually for the better. This doesn't apply to the Xen levels which are vastly different from half life 1 yet are some of the best in the game (excluding 1 part I'll touch on later). Also, performance and workshop integration are huge bonuses.

them CONS

This game isn't perfect. It has some cons that do matter. First would have to be the lack of cohesion in graphics between some levels. Some levels look great and really push the older engine to great heights while others look like old Garry's Mod maps. Another big issue for me Is the gun sounds. The overall sounds in the game are great and keep the half-life 1 vibe while also simply sounding good but the sounds for the submachine gun and shotgun sound terrible. You'll be using those guns a lot so it is quite a bummer. The last issue is the pacing in the Interloper and surface tension sections. Surface tension can be excused since it had to be genuine to hl1 but Interloper stayed it's welcome a bit much. Interloper starts great and continues to be great until the last third where it really becomes a drag and ruins the pacing of Xen.

Final thoughts:

It's a good game with a few cons that aren't nearly as bad as what it gets right. Worth a purchase 4 sure.

The weapons are much improved now which makes them more realistic(even the Alien weapons).

[H1] Final Thoughts [/h1]

This is unequivocally one of the most classic FPS games remastered to be arguably better than the original. The gameplay is phenomenal, story is tried and true, the game is full of nice little secrets and Easter eggs, it's only $20, what more could you ask for? The spacing and originality of the bosses is amazing. The gunplay and rate of gun upgrade is awesome and rewarding as well. The sound is spine-tingling and the soundtrack is fast-paced and adrenaline pumping. My only real gripes with this game are the stale human AI, (though it is better than the original), the bland friendly characters, wonky ladder physics, and lack of Xen, though it will be coming soon.
It's also got great Steam Workshop full of wonderful and greatly made creations, unlike some other crap-fest workshops.",1504735029,1700627755,True,5,1,0.535135388374328613,0,True,False,True

Devs do not bother fixing things in steam they just say EA for a year then release it full without fixing everything. Then they walk away.

the game is too dark, even with full brightness in the game, the monitor, and the flashlight constantly turned on, some chapters were still too dark, first and so far last time ive ever had this problem with games so far (oh btw the brightness bar is reversed for some reason?)

xen is awfully optimized, the rest of the game ran very smoothly on high settings, however when i got to xen i had to lower them to something between medium-low

the game crashes a lot, for example when changing video settings mid game (first leave into the menu then change them to prevent this), it crashed a few times when quick saving, and has some spots where a crash is very likely to happen, most notably in interloper when first encountering mind controllers, and overall crashes quite often throughout the game, especially in xen and even more during nihilanth

grenade physics suck, almost as bad as half life 1, half life 2 had much better nade physics

the game overall under utilizes the source physics engine, most physics interaction comes from plug puzzles, im not agaisnt those but id like to see the physics more often

a some chapters have quite a lot of completely unnecessary flashing lights and the game has no epilepsy warning what so ever

some of the chapters got too dumbed down or have severe flaws, on a rail became a straight path, the cart is also bugged in this chapter, surface tension is much easier, too much hecu and xen militia fighting, in xen levels you can easily get stucked on geometry, especially when long jumping, overall in a lot of the chapters it seems the dev team was more focused on good looks than gameplay, the amount of good arenas with good enemy encounters is largely lowered and the game just counts on you tanking the hits and gives you a lot more than necessary health and suit to make up for it

xen levels in themselves also over stay their welcome, the game isnt made to be finished in one sitting and sure, thats alright, but xen levels are too long and it gets to a point where youre not having that much fun and just want to be finished, i was excited when i reached gonarchs lair to have some combat but then the chapter, which was only supposed to be a bossfight devolved into just running away from it for a long amount of time, the game also gives up in interloper and just gives you infinite ammo for the gauss and gluon gun

cant control screen shake at all, and the game has a lot of it, can easily give you motion sickness if youre prone to it

read the privacy policy, thats an entire mess in its own that i wont be getting into

underutilizes the workshop, you can only change models and maps, cant add new weapons, enemies and stuff like that",1647856567,1700421170,False,0,0,0.324797362089157104,0,True,False,False

The pretty landscapes are gonna boost your expectations to feel a modern gameplay, but the random invasive ""loading"" freezes (even with a nvme drive), bugs, and general mechanics wont let it reach said expectations. 

Additionally, while some level planning decisions enhance the experience in comparison to the original game (blast pit/power up) some others feel like a deliberate attempt to extend playtime but fail to make the new longer trail exciting enough to justify it. (Xen/Interloper).

While Black Mesa does feel like a labor of love, it can be a tedious a task to complete and the challenge/reward ratio ends up unbalanced in its current iteration.

I could say how much colossal work has been done, that this is the best remake ever created, that it is a canonical Half-Life for me, and all this would be the purest truth.

My only Qualm though is Xen itself now on its looks or what it does its beautiful and that's not the problem. But my problem with it is Xen is a REALLY performance taxing section I feel some more optimizations should have been made because even being reasonably above recommended specs you WILL drop frames regardless of graphic setting unless you have a High to Very High end PC.

I dont have the right to say its huge size causes it to overstay its welcome because im not a long time fan but that is a nitpick of mine. But I will say Xen needs to be broken up or optimized more for performance and if unable should raise its minimum and recommended specs accordingly on the store page because if you fall onto the recommended specs 20 to 30 fps is the norm on the Xen section with some sections in it going as low as 10fps. I am very tolerable to that but I am saying this right now to play the game at 60fps across you'll need to high ball the recommended specs in the games current state.

As for the two achievements PhD in Pacifism and Laser Immunization its very hard if you try to do that in 1 run but remember you can save and reload at any time if you made a mistake. So I recommend saving much more often to get those two because there very arduous and difficult otherwise as saving and reloading does not invalidate achievements so long as the failure was done before the save.

Sure its save scuffing but its how with quite a lot of trial and error was able to get those 2 achievements that will save you a lot of headache if your a completionist.

Also if your wondering about performance to quell any about my rigs inability these are my specs and I will compare them to the recommended. And tell you if the Recommended is Greater then [>] or Less then [<] my system to quell any, my computer is to weak comments. I was Playing the game on Medium to Medium-High settings.

OS: Windows¬Æ 7 (32/64-bit) or Greater<Windows¬Æ 10 (64-Bit)
Processor: 3.2 Quad Core Processor or Greater<AMD FX-6300 Six-Core Processor 3.5Ghz
Memory: 8 GB RAM<20 GB DDR3                         
Graphics: 4 GB Dedicated Video Card or Greater<Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB Dedicated.

On Medium to Medium-High Settings I get 60FPS most of the game 30 to 60fps on the outside sections and anything between 10 to 30FPS in Xen. And just to eliminate outside factors id still get these frames regardless of Discord Streaming or other applications outside of the game being up or closed. Despite punching twice as hard as recommended in some of the requirements when recommended means at least to me you should be fully able to play at 60FPS reliably on High and almost all the time on anything lower then that.

So what does that mean? Well it means that Xen and the Outside sections are not considered in this performance analysis and thus this analysis is only based on the inside sections which do encompass most of the game and you will get 60FPS flat in those sections with Recommended. But if you do Recommended or lower Frame loss in those later sections is inevitable so for 60 FPS flat as I said prior you WILL need to High ball the recommended for that kind of frame rate across the game.

Hence why the game is still recommended because about 70 to 90% of it is still very much playable but because of this obscene performance demand in these places when recommended SHOULD account for that on Medium at the very least. I have to drop it to a 7.75/10 because of some of the later more intensive scenes and of course Xen one of the most anticipated sections in the game is sometimes rendered completely unplayable because of that.

Also and I know this next part is off topic but it highlights an innate flaw with the specs of a game in Steam it will tell you what is required but that doesn't always apply to ALL of the game. Most of the game can be easy to run but select sections can be completely contrasting to its expected specs causing this situation where a person buys and plays a game expecting it to run fine on there rig only to run into that large section that renders it next to unplayable.

Its even worse here because Xen is at the tail end of the game so you play through most of Black Mesa and now cant beat it because Xen is a performance hog of a section outside of expected specs and cant refund it since your now past the 2 hour refund mark not saying you should if you play through most of a game but for instance if someone less genuine was to do that it would be a nasty rug pull scheme. Thankfully that is not the case here its an amazing and genuine dev team that hopefully will fix that, and I managed to get through it and beat it but still, that's pretty bad.",1649471765,1700395008,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

__________
Honestly,
I was slightly surprised, also totally amazed!

I was playing the free version at the beginning a bit (because of workt I hadn't much time at that time).
I know the original Half Life perfectly.
Currently buying the pay version and know what? THIS IS SOO DIFFERENT, But still exactly the same!

Besides the better graphics of course, this isn't just a cheap 1-1 remake only with graphic enhancement.
Even before you're reaching the Xen world it had more details, better thought mechanics and environment, partly different areas and left out little annoying scenes. And gunsounds are also better.
One thing I really like for the immersion: The M16 weap. got exchanged to a MPL, which got the same game mechanics but is more belivable because of the ammo type and only moderate damage.
And I love the display of water surfaces on this source engine! It's looks damn realistic for such an old engine!
 
It got a bit (sometimes much) more easy, I was playing on medium difficulty and I had so often full health and often full energy. On the Original for example you only could fill up 50% energy at the energy station (at medium dif.), in here you can fill up even 75%.
In addition explosions where totally deadly if you hit yourself with a grenadelauncher grenader or usual genade. Not in here as long as you got energy filled up.

The most thing you die for is if you fell down a cliff or alike- typical half life bouncing ball physics... That's actually one thing I really didn't like of all those tiny edges you had to jump on.

- Let's get to the Xen world
I actually didn't recognize it at all! The developer completely changed the most parts and had a far better plot twist!
This one was truly the most amazing part, in addition more contend- I felt the Xen world had equally much of contend as before you're reaching this world.
In the original I guess it was around a bit less than a half of the contend in Xen world.

That said- I would even want to have this developing Team to remake even Half Life 2 at all episodes!

I initially enjoyed Black Mesa when it first came out in 2017. My first playthrough was a great experience. When the 1.0 update dropped in early 2020, I was eager to dive back in for a replay. Unfortunately, I found myself quickly disappointed. The changes to the level design on many maps were not for the better. The HECU now feels more like Combine soldiers from Half-Life 2, which is regrettable. The alterations to the guns, especially the SMG, made the gameplay less enjoyable compared to 2017.

Despite these issues, I decided to endure until the Xen section. It proved to be a challenging and often frustrating experience. Xen, unfortunately, turned out to be the tipping point for me. While it looked decent, it was overly long and lacked the fun factor. The Gonarch fight was particularly grueling. Although the final boss fight was decent, it wasn't enough to make up for the game's overall shortcomings.

On a positive note, the music throughout the game was excellent, though I personally prefer the original Half-Life soundtrack. Half-Life 1 remains my go-to game; it feels more enjoyable to play and comes at a much more affordable price. I find myself revisiting Half-Life 1 from time to time, and I doubt I'll be returning to Black Mesa anytime soon.",1588446249,1700219990,False,1,0,0.436481356620788574,0,True,False,False

Aesthetically breathtaking but hardly fun to play the new Xen practically functions as an expansion to the base game, just not a really welcomed one. As much as I think the ""old"" Xen is not on the same level as the rest of the game, I, frankly, found it to be a quite fitting end to the Half-Life storyline, it was aetherial, aestethically different from any other outer space fantasy setting that existed at the time and short, in fact by then the game had already given all its potential so I think that the short duration of the old chapter was a far more fitting conclusion that the mind boggling three hours of asinine puzzles and beautiful yet boring landscapes of Black Mesa's Xen. Aside from the Xen another criticism I want to push is the fact that this game is really really dark compared to the original one, and I mean REALLY DARK, in all of the times I played the OG HL I've never used the torch so much as in this game. Sometimes ,even with maxed out lightness and my room in total darkness, I wasn't able to understand what the hell I was looking at. In conclusion, I think this reimagining of the Black Mesa's events is a great experience that any Half-Life fan can and will appreciate but can hardly replace the original game.",1700151515,1700151515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still wouldn't recommend this game because of its privacy policy stuff, but I had a much more enjoyable time on my second playthrough where I'm trying to get all the achievements. I haven't finished the game again yet but I've gotten to Xen and its been much more enjoyable. 

I kind of see why I thought this game was directionless a lot of the time though. There are some points where its not really clear how far you are from your goal. Part of the reason I didn't have as much of a problem with that this time was because I had played it before. I still did notice that some areas just had you go somewhere with no clue why or how it would lead you to your goal. And there were still only sparse moments of real progression.

Also I do still agree with my old point about some of the segments with a ton of explosives like that one building with all the tripmines. There are certain explosives that are far enough away from the others that should totally be okay to blow up safely but they're not. 

And for now I only have two other things to say:
The helicopter fight is annoying.
The pizza, purple hat, and canister achievements are horribly designed. Anytime I had to take the items up a ladder it was a struggle. Getting them through the part that takes place on the cliffs was hell and I had to reload so many times cause they kept falling off. There were some times when a door would close behind me and never open again forcing me to reload because I left my items on the other side. It's clear that no actual thought was put into these achievements and into the fact that you have to carry 2 of these items throughout the entire game. And it was completely unnecessary to have 2 items at all. It means you either need to go through the super annoying task of carrying two items the entire time or you need to do two entirely separate playthroughs. If you don't care about achievements though you can just not do it. 

I might add more to this when I actually finish Xen again.",1669184808,1700070924,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]The Full Detailed Review[/h2]

The graphics and visuals are obviously gorgeous.
Gameplay, different mechanisms and in-game physics are inspired by Half-Life 2 and upgraded to a next level.
Some parts of the game feel like how they supposed to in 1998 version which is a great thing if you ask me.
the model and textures are designed wonderfully but the lack of variety can be seen in face models which I'll allow it assuming it's a fan-made remake.
 
Now down and down and down we go...
See this is a great remake. and for a fan-made one, it's a damn good job.
BUT it's not perfect. It has its flaws. *says a fan of HALF-LIFE* that were frustrating for me and almost ruined my experience.

The first problem I had, was its shadow and/or lighting problem. the game is SO dark that my life is pretty brightened compared to it.
Idk if it was an intention or with no attention but either way, It's really annoying. it's like the game overcasts shadows and creates
unnecessary ones over/behind/top of/in front of the object. whether it being a headcrab, a box or a body.
a flashlight won't even work because using a flashlight causes these shadows and THAT flashlight is as bright as a candle.
I didn't find a single functioning solution in anywhere. and people's reactions were like: ""Oh no you're lying and making excuse not to like it, I had zero issues with this game"".
Here are some example screenshots:
https://ibb.co/F7YL7n2
https://ibb.co/vmK9CXN
https://ibb.co/rskh4Yz

Next problem is its nonsense conversations between two NPCs. sometimes they are planned and scheduled at a specific moment and have a purpose.
but most of the time when they are following you, they pop out some random scripts at each other in order to make the situation REALISTIC.
for example:

+ you think anybody's gonna believe all this?
- I reckon.

+ You have any idea what's going on?
- You bet.

+ What is that smell?
- I aim to.

These dialogues are nonsense and unnecessary!
I know it existed in the original game but it felt real. it wasn't random.
all of them were scripted and triggered properly.
Now cause it's random, it can be different for everyone but it'll still be nonsense.

The Last problem is it's constant frame drops which is a usual thing in games nowadays. and either has a solution or doesn't.

Overall if you're a fan of Half-Life game, give it a shot, why not?
But if it's your first time getting into this franchise and don't care much about graphics, then I suggest you the play the original one.",1699964563,1699964983,False,16,5,0.561611652374267578,0,True,False,False

that I have ever seen.

All except the actual Nihilanth fight itself.
I hate to break it to you
But I would rather reinstall HL1 just to replay that final fight, than to actually do it in this game.

The eggheads (geniuses) over at crowbar collective have really out done themselves.
Almost to a fault.

Everything has been meticulously remastered and I mean re-MASTERED using everything one could possibly learn from studying Valve Game Design 101. But when it came to the nihilanth fight, they really overdone it and overhauled the fight sooooo much that... that its a Destiny fight now.
And I think that the final boss playing out like a WoW Raid with its phases and how bullet spongy it is really misses the point of what it felt like to BE Gordon freeman.

Gordon Freeman was never supposed to be checkpoint reloading his way to narative precognition, thats D9142's thing from SCP Containment Breach. What I mean by this is the mechanics and level design shouldn't end up facilitating the NEED for constant checkpoint loading, which will happen automatically when you die constantly to a bullet sponge boss, souring the ending climax of the story. 

That will just about do it for immersion.
The Nihilanth would never send you staches of supplies.
He would throw you to another realm where you stumbling upon resources
is believable and unintended.
Sending you staches of supplies for no reason is what he does in Black Mesa's Xen though...
Makes less sense than anything else so far...It seemed phoned in. Like a short cut was taken to facilitate this development.

The original ""fight"" NEEDS to give Gordon this down-time REGARDLESS of player prowess or game difficulty so that its the same ending and same feeling no matter what, completed at relatively the same ""pace"", with no savescum triggers. The Nihilanth from a story perspective is doing to you what G-man will start doing with you the moment you beat this boss, and it ties his powers in before you officially meet him. You see what im talking about in both Half Life and Black Mesa.

Again overall, EXCELLENT GAME in TOTALITY. but remastering the very ending fight in this way misses the point everything else set up. The original ending fight was actually pretty straight forward and there was no reason to change it to what is arguably a downgrade. Like imagine not having ALL of SCP 106's pocket dimension in a multiplayer rendition of Site 19 events, and downgrading him to a touch-to-kill like every other SCP in said multiplayer experience. Obviously you need to, right? You have to in order to have the game go by faster and keep things mechanically streamlined. Its just easier on you as the developer. Thats basically the developer version of what happened. The OG Nihilanth was a Mona Lisa.
And yet another obviously well talented and well meaning artist wanted to ""touch it up""
there is NOTHING wrong with the sentiment.
There just so happens to be everything wrong with the outcome.

Everything is improved, but it's still clearly Half-Life.  This game is on par with the quality we have come to expect from Valve themselves.  

The original soundtrack by Joel Nielsen is nothing short of excellent.  His work has come a long way since the inception of this game.  The sound design in general is also great.

Even if you played the 1998 version of Half life I would still recommend this remake as it despite using the source engine from 2004 still looks great ( better than CSS or HL2 or even Insurgency 2014 ) and runs great for how it looks, ( unlike say tf2 or CSGO ) it also makes use of the source engine interactivity so you can pick of bottles and boxes and such which for me is still a fun thing to mess around with. And of course the atmosphere is great ( with it giving me true ""disaster vibes"" ) while the soundtrack both ambient and the score are fantastic ( love ""forget about freemen"" ) 

all and all this game is a good 8.5/10 my issues mostly are them constantly breaking the workshop ( by making incompatible updates ) and the fact it does cut some things out from half life 1 ( however some mods can restore this it seems )

There's no map or even a radar(mini-map). Finding the right path could come off as needless unnecessary chore but once you realize that this element is part of the fun, if not the most part of the game, you start to enjoy it. It's not like your're going to play this game multiple times. It's a refreshingly classic fun.

+) Easily distinguishable overall graphic designs.
+) Simple good old fashioned Interface and HUD.
+) Optimized character control.
+) Quick save and load is your best gear.
+) Kept the good parts of the original version, enhanced the good parts of the original version, reworked the needlessly time consuming area of the original version, especially the Xen part.

¬±) Last boss was incredibly well done. So much so that it doesn't suit Half-Life. I mean it's First-person RPG game all of a sudden. Hahahahaha.

-) When reaching certain point of the map, the game loads next available area and during this loading your mouse movement, though it may not be visible, the game still reads them so it's possible you end up turning the other way without realizing, making you reload the previous area when you go onward.

Thus far, I would say I rate the game between 7-8 8 out of 10. The amount of effort put into this remake is amazing, and I absolutely love how the story is delivered in this game. 

The gameplay however is just okay. It feels dated for obvious reasons. Gunplay is serviceable but not good by any means, and most levels just seemed to drag on for far too long. I found myself starting many levels feeling excited for new plot developments and environments, but then doing the same puzzles with minor variations over and over again chipped away at my enthusiasm. I was wowed by Xen and then the level became an endless cycle of ""traversal puzzle, put crystal here, connect some wires, shoot at aliens for a few seconds, repeat"" I also encountered a level-breaking bug at the end of ""On a Rail"" where I had to completely repeat an already somewhat tedious level. 

Another reviewer described the game like receiving endless cake at a restaurant. It's great at first and then you're waiting for it to be over.

On sale, this game is absolutely worth it. It's a great fan remake of a historic game that holds up remarkably well, but also suffers greatly from pacing issues inherited from the original or maybe exacerbated by the remake process.",1699029151,1699029151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In that time, [i]Black Mesa[/i] saw a decade-long hiatus for the [i]Half-Life[/i] series and only barely managed to release before the newest title in the same month.

As for an actual review, [i]Black Mesa[/i] is more or less the original [i]Half-Life[/i] with a fresh coat of paint and polish. Lots of the design, both gameplay-wise and visual, follow that general philosophy so the title can feel like reliving old memories as you remember them rather than as they were. There is a slight variation on the tone and atmosphere at times, [i]Black Mesa[/i] will at times underscore itself with somberness where [i]Half-Life[/i] opted for esoteric and darkly-comedic colors. While not necessarily being the best at its craft, these changes work well enough to have a sufficient bit of impact when they come.

Once you reach Xen though the quality goes down. Way down. I cannot for the life of me tell what the developers were thinking. Xen easily takes up half the length of the entire game, and it's filled with nothing but tedious, repetitive, boring, uninspired section after section. Nothing in Xen even approaches the concept of 'fun'. You sprint along a linear pathway for 10 minutes, then you do a braindead jumping or power outlet puzzle that a 5 year old could do blindfolded, then you do it all over for around 50 times. The level design choices that these people made while creating these levels are absolutely baffling. It honestly feels like I was scammed, that's how bad it is.

Clearly a lot of work went into Black Mesa, but too much of the source material has been retooled for this [i]""Help I can't see anything! Is my monitor still on??""[/i] style of horror gameplay.

[h1]Half 1: Apprehension[/h1]
Your flashlight seems to work even worse than in Half-Life, and I don't mean in terms of jankiness, so much as it's a pitiful excuse for a flashlight. It only lights up the center of the screen and I wouldn't call a flashlight lighting up such a small area ""working"".

On the topic of screen space, it seems like a lot more of the screen is dedicated to the gun. So, in addition to the edges of the screen that the glow-in-the-dark watch you call a flashlight won't light up, the entire bottom right corner of the screen is [i]also[/i] a place ooky-spooky closet monsters can hide in.

And is it just me or did the shotgun's alt fire get a longer cooldown? Either it used to fire faster or I'm remembering it wrong.

Also, holy crap, what's with the sound effects for the guns?? Remember when remakes in 2010 would add way too much bloom for a stupid reason? That's what these guns sound like. Imagine if it was possible to put way too much bloom into Half-Life's sound effects. Now you know what the guns sound like.

I simply can't get used to those sound effects. That's not hyperbole. After 10 hours, I'm still put off by the noise every time I have to shoot something. I'm at the point where I'll just run past enemies so I won't have to listen to my guns.

Which leads me to: The AI is also even worse than Half-Life's. To its credit, soldiers still won't rush you when you're trying to camp and they will still throw grenades to flush you out. But when they're out in the open, they're rock stupid. They keep forgetting I'm there. They keep turning their back to me while we're in the middle of a fire fight. They'll often throw a grenade and then immediately run to where the grenade is and wait for it to explode. And the list goes on.

In one situation, soldiers were blocking my path. So I pulled back and tried to camp a corner. They never came around the corner and instead threw grenades, which is a relic of Half-Life's AI. But they also kept running to those thrown grenades, which is clearly Black Mesa's contribution. After camping the corner for a few minutes, never seeing anything but hearing lots of explosions followed by silence, I decided to peek the corner and saw they were all dead. I didn't fire a single shot. They all killed themselves.

The levels themselves have seen some massive retooling as well. I will agree that you can have a different experience and still have a fun. After all, nobody said this would be a 1:1 conversion, and that's for the best. But levels like On A Rail were the uncomfortable dips in Half-Life's gameplay, while Black Mesa's annoyingly dark shadow levels are just what annoying Black annoying Mesa's levels play like.

Or to frame this another way, On A Rail was a pain on the first playthrough, but subsequent playthroughs would show how easy it is and how much your problem solving skills had grown. But annoyingly dark levels of any game are always annoying, regardless if you're on your first or fifteenth playthrough, and that's Black Mesa.

[h1]Half 2: Questionable Ethics[/h1]
I think most of the people who are praising Black Mesa are doing so because they're afraid of being labeled a heretic for hating Half-Life.

But that's not hating Half-Life. That's hating not being able to see anything. That's hating guns that fire too loudly and not as fast as they used to. That's hating enemies that always work better when they're off screen because they're now designed to be closet monsters for a horror game. That's hating this one specific interpretation of a classic game. That's not even hating the developer(s) or their intentions. Just the final results.

Black Mesa was ""released"" in 2020, was ""in development"" in 2015, was ""released"" in 2012 (as a free mod), and was ""in development"" in 2005 (when ""released"" as a WIP free mod). But the important part is the game was ""released"" in 2020 and if Black Mesa doesn't want to be a 1:1 conversion of Half-Life because ""you can still have fun even if it's not 1:1"", then okay, fair enough.

But that also means Black Mesa is its own separate interpretation, which means it is its own separate game. And to grade Black Mesa by its own merits as a separate game that was ""released"" in 2020: It's boring, it's dark, it's annoying, I can't see anything, the AI is awful, my weapons sound like crap and are not satisfying to use, and it plays like a horror game, which is simply an experience I don't want.

Again, this point of view that I'm expressing, much like Black Mesa, is removing Half-Life from the equation. I'm not saying Black Mesa isn't good enough. I'm saying Black Mesa isn't good.

To add Half-Life back into the equation; just because you got scared while playing Half-Life doesn't mean Half-Life was a horror game.

While I acknowledge the significant effort and talent put into creating Black Mesa, the final result is an overly long and buggy mess that deviates too far from the original Half-Life formula. It would have been better if the team had focused on faithfully remaking HL1 in the HL2 engine, as most of the additions to the game simply do not work.

The first half of Black Mesa is enjoyable, providing a fresh perspective on the HL1 world with updated graphics. However, there are noticeable performance issues, particularly severe drops in frame rate (5-10fps!) during the Lamda Core level, significantly impacting the gameplay experience. While frustrating, this could be forgiven as a one-time occurrence.

Regrettably, once you reach Xen, the game begins to unravel in terms of story, pacing, and performance. The overly long Gonarch set piece fight and the chaotic experience of navigating moving conveyor belts while being attacked by 20-30 aliens, with body parts bouncing around the screen, detract from the balanced gameplay that Half-Life is known for. At this stage, it feels more like a Serious Sam game and never returns to the Half-Life essence until you finally meet G-Man.

The frame rates fluctuate wildly, ranging from 5 to 60, making it possibly the worst performing game I have ever played, especially on modern systems. Even lowering the resolution to 800x600 and using low graphics settings has no effect on the performance.

Due to the shortcomings of the Xen portion, what could have been a solid 8/10 rating drops to a generous 4/10. It is evident that the lengthy development time of this game was a result of overproduction and a lack of quality control, with too many individuals trying to incorporate their own ideas into a project that should have focused on faithfully recreating HL1.

In hindsight, Black Mesa should have remained true to its roots and simply served as a faithful remake of the beloved classic, without unnecessary alterations.",1698867949,1698867949,False,0,2,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

I decided to purchase Black Mesa not only because I read it had been in development for 15 years but also, from what other reviewers said: They CARED about the game. That to me, was the selling point. I wanted to feel like I was playing the original game with updated graphics and yes, thats just what I got.

Even though the game didn't manage to evoke the same emotions in me as the original, it was still a great experience to follow in Gordon's footsteps once again and relive the events in and around Black Mesa. Thanks to the Source Game Engine, the remake shines in all colors and shapes and looks way more polished than the original in every aspect. Even though this engine is also no longer up to date, it was a very beautiful  implementation. But it also shows all the more how irrelevant modern graphics can be when a good story is told in an exciting way and the gameplay is fun. This version of Half Life offers added value in that regard as it can convey the story a little more lavishly. Black Mesa shows its strengths especially in XEN, although here it feels like a completely new game. The Dash function adds a completely new game element and the developers have given free rein to their creativity. Instead of the 15 minutes of play time in the alien world of the original game, there were over 2 hours of firefights, skill tests and a lot of crouch jumping here. And I loved it, even though the last few stages felt a litte bit draged out. The boss fight at the end was an absolute blast.

Anyone who knows the original will also enjoy this game. And for the younger generation, Black Mesa offers a good introduction to a franchise that has had a lasting impact on FPS shooters.

Black Mesa's story is not only a success for the team and the creators within it, but a triumph for all of modding. A fantastic product, end to end, with some oddities here and there that I don't think make this not worth a play. I love the original Half-Life; I'm not the biggest fan of the gameplay of Half-Life 2 (though I think the presentation and worldbuilding is immaculate) and so maybe my biggest gripe is Black Mesa chose to modernise Half-Life's gameplay by taking notes from its sequel. It's less fast-paced as a result, channels less of that retro-shooter vibe, but in its place we get a very refined sandbox with some generally good balancing decisions.

Xen is a very interesting case. I think some of the expansion is close to flawless in its execution, whilst some decisions feel a bit off. Explosive houndeyes, naked grunts, and alpha houndeyes don't add as much to the gameplay sandbox as, say, canonising Antlions into Xen might've done (and also might've given the team even more opportunities to work with Vortigaunts; the way they're handled in BM: Xen is far and away the coolest part of the entire section). Meanwhile, plugs, plugs, and more plugs outstay their welcome, as well as Interloper on the whole eventually stretching on with its limited bag of tricks being exhausted by the end. The Nihilanth fight is climactic, though, and the music in all of Xen is an auditory revelation.

It's not a replacement for Half-Life - at least not for me, and maybe not for those who like the flow and ""vibe"" of Half-Life more than Half-Life 2 - but it is a way for the modern gamers who won't give retro games a second look to get into this world, and it's also another way to experience the start of a journey that for many - myself included - kickstarted a career in pursuing creative passions.

It stands on it's own as a pretty great game, but where I think it shines it as a companion piece to the original Half-Life and not as a replacement for it, an effort in which I don't think it succeeds in. 
The Black Mesa research facility is lovingly recreated in the source engine, but not all of it was carried over into this game. Sadly a lot was changed for the worst and some parts were cut entirely, for example 90% of the chapter on a rail. 
Some might be glad on a rail is gone, but to me it was a fun chapter in the original that broke up the combat sections from getting stale so it's a shame crowbar collective didn't at least try to re-imagine it. 
Another aspect I am not a fan of is the new AI for the HECU marines. In short they're not as fun to fight as their original counterparts. They get stuck on walls and generally are just walking turrets. The black ops  assassins are sadly even worse. I easily got them stuck in a door and killed all of them with a grenade. I wasn't even trying to cheese the fight, they were just that easy to get stuck.
But what makes up for all these shortcoming is the Xen chapters, which are a vast improvement over the original. The levels are gorgeous and really do go along way in immersing you in this alien ecosystem in which you feel like you don't belong. The Xen fauna unlike the their human enemy counterparts are very accurate to the original and still just as fun to fight. 
A common complaint is the length of the chapter interloper, which I agree goes on for far too long, but it's not something that detracts from the overall enjoyment of Xen.
My final complaints about the game will have to be some technical aspects of it. For one Anti-aliasing barely works. I had to run the game in DSR mode at 1440p on my 1080p monitor to make up for the awful anti-aliasing. Also the game, especially the research facility lacks a lot of polish, some ladders don't work well, the menu shows  up in the preview image of saves. I can go on about these issues but it seems the team has moved on and sadly they won't get addressed. Nothing is game breaking, but I was genuinely disappointed by this aspect of the definitive edition release. 
If I could have a perfect hybrid of Half-Life's research facility and HECU marines, and Black Mesas Xen, that would be the perfect way to experience the first chapter of the Half-Life saga. 
As it stands I can't recommend Black Mesa as a replacement for Half-Life, but if you just cannot tolerate the old school graphics of the original, or have already played it and beaten it, then absolutely give Black Mesa a shot.",1698677338,1698677338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great Remaster of the Original Half-Life. I would always recommend playing the original first, however this is a must play.
It does a lot of great stuff in terms of story and world building, making it a great transition to Half-Life 2. The game play is also amazing and many of the maps from the original look great here. Most of what the Crowbar Collective has added is great and adds flaws to where the original lacked.
Now I want to talk about the biggest part people tend to claim Black Mesa does better than the original and this is the Xen levels. I personally had no issue with the original Xen from Half-Life but I may be a bit bias. I will say that the new Xen in Black Mesa is phenomenal, I really liked how they made the world feel much more alive than it did in the original. My main gripes are only with the length of the last 2 chapters. I feel like in Interloper, some of the levels go on for a little too long, especially the last section when you are riding the lift all the way to the top. As for the final boss fight, I would have wished that they added the 3 teleporter rooms that they had in the original. It would have made the boss fight feel a little more fleshed out and difficult, not to say that it is bad at all, it is quite the opposite. 
One note I want to add is the difficulty. I think they did this almost perfectly. Hard is a great challenge for all FPS veterans, but for someone new to the Half-Life series and has not played the original, I would recommend playing through on normal first.
I have played through this game maybe 10 or 12 times and I absolutely love it. I recently just got all of the achievements which I had wanted to do for a while but not gotten around to. As for the achievements, if you are like me and like to get 100% on games, I would recommend it. They can be pretty time consuming, especially the two regarding carrying an item to the end of the game but I felt rewarded by the end.
Ultimately, this game is a 9 or 10 out of 10. I cannot recommend it enough but urge people to play the original first.

Ok after some serious game play across the whole of Black Mesa, i managed to find some bugs. The bugs apear in surface tension and range from invalad game data to the AI being automaticly disabled and my charecter getting killed repeatedly while crawling through a pipe when there are no hazards. 
I have tried several workarounds with no success  and the developer game consel shows sveeral issues when loading the chapters and maps in question.
As for the game itself, very well done with several improvments since it was released. 
The Xen chapters itself are very well done and when i viewed them for the first time, i was just floored...........seriously Crowbar Colective really outdid themselves. the graffics are just absolutely stunning and breath taking and i found absolutely no issues with Zen.

has many of the same downfalls as the original.

1. Overuses puzzles to a painful extent
the puzzles are not ""portal"" level, no, they are only difficult because of their tediousness, no satisfaction in completing them.

2. Due to the many boring puzzles, the action is limited
maybe keep the old puzzles but add more? seriously?

3. You'd think in a remake, they would focus on the action,
like the dam map was badass but they barely had any action on it, 

maybe add a defensive section?

4. Unstable
maybe focus on what matters in half life, interactivity, not the overuse of cheap graphical effects.

5. Genius Developers made a bottom limit for ""brightness""
the weapon flashes are bright as hell, terrible headache inducing graphics.
Look at the original hl2 which this game is based on, maybe learn something before trying to make something.

Also these cheap graphics are giving me a headache.

Did you pay any attention to the hl2 asthetic? 
it was dull with some futuristic ""bright"" elements, now everything is bright and makes me want to puke, giving me a headache playing a couple hours.

The big reason to play it is to see a fleshed out version of Xen. It's very nice, very ""Subnautica."" Also very long.

Black Mesa as an FPS game is pretty fun. There are a LOT of weapons to mess around with, decent enemy variety, and a whole lot of fast-paced corridor goodness. Very reminiscent of Half-life 2 in that regard (shocker). I don't think all the weapons are created equal and the game does want you to take it a bit slower than the movement speed lets on, but it's a good time regardless. However, Black Mesa becomes a truly incredible experience once you take in the journey you go on.

The level progression in this game is incredible. What starts as a bunch of cramped hallways takes you across a complex research station with each chapter having at least one incredible set piece or moment. The story in Black Mesa is told 100% organically and yet is still able to establish a natural progression of a dire situation developing and getting more dramatic. The music and eye-catching maps only help add to this and Black Mesa becomes one of the most engaging titles I've played all year. It's akin to Bioshock in levels of immersion as far as FPS games go, a claim I do not make lightly, and a definite must play even before you consider the legacy of the first Half-life.",1698057607,1698057607,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Graphics.

The game looks stunningly beautiful in every way, and Xen is no exception. This remake boasts some of the most enhanced environments of its kind, and they really pushed the Source engine to its limits.

This is where all of positives lie, as there isn't that much new or improved other than that and some things were made worse. Xen really brought this game (and the original HL1) down. 

Balancing: Pretty horrendous, honestly. Everything does way too much damage, and they offset it by spamming pickups everywhere to the point where it feels like there isn't enough punishment. A basic soldier should absolutely NOT be doing more damage than every other normal enemy in the game. Xen feels incredibly underwhelming and repetitive because none of the enemies live up to the danger that is the basic soldier. Xen also handicaps a LOT of weapons, mostly sticking you to the Gluon and Tau cannons. It just doesn't feel fun using the same weapon for the entire section of Xen, especially since the Gluon is so OP.

Movement: Somehow more slippery than the original? I'm not too sure how they did it, but a lot of the pipes and small jumps (especially in Xen) are extremely finicky. It's also slower than the original, but it used to be worse when it first came out.

Level Design: Xen. Xen. Xen... oh what a disappointment you are in both this game and the original. At least in the original it wasn't THAT long, but in this game it feels like it takes up about 50% of the playtime for such a terrible section. This game's Xen contains way too many repetitive puzzles (the conveyor belts... why???), and way too much platforming for it to be fun by any means. Each part of Xen just lasts too long, all the way from Gonarch to Nihilanth could've been shortened substantially. There's way too much padding in this level. 

What about the rest of the level design...?: It's okay... some of the sections are done right and others aren't.

Story: It's still all the same just with a couple more details such as Vortigaunts being more neutral.

Bosses: Same complaint as the level design, they go on for too long with no real interesting variety. Except for Nihilanth, which is way too easy in this game?? 

I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and recommend it, because it's still good for people who haven't played the original and are turned off by the old-timey graphics. Save yourself the time and do not play on hard difficulty.

If you know HL, this is a no brainer. If you don't, perfect to check it out.

Longer version:
So, graphically the game is close to HL2. Sometimes worse, mostly maybe even better. Yea, Zen is a good example of latter. Gorgeous. You can tell the devs got really into it as they got more and more experienced.

Audio is good, proper voice lines and all, some that are remakes of the old ones, many completely new ones. This is what happens when a company doesn't sit on an IP but allows talented people to do what shall be done. Action music parts can be a bit obnoxious when you want to listen to enemy movement so yea, while I like those too, gotta tune the volume down, at least at those sections.

Gameplay wise... not much changed. Yes, weapon handling is updated a tad but the game itself is still Half Life. Quite a bit of platforming and kinda iffy combat. The maps themselves got expanded, very rarely do we see anything less than the original. Everything is bigger, more detailed and while that is mostly great sometimes it can be a pain. I'm not fond of heights...

While many things got very obviously updated and upgraded, causing real joy when I noticed, it is also true that some things that could really use a bit of fixing stayed pretty much the same. Well... only combat really and even that is only mostly a problem against the soldiers. So yea, only about third of the game :) 
Okay, it's not that bad, never really was That bad but the AI while appeared quite intelligent back in the days nowadays it feels more annoying than clever. While the enemies can be tanky they are not bulletsponges - but they don't care. They rush you and care not that you will blow them to pieces, they will keep rushing. It's the typical game trope - an enemy soldier is happy as long as they can get a little bit of health off the player. 
Intelligence and tactics aside, they are the typical retro-game enemies. Stealth is rarely an option and if they notice you they always now where you are, hitting you with pinpoint accuracy. Them spawning in on screen is also an issue. 
Things like these make it apparent that this is not a new game but a remake of one of the biggest but oldest fps games ever made.

But despite things I really didn't remember fondly still sticking around I must say this is such an incredibly high quality remake that it makes any other remake I have ever seen nothing more than a shameful cash-in. The game is worth the full price any time - but if it's on sale it's outright a crime not to get it. You own that to yourself.

... okay, that sounded a tad too fanboy-ish even though just a minute ago I was swearing like an italian plummer. At the soldiers again...

Update: After playing through once without the DLC/Mods for now, I can safely say this was one of the best purchases I've ever made.

As much as I understand this is considered the great remake of Half-Life for almost everybody... it's a bit broken.

When the game updates often, it often does break old saves. And broken saves mean lost progress.
Like that one where you put so much time and effort into, invested almost countless of your time, all lost just because of an update to either that map you were on, or the whole game's maps.
Sure, the update's good, but [i]damn[/i] is it annoying to lose your hard work.

Starting a new chapter/map just doesn't feel like a good workaround, it often feels like it's just a band-aid over a profusely-bleeding wound.
And with me having hiatuses for games... at this point I have just about given up and went to cheat just wanting to get it all over with.

And that menu overhaul was a [i]clunky[/i] change.
When I tried loading an old save, the menu hiccuped and then the only options were either quitting the game, going 'back to game' which doesn't do anything, and the console.
The console's automatic autofill was also gone, and I can no longer resize the window, now only able to fill 1/3 of the screen from the top.

I would like the old menu back, please. [i](probably setting myself up for an '-oldmenu' launch parameter jab, but i'm ranting my stress out so give me some slack, plus unexperienced users may find it hard to revert these changes)[/i]

You know, this gave me an intriguing thought.
People talk about Crowbar Collective being better than Valve, when Valve were the ones that [i]done most of the hard work, kept persisting when said hard work was stolen, gave the community the OK to make free mods and occasionally some commercial sellings, [/i] and I'd like to talk about their works of the Half-Life series being seemingly more polished for their time but I'm afraid of some people that might get triggered by that.
Not even the greatest of Valve's works were free of hiccups, I'd admit, but last time I played their games their menus were definitely more flexible.

I'm giving this a [i]Not Recommended[/i] because all the positive reviews should balance it out, otherwise I'd just go in with a [i]Meh[/i] option if it ever existed.
...With that said, I think I should've stuck with the free version.

EDIT: Just after I wrote this review, the game softlocked when I saved.
A 'PAUSED' notif similar to 'LOADING' notifs appeared, and I am unable to do anything except operate the weapon switching HUD.

(I hate the purple hat and the pizza box)

I never got to play Half-Life when it originally launched nor did I know what I got myself into when I bought Black Mesa, so I can only say that, based on the reviews and feedback from many other players, this game preserves the original Half Life feeling while also improving it by either changing the level structure even if for a bit, or by altering some later levels entirely.

The game, while being centered around the idea of an FPS, it also adds a lot of flavour to its gameplay by adding puzzles and parkour sections, challenging your platforming abilities while also trying to make you aware of your surroundings. With no map at your disposal and the levels becoming more and more complex, you can easily become lost in the section of the game you are currently in. Each level tries to be unique in their own way, adding unique sections to them.

As for the gun play, you firstly begin with the good ol' crowbar, a reliable Glock 17, later improving your arsenal with a lot more damaging weapons like the RPG, Gluon Gun and Tau Cannon, giving you a lot of [b] fun [/b] ways of disposing of your enemies.

In conclusion, I think Black Mesa achieved what it wanted to achieve, adapting an old classic game to better suit today's graphics and effects, preserving the original gameplay while also improving on it, making this a really, really good game to play.

I recently tried the Half life series since a year or two ago and I gotta admit that I should of a while ago. I had the Orange Box for the 360, but I didn't play Half life 2 cause I like TF2 more and thought it was the game was shit. When I finally tried it I LOVED IT, I wanted to play the first game so I bought a pc. I loved og Half life, but the thing that kinda turned me off was the graphics (same reason why I didn't play hl2 before.) When I heard of a fan made remake I was a bit spectacle since I heard from one of the reviews that the game felt fan made. When the game went for sell I bought it and played it. I was amazed at the fact the source engine can do all of this. Sure, the game uses a modified version of source, but it's still source to its core. Just goes to show that the engine is still capable and given to the right and passionate  hands can create something beautiful. The lighting, the models, and the environment are all stunning. I loved that the game is doing something of it's own, while still staying true to the original. Finally my last point, THE MUSIC FUCKING SLAPS. It's like you're ascending to heaven or something.

The controls are as if you're ice skating to a degree (which Half-Life 1 couldn't deal with, either) and where extra content came it was way too long padded out unnecessarily.

edit: I am crawling inch by inch. Xen is beautiful but its mechanics, the jump pack, are whack. They demand high speed parcour while the environment, where you're supposed to prove quick thinking and perception, is sometimes so misleading that you might question your sanity if you're the problem and simply are stupid or if they want you to suddenly and inappropriately slow down, take your time, use the god damn crouch jump over and over again and then hope to God that you don't bump into some straw of Xen grass or pebble and get scooted around like an air hockey puck. 

I still am not through but Gornach's Lair is, after all the damn padding, the worst content in the Half-Life ""series"" (if you count this game as part of it) I have ever played. This is stupid and the bugs with Workshop still not being fixed but the devs demanding quite a some of money leads me to not recommend it if not on heavy discount.

To you, devs: Your dedication is astounding and I appreciate that but this game at least the many bugs in the options alone still need fixing. I have only heard praise and this negligence on top of the crazy stretching content and pacing wise is not what is worth any amount of money in the double digits. Only because you love that game (Half-Life 1) it doesn't mean that by cramming as much as possible into it, finishing it with a proper ending and then go your own marry way without any consideration afterwards that you deserve all the money and praise by default. At the very least your graphical options should be fixed enough, aside from the wacky Xen collision boxes with the god damn jump pack.",1655795967,1697134991,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a remake of the original Half Life more or less. I cannot evaluate it as a remake because I do not remember much of the original but on its own it is solid. Weapons have great feedback in terms of sound and visuals, and they all feel powerful too. The shotgun's alt-fire can gib enemies up close and that never stops being satisfying. This and other weapons that can achieve it are made especially amusing by how violently limbs from gibbed enemies fly apart. The enemies themselves also do a good job of avoiding your assaults and responding in kind. The enemy variety is decent but you will have seen almost all there is to see when the military rolls up. Progress not gated by combat is usually blocked off by simple puzzles, and being able to figure these out on your own to progress is fun, especially when the game's physics system comes into play. There may not be much to it but playing around with it can be amusing. The visuals are also generally impressive and whenever the soundtrack decides to start up it really hits hard.

Overall if you like first person shooters I strongly recommend it.

The full scoop is a couple of dudes announced when Source 2 came out that they were going to rebuild HL1 in Source 2 from the ground up, and dropped a couple little non-playable film demos which got a ton of people excited.  This snowballed over months into years where the couple of devs kept winning ""BEST UPCOMING MOD OF THE YEAR!"" from multiple websites with cash prizes, thousands of dollars.

Every time anyone messaged them about an estimated release date they would get all snippy and say how they were working on it in their spare time, FOR FREE, and it would be released, FOR FREE, whenever they felt like it, all while collecting their cash prizes and producing nothing.

This went on for a decade.

Now it's FOR SALE for $20 on Steam, with a webpage boasting about how they are a ""game dev company who makes games"" with nothing but Black Mesa as the sole ""game"" they created.  I bought this just to post this review and I'm refunding it.  I don't care if they finally released it.  They walked back every promise they made and think ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews make it ok.

It's not ok.

üü© Pros
An incredible remake: almost everything was remade from scratch or improved - HL1 never looked better.
Excellent combat featuring interesting weapons, good enemy variety and great gunplay.
Plenty of secrets and Easter eggs to discover, on top of amazing level design.
Good variety of enemies and well designed boss fights.
Great gameplay variety that alternates combat, exploration and puzzles (mostly) with the right pacing.
Native modding support with Workshop integration.
üü• Cons

Black Mesa is basically a remake of the original Half-Life made in the Source game engine. Although it started as a free mod, in time it became an actual product under the blessing of Valve itself. 

Storywise the game does not really stray away from the original. Gordon Freeman comes to work, accidentally opens up a rift in time and space letting alien invaders into his world, and then goes and tries to clean up the mess. Typical friday I guess. 
HL1‚Äôs story pretty much revolves around a few key events. In-between those what you really do is just fight through hordes of enemies and solve some environmental puzzles, from time to time meeting the same model of researcher/security guard for the 11th time. BM being a faithful remake is pretty much still the same but improved aesthetically and done better in terms of gameplay. You mostly visit the same locations, just reworked. 
The biggest advantage of this remake is probably the whole Xen act of the story which has been expanded. Not only are there more Xen levels now, but they are actually fun this time. You get a cool air dash ability which makes it really enjoyable to go and sightsee the Borderworld. And let me tell ya, there are some sights to behold or at least worth taking a screenshot. 
The painful downside to the game is the lack of the DLC content, although the ‚ÄúBlue Shift‚Äù campaign is currently being recreated by the good folks at HECU Collective as a workshop mod to the game. 

The gameplay is much better than in the original, at least it‚Äôs more to today's standards. Guns have new models, and they seem to actually pack a punch, enemies now ragdoll after death and seem to stagger when hit (that still doesn‚Äôt affect their deadeye accuracy though). Other than that, it‚Äôs still good HL action. Dashing through the Xen levels gives you a big sense of freedom and it‚Äôs just fun platforming honestly. 

How the game looks is probably the main improvement over the original besides gameplay. Everything has higher resolution textures and better lighting now. The models of weapons, enemies and npcs are much better and they have more fluid and lively animations. A shame that you still feel like you are meeting the same guy you‚Äôve met 5 minutes ago though. Still not enough unique npc models. Overall, the game looks good, at least it's not the same archaic look of HL1. 

In terms of music I was actually pretty torn up. The combat tracks often felt out of place to me. They seemed too loud and obnoxious when I had to hide behind a barrel with 6 HP, or especially when there‚Äôs like one enemy left somewhere and this epic music just goes wild while you‚Äôre just standing there trying to get what the hell is going on. The pieces are damn good, they just felt misplaced sometimes for me. 
The music actually redeemed itself for me later. The Xen tracks are atmospheric and straight up beautiful. ""Black Mesa Theme"" is a treat too. The general sound design is really good. 

Achievement hunting in Valve and Valve-inspired games was always fun to me, but one of the biggest sins of the developer (right after the fear of the number 3) is the introduction of packing achievements. You basically have to drag a specific item throughout a large portion of the game. It started with the damn gnome in HL2: Episode Two and it has inspired other creators to put this into their games. Now BS has [b] TWO [/b] of such items to pack. Come on man. It‚Äôs a fun challenge once and once only. Good thing that listening to podcasts made this thing bearable for me. 

Black Mesa is undoubtedly the best way to play Half-Life 1. It‚Äôs faithful to the original giving you the same narrative and action-packed experience in fresh form. The only shame is the absence of the DLC content which delivers different perspectives on the entire incident.",1696878222,1696878222,True,1,0,0.525606453418731689,0,True,False,False

But Black Mesa due to being a modernization of HL1 and has improved upon stuff like the movement not being as slippery, there being more use for each of the weapons than before due to less ammo and the graphics being on Half-Life 2 level of greatness. I'm not saying that this game should replace HL1. Since its a remake/reimagining and not just a simple graphical upgrade there is still a reason to go back to the original. But for first time players of the Half-Life games, the clunky but lovable original may leave a bad taste in some peoples mouths for just not being up to some modern standards.

The level design is usually pretty faithful but it deviates pretty often, for better and for worse. Certain sections feel less ""what do I need to do here?"" and are generally less obtuse but in many other instances the developers fall back on plug puzzles or finding the wheel to a valve. These puzzles are never really that hard, it just feels a bit sloppy there is such an abundance of them. There's a chapter (On A Rail) that is overhauled but its overhaul feels like it threw out the good parts of it too and it feels underwhelming in the end.

Some of the weapons are much better at their job (crossbow, hive hand, RPG) and some feel a lot worse (shotgun). Grenades are no longer insanely janky which is nice but I still found myself rarely using them. The crowbar also has a ton of range in comparison, which trivializes the enemies you're intended to use it on. 

I played the game on ""Normal"" difficulty (which is the easiest) on my first playthrough and found the game overall to be not super tough. While that is partially due to having memorized some parts, there is also just an abundance of HP and suit armor - I rarely was below 50 HP for most of the game. On my second playthrough I chose ""Hard"" and the military was consistently killing me so fast that encounters just became a flowchart and out of frustration I had to downscale the middle difficulty ""Black Mesa"" for the rest of the game. Just to clarify, this game's Difficulty scale is Normal --> Black Mesa --> Hard. Brilliant naming.

Before I discuss spoiler contents for the people who played HL1 already, I'll just say to play the original first and check this out after if you're interested.

Info about the revamped final act below; SPOILER WARNING!!!
[spoiler]Xen is wildly different from before, but yet again I am forced to say it's both good and bad. The long jump module is easier to use and works in several directions making it doubly useful as a dodge; it also nullifies fall damage, which is a nice bonus. 

The first two chapters improve on the awkward platforming sections of the original and have environmental puzzles, some neat world-building, and a few enemy variations introduced. The environment itself is beautiful but at the same time, I liked how hostile, barren, and intangible the original Xen felt. This rendition of Xen feels much more like a tangible region of space as we know it, which I don't really like for what's supposed to be a dimensional ""border-world."" It's still absolutely gorgeous though so I can forgive it.

The ""Gonarch's Lair"" chapter is HUGELY improved and my favorite part of new Xen. Rather than just being a bullet sponge that runs to the next arena when you unload enough ammo into it, you are alternating between battling the beast (which has much better AI) and cat-and-mouse chase sequences where you can chip in some extra damage before your next encounter. I have virtually no complaints about this chapter other than a bit of downtime in a certain part of it.

Interloper was a pretty big let-down, though. The chapter starts off promisingly by better humanizing the worker Vortigaunts, taking interesting creative liberties with the factories, and giving a new capability to the Controller enemy. The actual gameplay of this chapter after that is very slow, very puzzle (PLUG PUZZLE!) heavy, and the combat gets pretty stale. At a certain point they buff the AI of a certain enemy making it way more threatening, but immediately after trivializes every enemy by consistently giving you crystals that give infinite charge on the ""F.U. Laser"" Gluon Gun. This chapter ends with you slowly riding an elevator, holding your cursor and left mouse button over any enemy you can see. This chapter sucks a lot and lasts about as long as the entirety of Xen in the original game. Fittingly, this is also the chapter where most of my game crashes occurred.

The final boss is a decent note to end on though. He no longer teleports you to random obstacle courses, and has way more attack variety (the portals come back in spirit when he lobs stuff from Black Mesa at you). The fight felt a lot more focused, and I generally liked it. 

The Xen portion of the game overall is a lot longer by comparison to the OG's, taking up almost half of my total playtime, but most of that time was well-enjoyed.[/spoiler]",1636441429,1696662768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2] Introduction [/h2]

I've never played Half-Life or Half-Life 2, so I am coming into this with the perspective of a new player to the franchise. I will not be comparing it to HL, and am looking to it as a standalone product. Overall, I found Black Mesa to be a compelling experience from start to finish, with great ambience, cinematic set pieces and gameplay.

[h2] Narrative [/h2]

You are Gordon Freeman, a physics whiz working at Black Mesa, a secretive government research facility in New Mexico. Performing a routine experiment at work, things go awry and lead to an alien invasion of Earth. The game is then spent clawing your way through the now alien-infested Black Mesa facility, with the hopes of finding the scientists that will be your last hope in closing the inter-dimensional portal and ending the calamity. However, you will soon come to find that the aliens aren't all that you have to worry about...

Unlike many modern games, BM relies heavily on gameplay to tell its story. It rarely grabs control away from the player, and pretty much all the cinematic moments of the game happen naturally without any awkward breaks into cutscenes. For this reason, this game feels really immersive and keeps you invested. Both the facility and the alien borderworld of Xen feel lived-in, with a good variety of environments, both cramped corridors and large open areas, that keep it fresh.
 
The story itself, whilst not particularly deep, has enough solid story beats and twists that allow it to be compelling. By the end of the 15 or so hour journey, I felt pretty amazed at all that Gordon has gone through.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]

I'll keep this part short, since I'm playing on a potato laptop with an iGPU. I played at 720p minimum for the majority of the game (Ch 1 - halfway through Ch 17) and the game still looked good in spite of that. Environmental design is great and feels realistic. However, I ran into some serious issues in Interloper, which resulted in the game repeatedly crashing at one point. From then on until the end I played on 800 x 600, which makes the game look very dated, but ultimately it was tolerable.

Again, the game does a great job of being varied even though it all takes place within a single facility. Each chapter has its own distinct look. Surface Tension is a standout as it brings you into a huge outdoor section for the first time, with dams, military outposts, cliffs and more.

And of course, how can I mention the graphics without talking about Xen? I am aware Source is now a fairly dated engine, but holy cow, the alien borderworld looks stunning. The game isn't afraid to show its graphical muscles, offering a wide variety of vistas that allow the player to stop and admire their surroundings. Xen feels perfect - both familiar and disturbingly dissimilar to our world. Xen (the chapter) does a phenomenal job of introducing the player to the wildlife, landscape and gameplay mechanics of the new environment.

And you'd think spending 5-6 hours in this place would make it lose its charm, but again the devs have managed to keep it varied, thanks to a change in the colors used and the differing environments - you start off in the natural environment of Xen, before moving into its underground caves, and then into the artificial tower of Interloper.

This all comes at a performance cost though, and I found my enjoyment of Xen to be slightly bogged down by low framerates as a result of the immense environment.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

At its heart, BM is an FPS game, and a pretty damn good one at that. The arsenal you develop as you progress gives you enough tools to tackle basically every situation thrown at you.

The weapons I found myself using most are the shotgun and SMG. The gun sounds are satisfying and feel reasonably powerful even late in the game. I like how ammo is quite limited in BM, which leads in you having to use the whole of your arsenal instead of only relying on 1 or 2 weapons. That being said, I have not used a single snark or trip mine throughout my playthrough since I never found it necessary.

Puzzles are another key facet of this game. It is inherent in the environment design, and unlike a lot of modern games with quest markers and whatnot, force you to pay attention to your environment. I liked the majority of them, though I have to say that some of them completely flew over my head and I had to resort to watching a YouTube guide. One particular moment for me was in Lambda Core and its teleporter puzzle.

The boss fights in this game, while not many, are incredible. In the Earth levels, they often involve roaming around and setting up a contraption that can take down the powerful alien beings. Meanwhile, on Xen, you take the fight directly to the enemy and shoot them down. The epic fights at the end of Ch 16 and of course Ch 18 are incredible, and paired with fantastic music, made me absolutely fall in love.

I have heard a common complaint of BM is that its Xen chapters overstay their welcome. I do agree that Ch 15 and Ch 17 can be trimmed down, however I don't think they were long enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game. I still liked them, but it may be due to how I played the game, in which I did these chapters over a period of 2 days, so I only played about an hour each time.

[h2] Difficulty [/h2]

I played through the whole game on Normal and it presented a reasonable challenge. Keep in mind, I suck at video games and I was bogged down by low framerates due to potato laptop, so I still died a lot and had to load saves often. However, it was still doable for me and didn't leave me overly frustrated. Enemies seemed balanced, not too tanky, nor too squishy, which was nice.

Veterans of the genre might prefer to play on the more difficult Black Mesa or Hard difficulties instead.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

Black Mesa is a brilliant game, and as someone new to the HL franchise, it has inspired me to check out the HL games one day. I picked it up on sale for around 3 USD and for that price this game is an absolute steal. I would dare say it is even worth its retail price of 20 USD. For that, you get a true labour of love. And it's a terrific game to boot.

No, it isn't perfect. Pacing does get a bit wonk at times, and performance can get bad late in Xen, but when this game is good - oh boy is it incredible. I'm glad I experienced this game.

This isn't just a remake; it's a love letter to one of the most iconic titles in gaming history, ""Half-Life."" Black Mesa takes everything that made the original great and cranks it up to eleven, creating an experience that feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, you're transported back to the eerie, otherworldly Black Mesa Research Facility. The level of detail in the environment is staggering, with every corridor, lab, and ventilation shaft meticulously crafted to evoke the sense of isolation and impending doom that the original game nailed so perfectly.

But it's not just about pretty graphics (although those are certainly worth mentioning). The gameplay in Black Mesa is top-notch. The updated controls and mechanics make the experience feel modern and intuitive, while still retaining the core essence of what made Half-Life a genre-defining title. The iconic weapons, from the trusty crowbar to the devastating Gauss Gun, all feel incredibly satisfying to use.

One of the standout features of Black Mesa is the attention to storytelling. The narrative has been refined and expanded upon, with more engaging character interactions and a deeper exploration of the events leading up to the alien invasion. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to preserving the original's spirit while enhancing the storytelling for a new generation of gamers.

The game's pacing is impeccable. The moments of intense action are balanced by periods of exploration and puzzle-solving, creating a rollercoaster of tension and relief that keeps you glued to the screen. And speaking of tension, the AI of the enemy creatures has been significantly improved, making every encounter a heart-pounding battle for survival.

Black Mesa also boasts a robust multiplayer mode that adds even more replayability to an already outstanding package. Whether you're facing off against other players in deathmatches or working together in cooperative missions, the multiplayer component is a blast.

In conclusion, ""Black Mesa"" isn't just a remake; it's a masterful reimagining that pays homage to the original while delivering an experience that stands on its own as a modern classic. Whether you're a die-hard Half-Life fan or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play. It's a shining example of how to update a classic for a new generation, and it sets a high bar for future remakes and reboots in the gaming industry. Grab your HEV suit and get ready for a journey back to Black Mesa like you've never experienced before.",1696007381,1696007381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yet, my short attention span drove me to more colorful and fast games, back then I got to the first surface level and left it there, I thought that was the end and never played it again. 

Years later, I keep hearing about this being one of the best games of all time, and decided to finally buy it along with all the other Valve games, perhaps as part of my redemption for my years of sailing the seven seas, and well, what other way to play but with enhanced and perfected graphics? Abandoned it to my backlog.

Until at long last I forced myself to play it, and what a game, every praise, every high score, every award this game has received is well deserved, of course most people talk about Half-Life and not exactly Black Mesa itself, yet Black Mesa is just the perfect way to play it, the original game hasn't aged very well, and while I did try it a few times as an adult, I believe anyone who wants to experience Half-Life should check this version. 

The graphics are amazing, while it does change the art direction that does not hurt the original at all and at some point it might be it's own game yet the landscapes look beautiful and give Half-Life an excellent modern makeover. Gameplay feels way more fluid and responsive. Sound effects are most if not all from the classic version, since what would Half-Life be without it's iconic sound effects. It also has achievements now!

In conclusion, Half-Life will always be one of the founding fathers of the FPS genre and with Black Mesa it has a nice new look and is a lot easier to get into for the new generations, since this is Steam, every Library should have a copy.",1695958599,1695958926,True,44,1,0.765965580940246582,0,True,False,False

Art-style is very much closer to Half-Life 1 than Half-Life 2, which at times I question, but (most of the time) it's probably better off that way. Sometimes it felt like the game was asking me to take it seriously while enemies were gibbing into hundreds of parts more often than a New Vegas play-through with Bloody Mess.

One softlock (killed the Gonarch improperly I guess?) and some fucky enemy behavior that fucked up a chase sequence were the only memorable bugs I experienced. There were some weapon balance changes that I raise an eyebrow to, but otherwise nothing terrible.

If you absolutely cannot play Half-Life 1 and want to have ""The Full Experience‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"" Black Mesa pulls it off in my opinion. If you can play Half-Life 1, then play both in whatever order you want to, Black Mesa changes enough as it's own adaptation that they're both worth the play, it's absolutely not just a high definition reskin of the original.",1695789675,1695789675,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Upsides:

+Good audiovisual side (with a couple exceptions I'll get to in a bit). The orange colors outside make the Black Mesa facility truly feel like an epic warzone. Sound design is also improved. Voice acting is also pretty great, though some lines feel forced

+HECU having more radio conversations is a nice bonus

+Surface Tension is pretty good, with a couple added fight scenes between HECU and Xen aliens that are cool to watch

+Partner AI is a massive improvement (though this is a low bar since this is a 2020 remake of a 1998 game)

+There's a workshop which allows potentially endless modding 

+The HEV Zombies section in Xen was the single best addition. Was original, and had a cool atmosphere

Now, for the downsides

Combat:

For HECU Marines, the game uses Combine AI from Half-Life 2 by default. This is fine on it's own, but the soldiers keep the same strength and damage output from the original, which made it feel for me like I was fighting a bunch of walking sentry turrets. It doesn't help that a lot of arenas are copied from the first game, which results in a weird amalgamation. Most of the weapons in your arsenal have been nerfed, with lower ammo counts and higher spread. Other enemies (especially Vortigaunts) feel tankier to fight against, though to be fair this pales in comparison to how unlikeable the HECU are

Puzzles and Level Design:

There is a staggering amount of plug and valve puzzles in this game, likely 9 in 10 of every puzzle, at least from what I can recall. None of the puzzles here feel challenging or original, the only one with some thought (that I can recall) was the teleporter one at the end of the Xen chapter (that was ok). Level design isn't much better either. Crowbar felt the need to add as much visual clutter as they wanted when making these levels. There are several instances where there's a bright door ahead of you, but the way ahead turns out to be some dark vent in the corner. Don't underestimate good level design

Audiovisual:

This is the biggest high point of Black Mesa in my opinion, but there are still some problems. The soundtrack doesn't feel fitting. The fight tracks are good (and Kovalski made some good remixes if you liked them too), but every track besides ""We've Got Hostiles"" felt unfitting or unoriginal. I think it would've been better to not straight-up copy off but take inspiration from Kelly Bailey and his HL1 tracks. As for the visual side, I don't like how the orange glow (which looks great outside) is kept indoors, making every building feel on fire. There's also an overuse of lens flares (though this is more of a nitpick)

On a Rail:

On a Rail was not a good chapter. It was confusing and felt like a drag. But in Black Mesa, rather than try to improve it, Crowbar just cut about half of it and replaced it with a few fights. Pacing's better, sure, but it feels less like it's - well - on a rail. While I don't have any specific suggestions for how to fix it, I'm sure Crowbar could've thought of something 

Xen:

There are some quality of life improvements, like the supply drops and landing jets, but Xen as a whole felt worse for me. The unique flesh world, middle of nowhere aesthetic is gone, replaced with a recolored human jungle and later on a Doom Eternal setting. It also feels way too long, Interloper especially. The Interloper boss just feels lazy, with infinite Gluon ammo and health. Nihilanth is also a missed opportunity in my opinion, but it could've been worse I suppose

Not a bad game, but I would not reccomend playing this over the original. Play it on your own if you wish, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it",1691677690,1695781046,False,2,0,0.480314940214157104,0,True,False,False

And it's a damn good remake. Lots of obvious passion behind this project. Much more playable than the original.
Even Valve loved it, and acknowledges it since it's here.

Now some thoughts about the game at it's core, Half-Life 1:

-Was incredibly innovative when it came out, but is pretty dated now
-I'm not the biggest fan, nowadays it's a pretty average game, gameplay and storywise.
-Barely any cutscenes, the world is alive and people interact in front of you, which is very immersive
-The enemies are lacking.
-Environmental and tonal shift somewhere around the middle.
-Gorgeous lategame setpieces.
-Mystery surrounding the guy with a briefcase. (Honestly the main reason I played the game)

[b]tldnr: the halflife part of this is absolute garbage not on par with the original even if played today. the xen was thrown away and a different thing created in it's place. which is an enjoyable mediocre game in that 00s era of weird alien worlds. Is it worth it to suffer through many hours of bad game to enjoy several hours of a mediocre game?[/b]

This is a paid fan-remake of the Half-Life. I already tried to play it on release, but was so unimpressed i decided to not to waste my time.
After a work day and suffering from the lack of sleep i was in a weird space and was thinking about Half-Life. So instead of playing that a little i decided to force myself through this thing.
What can i say. The best thing about Black Mesa is that it shows how Valve instead of persecutions actually allows other people to contribute to their IPs. Especially to the dead ones. I only ever saw Nival do that, and i think Shanhai Arisu gengakudan allows people to contribute to Touhou. But the scale is incomparable.

Half-life came out when having an FPS game in real 3D was still not a given. The genre was already established, but not yet tropefied. Having only Duke Nukem 3D in mind the game about Ivan the Space Biker had to stop in its tracks when Quake 2 came out and accidentally created the ‚Äúmodern military shooter‚Äù paradigm. Valve decided not only to catch up to this story of s·¥ò·¥Ä·¥Ñ·¥á ·¥ç·¥Ä Ä…™…¥·¥ás but also to surpass its ‚Äúgritty realism‚Äù and ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù prowess. With the hindsight it is really easy to see in which order the things were tacked on each other. There‚Äôs the Quake‚Äòs Xen but better, Duke Nukem 3D‚Äòs ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù real spaces filled with intractable objects but better with real 3D, and Quake 2‚Äòs stupid-arse ·¥ç·¥Ä Ä…™…¥·¥ás, dull grey corridors and boring guns, but better.

The tram intro was absolutely amazing the first time you see it. In that era cutscenes were a reward for the gameplay and not its substitute in a form of punishment. But every time you want to replay the game the first couple of hours were a chore and a torture.

Black Mesa is too similar to the Half-Life where they could‚Äôve added something new and not similar enough where it counts. The NPCs in the intro should give more directions when you ask them, at least give the names of the rooms you are expected in. I know the outline of the game, but what new players are supposed to do? To wander around blindly or to look up a walk-through? There is so much HUD, and none of it is your Pilot PDA organizer.
Now the crowbar is even further away, forcing you to play Episode One, with flares (that are broken) and an escort mission where the civilian is you. Damn, Episode One was such a cheap trash, even on release.

I really hated the whole first part of the game. It felt like a disgusting zombie ‚Äî looks alive but is dead inside. And all the artificiality with bad physics did grind my nerves.

Then i finally reached Xen. The part that turned the mediocre Half-Life campaign into one of the best game to this day. And yep, they did remove everything that was cool about it. There is no low gravity and cool open levels. It‚Äôs just corridors and corridors and a ton of platforming. Without the low gravity you have to use the stupid booster. But the game doesn‚Äôt have aerial control and the edge-lips are still broken. So they removed the analog platforming, to replace it with discrete platforming and a broken one at that. But hey, at least it is Xen. And it is entirely new material, so i didn‚Äôt hate playing it. First part is super artificial gamey gameness and nearly a walking simulator in alien worlds. The second part is still artificial but is more combat-heavy. After you dispose of Gonarch, you participate in a ‚Äúprepare a tower sequence‚Äù, similar to the rocket engine room, the ending of the sequel and the beginning of the Episode One. Now the last part saw a significant improvement lore-wise. You meet civilian Vortigaunts who do not fight you unless forced to, and sometimes do idle scenes. Reminds me of russia, everyone who didn‚Äôt flee and didn‚Äôt volunteer into NSDAP is so enslaved and tired that they don‚Äôt even care that an alien showed up at their workplace and starts to re-arrange their industrial equipment without any understanding of consequences. Them suddenly being friendly in the sequel was weird (and also meant that great enemies are replaced with more ·¥ç·¥Ä Ä…™…¥·¥ás) and this chapter bridges that gap. Also it explains the connections between brainies and crystal, so i was prepared to a one damn good boss-fight. But alas, this is the Black Mesa in the end. So it throws away all that tutorialization it did. It trows away one of the best (but poorly explained for better or for worse) boss-fights in the history of gaming. Instead of extremely memorable, zany and weird fight we now have an utmost generic ‚Äúblob in the centre of the room‚Äù flat fight. I forgot more games that i finished than i remember minutes of my first fight against Nihilanth in the original.

i still had FPS drops on my 10900k + GF3080Ti and loading times comparable to when i played Half-Life. By default the FoV is locked up to 90, so i had to manually enable the console and punch it up to something more modern. And AFAIR you still can‚Äôt get up to the modern values even with the console. But at least it‚Äôs not a torture anymore. 90 FoV? What are you, living in the 90s? Playing on a 15‚Ä≥ CRT?

While playing, when i reached the first mine-house the game has crashed and killed my save file. But with the modern technology it also offers backwards-corruptibility. Every single save file for the entire chapter became broken. I had to start with the game‚Äôs pre-baked save point in chapter-select.",1695573563,1695573943,True,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

The graphics and levels are vividly detailed, the soundtrack is excellent, the voice acting is well performed and self contained, it follows Half Life 1's formula and materials well, it also has a mostly functional workshop *cough* Halo MCC take notes, Nexus and Assembly doesn't count*cough*. 

The team of people that made this game are very talented indeed, seeing that the game started out as a fan made project, I can see why it took as long as it did, I honestly think it was worth the wait, since the dev team seem to had undergo the daunting task of making almost everything in Xen from scratch. Xen might as well be an entirely different game.

The few cracks in this game's armour to me was that the game is slightly less scalable compared to it's previous versions and the Half Life games before it, the developer console seems less usable, at least to me, since I use commands like toggle crouch and walk, but those functions are no longer present as well as adjusting the weapon fov without mods, very minor gripes though. 

The gameplay before Xen felt a bit too easy sometimes, most weapons are more efficient at killing most enemies than ever before, I'd argue that the shotgun is a complete beast now, even at mid range. It's probably because the weapons are extremely powerful, or that the enemies are very weak, even on hard. The weapons are still overkill imo;  ammo for even the more powerful weapons feels a lot more generous compared to HL1&2 etc. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay loop and pacing is more preferable to Half Life 2's snail-paced action and I like that the enemies die quicker as a reward for proficient aim, I like that a lot, but it's a bit too easy sometimes and the enemies can feel a bit under-powered as a result. 

Lastly is that the performance in some areas of the game can tank like a mother, the game is better optimised now but you're still going to need a rather powerful machine to play the game at a consistent framerate, but I can't really fault the game for it's performance - This game is a very ambitious project and it's unrealistic to expect a game to run perfectly with this much content put into it.


All n' all, puts most modern remakes of other games to shame, it's an entirely different beast of it's own and is arguably one of the best games in Steam.",1492220703,1695526391,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If it‚Äôs even remotely a faithful remake, it‚Äôs very easy to see why Half-Life often tops ‚ÄòBest Game Ever‚Äô lists. A game like this would have stunned me in 1998.

However, while I can see and appreciate why it‚Äôs regarded as a great game, I‚Äôm not sure I was always having fun playing it. It definitely felt like quite a gruelling experience at times. It feels longer than it needs to be, particularly the later Xen levels, and almost every level is either a puzzle in itself, or contains multiple individual puzzles and contributes to this feeling of constantly having your stride broken.

There's a lot to love in there, but there's also a lot of glaring issues: the absurdly unfair difficulty just kills the fun, there are many instances of badly designed feedback for the player and overall the game overstays its welcome quite a bit. 

Before you go about with some ""get gut"" sh**, let me tell you I'm a passionate gamer with almost a thousand beaten games behind me. I'm not a ""noob"" and I can easily headshot enemies in any shooter game. I've played a lot of masterpiece games and this is not one of them. It's close, but it's not.

The game is seriously unfair and you'll end up dying way more than you would expect. I think it's because it's built on a game from an era when there was no ""quality-of-life"" philosophy behind game design, or at least not as we know it today. You will also die because of bad signs & feedback, like jumping across a gap and hitting an invisible wall midway through the air, or trying to take down a monster showing ""hurt"" feedback in a particular segment where it cannot be hurt (yes, Gonarch, I'm looking at you).

I said there was a lot to love here if you can stomach the unfairness. Level design is amazing, scope is epic, and I love how the story unfolds through events happening around you, and through the environments. Truly amazing storytelling all-around. But gameplay makes it hard to enjoy and I often finished a session feeling like I wasted my time. Bad feeling, really.

Tl;dr: Recommended for masochists only. IF you can stomach the frustratingly unfair difficulty, there's a lot to love here, but I don't believe it's the masterpiece people say it is.

Stepping into the world of Black Mesa is like revisiting an old friend, but realizing they've undergone a major glow-up. Crowbar Collective's reimagining of the iconic 1998 game, Half-Life, isn't just a mere facelift; it's a comprehensive overhaul that breathes new life into a beloved classic.

From the get-go, the game feels familiar yet distinctly modern. The core mechanics, the combat, the puzzles - they all echo the original Half-Life, but with a polish and finesse that only the advancements of the Source engine could provide. The game's environments are richer, the physics more intricate, and the platforming feels more intuitive. And let's not even get started on the AI. Those alien grunts and military operatives? They're smarter, more relentless, and will keep you on your toes.

But perhaps the most commendable aspect of Black Mesa is how it addresses the original's shortcomings. Remember Xen? That slightly jarring, out-of-place final chapter from Half-Life? Black Mesa doesn't just tweak it; it transforms it, turning what was once considered the weakest link into a compelling and cohesive conclusion.

The journey of Black Mesa, from a fan mod to a commercially approved release, is a testament to the passion and dedication of its developers. Black Mesa isn't just a remake; it's a love letter to Half-Life fans. It captures the essence of the original while enhancing every aspect for the modern gamer. Whether you're a veteran Black Mesa scientist or a rookie stepping into this world for the first time, this game promises an experience that's both nostalgic and refreshingly new.",1695231138,1695231138,True,8,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False

While the early chapters (In the lab / Black Mesa) are almost identical with Half-Life 1. Which is fine, it's still great overall for newcomers). In my opinion, I do like how the remake presents the levels, but I can almost anticipate any threat that may come etc because its pretty identical with the original level. 

Even though the levels are identical, in addition of the soundtrack helps elevate the mood and the gameplay by a wide margin and I thoroughly enjoyed all the encounters.

Also, the last chapters are magnificent and breathtaking. I won't spoil any of it that much, but my impression is. Every section of the last chapters, they kept one-upping the earlier sections.

The game's still playable, but controlling menus with keyboard and mouse controls on a controller is horrid. I prefer controller to mouse and keyboard most of the time, and I have a steam deck, so controller support means a lot to me. So seeing this game had ""partial controller support"", I picked it up expecting it to be playable on controller. Joy!

So, uh, that was a lie. Actual bold-faced lie. This game has no controller support whatsoever, just like the original. You're forced to navigate menus using terrible mouse and keyboard controls. I think there's hacky ways to get it in, but the fact that a Valve-sanctioned game that's been in development for 10 years on an engine with controller support has no controller support? Yeah no that's stupid. That pissed me off so much I immediately refunded upon realizing that.

I mean, seriously? ""Partial controller support"" means the game has at least basic controller support. But no, you can't navigate menus, you can't move, you can't look around, you can't even pause the game without mapping keyboard and mouse. What part of that is ""partial controller support""? That's NO controller support. Why would you advertise the game to have something it [i]doesn't even have?[/i] I'm baffled really. I'm sure the rest of the game is great, especially if you don't use controller, but...what the hell were they thinking adding that tag?

That sums up [b]The Crowbar Collective[/b] who made this game.  When they said they were originally going to redo the entirety of [u]Half-Life[/u], I scoffed at the notion of it, just like so many others.  ""Oh great, another mod with updated shaders and new textures"" I figured.  Not that those aren't appreciated, it's just hard when someone tries to give new life to old, blocky games.  Neat, the faces look more real, despite the Minecraft square head look still.

I'm glad I was wrong.  This game is something else unto itself.  To say that it's a fan's love letter does it no justice.  The amount of thought that went into this is unprecedented.  Every last detail was thought of.  The whole game was overhauled, built from the ground up from scratch.  Not only were the graphics updated to match those of this era, the level design, mechanics, sounds and just about every other thing were completely revamped and added too.

If the apostle David himself was a masterpiece in his time, just as Half-Life was, then [u]Black Mesa[/u] is Michelangelo's masterpiece which is an ode to him.  I remember playing this through and thinking how wrong I was.  I had played up to the Lambda Core missions, where [b]The Crowbar Collective[/b] had stopped development, as they were still working on Xen.  I was disappointed, but still full of excitement and anticipation.

As time went on, I totally forgot about it.  Until recently, that is.  And my god, Xen was beautiful.  I can see why it took them so long to release that.  Honestly, Zen was my least favorite when I played the original [u]Half-Life[/u].  It seemed rushed, and under-powered, as though they had great ideas for it, but ran out of time and didn't have processing power to make the world like they wanted.

[u]Black Mesa[/u], however, made it something most surreal.  It was my favorite part of the whole game.  It was almost an entire game unto itself.  And the battle with Gonarch?  One of the best boss matches and cinematic experiences of all time.  Leaps and bounds better than the original.  Like [u]Half-Life[/u] to the power of 100.

This game is my favorite of all time.  I love [u]Half-Life[/u], but this was [u]Half-Life[/u] done justice.  A monstrous thank you to [b]The Crowbar Collective.[/b]  You made this ol' timer relive his childhood as though I was playing it again for the very first time.

Despite not having played the single player campaign for nearly 15 years, Black Mesa really was a nostalgia trip...but with added/expanded content. Lots of moments were had with me going 'Ah yeah! I remember this' to thinking 'Was this in the original?'. The developers/makers have really made something that was already great, and somehow made it greater.

I am conflicted though, as much as I think Xen (and following chapters) are beautiful, sometimes challenging and entertaining enough. I felt like some sections were a little too long. But don't let that stop you from trying it out. We live in a world where our attention spans are getting shorter by the day xD

If you're a fan of Half-Life then this is a no-brainer to buy, get and play. If you are new to the series then this is also good for you too...I think it would be pretty cool to have played this first and then go back to play the original and make comparisons...but remember it's a game from a different era of gaming and gameplay.

Does this mean that its better than the original? No.

Half-Life is such an influential game that really set the bar for the fps genre. I personally think Black Mesa is best experienced after completing the original Half-Life. I might be biased, as Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time, but I really enjoyed playing Black Mesa and looking for all the things that were the same, and what Crowbar Collective changed. 

In my personal opinion, the only thing Black Mesa does miles better than Half-Life 1 is the chapters On A Rail, Xen, Gonarch's Lair, Interloper, and Nihilanth. These chapters are mainly regarded as the worst parts of the original and I completely agree with that. However, Black Mesa completely redesigned all of these chapters and made them WAY better than they are in the original game. 

In the original game, On a Rail is a long, tedious chapter where most of it is spent on a painfully slow rail cart driving through a decommissioned rail-system inside of Black Mesa. The latter hasn't changed with Black Mesa, but they greatly improved this chapter by completely redoing it. There's more puzzles, and you don't spent ALL of the chapter on the cart. Also, the big battles with the HECU soldiers are made much better in this game than they are in the original.

The last few chapters of the game spent in the border world Xen are all pretty bad in the original, with the maps looking rushed and not being very appealing visually. Black Mesa's rendition of the Xen chapters are absolutely stunning graphically. Unlike in the original, where Xen is just a bunch of greyish green floating islands in space, Black Mesa's Xen has more islands to explore, each covered in foliage and alien like flowers that make the world feel more alive and lived in. It also improves the gameplay of these chapters, featuring more puzzles, a redesigned Gonarch boss fight, and more. Black Mesa made me actually enjoy Interloper, which in my opinion is the worst chapter in the original game.

Black Mesa is an amazing recreation of Half-Life that I 100% recommend to any Half-Life fan or anyone who's played the original. However, I don't think this is the definitive way to experience Half-Life as the original just has a certain charm to it that makes me keep coming back to it to play it over and over again.",1640904360,1694035983,True,0,0,0.490196079015731812,0,True,False,False

Black Mesa It's a love letter to the original half life, and if you want to revisit its a fantastic way to do it, it maintains the same visual language of the original , it almost in way that's how you remember in your mind how Half Life 1 was suppose to look like, and only after look back at the original you realised how much upgraded this game looks like

Black Mesa takes the BMRF from Half-Life and makes it an actual place. The game focuses on reality a lot more then the original Half-Life did. Areas feel like they could exist in real life, and in Source 2 Black Mesa could take the Half-Life series to the next level. The workshop is pretty decent too. Black Mesa: Blue Shift by HECU is probably top notch, remaking Blue Shift out of Black Mesa, unlike other remake mods such as Operation Black Mesa, Guard Duty, and Peer review (still good projects though) that make it out of Half-Life 2 like the old Black Mesa mod on Moddb. Other mods I enjoy are mods like the Pre-disaster mods. The Pre-disaster mods make the BMRF fully feel like a real place. I love Black Mesa, more than Half-Life 1 2 & episodes. Some complaints I have though, are the push doors. The push doors are doors you would push to open in real life. However in Black Mesa they cannot be opened. This takes away from logic and immersion. Some are shown blown off, meaning there are places behind them. If there was a locked sound whenever you tried to open it that would be fine, but I still get irritated by it. Another complaint I have is NPC variety. There are more than Half-Life, but it still is noticeably repetitive. Also, all NPCs use the same generic voices, There could have been a few unique  ones, but they are all still the same. The NPCs in general are not a big step up from Half-Life. I still love Black Mesa, and wish nothing but love to the developers.

downright awful performance in certain maps, like the surface where you launch the rocket in ""on a rail""
(there are moments when i can get upwards of 200fps, and then there are some where i'll be stuck on 40-60)

the environments are VERY pretty, if cluttered, with you or your projectiles being able to get caught on a lot of things and visibility of enemies being pretty poor

balancing is pretty strange, with ""easy, medium, hard"" being replaced with ""normal, black mesa, hard"", with very little being changed between them
as opposed to half-life 1, with it very clearly making enemies take more and more damage before sucumbing
some people may not agree with me here as this just makes enemies more bullet spongey, but hl1 enemies are thicker and slower while also having clearly defined states of attacking and moving, allowing you to plan when to deal your damage and when to take cover, and allowing you to deal a critical headshot when the time is right

7 achievements are locked behind having to carry a few different physics objects between several chapters
(with a bug that will drop the object if you start sprinting while your weapon is in the middle of the holster animation)

workshop support is poor, with it requiring you to have to manually move some replacement mods into your game folder manually.

despite all this, you should definitely give it a shot, as it is a breathtaking remaster of the original half-life and a ground-up completely original remake of the xen chapters",1583386089,1693718851,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

[h1]Should I play this, or should I play Half-Life?[/h1]
This question is the most pervasive to those looking to get into the Half-Life series, and every player has their own answer. It's a hard question to answer if you are specifically saying no to the ""both"" option!

Admittedly, as much as I love the classic game, it has a heavy reliance on rose tinted glasses. All of what made it special way back when is now considered standard and normal now. 

If you are younger (say, around 25 or below), you know how when you revisit older games they generally have strange difficulty curves and a sort of clunky feel? Half-Life is an old game that feels like an early modern game. Simple as that. It did shape most modern game design, after all.

In general, if you are younger or you aren't looking for a nostalgia trip, you will probably want Black Mesa. You won't miss out on any story or anything, and it'll feel like a game that you are used to. If you are interested in history and witnessing the fundamental roots of all modern games, play HL1.",1579577439,1693564203,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

Pretty much the same thing happened with Black Mesa - basically the entirety of the levels in the lab were a chore to get through. Headcrabs are annoying to fight, the atmosphere is tense but it gets old very quickly, NPCs and the story bring hardly anything to the game. There were to many gadgets I never ended up using that just made me scroll my ""inventory"" for longer.

It does get much better with the change of setting in the second half (third?) of the game. Not only does it fully showcase the beauty of the improved graphics, but it gets more creative with the level design and the addition of double jump. It also takes the story into a far more interesting direction, and has many memorable moments overall. And you can use the gluon gun almost limitlessly, which is super fun.

While it's probably the best way to experience Half-Life, from technical standpoint it's not perfect. My PC is not that old, and yet I faced multiple FPS drops when some bigger explosions were happening on screen. There are also plenty of bugs - mostly Freeman blocking himself within the environment or in the air, but the game also did manage to softlock me when a script didn't work and a scientist froze before the door I was supposed to get through (I only realised what happened after walking aimlessly for 20 minutes and searching up a YT walkthrough).

You step into the boots of Gordon Freeman, the ultimate underdog just like when Mankind took on The Rock! But instead of a steel chair, you've got a crowbar, and you're swingin' it like you're in a hardcore match with headcrabs and alien goons. It's like if Stone Cold had a PhD in kicking ass!

Now, this ain't just a rehash, oh no! ""Black Mesa"" takes the original ""Half-Life"" and pumps it up like a 'roided-up Hulk Hogan. The graphics? They're smoother than a Bret Hart Sharpshooter, and the environments are more immersive than the crowd at WrestleMania! It's like they took the original and gave it a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving you in awe, brother.

But hold on tight, because the story's got more twists than a Steve Austin swerve. You're fightin' your way through Black Mesa Research Facility, just like tryin' to win the Intercontinental Championship. But instead of belts, you're earnin' the respect of the scientists and soldiers, and even makin' alliances with unexpected allies ‚Äì kinda like forming a tag team outta nowhere!

And the action, man! It's like if The Rock and Triple H teamed up for a handicap match against a legion of aliens. You're dodging gunfire, blasting through barricades, and solvin' puzzles that are trickier than Vince McMahon's plans. It's the kind of chaos that'd make Mick Foley smile under that Mankind mask!

So there you have it, brother! ""Black Mesa"" is like the Attitude Era of gaming ‚Äì it takes the original formula, throws in some wild surprises, and delivers a slobberknocker of a good time. So lace up your boots, load up that shotgun, and get ready to layeth the smacketh down on those alien candy asses.

From the meticulously recreated environments to the enhanced character models, every aspect of the game has been lovingly crafted to modern standards while staying true to the essence of the original. The graphics are stunning, breathing new life into the familiar locations I've explored countless times before.

In conclusion, Black Mesa is more than just a remake; it's a passionate love letter to a beloved classic. 
The only negative part about it is that it ends, leaving players with a sense of bittersweet satisfaction, and a gentle reminder that the much-awaited Part 3 may never grace our screens.

It has been developed on a newer engine, Source, instead of the much older engine GoldSrc. This results in improved visuals; however, it may adversely affect the game's performance. For instance, on my i7 4770 integrated GPU, Half-Life ran at 120+ FPS on 1080p, whereas Black Mesa barely achieved 60fps at 720p.

In my view, you should definitely play either Half-Life or Black Mesa. Personally, I played Black Mesa first due to its nicer graphics.

Revisiting old classics is a bittersweet experience, where your memory keeps everything that made you love a game but abstracts away the outdated graphics and experience, as your analog brain doesn't care about polygons and pixels.
Black Mesa is a faithful upgrade on the original game, not just some high-definition mod.
Built from scratch, it pushes our well-known Source engine to its limits and beyond with truly stunning looks.
They made the original puzzles make more sense (when possible), upgraded the gun work with a more modern approach (sometimes enemies are way too smart), and kept the fast-paced combat.
The level design removed some boring elements here and there (like a super long on-the-rail), but added in others, like completely reimagining the Xeno worlds and making it a true alien-like experience and unlocking all the potential for the final chapters.
They made the Half-Life story more lore-friendly for Half-Life 2 and imported some interesting gameplay elements from it.
From someone who played Half-Life in 1998 and has been following the news on Black Mesa since 2005, it has been worth the wait.

Sure, play the original game and appreciate how well made it was for 1998 but then play this and realise how much better it is. I really love how much more connected this feels to Half Life 2 as well whilst also keeping the original aesthetic. 

You can tell so much love went into the design of this, especially the Xen levels towards the end of the game which even includes new music which sounds incredibly angelic. However, what I will say is that, although Xen looks amazing, I will admit that it outstays its welcome a little too long and is a bit of a drag to get through to the end of the game. Obviously, that is just my opinion though.

I have also encountered a few bugs too which aren't anything game breaking but can be a little off-putting. For an example, loading screens seem to have weird black boxes flashing all over the screen, not sure if this is a common bug or if this just happens to various people but it happened every time without fail for me. 

Also, there was a specific part of the Gonarch levels that bugged out when I saved and came back in. I can't really describe the specific part of the game but I know that the thing was just stationary when I loaded back in and only triggered when I went into a specific area. Not long after this, it kicked me into the air and lodged me behind an invisible barrier outside of the map to which I had to reload. 

Overall, I am a huge fan of the Half Life series and Half Life lore and, although it's not a Valve instalment to the series, it is a faithful and brilliant modernisation of an already all-time classic.

I feel like Black Mesa undercuts a lot of lore in favor of bringing relatively fancier graphics. Further, the weapons handle way worse in Black Mesa, even compared to playing the Half-Life port on my old PS2 with a controller (the MP5 is just awful and the Magnum fires better from the hip than down sights).

That all said, the worst part is the game-breaking bugs. For me, it was transitioning from Surface Tension to ""Forget About Freeman!"", wherein, upon going through the door that starts the next chapter, none of the lighting loaded. I could walk around, fire my weapons, see the muzzle flashes, accidentally kill Gordon, and see the UI, but that's it. The screen was otherwise black. I wasn't running a chapter mod, it just didn't load the lighting. No flashlight, nothin'. I looked all over the Internet and I couldn't find a fix. Reloaded earlier saves and replayed a lot -- it just did the same thing: Complete blackness upon loading ""Forget About Freeman!"".

This is really annoying, too, because I truly feel like the first Half-Life deserves a remake/remaster. It's such a great game. However, not only does Black Mesa miss the spirit of the original, it's just a messy, broken product that seems to miss every beat, outside of environmental/graphic upgrades.

My next stop will be playing through a highly-modded run of Half-Life: Source (the Fixed mod being a key install). I hope that's better. I just want to play a modernized Half-Life that works. Ugh.",1693054431,1693054431,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False
