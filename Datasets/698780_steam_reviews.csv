[h1]DISCLAIMER! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, EVEN THOUGH I TRIED MY VERY BEST TO BE VAGUE ABOUT THEM![/h1]

If you are even remotely interested in the visual novel genre, I know you have heard of this game at least once. So, what is so special, or interesting about it? Before telling anything about it, I must warn that this review will contain spoilers. So, if you haven't played the game, go ahead and do so. It is completely free and will take 3-4 hours out of your life to complete it blind. Oh, and be warned: even though, it seems cheerful and innocent, the game bears meta-horror elements. Played it at least once? Please keep on reading, so we can talk about the depth of a spectacularly eerie work.

[i]Doki Doki Literature Club![/i] is Dan Salvato's only game so far, and it is one of those games that you can benefit from most if you play without knowing anything about it. As you give it a start, it seems like an ordinary dating game: we have four girls, a high school setting, a reason that brings people together... and romance emerges, right? Well... you are both right, and completely wrong. You sure take on the role of a teenager male student, who's been attending a high school with four girls: Sayori is your cheerful childhood friend, Natsuki is a classic tsundere, Yuri is the sophisticated literature nerd, and Monika is the level-headed, patient and knowledgeable president of the Literature Club. As Sayori drags you to the meeting of the club, you meet all the rest; and after a heartfelt pity-pitch, you join the club. From there on, you will attend meetings and write poems to the girl that you are interested in to win her heart. Depending on the girl you wish to romance, you have to pick words befitting her character to use in your poem. If you have done it right, you'll be rewarded with a new experience with the girl you like. This is practically it.

[spoiler]Nope, it isn't. It all goes generic, and even boringly peaceful until the Club Festival event. As the event approaches, things start to change for the darker and eerier. People fight more, and a certain someone gets depressed out of nowhere. At the end of the said event - no, even though I'm writing this as a spoiler, I won't spoil everything: you gotta play this on your own! - there comes a point of no return; and after that... that's when everything you have previously experienced as a cute little slice of life, becomes psychotically dark, uncanny and disturbing. As you keep playing, narrative, characters, environment, timeline... they all begin to get corrupted in one way or the other. If you persist in playing, you will soon discover that this game has a villain. A villain you have to deal with if you wish the save others.[/spoiler] Oh, and as Monika recommends: save frequently!

No, I won’t speak of jump scares, easter eggs and fan theories. What I would particularly like to draw attention to in this game is: [spoiler]a)the quality and content of the poetry written by girls; and b)the kind of skill that was put into portray an AI which is aware of and responding to the player beyond the avatar. It is all fascinatingly creepy. Poems coming from our girls during the first chapter bear deeper meanings and even foreshadowing for the remainder of the game. Especially Monika and Yuri's poems are spectacular readings for that. When you eventually reach the end of chapter 2, and get stuck with Monika, the amount of monologue she may share with you, and the depth of various topics that she chooses are downright spooky. Also, you'll need to tamper with the game files if you wish to continue properly, as someone has been doing so far. [/spoiler] As you can see, this is not a common visual novel. It is an interactive horror game that questions the content and nature of sentience.

Well, there is no need to speak about it more, since I cannot keep writing about it without giving direct spoilers - as if I haven't been doing so far! Please stop reading and go ahead for your first run. If you can bear the first 2 hours or so - which is kind of boring - you'll be pleasantly and creepily surprised.

Visual novels... Worthless and absolutely nonsense genre... How tiny player's brain must be to play THESE subgames! That was my opinion before i played Doki Doki Literature Club. This is more that just a visual novel. This is truly immersive game made with attention to smaller details. But how visual novel can be immersive? An exciting story? Awesome in-game environment? Live characters? No. Its not enough for visual novel. Team Salvato made much more. [spoiler]Doki Doki Literature Club don't immerse player into the game - this game immerse itself into player's reality bringing philosophical questions.[/spoiler]

Community gathered around Doki Doki Literature Club is also interesting. The most important part of community are not dumb weeaboos. Instead of fapping on characters community made a number of different mods (mods for ""another visual novel"" - i am serious): from useless to very funny and unusual. For example, in one of mods i've found a reference to Planescape: Torment.

In total: one of the best games ever. The unique and best game in own genre and style. 10/10

P.S.
I've changed my opinion on visual novel genre but i am still sure most of visual novels still worthless and nonsense. And i still don't understand those who play (or read?) these visual novels. I hope Team Salvato will make something good in this genre. I dont care if the next game will not utilize all potential unleashed by Doki Doki Literature Club.

At the very least in the indy/VN category, but overall for me.
The amount of love poured into this game is really something. Something to be proud of.

Doki Doki Literature Club! by developer Team Salvato may seem like a cute anime style story based dating simulator but don’t be fooled. This game has several warnings against kids under 13 playing this game. There is a warning before going to its download page on Steam and before the menu screen after you have downloaded it. You may think, “Oh this game is so cute! What could possibly go wrong if I let my child play this?” The answer is they will be scarred for life. Like seriously – don’t! BUT, if you love crazy unexpected horror games (and are older than 13), then please play! This game has outstanding reviews on Steam and just won People’s Choice for every category it was nominated for! Those categories include Best PC Game, Best Adventure Game, Best Story, and Most innovative. Team Salvato, congrats on the amazing work from all of us at Gaming Cypher!

The game starts off as you trying to decide what club to join, your best friend Sayori suggests you visit her literature club and enjoy some cupcakes. You decide to stay when you realize that the club is filled with hot girls. Monika is the president, a girl who was in your class last year and is way out of your league. Yuri is a dark and mysterious book worm with a big bust. Natsuki is a short tempered first year who doesn’t know how to show affection. Lastly, Sayori, your best friend from childhood who is just a ball of sunshine. Monika decides you should all write poetry. You must pick the words to impress the girl you like the best. As the schools festival gets closer things get weirder.

I rate this game a solid 10/10. Team Salvato has really raised the bar with this game. Doki Doki Literature Club! is a compelling ride you won’t regret taking. Congrats again!

Now if you have already played this game (or have already spoiled it by watching Let’s Plays like I did) and are looking for a review keep reading, but if you haven’t be warned SPOILER ALERT!

*SPOILERS*
Like mentioned above, the game starts off as you trying to decide what club to join, your best friend Sayori suggests you visit her literature club and enjoy some cupcakes. You decide to stay when you realize that the club is filled with hot girls. Monika is the president, a girl who was in your class last year and is why out of your league. Yuri is a dark and mysterious book worm with a big bust. Natsuki is a short tempered first year who doesn’t know how to show affection. Lastly, Sayori, your best friend from childhood who is just a ball of sunshine. These girls are not as perfect as they seem, all because of Monika.

Monika is a self aware AI who likes to mess around with the coding of the game. She is jealous that her character was written to never be the choice of your main character. So she had a little fun adding twists to the characters coding. Yuri has a knife fetish and self harms. Natsuki has some hinted upon Daddy issues. Sayori has major depression which she masks by being overly happy.

Mokina slowly starts to slip up and reveal her act as you fall in love with the other characters. She breaks the fourth wall by giving a tip about saving your game before making tough decisions. She then breaks it again when Natsuki makes a joke that would only make sense in Japanese. Everything starts to get scary when Sayori starts acting weird, admitting her depression and suggesting Monika told her to kill herself. Sayori eventually does kill herself when her depression is too much to handle. The game starts to break as Monika rewrites the coding. She ends up deleting Sayori’s character all together. She even disappears from the game’s files. The game resets and instead of Sayori inviting you to the club it’s Monika. From here on, Yuri and Natsuki start acting super weird too. Things will start appearing in your game files so make sure to keep watch for that. Without Sayori things start to fall apart. Things become way less PG and family friendly. The characters start cussing and you catch Yuri cutting herself. She admits to masturbating with your lost pen. Natsuki glitches out. Sayori appears in different ways. Monika is losing control of the game so she has Yuri kill herself as well but this time in front of you. Monika isn’t very good at coding so the dialogue breaks. I suggest skipping a head because you’ll be there a while. When the dialogue is finally over the other characters return for the festival. Monika realizes her mistake and decides to just delete everyone. It’s just Monika. Just Monika will last forever if you don’t delete her from the game files. This will restart the game again but this time without Monika. Sayori and Yuri are alive and Natsuki is her old self. But then Sayori starts acting weird. The president of the literature club is doomed to be self aware and the process is about to start all over again… unless Monika has a say in it. She deletes the game all together which leads you to the credits.

There are many possible dialogue options depending on your choices. You may have to play the game several times to get all the information about all the characters. This game is just a gift that keeps on giving. There are so many theories and secrets to this game. I just suggest playing with it and see what you can do. Team Salvato definitely earned their awards.

I was curious about this take on mental health as someone who deals with it personally. I feel like it says something about the character Monika to have picked these traits to amplify as a way to turn you off from the other characters, while she herself obviously is not mentally sound. I honestly don’t know how I feel about its portrayal. I didn’t find any of it offensive or insensitive since the game always made it clear that it isn’t real. That’s the whole point of the game. That the characters aren’t real and that the scenario isn’t real. It’s coding and anything can be coded or deleted. It may be triggering for some as it does show graphic images. So if you are sensitive to these subjects, please be aware.

I rate this game a solid 10/10. Team Salvato has really raised the bar with this game. Doki Doki Literature Club! is a compelling ride you won’t regret taking. Congrats again!",1513941558,1513941558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoy listening to the sound track in it, it matchs perfectly (favorite song is ""Track 14 Poems Are Forever"" (bonus track).

The choices you make in game and with the files of the game do matter. For someone who doesn't like anime (seen it everywhere on youtube) I enjoyed this very much, I highly recomend this, it is kinda slow at first but that just gives you time to connect to the characters and get into the story but once it gets going, oh boy it picks up quick and doesn't stop, I love how it played out.

It's a little cliche to say, but it really did intrigue me.

All I'll say is that it was definitely worth the playthrough on my own, especially considering that the game is free.

It definitely follows the generic anime/visual novel style of gameplay, at least at first. But (also cliche) the plot seriously kept me interested enough to play through to the point of getting the secret ending (~11 hours in total, which includes the first playthrough). Lots of dialog to go through to get there, but that's to be expected considering the genre. It's worth it though.

It's not without criticisms (which I'll go into), but for me it's a solid 9/10, definitely worth playing and paying for if you like an unsettling emotional roller coaster. Also a definite purchase if you, say, enjoyed Undertale or games of a similar creepy/wall-breaking nature.

Pros:
- I really cared about the characters
- Was scary/unsettling without going overboard and destroying my faith in the game.
- Pacing is generally solid throughout.
- Made me genuinely think about some things in life
- I actually want to go write some poetry now, huh.

Cons:
- Anime waifus aren't for everyone, though this game is *relatively* decent
- I could see the music getting old for some, though to me it was fine
- I wanted just a *little* bit more out of it... but not much!

Now there's a lot I'm willing to forgive because I enjoyed the storytelling and cared about the characters so much. But here are my criticisms in more detail (maybe if the devs see this):

- Wanted a more emotional, in-depth resolution to one particular, important character arc - was good, but I wanted much more.
- There's a dialogue-skipping feature, but I was unsure if using it would cause me to miss subtle differences between decision paths - I found there wasn't much if any, but that's not communicated anywhere. Iow, there were times I could have skipped but was afraid to.
- I got 100% completion in the minimal number of playthroughs to my knowledge, but if you don't know what you're doing going in (which ideally you shouldn't), then you might require additional playthroughs... skip feature is nice for that, though.
- Some ""scare"" art/animation could have been executed better imo. Also I think the still non-cutscene poses of the characters could have been drawn/proportioned better, but I can forgive that.
- Probably just me, but I found myself too high-strung/defensive to really let the unexpected hit me sometimes. But I normally can't even tolerate scary movies, so the fact that I 100% completed this is saying something. (I.e. I really cared about the characters.)
- There were some things that I suspected would reward my efforts if I tried them, but didn't result in anything and wouldn't have been too hard to throw in, imo.
- Couldn't change the selected monitor/display for fullscreen, only possible by changing Windows primary monitor, I believe.

I'll probably be exploring this game more over the next few days... definitely recommended! And I don't say that easily.",1510985906,1510985906,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
