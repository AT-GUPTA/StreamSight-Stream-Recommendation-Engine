As much as I wish we had a little more freedom with the inventory management, like swapping inventory item's positions and taking out more than 1 item at a time, I kind of understand why they did it like this. To balance out the difficulty, making it so the player needs to make use of the lock feature in the shop and hold off another run or sacrifice an item in your pack to make something fit. 

You can get really OP, really easily if they gave full freedom of organization in this game. If you play your cards right, you should be able to figure out enough spaces for things you need and things you want. This is a minor complaint. 

The other thing is, this game advertises itself as a ""Rogue-LIKE"" while the game being made and balanced around meta progression that only exists in a Rogue-LITE game. It's miss-marketing itself. This might upset people who would rather play a Rogue-LIKE instead of a Rogue-LITE. But, for me, I much prefer Rogue-LITE games over Rogue-LIKE games. Mainly because I like having a sense of progression in my games. So Rogue-lite games are right down my alley.

The game itself has countless builds you can have that surprisingly work well. But, with any RPG/Wave Survival game, tank builds are discouraged. The issue with this is, due to the way the game adopts the Backpack Battles playstyle, shop RNG can completely ruin your run.

The game lacks synergies that change the way your attacks behave and it doesn't fuse weapons into other, more powerful weapons. What it does offer is some weird passive tiers that don't seem to work properly.

The current state of the game is that some classes are so strong that it's an easy win every time on the hardest difficulty (the strongest classes currently, in my opinion, are golem, sentinel and eldritch knight, by round 4-5 they are unkillable) while a few other classes will even struggle slightly on the lowest difficulty. The classes I think need a buff/rework are the adept, knight, weaponmaster, priestess, inquisitor, ranger, duelist, blademaster and rogue.

For some of the classes, namely the knight and blademaster, I think they need a full rework of their kit. The basic knight is just an empty shell of a class, and the blademaster doesn't scale at all. The other weak classes would be fine with just a touch up of the scaling on some of their passives, improving some positive scaling or reducing some negative scaling. The adept class in particular loses HP far too quickly, I've never tested it, but I think it's actually possible to die from leveling up reducing your max hp to 0.

A few classes don't need a buff, but rather a simple weapon addition in their starting weapon selection. These are the Singularist (add claws), Rogue (add shortsword), Crusader (add longsword or halberd), Spellblade (add magic staff), Warlock (add flame wand) and Shaman (add staff of fireball). Each of these weapons are something I would consider central to that class's playstyle and class features, not having it from the start of the run is enough to make playing these classes a struggle, despite the class being strong on paper.

Obviously Brotato itself is a Vampire Survivors derivative, so God of Weapons is a copy of a copy, but the good news is that Brotato is excellent and, for the most part, GoW knows which notes to play. 

Specifically, characters gain extra benefits from focusing on 2-4 stats, weapons have categories/tags that provide multiplicative bonuses, and most non-weapon items provide a both a smaller debuff along with a larger buff, and sometimes the best way to play is to make a character build that minimizes or negates the effects of the debuffs.  

Where GoW expands, rather than merely iterates, is that it adds backpack management ala Diablo 1/2. Leveling in GoW gives you a tiny HP bump, and, more importantly, two extra squares of inventory space. Not only do weapons and items need to fit in your bag, but many (though not as many as I wish) specific weapons gain bonuses when they're placed adjacent to other specific weapons. 

I also think it's worth noting that GoW features more meta-progression than Brotato. Yes, unlocking characters and weapons is the bulk of the work, but there is a ""spend resources between runs to permanently bump your stats"" mechanism, too. 

Unfortunately GoW fails in a few areas.

The biggest offender is that the action is a weird 3/4ths overhead view and both the enemy and weapon hit boxes are... tenuous. These two things combine to make it feel like your positioning provides little if any agency. Don't stop moving, spam dash on cooldown, stack some lifesteal, pray. I know this describes most bulletheaven games, but it's worth highlighting how little it matters in this game. 

Second, there's a ton of slowdown, at least on Steam Deck as of late January 2024. Maybe this isn't an issue on more powerful machines but if you're playing this on deck. To be clear, it isn't game breaking, but it is very noticeable. 

While those are going to be the two biggest red flags for most, my biggest issue is the graphics. Visually, this game is soulless. Simplified, chunky, kinda cutesy, generic fantasy 3D models that look straight out of the worst gacha mobile game.  If you measure graphics a scale with Art (complimentary) on one end, and Content (derogatory) on the other, this is has run is off the chart on the Content side. I feel bad calling it out, because making games is hard, but it's impossible not to notice that the graphics in this game are entirely perfunctory.

That said, I've already played for almost 20 hours, it'll probably take another 5-10 hours to finish unlocking everything, and I like it enough to check back every few months when new content drops. I've more than gotten my money's worth.",1706554877,1706554877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A combination of action shooter and tetris (I know, weird, but go with it!), God Of Weapons is an awesome time-suck.  Plenty of playable characters with different buffs, and tetris-optimizing weapons loadout between rounds is surprisingly satisfying.  I've really enjoyed trying to optimize my choices for the particular game I'm in.  There's no rocket science here, but the action is fast-paced, lots of enemies and frantic moments.  For me, a perfect blend of action action action and then natural pause between rounds to think for as long as I want.  Highly, HIGHLY recommend, especially for a game of this price point.  I paid about $6, and now that I've played it I would've paid 3X that much for it.  Will be buying and gifting to my Steam friends.  It's awesome, and they don't need to know it was $6!  I haven't played it on controller yet, just WASD, but I bet it would play even better on controller.  Finally, the progression up to different characters and going after Achievements is well-thought and doable and adds just that much more polish to a very fun game on its own.  I get one or two achievements per session, and that's just about perfect to keep me interested in coming back to try another one.  Dev recommend: Complicate the floor a bit more so it's a tad more maze-like instead of always rectangles running in circles.  And maybe randomize the buffs on each item a bit more, so I have some harder choices.  And finally, a little more documentation to understand when buffs are weapon-specific vs. universal.

don't buy this game, every time i launch it i waste so much time to make controller work. 
During run i lost many time because controller stop to work for no reasons.
I don't feel any progressions in the game
fight are boring, all same

If you just want inventory management, there are many better options out there

If you enjoy inventory management with a side of souls-like, you'll enjoy this...but... considering most of this game goes on in the inventory phase, it has a few annoying design flaws, the worst of which:

You can have items ""out of your bag"" to make room as you shift things around. If you proceed without putting items back in your bag, they are destroyed (not sold - destroyed). This is fine, except for the fact that there is absolutely no confirmation window. If you click next floor a bit too fast and had something big and important out of your bag, well WOOPSIE. There should be an option you can turn on to have a ""ARE YA SURE, BUD?"" window pop up. That or have the UI be clearer that there's an item down there. Some items have dark textures and they blend in outside the bag, making them easy to miss.

After 4 hours of gameplay, I've *willingly* destroyed an item once. Mistakenly, like, 5-6. Very frustrating.

Less major (imo), but still meh things:

-Not all enemy attack windups are clearly indicated
-Not much stage variation (some, still), and they're all grey/black wood/stone
-Most enemies are dark in color (black, dark red, purple mostly), which makes both points above worse
-The dodge (re)charge indicator is at the very bottom left of the screen, very far away from where your eyes need to be. I thought BOTW made it clear that you -can- in fact have UI next to the character and it's very good? Guess not.",1705982251,1705982291,False,4,0,0.515304684638977051,0,True,False,False

It still has so much update potential, with new levels, bosses, items, characters etc. I'm kind of frustrated that with the latest update, we didn't get new characters, but the new items, bosses and levels are fun.

The inventory management system is not flawless, but it's extremely addictive. Most of the time, I spend 30 secs to a minute in a level, then find myself spending 5-10 minutes on the inventory phase, I really like the combination designs.

- Sometimes enemies spawn before you've risen into the play field. (race condition?)

- There was an achievement for the Spellblade for 25 melee and 25 magic I believe.  It tripped early at 24 melee and 23 magic.  I believe this was the odd bug I saw.

- Sometimes a projectile is fired before the round ends, and breaks a barrel after it ends, but the barrel is empty so there's no item for a 'ball in play', essentially.  (race condition)

- Luck seems to have no affect on barrels.  Barrels are almost always the explodey enemies.

- I have no idea what resource gain does.  I feel like some of these stats should be explained in a help menu.  Does this get money faster?  Or resources for some other stat?

- There was a typo in one of the mouse-over texts for an item.  It was something like ""nearbey"".  Just run a spellcheck over all of those and find it.

- I finally figured out how to make everything explode with a Crosstornado in a helix formation, with the big cannon gun in between (adjacent effect shared).  I added several piercing items and everything explodes, constantly.  It's awesome.  However, I noticed the Crosstornado effect didn't apply until the next round (adjacency evaluation issue?).  It didn't begin doing that until the round after I placed all the items.  There's a Crosstornado bug somewhere.

- If you're purposefully trying to avoid the boss in the last round and go after enemies, there's no boss healthbar to pay attention to.  Need this.

This game is awesome.  I've been pretty obsessed with it for a few weeks now. It feels really rewarding to figure out a new formation (tetris-like) that extends weapon or item effects wider/larger.  The game SORELY needs an endless-mode.  I haven't gotten all the achievements, and I need to unlock 1 character - maybe a cheat mode does exist but I haven't seen it.  This game would be SO MUCH more fun if you could enable:

- Endless rounds, go until you die or quit.

- Make rare weapons appear in any round buying stage.  It's frustrating that the Crystal Staff and others only appear after like level 10 or 15.

- Let you expand the size of the grid to any size.  Or a boundless inventory, so you can just create clusters of items without being space-constrained.

The Future:

- This game desperately needs to become a procedural dungeon crawler.  I loved the Big Update but I felt like the new map effects weren't really reaching what we wanted.  Give me a dungeon with rare weapons appearing in random rooms, or rooms you must fight toward through several others.  Give me several boss characters in deeper rooms or levels (Enter the Gungeon style).

- The game maker has this other game: ""Apocalypse Party"".  They should take these characters and weapons and items and just put them in that game.  Call it ""God of Dungeons"" or something.  I want to do these builds in co-op with friends.",1702503349,1705903106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Would like to have some auto item arrangement without this outside thing, since it's really a time waste to try different ways to fit your things in, could check the effects later, without all this hassle. Why can't you combine using items from outside of the chest? if you bought and you own it, what's the problem? On the same note, how should I know that items on the outside disappear? There's no warning whatsoever, there's no reason for such things and they're barely visible outside so you can forget to put them back.
It's not too obvious at the beginning that some weapons require only 2 items to combine, I guess it's mainly the size but still, there's no explanation whatsover, this ""dark soul"" git gud policy is never good.
The way achievements unlock is also bad, there are achievements that unlock once you finish a run with a character which don't count the progress of the characters you finished with retroactively, means you'll have to finish a run with them again While there's noo real indication on characters if you finished a run using an aspect on 1st diff, as opposed to others that have text in different colors, so maybe that's part of the problem.
After some time, especially when leaving the game in menu and afking, some screen tear begins to appear and by the end of the run sometimes you just can't see anything every second or two.
Can reach 0 health after a floor finishes, which makes you die right away unless you can heal...
no option to hide completed challenges.
The game uses too much resources in the heroes hub or menu for no reason.
Sometimes traps may collide at the beginning of a floor, for example spikes make activate poison urn that spawns on top of it.
Got dodge as berserker during a floor with the exquisite fan t4 item, same problem with wizardd and flagellant's crown t4 item, which can still give melee power and projectile power for recovery.
You can get progress for the achievement that requires you have to less than 10 gold, just from the first round if you don't level starting gold...
Enemies get stuck in some of the terrain and if you have a still build, have to chase them.
The item which transforms into random starting item just disappears sometimes after using it in a run (probably turns into the same thing which is unique so it does nothing).
Why do You have to choose a character to look at achievements or choose upgrades? Even if you can easily switch to others.

The game is pretty enjoyable, mixing gameplay elements from Backpack Hero, Brotato, and Halls of Torment. There are aspects I wish felt less derivative from those games, but it's a satisfying mix of mechanics nonetheless.

-Poor English translation (you understand ultimately what it's trying to communicate but there's no shortage of grammatical errors)
-Some glitched achievements (winning a run with all Priestess and Lancer aspects)
-A couple notable post-run glitches (losing a run right before the timer reaching 0 causes the screen to transition out and not make character selection visible, and some enemies can spawn from a previous lost run on the first room)
-A lack of information about what exactly is affecting stats, no reminders for character effects; basically just more stat information would be nice

 It's a very fun experience creating new builds under each aspect of different classes. My second run was on the hunter where I surrounded his relic which increases the fire rate of adjacent weapons with FOUR AUTOMATIC CROSSBOWS.

A few piercing and damage relics later, each floor was a pretty accurate recreation of Omaha beach, 1944.

 Some downs sides to be aware of:
Progression system is tied to winning runs, and completing achievements, the latter can be a bit messy with some achievements locked behind unlocking classes, without calling out what class needs to be unlocked first.
Progression system via unlocking new items does turn it from 'can I beat floor 20' to 'can I survive until good items show up in the shop' the super crit items is an outlier but very much warps all builds because it lacks downsides.
Runs will prolly end up blending together with enough play time, as the game portion is is 20 floors of about a minute each, with a chance to shop between each floor, without any real variation in the gameplay.

Itemization in this game can be a bit weird at the start; I feel like Luck is the most important early game stat as it affects quality of items found in the shop. While other stats like Experience gain, and the negative stat of more enemies are basically interchangeable for how useful they are.

Game could use a bit of accessibility improvements with it being locked controls - unless I completely missed an options menu for it. - There are some issues with swapping subclasses as I had to swap to a new class first and then reselect the subclass that I wanted. Last thing is I couldn't really bring up class specific information mid-run, so if I wanted to check what improves the crusader aura the only way to find that was die in the run and re-check it on class selection; or hope someone mentioned up to date info on it in the community discussion for this game.",1705717127,1705717127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. The idea is good, Backpack Hero mixed with Brotato. The execution is lackluster.

Cons:
1. Camera angle is atrocious and can't be changed. You do however get used to it. Unfortunately its infuriating trying to dodge projectiles until then.
2. It has the illusion of lots of choices but they're mostly generic and bland. 
3. Only 1 map and 1 (technically 2) bosses. 
4. A cool mechanic I would have liked to play with was the overshield / arcane barrier thing but only 1 class has access to it.

I was quite fond of this game when I first played the demo during a Steam Next Fest. My initial feelings were that the hitboxes didn't seem right, but really liked the unique take of tetris inventory management roguelike.

After playing a good sample of the game, I have mixed feelings on it. I jumped into the game after the 1.5 big update. 

[h2]Things I like[/h2]
[list]
[*]Nice and simple artstyle
[*]Smooth gameplay
[*]Simple but nice sound design
[*]Addictive gameplay
[/list]

[h2]Things I'm not too fond of[/h2]
[list]
[*]Lack of build diversity - there are unlockable classes with unique perks and class items, but certain items will only work with those specific sets
[*]Addictive gameplay, but ti gets tedious because of the point above
[*]The inventory management is a bit too rigid and requires proper placement
[*]The UI is not super clear, the dash bar is a guilty component. It's in the bottom left, I only noticed it after 28 hours later
[*]The class passive is only shown when you pick the class. Nowhere else will it remind you or show it
[*]The game can crash, and annoyingly there's no autosave between floors. So you can lose 40+ minutes of progress
[/list]

[h3]Overall, it's a good game but it does feel shallow the longer you play the game. You'll get your money's worth but I feel like if you want something with deeper mechanics, maybe give this a skip.[/h3]",1705353598,1705521491,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In EtG the first win over the High Dragun is a mere beginning of the actual story; Hollow Knight, Hades, the same. Even the original Vampire Survivors had their deeper levels, their analogue of NG+.

Visually, I think this game looks really nice and I think that the game play is very similar to brotato in terms of play-style, stat scaling and weapon upgrading.

I bought this game on a whim because it was very cheap and thought that it would be interesting, the trailer shows a very large host of classes and weapons to build around etc which maxes it look great however personally, I think all of the characters feel very samey and the starting weapons and items don't add a huge amount of value for me.

Almost all of the enemies behave identically just being re skinned and having more health, it gets very repetitive very fast, too fast for my liking. Another thing is that you get way to much gold and have way to many re-rolls for the amount of inventory space you are able to obtain and the sorting system and inventory management, while looks very nice, feels very clunky without enough space to move things around and there isn't a feature that allows direct item to item swapping if they are the same size which really got on my nerves.

Another thing someone mentioned is the weird isometric view completely ruining your perspective of hit-boxes and making it feel like a very clunky bullet hell.

I personally don't think the inventory system is implemented as well as some other games which are similar (backpack hero/backpack battles which both feel very clean in the inventory).
For me, as of this review, I would rate this game a 6/10 with an 8/10 or 9/10 for potential.

TL;DR this game has great potential if these things are covered:
-Allow for item position swapping
-Allow for more than one item to be outside the inventory as this will make it much less tedious to sort your inventory out.
-Maybe add symbols for specific things like luck and life-steal etc. to stop it all from looking the same and boring.
-Most importantly,  more enemy variety (game play wise not visual wise) to make it more interesting.

If you have had a look at the game and read some reviews, by all means give the game a go as you can always refund but keep what I have said in mind, thank you for reading and happy gaming :).",1705066400,1705066541,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Smooth gameplay
Great item variety / Many build options
Large quantity of uniquely building classes
Large amount of items and characters to unlock for progression

Neutral:
Break whenever you want, good game for if you're busy and doing stuff in between.  Short bursts and short overall time.  I personally count this as a pro, but some may not enjoy the interruptions & short duration.

Cons:
Some obscurity on a lot of the achievements. The steam achievement lists 1 task, but doing it won't give you the achievement. What you really have to do is unlock the mission by completing other missions first shown on the stele in game, before you can do the achievement.  Win 3 runs of specific classes doesn't start counting until you've unlocked all 3 of said classes.  So you can win with 2 but not have the last unlocked, and those don't count.  You need to do all 3 again for the achievement.  Or it was missing info on a specific class you had to play.  This could totally get cleaned/clarified pretty easily.
It would also be really nice to have a lot more boss and [strike]elite variety.[/strike] Edit - Got Added

What i'd like to see - Some different modes with higher numbers of floors, maybe scaling with more difficulty? ie: over 20. (And obviously i'd like to see the cons I listed get fixed up as well.)

Overall, it's a really well designed VS / Backpack hero mix, i'd definitely recommend it for it's modest asking price.

graphics are a nice low poly look animations seem to fit well 
gameplay is a neat mix of vampire survivors and the horde em up with a bit of selective inventory management akin to backpack hero

my only complaints i have really are 
in the between level inventory movement area pick up and drag is a lil wonky
takes a sec to pick some things up sometimes

hit feed back on the player seems a little lacking
sometimes its hard to tell vie been hit in the mass of action
and the dodge cool down indicator is really hard to see in the lower left corner, it took me a few levels to realize that is what that was

otherwise pretty good 
never felt like i was screwed over in the few runs i did
never felt unfair

2342950,155681168,76561198036812874,0,17,399,0,399,1704882295,"TLDR: Game can be fun at its core but there are some drawbacks such as that the game severely lacking polish, quality of life improvements, sound effects and music, game being really unbalanced with some things being orders of magnitude better than others, progression being slow, inventory management is clunky which makes it take twice as long as in similar games to do things and is not very controller friendly so will also be not be that great to control on steam deck. Overall it feels like early access.

Some examples of issues:

Bugs:
After selecting a character to play, sometimes character would not move when I moved controller stick, but all the other controller buttons worked.
Being able to combine the items even when the game says that you can't afford it.

Controls:
I used controller the whole time and the button layout is just very unintuitive. For example every other game uses some version of RB and LB for rotating the item in inventory. This game uses X button to rotate so you can only rotate in one direction and the RB and LB buttons do nothing while holding the item so there is a lot of missed opportunity in how the game controls.

Quality of life features:
You cannot leave mid run and continue your run later, even though the game is wave based and pauses between waves to let you manage your inventory creating a perfect opportunity to jump off and return later.
When you want to go to bottom of the list, pressing up while at the top does not take you down to the bottom, instead if you want to check what the stats at the bottom do you need to press down like  20 times.
You can't swap item in inventory with one being held at the moment. If you want to swap locations of two items of the same size you can't just pick up one item, move it over another and just swap it. You have to first pick up an item, drag it into empty area, put it down, go to the other item, drag it to the first items original area to place it then pickup the first item and move it the original place of second item. Fiddling with inventory like this adds nothing to the game and just wastes players time.
Overall the inventory management takes more time than it needs to take, especially compared to similar backpack management games that have more mechanics and depth but still taking less time to do things in inventory.

Balance:
Some characters have way better starting loadout than others.
Some stats are way better than other stats with luck being pretty much the best stat you can get by order of magnitude. What makes it so good is the issue with how you get stronger weapons and the fact that space is often the most limiting factor in how strong you are, so being able to fill up said space with higher tier items is extremely valuable. Also all of the more fun, interesting and build defining items are of high tier so if you like fun, you have to stack as much luck as you can get away with to have a higher chance of said items appearing.
For example lets say you want a tier 3 automatic crossbow. There are 3 ways to get said weapon.
(1) Just get lucky and have it appear in the shop as tier3 and buy it straight up for 98g from the shop, this one is by far the cheapest and fastest way and luck increases you chance to get lucky and see higher tier weapons and items.
(2) Upgrade your tier2 automatic crossbow that you bough for 57g using arcane anvil that is tier2 item and costs 80g for a total of 137g, luck helps with this method as well as it both increases the chance of getting the anvil as well as finding tier2 automatic crossbow.
(3) Buy 3 tier1 automatic crossbows for 35g each, have the space to hold them in inventory, they each take 6 slots, combine them for 57g into tier2 automatic crossbow, the cost of combining them is the same as just buying the outright, do that again twice to get two more tier2 crossbows and combine all three tier2 crossbows for 98g into tier3 automatic crossbow for a grand total of 584g.

Progression:
At the beginning of the game as you play, you get a tiny amount of meta progression resource to upgrade your characters between runs, you can get them more quickly by playing the harder difficulties that you unlock. You can spend said resource to either make your character stronger, to purchase items to add to the item pool, for some quality if life improvements or to increase how many resources you get. These options pretty much make it so that the last thing you should be buying are more items that increase variety and fun if you want to spend your time efficiently and should instead buy more resource gain and power to be able to play more effectively on harder difficulty. So the best way to play is not the most fun way to play, it is to ignore adding interesting and unique items and just more resource gain and power.

Sound and Music:
They are there, but they are strictly functional and do not evoke any sense of excitement and do not make a game better that much. The game could be with no sound at all and it would not really make it any worse than it is.",1704884499,1704912144,False,3,0,0.557046949863433838,0,True,False,False

StS meets Backpack Hero and it works well.

Still the late game is not fun or meaningful. 
When you have unlocked about 80% of the game, that s when you see that the game didnt get a lot of care. Some weapons effects are not working as written. Some classes specific passives are not working as written. And the balancing highly favors 2 or 3 mechanics, so you are kind of building always the same items, around whatever weapons the game gives you.
It gets repeatitive, stompy and not rewarding as unlocking more of the game only unlocks class-specific items (over different 12 classes).

Pros: Enjoyed the interplay of items and figuring out what to combo with the best. Also inventory tetris-ing to squeeze in that one last piece of gear you want is satisfying. If you get to the end most runs after a point felt godly in the boss doesn't pose much (which can be good or bad).  

Found that I unlocked most of the stuff and was running around with no further use for the collectible pieces since nothing to buy further. Which I wished there were stuff to do with. Run modifiers like anvil being more common or more bosses and tweaking it to be harder could have been neat options for excess currency stuff. 

Classes and their variants (plus the unique class item) can be interesting or just meh variants (looking at juggernaut and the item anti-syngeries with default item for example). Found singularist, scholar and rogue pretty fun. 

cons: There isn't that much variety in the items for some tiers even once all the unlocks due to luck restrictions and alot of unlocks being higher tiers. Additionally for some stats there's not that many items. Like midgame attack speed is mostly clocks which if you are lancer class with default item aren't that great for you. 

It also felt like ranged was severely lacking at highest difficulty tier for most non archer class(class with buffs to ranged) unless you got lucky. pierce dmg drop off(50% for most) makes it kind of a useless tier 3 item. There is a swarm of high spawn rate so you want to get high attack speed but don't usually get enough projectile power/dmg/crit.

So, over the last year, I've played a bunch of ""Vampire Survivors""-like. Each one bring something unique. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. And I expected God of Weapons to be that, a unique mix of VS and Backpack Hero. Instead it seems the devs of this game I've played several fun indie games, took mechanic from them, made them worse, and mixed them together into this game.

From Vampire Survivors, they took the idea of roaming around the map while your weapons auto attack. However, the only map in Vampire Survivors is a small rectangle, sometimes with a few obstacles in the way. There is nothing to discover, the map is just an area to dodge in, not a fun thing to play with and find secrets with like VS various maps. To spice things up, you can try to do achievements like in VS...except GoW lock achievements behind other achievements. Some achievements can only be done if you've done other achievements, even though they are technically unrelated. Worse, the achievements have not been well thought out. Some classes have multiple achievements related to them, others classes have none. A lot of fun aren't particularly fun or interesting.
Finally, they also took the idea of various weapons doing a lot of stuff onscreen, except the game is harder to read, and more importantly, provide no information about how much damages or kills each weapon or item is doing, so you're left in the dark regarding what works and what doesn't, so builds become guessworks

Talking about builds, it seems they took the idea of a complex set of stats and great number of weapons from Brotato. Except, contrary to their inspiration, they didn't provide a single explanation about what each stat does, they have hidden stats (like Pierce), item descriptions are unclear, or sometimes entirely wrong. As a Brotato player, I could recognize the way they displayed skills, and I could guess what the icons meant, but somebody who hasn't played Brotato before will have a much worse time. Even worse, a lot of stats and items seem really unbalanced, with some completely useless, and some must have. The build variety is therefore much worse than in Brotato, you're mostly gonna gravitate around a few concepts, and getting better at the game will only make it more obvious (whereas Brotato was great at encouraging you to try new things, and find new interesting builds that actually work).

Finally, for the last obvious feature, the inventory, the obvious inspiration is Backpack Hero. But once again, they made it worse. Items interactions in the bag are much more limited than in Backpack Hero, and more importantly, they made it a pain to reorganize your pack. Whereas Backpack Hero will allow you to freely remove stuff from your pack temporarily to complete reorganize everything, God of Weapons only give you 2 slots (one of which needs to be unlocked) to put items temporarily out of your backpack. Considering the number of items there are in your pack, it's woefully inadequate, and most of the time you will just let things as they are even if it's not the most efficient, because redoing your whole pack is just awful.

best classes and subclasses, unlocks and fluidity. I usually name Halls of Torment as the best game in the genre that Vampire Survivors founded. but this is almost just as good. and better in a few areas like meta progression and just overall visual niceness.
[VS is extremely good, but has some glaring flaws that show up later when you know the game well... but just buy it, it's the original and has dozens of hours for you anyway.]

the items and classes you can unlock really make a big difference. they're not just gimped versions of the starter class (*cough* like some dude-bro normie game in this genre I won't name)
I see so many things they could add to unlock... maybe different conditions, types of magic... this could get like Soulstone Survivors with its myriad builds and conditions and crazy meta progression (another game that does soooo many things better than everyone else in this genre, but is unplayable unless you use the new slider to tone down visual noise in settings)

not needed atm, but if they add more mechanics, give me meta progression where I can exclude certain things from showing up by banning them

it is hard to put into words what makes this game so much fun. it just is so well done. maybe that's it... it just knows exactly what it does and does that. so many games ignore the things people really like and add stuff nobody cares for these days.

it's nice to see a survivors game (essentially a reverse bullet hell) just be that. no stupid manual aiming, no messaging, no depressive garbage setting [zombies/post apoc], no dodge simulator (you can dodge, but I end up almost never using it -- try that in Soulstone Survivors lol... [still such an amazing game and one of my all time favorites of this genre]

if you like this genre, this is a must buy. Vampire Survivors is the original. but it's not as much fun as this game or the other two I've named. unfortunately, a lot of games copied exactly the worst parts of VS and added *manual aiming* off all things and then puzzle over why their ratings are in the mid 70s... 

this is one of the best genres to come along in a looong time. and this is one of the best games in it. it has potential to be *the best*, but for that, it'd need some outdoorsy, sunny environments. that's the one thing I am missing.

You don't find items within floors- occasionally, you get little buffs in breakable barrels, maybe a heal or some money. 
If you like Tetris, packing suitcases, organizing inventory, or perfecting your storage system in Minecraft or Terraria, this game might just be for you. However- other than moving, individual floors are largely set-and-forget, and there isn't much variety between floors visually. Even with this minor gripe, most of the gameplay is visually clear, and character designs are charming and easy to tell apart. One very actionable flaw, however, is the blacksmithing screen- it's very difficult to read. It absolutely needs some sort of darker backing to separate unobtained items and the background. I often find myself mousing over background objects, thinking they're unpurchased items.
Some small additions to clarity would help, especially in terms of unlock conditions. I'm attempting to clear with only daggers, and it's not apparent if that means only daggers and no other items, or only daggers as weapons, and items are allowed.

I'm really glad this pulled me in because the game is a really interesting take on the genre. There are two phases to every level. The combat phase is well done, but fairly standard survivors-like with dodging and powerups. The other phase is expanding and filling your inventory.

But you also need to fit them in  your inventory and the items are all of different shapes and sizes. And you also get adjacency bonuses by placing them next to other items.

There's no ""story"" really, just the fighting, so the focus is on the looks and functional details of the weapons and items you unlock and collect.

This rogue-like has everything I love about the genre - a strong visual style, the dangling carrot of visible but locked progression of new characters that keeps me coming back again and again, a pretty fast run time per round of approx 30 minutes, and lots of tiny, granular choices that affect the outcome of each individual fight and floor. The god-like aspect comes in from the auto-battle aspect of not having to press a button to activate the weapons - they float around your character and attack independently - the only thing the player, and the character, has to do is walk and dash. (The Dash ability is explained in a very simple tutorial pop-up, which could be improved by mentioning the cooldown timer - you cannot spam dash to avoid attacks like a dark souls game - the Dash is only for escaping a cluster of enemies once every 2 seconds.)

This game's simplicity of design is both a positive and a flaw - on the positive side, it really gets the player into the action quickly, gets them to learn by doing, and is not intrusive visually during runs. There is no ""story"" that requires brain power to follow or remember between runs, there is only the fight! This makes this game really attractive to play for stress relief, for that feeling of slowly but surely improving and broadening one's options.

On the negative side, there is not enough tutorial to explain the menu between floors - it took me several floors to notice the re-roll button for the shop on the left, several runs for me to notice the Lock function that keeps an item pinned so that it remains between floors and is unaffected by the Shop Refresh within the same floor. And several HOURS before I noticed it is possible to pay gold to shuffle the spots on offer to expand your inventory after a Level Up!

The only change I would strongly recommend is to add a second table or book to the starting area's Armory Room, to allow us to view available weapons and items and their stats. AND explanations of those stats. So the player can more easily plan their runs in-game without needing external guides or notes. For example, there is no way to know from the game's text alone what ""Luck"" does, that info is only found elsewhere online. To keep the sleek and simplified visual aesthetic, I think this info can be semi-hidden in a menu or an optional location, like the Armory room itself is.

Another feature I would like is the ability to (outside of runs) zoom in on character models while they are all standing around on the ground floor. Or, have their models show up with lots of detail visible, in a Journal option in the menu, or something like that. If i want to make canon-accurate fan art of the Berserker, I'd like to be able to see all the outfit details! :)

I have 21 hours in this game at time of review, so I'm not sure if this feature will be available later, but I would like something like the ""banish"" option found in Vampire Survivors, where the player can remove items from appearing the shop's offerings. There are two ways I can imagine to do this - either add a book containing all the unlocked items (as mentioned above), and allow a certain number of Banish Slots that could be increased at the Altar, to be spent on hiding or banishing the items from that book, where any item could be toggled on or off between runs, and the Banish Slots are refunded easily. (That is how VS does it.) 

Or, a gold-pay option in the Shop, where the player would see an item in the Shop between floors, an dwould have the options to Lock, Buy, or Banish the item. After picking Banish, that item would not appear in the shop again during that run. If the player made a mistake, it is already very easy to abandon a run in the menu and start a new one, so that makes for simple management.",1701391922,1701391922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Many classes, each have 3 sub class you can choose
- Wide variety of weapons
- The idea of combining RE and a roguelike game is executed pretty good.
THE BAD:
- The impact of monster's hits is awful. Idk if it's the camera's fault but you get hit even when the enemies not really touch you. 
- Monsters can deal damage to you both rapidly when touching you and using their skills, which is horrible with this small arena. And the number of monsters is many, but your weapons can't kill 1/4 of them all the time.
- Defense layers are useless. Monster can rapidly touch you without cooldown between touchs but your dash has cooldown, even between 2 dashes when you upgrade the maximum dash count. And no sign which shows if your dash is able to use or still on cooldown. Leeching is useless because it only leechs 1 HP each time. Armour is the same since leeching is meh and they can hit you multiple time with huge damage with 1 second touch.
- Too many stats but items provide too little and mostly with a downside effect, 2-3 or weird slots.
- Too grindy, not finishing a run only gives tiny number of materials, even when it's a 99% run.",1700819476,1701139557,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

My surprise is only somewhat facetious. This is a Meat Game (i.e. ""X meets Y""), in this case it's Vampire Survivors meets Backpack Hero, and there isn't a dang thing about this game that doesn't scream ""formula-driven"". The thing is, if either one of those styles of play is capable of sucking you in, then God Of Weapons will do so, EFFICIENTLY.

My main complaint, and indeed the main reason I'm so surprised I spent so much time on this thing, is that all meta-advancement is so you can get better at fighting the same enemies in the same environment, on repeat, forever. There's only one type of environment, a stone dungeon looking thing that is a slightly different size every time, and occasionally has a couple token obstacles or spike traps. There's plenty of characters to unlock, and each character has different ""aspects"", all of which change the build strategy, but really all you need to know is, what bonuses does this character/aspect give you, and from there you just buy the items that go with that.

The arrangement mechanics are probably what sucked me in the hardest. The more powerful weapons have harder shapes to work with, and the rules for expanding your inventory space include a random element that ensures you'll always be one space short of goal and using the ""lock item"" feature to hold an item until your next buy phase. But I can genuinely say this grabbed me, and it's satisfying to pull off an arrangement that turns the ever-growing goon squad into gibs and loot drops.

All in all, I can say I got way more than my money's worth out of this, and Bonk help me, I'm probably gonna go play it some more after I write this. But I won't be proud of myself.",1700722118,1700722118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To those that loved Legos and Tetris in the 90's. 
To those that like RPG with bunch of classes and sub-classes. 
To those that enjoy bullet hells. 

This game is for you. 

It got some fixes yet to be done but it's a great game overall. If you read this around November 2023 then you're at a great time to join because most of the annoying bugs and errors have been fixed already and there's just new content and features to be made.

Make your own build, explore the possibilities on each of the classes you can play, unlock achievements, sit back and kill everything that steps in your way or harden every hit you take and survive through all the 20 floors. 

Don't like the music? Go ahead and disable the game music and play your own playlist.
The game crashes? This is probably because of your computer settings or your graphics card, the game has excellent yet simple graphics and can run smoothly on most settings.
You feel like you're just doing the same things over and over again? Then go wild and try a new build. Be persistent and find your own way to enjoy the game, it has so much to try and so many ways to clear the floors that you'll find yourself thinking about new characters and items you might try your next run.
You have a lot of ideas on things that could enhance the user experience for this game? Go ahead and leave a comment on the discussion board so the Devs can see it. I'm sure they appreciate all the feedback they can get from players since it's still a newborn. 
You have a lot of complaints about this game? Ugh, you disgust me. Go ahead and comment them on the discussion board but know that ""A Man's Ambition Should Never Exceed His Worth"".

If by now you don't feel intrigued or encouraged to play, then don't buy it and move along, this is not for you.

It scratches both the bullet hell hoard slaying and inventory management itches with enough progression to make it re-playable. The developers also seem active with some road maps in their Discord. For the price point, you can't go wrong with this game since it is fun to play during lulls or in-between other games.

What I would hope is added:
- More difficult bosses with better mechanics like Halls of Torment. Something that can provide more of a challenge and would therefore be more rewarding to kill once you make it through 20 floors.
- Challenges, like Boss arenas (maybe load fallen champions or give X Gold / X Levels at start)
- Previous run history with stat chart and inventory screenshot
- Endless mode

What I hope is improved:
- Inventory management feels loose, the items seem to update based on where you clicked them instead of a consistent position on the mouse. It's manageable, but also it's a large mechanic of the game and therefore can be a bit annoying. ""Backpack Battles"" does this really well.
- Dash screen notification or HUD element to better track its cooldown, especially with +1 Dash boots.

How I beat the difficulties (for the first time):

T2: Rogue using Daggers
T3: Singularist using a Whirlwind Axe

Inventory management in this type of game is new for me in that you have to upgrade your bag size by leveling up to hold more items or weapons and you have to plan for which weapons or items you want as you upgrade the bag so they can fit.

In terms of items and weapons there's a lot of variety especially once you get to unlocking some of the crazier ones though wouldn't mind seeing some others get added to make game runs more interesting but I'm sure they have more coming.

Of the characters I feel there's some better than others though maybe that's just me not playing them right but I would like to see more if they add them in future updates. Maybe some monster classes, fusion of two characters, or collab ones if the can.

The difficulty is pretty hard at first till you can figure out what items and weapons to use then it just depends on how fast you can kill the other enemies before they wipe you out.

Upgrading the permanent statue is also hard at first if you can't kill the first boss to get upgrade stones but once you can, get the upgrade that has a chance for the stones to drop to make life easier since it's also used for buying the items and weapons.

Soundtrack is ok but I generally started playing my own music after a while to mix it up.

I do like the concept of the game and the way devs tried to differentiate the game from other action rogue like games.

But I can't recommend it in it's current form.
Why?

1) Difficulty scaling - it's really hard to get to a new difficulty tier while trying to gather resources to upgrade your stats and expand your arsenal. Shards and keys for 1 weapon or equipment? It seems strange to me.

Also there is no options to adjust a difficulty like in brotato. 

2) Meta progression - upgrades don't really give you much of advantages, for example decrease dodge cooldown(how long the base cooldown?) to 15% for the total of 45 shards - really strange. 
Attack speed or critical chance, base damage, etc. - missing, why? 
+ the rate of which you gain shards - ridiculous, and tiers don't really help with it, if you die you won't get any. 

3) Weapons and variability - oh boy, the game is about the weapons, their variability but the weapons only differ in stats and their bonuses, for example 2 different daggers have the same moveset and the first gives you increased attack speed if placed near the same daggers (also have greater stats) and the second one gains more attack the more kills you get with it (20 kills for +1 damage), which one would you buy? 
That can be applied to the other types of weapons, but there is more to it - some weapons are obsolete in comparison with others, you quickly find out the best ones and you pretty much stick to them for the whole playthrough. 
Why there is no different movesets and attack combination, just strange. 

Also, you can only upgrade weapons via an anvil, which improves the weapon to the next tier. You can't combine 2 or 3 versions of the same tier weapon to get it to the next level, why? The game gives you so many tier 1 weapons that you don't know how to use and if you lucky enough you will get a chance to see tier 3 and 4. 
BTW the anvil is a rare item that's hard to find. 

4) Enemies and attack patterns - they just strange.
Some enemies clearly show you their attack so you could move away or dodge.
Others not so much, they just run straight into you and often the target system can't decide the priority of attacks. 
You can't see their approximate range and that leads to a hit. 

Damage is pretty high so any mistake might cost you a game, armor and dodge doesn't really help.

The combat or vampire survivor style gameplay is kind of barebone, not that many different enemies and especially bosses.

Nothing that can't be improved with patches though but for now does not feel like that part really went out of early access.

Where it shine is in the variety of characters and items combined with the inventory management where you'll spend more time than in battle. What stats or item do you go for? Do you stay safe and take this item or risk some gold to get a reroll and different options? It's fun to experience with different built, try to shove as many weapons in your inventory as possible to see the explosion of animation it create in battle.

Firstly, I'm writing this review after completing all content in the game. I thought it would be interesting to do it this time around since the achievements seemed pretty straight forward.
Well, to start I think this game was easy to understand and get into, the themes were interesting, bringing generic rpg classes into a  ""climb the tower"" story, told only by game mechanics and environment. Different characters can be unlocked as you explore these game mechanics and they have class variations that customize gameplay even further; The Graphics are generally nice and pleasing to watch, as well as many visual effects from the weapons themselves. The game features an inventory management system that lets you customize your play patterns  and adds difficulty to the game.

Now, there are several specific good and bad things I found while playing the game and would like to describe here so others can understand better what I've been talking about:


CHARACTER DESIGN:
Designs and their variations are usually appealing, with the king one having the most different 3d models variants. However, there seem to be some random sexualized characters such as the lancer and priestess which have common tropes such as boob a thigh windows and ""battle lingerie"". Finally, in general, all skins are ok, but feature very few differences between themselves mostly being color variations and different accessory models, which, don't get me wrong, are usually fine but sometimes make it hard to discern which class variation is it.

WEAPONS:
Most weapons look super cool, not only the models, but also in game as they attack. There are enough variations and types of weapons, making it possible to pivot and develop your game plan throughout the floors as well as just keep it simple and use one type of weapon the whole run. Personally, I didn't like the dual blades and the big lifesteal scythe for their attack patterns and damage weren't worth the space. My favorite ones were normal dagger, thunder spear, trident, cannon and throwing hammers.

ITEMS and STATS:
Unfortunately I don't think most items were interesting, many of them are just stats tradeoffs, with only tier 3 and 4 actually changing how things work. But, as weird as that sounds the most useful items are those stat ones at the beginning, they will set your survival for the whole run. That said, the importance of those attributes vary, not only as you progress through the game, but also as you understand what actually makes you live. Earlier on, having tons of blow horns will secure survival and help you understand enemy patterns and such. But later on things like Range and Attack Speed will keep most of the enemies at bay. However, there are some problems still, I think that the payoffs for having negative movement speed outvalue practically everything else and it is almost always correct to go for it in almost all scenarios. The real problem here is that there should be more payoffs for having more speed for example.

MECHANICS and BALANCING:
First of all the normal camera was hard to play with, even with just a small tweak by changing it in the settings some of the hitboxes of projectiles are not as precise as they seem. This is a minor feedback, for the major problem and basically the ranged winged elite that shoots projectiles and the final boss’s spinning aoe effect. For some reason this enemy is harder than the final boss in any difficulty and the final boss’s spinning sword aoe skill have very little visual effects to cue this ability is happening in the middle of some many other enemies.

BACKPACK MANAGEMENT:
Ok, this part is not well done. This feature is not fluid, it’s hard to reorganize items, there is no way to simply remove all items and such. The idea is good, but the released feature is kinda clunky. I wished it was something more similar to the new released game Backpack Battles, which really gives the player the capacity to manage the grid tetris to their favor.",1700174537,1700174930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- There are no item combinations like in Backpack Hero, only adjacency buffs

I recommend this game only because of the price point; it's worth $5 on sale.
This game has great ideas and a good core, but there are many things that are not as polished as other titles that you won't pick up on until hours in -

1) You can't quit a run half way through and resume, which is a big problem for two reasons
a) The runs take twice as long as something like Brotato due to the inventory management
b) The game will crash sometimes, and there goes your run
2) The game only has one music soundtrack that repeats for every floor
3) This is more annoying than it sounds - the text color of a character you have won with changes but ONLY if you beat on difficulty 2 or higher, making it impossible to tell which characters you have beat the game on difficulty 1, and there are achievements for beating a run with each character. This issue is due to  first difficulty text color being white just like the default. One of them should be changed to grey or something.
4) You can't view your inventory when you pause the game
5) If you have an item outside your inventory and forget to put it back in, the game doesn't warn you before you start the next wave, burning up the item
6) The menu in the Armory area is hard to see because of the transparent background letting the forge light through
7) Sometimes the bottom of the inventory gets bugged and it won't let you buy a weapon that would obviously fit there until you beat the next floor and come back to the shop. This happened multiple times, and yes I quadruple-checked that the weapon would fit in the spot.

Like the name of the game implies, it's about the weapon combinations that make any particular build viable... but more importantly, there's basically an inventory management mini-game/puzzle where you balance the needs of your character against where you're at in a given run.

That said, some details you might want to know about the game are:
1. There are elite monsters that'll show up, at a baseline of floors 10/15.  There are, however, only 2 types of elites that can appear: the succubus and the beholder.  That's it.
2. Similarly, there are only 2 bosses throughout the game.  One variety on the last floor of the lowest difficulty and one variety on the last floor of the remaining 4 difficulties.  
3. There are only 20 floors for each difficulty at a maximum.
4. There are a bunch of different weapon and character combinations.
5. Much of the weapon access is gated by achievements on previous characters.

There is something to be said on the limited variety on elites and bosses.  There's something to be said about how 20 floors can stop feeling like a challenge.  It can feel [i]disappointing[/i] to see the ""victory"" appear at the end when you want to keep going.  But it's important to recognize that it's disappointing because this game is, most importantly, [b]fun[/b].  Therefore, this game has a hearty endorsement from me.

I would also like to clarify that a broad sense of a good quality game is also defined by its value proposition.  For me, that's something close to 1 hour of legitimately fun gameplay (not gimmicky throttling) per dollar spent.

You choose a class, and get tossed into the dungeon with a starter weapon.  Gameplay involves running and dashing around a dungeon room, trying to avoid getting touched or shot by mobs.  Break one of the barrels which randomly appear, and you could find one of a few power-ups, health-boosting food or a stick of dynamite that blows up after a few seconds.  

Mobs often drift towards you, asking to have their necks cut by your trusty whateverweaponyourecarrying.  Some, though, will snipe at you from a distance, forcing you to dash in their direction and take them out before they add to the bullet hell rooms can become.  All of this time, you collect gold, which is used to buy stuff between each floor.

That ""stuff buying"" is what makes this game unique.  You only have a limited inventory space, so whatever you buy has to fit in the grid that will expand slightly as you beat each dungeon floor.  One of the tricky parts is that you're offered expansion before you buy anything, so you have to watch what's available, and hope the RNG grid expansion choices let you create a shape where the stuff can fit.

The ""stuff"" you're buying consists of weapons and stat boosters which only last until you die.  After a dozen floors, your inventory is crammed with weapons, each of which is used to fight off the mobs; have 6 swords in there, and you're a walking food processor, pureeing mobs as needed.

Trying to assemble and balance inventory is a crucial part of this game, adding a bit of jigsaw-like puzzling to make sure you're using your available space as efficiently as possible.

Honestly, before playing I thought the game might suck a bit - but it doesn't.  While the graphics are a little isometric-cartoony, the atmosphere and slightly-frantic pace of the gameplay keep you engaged.

Pros
Very low level of entry, low skill ceiling. very genre beginner-friendly
The progression system feels satisfying
Weapons and Character unlocks are bound to Achievements, making the achievements feel satisfying
Weapons are diverse enough that they permit for varying play-styles.
Weapon set bonuses promote for item diversity.
Character Modifiers promote build diversity, as well as allow for starter item mix-match for some level of customization.
The inventory management ""mini-game"" is intuitive and easy to master.

Cons
The game's simplicity promotes for meat grinder AFK builds.
Sweeping weapons heavily outclass linear weapons do to all rooms being wide open.
The game rewards you more for AFK building than movement based builds.
All rooms behave the same, with a few tiles randomly getting obstacles.(which don't matter with AFK builds)

You can definitely play this strictly on controller but the UI doesn't provide much hints on how to navigate, especially when it comes to the backpack itself.

The lack of mid-run save is also a downside. You either have to leave the game on if you want to continue where you left off, or quit the whole run altogether if you need to take an extended break.

Characters have a variety of up and downside, keeping the runs interesting for a good while.
Even though i was annoyed by it at first, sorting through your weapon case was alot of fun. Taking into account different shapes and sizes of weapons and items gave the game some extra depth and time to calm down between chaotic waves.

After you unlock everything, the builds start to feel very similar. All you want is attack speed, damage, range and lifesteal. Luck and EXP early on. Especially on Calamity 5 you have to build the same way to survive the early rounds.

I would love some more variety in future patches. Many items of higher rarity feel extremely underwhelming besides the saddle or the eye, which give you extrordinant amounts of damage if you stack + or - movement speed. 

Overall more variety would do the game good. More weapons to unlock. more bosses, bigger rounds etc.

Characters are good as is but could probably use a balance overhaul. I felt like characters like the Spellblade or Ranger are basically vanilla characters which barely affect a run at all while Thief, Weapon Master and Singularist HUGELY overperform.

Edit/Update: I found out what was causing my health to drop to 1, it only happens when i take a life steal item, such as the voodoo doll, or the glove.
Pros:
Wonderful time waster! I have casually played this for a little under 10 hours now.
Its not super easy, and it plays a lot like how a 3.D. dungeon crawler backpack hero would play.
Low skill to learn.

Cons:
The game is short 
the game has a meta that needs to be abused currently for longer tiered runs.
The +1 Pierce does not work for ALL projectile weapons.
It feels like the meta currency is random even when defeating a run/elite its not always guaranteed to grant you the amount expected of that tier of run.

Current Annoyance:
The biggest qualm i have with the game at this current moment is that for some reason my health just keeps getting reset between shops to 1, I don't know if this was intended for level 3 difficulty to do that, but its sadly caused me to lose 3 level 3 runs in a row. If not intended great I'll come back to play when patched out. 

If the game is abandoned and will not be getting updates to fix these bugs my score goes from a 7.5/10 to a 2.5/10

The inventory management is great.  The amount of spaces you get as you level feels fair and the choices in how to build out your inventory and re-arrange items can be really interesting/stressful.  There's a lot of fun gambles on it as well including [spoiler]an item that lets you expand your inventory at the cost of having to fight two extra elites next round.[/spoiler]

The characters and items are locked behind achievements and I find that quite enjoyable.  It gives you a goal beyond ""Here's the random items I was dealt, how do I want to build this round?"" you usually get in Survivors-likes.  It's really satisfying when you pick two or three goals and you actually achieve them.

I only have two complaints:
[b]1) There is no auto-save.[/b]  Normally, that's not a big deal with a Survivors-like game, but this game goes for 20 levels including shuffling your inventory around between them and I had a game where it crashed on level 19 and I was having an amazing run.  It felt really fucking bad.  If there had been an auto-save system for crashing, I might've been able to load back in and finish the run.

[b]2) As far as I can tell, there is a limit on[/b] [spoiler]how many extra elites you can summon for the next round. [/spoiler]  I'd like there to be consequences for when I get greedy.  [spoiler]If there is a hard limit, (which seems to be 3?) then deciding whether to take something that'll make more of them becomes a boring no-brainer.  I had one moment where I stopped and realized I was greedy and spawned in seven extra elites and thought I had ended the run with my greed.  As far as I could tell, 3 spawned in.  It was really anticlimactic. [/spoiler]

What I liked most:
1 - The sound effects of the weapons are very pleasing (specially the range ones);
2 -  The game's achievements guide you to explore what is unique in each character;
3 -  To beat the harder difficult levels you are required to understand the mechanics and items' synergies, invest in general upgrades and unlock better items.

It is on ealy access so I hope it improves even more over time. These are the aspects of the game that I think need some work at this stage:
1 - They need to allow the players to return items bought with divine favors, in case they regreat it;
2 - Don't show items that make no sense for a character (for example, why show ranged weapons in the store after each level for a character that can't use ranged weapons? or why show life stealing items for a character that can't use life stealing?)
3 - Create a few achievements for beating level 5 difficult with different characters; 
4 - Melee damage and aome melee characters need buff;
5 - Create more tags on the items (it is not very clear what counts as  what in the game).

That being said, in my opinion, the game is more than worthy for the price tag in the state that it is right now.",1697925550,1697925550,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

That’s right; you will spend much more time in your inventory and shop than in arena fighting. The arena gameplay is dull; on the earlier floors, you run in circles trying not to get hit, and on the later floors, you run in circles trying to hit as many monsters as possible.

There are lots of items and playable characters, but the gameplay is always the same: only some items work well with your character, so you stack them until you are overpowered.

The meta-progression (permanent stat boosts, new items to shop, new characters) is fun, but after about 20 hours, everything will be unlocked, and you can’t really spend resources anymore.

You kill enemies in short 1 minute rounds and you expand your inventory and try to fit as much buffs and weapons into it as possible sometimes shifting things around.   

It has a lot of variety and each class has 3 different subclasses that allow for other builds.   
Almost everything has some sort of synergy with each other so it allows for a lot of mixing and matching of equipment.  

Apart from other games like this it features a simple dash, but that allows for more refined and specialized gameplay and reminded me of Hades a bit.

Simple yet allows depth.   

I would like to see a special bar and dash upgrades in future updates with unique specials per class and perhaps subclass if the dev is reading this.   
Also perhaps some in arena special items that are on pickup consumable.
Also a better balance between having slots and money for upgrades since currently you have more money than upgrade slots very often.

If you liked Brotato and you like inventory management - get it - it's worth every penny.

Graphics and audio are on high level (cartoonish style).

Gameplay wise - I didn't encounter any bugs. Inventory management could be more accurate (sometimes item you want to place mismatches with mouse cursor but then you should look at model of item rather than mouse cursor :))

Movement - good movement with dash included. Sometimes you encounter rocks/environment elements you can't pass that are not that visible with enemies on screen.

Itemization - plenty of items and weapons. The ultimate combo is lifesteal set (crown + heart + lifesteal items) which gives huge damage boost. Add unique weapon with gold on lifesteal and you are unstopabble. This can be considered as pro and con at the same time.

Characters - 12 characters with 3 subclasses gives you 36 unique runs to finish.

But DEVS... please consider a couple of quality of life updates. 

1) Give us a control scheme other than WASD. I play a lot of these games sitting in my chair in my front room and having to lean up and use the keyboard to play is a pain. Controller support is preferred but even simple mouse movement option would be helpful, and I doubt these elements are hard to include these days. Expand this and expand interested players. 

2) The upgrade system seems a bit slow. As of this writing I think I have done around 10 runs with no noteable reward as of yet. I appreciate a slightly grindy upgrade game, but I'm not going to put 300 hours into this game, so please allow players to feel some progression a bit faster as they play. 

I am still giving this game a positive review. The graphics are good, the inventory grid system is interesting, but there are a couple things that would make this game that much better. I hope the devs read this and consider these suggestions.",1697277744,1697277744,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- you guys can add some harder achievements.
-after obtaining every weapon and items there is no need for the ore... so you can simply do a NG+ system that you can buy for 6th and 7th game difficulty, or you can use them for buying inventory slots for the 6th difficulty.
-you can add a story mode, or a story behind it like ""no ending dungeon and  trapped souls trying to find a way out of this misery"". no big changes, but a little story can add something.
-Joker Weapon.... silly item that starts as a joke.... and stay as a joke rest of the run... People try to beat the game with it 

I played the game with controller but it has some problems in the inventory system. 

-Right analog stick can be used as a mouse cursor, it can save lots of time. 
-You can use L2 and R2 as ""reroll"" and ""next level"". 
-Left analog stick can be used for inventory and movement buttons can be used on shop.

Half the game takes place tweaking your inventory and items, getting the biggest bonuses, ensuring synergy and hoping for the rare unique to make your armoury sing!

A surprising amount of unlockable content too. Lots of items to change things up and character subclasses/loadout alternatives to unlock.

Now, the bad stuff. The actual arena is pretty dull and enemies spawn in and... Die mostly. Some spawn stuff, others shoot stuff, most just chase you. They have one or two dungeon features to take up space but its monotonous. Enemy variety will do much to help ease that, as well as giving us some actual maps to play in instead of mostly empty rectangular arena's.

The core game is *surprisingly* solid given the premise and there is lots of room for improvement down the road.

Maybe I have not progressed enough yet to know any better but so far the game play feels far more bland and less satisfying than other similar rogue-likes of its price range (Vampire Survivors, Soulstone Survivors, Halls of Torment ect), progression seems to be limited by hours put into the game, unlocks and shear blind luck rather than individual player skill/strategy or decision making.

You will spend far more time in the more interesting inventory shop than you will in the actual arena playing the game and fighting mobs, rolling for good drops in the shop is actually more fun and exciting than any fight in the levels so far, which leads me to my second problem with the arena game-play seemingly having no skill ceiling or skill floor, enemies hit you when they have not yet touched you via your extremely large hurt-box or by spawning on-top of your location which the arena size doesn't do much to help. I don't like video-games being easy so usually i would see this as a good thing to ramp up difficulty but my decision-making/positioning and skill do not seem to make as much of  a difference on getting me through a tough level as much as just having out of run unlocks through hours played or having good luck in the shop and rolling good items to the point that everything dies before it becomes a threat.

It feels like the perfect mix of Brotato's gameplay loop and Backpack Battle's shop phase, with each being a vital component to the game and neither of them failing to stimulate different sides of my brain to ensure neither get too stale.

The good: 
I love puzzle games and Tetris, so trying to fit all my items into my backpack is genuinely fun, and racking my head around which items should stay, which should be upgraded is probably one of my largest time sinks in this game

The gameplay is good enough for what this game is trying to be, I don't feel like I'm sweating trying to get through every wave, but I can feel my heart race when I take far too much damage too quickly and count down the seconds just praying that I survive.

The diversity is amazing, every class having 2 additional subclasses to unlock with 2 additional relics that will change the way you think of building every time you go in, giving you plenty of choices to pick from, or challenges to work towards if you're finding that your struggling with what you current have available to you.

The Enemies are all different and behave different, while the general action is to [Move Towards Player] they all have their own movements, their own attacks, patterns which you learn and adapt to the more you play and enemies you come to fear and try to plan around because you know how devastating 8 small slimes or 7 baby scorpions can be when you have no AOE, they matter and will make sure you are playing to the best of your ability, easily punishing you for overconfidence trying to reach a barrel for a couple of dollars.

The levels vary in size and obstacle amount, while it might seem small, I love that I have to change my playstyle based around the enemies currently spawning and the layout of the floor I'm currently on, long yet thin levels feel compact and intimate, like every point of attack speed will count as all the enemies have no choice but to spawn next to me, where as large open levels feel like dodge, move speed, range, and smart dash usage feel much more important as enemies can launch ranged attacks from much further away and I can't just be a sitting duck (unless my build revolves around that)

The Okay:

I love the items, how they feel and how they look, but judging from the discussion boards and even some of the problems I've had, some items that have additional effects than just a flat stat boost like ""Set your HP to 1 at the start of the round after this was purchased"" or ""Gives +8% Bounce for each adjacent Throwing Weapons"" While functional and very cool, could definitely use better visibility to avoid people thinking they were bugs, or working improperly (The +8% Bounce applies TO the adjacent weapons, not to the base weapon as I had thought from the wording)

The Meta currency, affording you power ups for future runs and the ability to purchase stronger items to appear in future shops. I'm a bit mixed as while I wish there would challenges to unlock the items instead of just buying them with boss currency and challenge keys, they are fine and I can give them a pass. I'm a bit saddened that there isn't a big currency sink from what I've seen after you've purchased everything you can (Not that I have any ideas what it could be) and that they'll just kinda pile up, leaving the only purpose for a full difficulty 5 clear on all characters just being satisfaction that all their subclass names are Orange.

The Bad:

Item managing, specifically the inability to not just rotate, but fully flip the item. Some items have weird shapes and I with I could position them in a way that better suits forming a dense shape around my starting relic, but I am sadly not afforded that option because my items can only be rotated in 1 of 4 directions, no ability to flip non-symmetrical items. while this isn't usually an issue later in the runs as you'll usually get a much larger backpack and a lot more items to help fill in and spaces that are left open, it hurts just a little bit not having a visually pleasing backpack at the end of the run to be able to show my friends to convince them to buy the game

Boss Diversity is also lacking, all of the enemies are visually and functionally difference and usually start appearing at predictable points in the run if it calls for it, but no matter what item you consume or socket into your backpack, you'll only be greeted by 1 of 2 minibosses, and while they are well telegraphed and hit equally as hard, I wish there were more of them to send shock through me and make me consider my build further before telling the game to send 5 at me because I know I can take 'em all. The same goes for the boss, I wish there was another we could see, as I think every time I've gotten to them, I've only died once to them, and I've only beat the game through time due to lack of DPS once, so more variation is welcome!

I love this game and am going to go for 100%, I can only hope the devs have more in store for the game, more characters, more items, possibly even new game modes with endless or hyper speed for bragging purposes. You guys did AWESOME and I'm so happy there are so many bundles for different games for a cool deal and different experiences depending on which parts of the game you enjoyed and which you didn't.",1696530111,1696530111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game runs in timed stages where you run between a lot of enemies trying to kill and survive at the same time but, in between, you get to manage a square divided inventory (like the ones on Resident Evil or the old Diablo)  where you need to put the weapons and items and potions that you buy in a randomized store. Some Items have synergies between and different qualities  them so carefully managing them is vital to your survival and to your build optimization and this change of rythm between the game loop and the inventory management section works great.

On top of that, you have many different classes and subclasses that create their own synergies with some weapons or items (IE: Knight favours armor and big weapons, rogue has more damage the more daggers you have, etc...) And you unblock many more by completing milestones and achievements. 

It is A LOT of fun for the price, so I highly recommend it if you like the genre and if you love to manage inventories.

That being said, lets get to *why* you should buy it:
If you're familiar with the Vampire Survivors genre, you know that most VS games follow a similar formula. You enter a map and face waves of enemies that grow in size and power over the course of 20 to 30 minutes while leveling up and building your equipment with the goal of surviving to the end.

The problem with these games is that, once you become knowledgeable of what works and what doesn't, with a little luck you'll hit a point where you can basically just set the controller down and watch as your character stands still killing everything on the screen. It becomes a glorified screensaver and loses the thrill and engagement you had when you were starting out and eventually becomes boring to play.

God of Weapons gets around this by splitting the level up into stages. Rather than one continuous 20 minute level, you'll fight on 20 stages that each last 45-ish seconds. Between each stage you must manage your inventory, and that's where the real magic is. 

I didn't expect to like this aspect, but it turns out that expanding and managing your inventory is a game in and of itself and fiddling with the puzzle of getting the most out of it works to engage with and bring your focus back to the game regardless of how well you're doing during the fights. The game is generous with the resources you use to buy items and upgrades so you can put quite a bit of effort into perfecting your build for the run.

I bought this game yesterday at 12:00pm. It's now 4:33pm and I've played the game for 17.3 hours. For $6 this game is a steal.

The only drawback isn't really a drawback. I woke up today and decided to play a run at 1:00pm, expecting to take 20 minutes to finish and then run some errands. I didn't stop until 3:00pm. Yesterday I thought it was 9pm and looked at the clock to see that I'd been playing until 2am. This game will absolutely make you lose track of time.

Pros: 
-I actually need to think about my inventory
-Most weapons actually feel like they have a point
-Nice items to build around
-unique characters that encourage different game play
-My eyes don't hurt from bright lights that fill the screen
-melee weapons have no melee problems

Cons:
-luck is required no matter what
-A lot of Characters unique stats will not help you in high difficulty
-Although many there are cool looking items, some of them are trash and should not be added in the pool
-there is no way to control the pool of items other than getting more money or luck
-no endless mod
-range projectiles sorta suck
-melee weapons are not melee weapons

Overall a nice survivor game, but at some point i want to reach the point of stupid high stats. Many cool items cannot scale even with the respective character in theme of build. You always need luck stat as it decides what and how rare items will get. This is a nice idea but i'm always locked out if i don't roll dice on a character with no luck. You gotta pick between moving fast and not moving at all as the best scaling items usually relate to how you move, or not move. Range stat will feel amazing as it will remove all melee issues and turn into something better than ranged weapons because they only have a attack animation and no travel speed, unlike a crossbow where you need to wait for the bolt to travel and wait for the enemy to die before it changes target. I feel a lack of priority when it comes to choosing who to attack. The enemy can be right next to me and still miss or not choose the enemy next to me biting my leg off.

There's a bunch off small things i could list off, but in conclusion:
-It has a solid mechanics, but i prefer more
-Its a Diablo 2 inventory based Vampire survivor

God of Weapons is a surprisingly deep action roguelike that focuses on inventory management between levels. There are five difficulties that progressively make the game tougher and provide a nice challenge. It does need more polishing in terms of enemies, maps, and sounds, but at $6 the gameplay loop is satisfying enough to keep you playing for 20+ hours.

[list]
[*]There are a lot of weapons and characters to unlock, and you're able to make some interesting builds with over 100+ items.
[*]No performance issues. Perfect for playing on Steam Deck.
[*]Tons of achievements to unlock.
[*]Graphics are nice.
[*]Five difficulties.

[b]Negatives[/b]
[list]
[*]The map is repetitive, and each floor is the same as the last except with a few random changes to size and the types of enemies that spawn.
[*]Music is somewhat poor. The same 10-15 second loops play.
[*]The angle of the camera is a bit awkward. There is a setting to adjust it slightly higher, but it doesn't do much.
[*]Less boss enemies currently in the game than I was hoping for. Looking forward to seeing more in the future.

Like...literally unplayable at certain points. 


Looks fun, could be fun. But there is no rangeindicator to enemies. You just constantly walk into them with meleerange. Your weapons have no impact and so enemies will walk into you while you are swinging accross them and you have no idea when that happens, no animations for most enemies. It is a horrible gamefeel. 
Nothing ever seems to have weight to it. 

Elite enemies track your movement, so dodging literally only works if you dodge while they are triggering their attack (or you run at the other side of the arena, which in meleecombat you could call...running away while being unable to fight it?) which basically just means you have to perfect dodge which is basically not possible if you have a melee class trying to get closerange, which like said, you don´t wanna do anyways because you will just walk into it and start pushing it away with your body while continuously taking damage.
You can not switch an inventory items place with another making it needlessly tedious.
Upgrading weapons makes them...slower???
Experience gain is not even balanced, just straight up strongest stat in the game since you need to get to 6 weapons and otherwise lack inventory space.
The ""maps"" are...basically Brotato levels of uninteresting. There is trees...pots spawning. And sometimes we will make it super interesting and there will be a rock or something. That´s about it. Monsters will spawn wherever they want and with the map being so small you can not group them up or draw them somewhere most of the time. Rather it´s just your weapons constantly flailing around.
You will not get any indication of what range monsters have other than the damage number appearing over your head


But yeah, main gripe: I have weapons constantly swinging around me and still enemies just randomly walk into me, something like that just doesn´t happen in Brotato or other Vampire survivors, those are almost pixelperfect to avoid, here it feels like I am having to stand two character widths away from the monster and I am still not sure if it won´t just randomly bump into me.

I thought it was really cool not to play from a straight top-down perspective, but if that´s what´s needed then I would take it anyday over the current feeling of uncertainty and clunkiness.

Ranged weapons work and show that the game could be nice, but also ranged weapons are so uninteresting that it is hard to do more than two runs...or at least I would imagine that if I wasn´t tired of them already. They feel like a Brotato mod, some bounce, some pierce, some lifesteal...cool. Those are stats. Only stats. Extra stats. They never do anything new. Once you build the necessary stats: You win. Congratulations. But also you don´t need to gameplay anymore at that point.

So melee is broken and feels horrible.
Balancing is broken
Upgrades are uninteresting.
Ranged is boring.
I still like the idea, but right now I will get better deals with any rando Brotato mod.",1695791277,1695944050,False,1,0,0.493355482816696167,0,True,False,False

first impressions: very fun, and addicting. easy to get absorbed into the gameplay and realize hours has gone by. 

On further play: lack of information is annoying. whether it's Item use clarification, dps of each weapon. or overall damage mitigation. i think i speak for many players of this genre likes to see the end stat sheet to review what was working and what wasnt.

item diversity: it's a new game so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt and give it more time before i'm more critical on item variation. 

my current issue that i think could be worked on is weapon tiers, and synergy balances. at the current moment it's almost always better to just pick up a T3 or T4 weapon asap even if it doesn't synergies with your build at all, it just deal more damage. the magical anvils help a little with this, but i think it's enough. sometimes i'd rather go for a spellblade build but when i'm offered T4 great axe on round 6 i'm going to take it because it just out performs any amount of T1 set bonus.

ending thoughts: it's a new game, and it's really fun and good.

Things to like:
The way all your weapons are just wildly attacking things of their own accord while your character just stands there and looks cool, like the most powerful wizard/jedi/dark lord to ever exist, is really enjoyable to watch.

The inventory puzzling thing is, in my opinion, a really good way (though, certainly not for everyone) to make an otherwise uninteresting character advancement system (“choose from one of these three options, one of them is clearly the best one”) into something that can be legitimately challenging (“I could easily get the tier 2 frost wand and fit it in here, but if I can just move things around enough to get these spaces over to those spaces, I HAVE the space for that tier 4 fireball staff... Or do I just admit defeat and sell one of these horns, but do I have enough self-healing to risk having less barrels spawning???”)

Dozens of character builds to try out and loads of replayability. Even without the progression system, this game would have staying power.

I really just like the look of the game. The glowing eyes, the way the warlock floats, the generally practical/normal looking outfits, the less over-the-top weapon designs, all the funky little magic items.

Things to dislike:
Not enough classes. I want MORE!

Things I’d like to see:
More of everything. More characters, more weapons, more magic items, more, more, more.

Having said that, as you unlock all the cool items in the forge, your selection of items in the shop gets more and more bogged down with things you might not want for a given run. Certain types of runs, like single weapon type runs (all throwing daggers, all anything small, really) become harder and harder to achieve as a result. It’s a minor problem, but the simple addition of a sixth slot in the shop that is usually empty but has a chance to have an item in it that goes up by a small amount for each item you unlock would solve that problem.

An infinite mode would be pretty cool. Where you could max out your inventory and face increasingly numerous hordes...

There needs to be a co-op. Even if it were just tacked on, with no balance changes, even if it were local co-op only, even though I have no friends and would never play it with anyone, it needs to happen.

If I mouse over a stat, it’d be pretty cool if it highlighted every item in my inventory that was modifying that stat.

The ability to right click one of the blessings to refund a level in it without having to refund all my blessings to free up a few titanite shards would be a welcome addition.

But the main thing I’d like to see is a balancing of the various stats that doesn’t just nerf whatever’s fun or popular, because I’ve been burned by that kind of balance before.",1695181091,1695862046,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The concept of this game is great. The inventory management style is very fun. The game is lacking in a lot of key areas though. The meta progression offers little to be desired, with some +melee/projectile/spring cooldown/inventory slots/etc. However the buffs don't help all that much besides the extra inventory holder.
On top of the poor meta progression, getting the currency for the meta progression is not easy. You gain currency by completing quests or killing mini bosses, or beating the end boss. The problem I'm running into though, mini bosses drop the currency rarely and playing the game past the normal difficulty doesn't scale well. 
Playing the game as a melee character is impossible right now because a bug causing weapons to not even attack if they reach a certain attack speed, so you're stuck to playing ranged only.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- typos and weird descriptions here and there, nothing game breaking, just not as polished as you might think 
- rounds based system might not be for everyone, rounds are 30sec - 1min long with shopping in between
- the arena that you are fighting in is quite small, which makes it difficult to navigate and survive early on while your build is developing and on the flip side once your build picks up, you can't get enough mobs to kill, your weapons have big enough range to kill everything across the arena so you just stand in a corner and kill the mobs practically off-screen.
- definitely needs more balancing for monsters and items, the game feels too easy and too hard at the same time, and maybe 20% of the time it's just right. Starting off with the lesser evil: certain item just make or break the build and you are not guaranteed to even get them. With that in mind I would just like the devs to review certain underused items and maybe combine them with others or scrap them altogether, this would reduce item bloat. Like I said, I finished this game and certain items I either haven't found a use for or it's so situational that it would be better of combined with something else. Hopefully devs have some stats on underused items to take a look at.
- and lastly the main balancing gripe that I have are certain mob types. For example you could get oneshot with a solid build if you happen to run to a wall and get charged by an elite that is sliding alongside the wall, practically shotgunning you. Or even if you happen to be at the end of their charge, you always seem to take more instances of dmg from them, so maybe they should give you a grace period after getting hit by that elite mob specifically. It's worth including in the review because that thing was the reason for at least half my deaths and is bound to happen to YOU. So to sum it all u some things are just over- and under tuned. But it's by no means unplayable you get your workarounds and get used to it.


[b] Pros: [/b]
- their twist on itemization with the inventory management is a unique idea and should be your main reason to try to this game because it feels like you are playing 2 games at once, very enjoyable though! (For reference you play 20 rounds to finish the game. Each round is 30sec going up to 60 sec, but lets say a round is 1min each. You would need 20 minutes to finish the gameplay aspect, however my fastest game was  41 minutes and that's after I knew exactly what I was doing. Before then you can expect your games to last an average of 50 minutes consistently, which just facilitates my point that you are literally playing two games.)
- plenty of things to unlock and builds to try, as stated above 60 hours worth of entertainment for this price tag is a steal
- item synergies via item tags, most items have tags that give them additional bonuses if placed adjacent to a synergistic item, which makes the inventory management intriguing

This game has a very satisfying gameplay loop and once you get into the flow, it's even better. Figuring out builds and methods for hitting that next unlock is really really satisfying.

I personally find The Barbarian: Singularist (get massive bonuses for only having one weapon) and The Fighter: Weapon Master (get massive bonuses for having a massive, diverse bag of weapons) to by some of my favorite.

Who knew that bullet heavens had so much to gain by borrowing from Resident Evil 4? God of Weapons may not inundate you with Spanish zombies but it does gamify the grid based inventory management of the 2005 Capcom Classic and combines it with a bullet heaven.

The result is glorious: you get the same sort of escalating power thrills of all the best games that have ‘survivors’ in the title but it also turns the build crafting process into this constant negotiation where upgrades take up physical space and are competing with the rest of your powers.

A bland aesthetic and lack of contextualization for its inventory systems ensure that God of Weapons is only as good as it’s mechanics, but thankfully those mechanics are both massively compelling and endlessly replayable.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039381541

I think the highest compliment I can give God of Weapons is how obvious it was that this wasn’t their first time taking a crack at the genre: developer Archmage Labs previously made “Beautiful Mystic Survivors” which takes full advantage of the fact that this genre is typically played with one hand. Despite the fact I haven’t played it, it’s not lacking for glowing reviews that swear they’re only playing it for the articles.

That survivors pedigree is made manifest in some subtle choices—strong execution of genre staple mechanics and smart cherry picking it’s done from its peers. It’s got Brotatos economy management and discrete waves to ensure building and upgrading has its own dedicated time instead of disrupting the combat. It’s got a Soulstone Survivor’s esque cross character dash that allows for a low cooldown position reset if needed. But most importantly it’s got that RE 4 inventory management, more directly filtered through the lens of modern indies like Backpack hero which wrap a whole game around the concept and add perks like modifiers and adjacency bonuses.

All those influences fit like a glove: the inventory management specifically isn’t just a gimmick but a complete reconteztualizarion for each choice you make. The leveling process itself isn’t granting you all that much statistical power, it’s real merit comes from giving you one more choosable square on the inventory grid.

And therein lies some pretty compelling questions: you’ll have your usual survivors concerns like getting enough flat damage to get through early game and enough scaling damage to get through late, but now you have to think about how those things interact in a physical container.

You’ll oftimes start by designing your weapons around your space but you have enough agency to design your space around your weapons: when that max rarity hammer pops into the shop you’ll be tempted to find the 8 lopsided grid squares it demands to take advantage of that power.

There’s a lot of more minute shuffling to be done in addition to that though: each class has a different starting item that typically applies benefits to neighboring weapons or armor, so there’s this jigsaw meta game of trying to align your inventory in a way that both minimizes open space but also ensures your passive boosts are touching the right items.

There’s a transience to the inventory as well: the ability to sell any item gives your playthroughs a level of mid-run flexibility and pivoting opportunities that God of Weapons’ peers typically don’t have. It prevents your builds from ever becoming autopiloted regardless of how deep into a run you are.

What shouldn’t be unspoken is how well God of Weapons executes on the genres tenants. Even completely independent of its bespoke inventory management upgrade system, it nails the satisfaction that comes with overpowering the swarm that’s enclosing you. The scrolling combat text is readable and simple, the soundscape nails the gratification that comes with the layered audio impact of cleaving dozens of minions at once, and by virtue of the fact this is a full 1.0 release rather than the genres love for early access, it came out the gate with around a dozen classes each of which has three subclasses.

Brisk 20 minute durations always tempt a follow up run, coupled with a meta progression and item unlock system that multiplies the amount of weapons and armor in the game. 

It does have some balancing problems which, according to one of their first post release dev communications, is something they’re already looking at. One of the obvious culprits is items that use increased horde size as a downside to offset powerful bonuses, but in practice it’s the elite and boss monsters giving you the heartache not the horse itself so it’s hardly a penalty.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039381859

It’s current biggest drawback is a modest presentation that might have some folks scrolling right past it’s store page and  prevent them from ever getting to the juicy systems underneath. This knight lugging around a sack of pointy sticks in the key art isn’t a visual motif that carries into the actual gameplay in any way. Armor gets no optical representation at all and weapons unceremoniously float around you—a budget concession I think I’d be more willing to jump on board with had the visual themes enforced it more: like controlling powerful gods who need not bother with grips and handles, instead of these regular ol’ fantasy classes that are all telepathic I guess.

It may not be a looker but don’t make the mistake of passing it by for that reason; from a pure gameplay sense this is the one you’ve been waiting for. God of Weapons borrows a lot but it borrows smartly. There’s no system in here you haven’t seen before but their integration add a tremendous amount of texture to every decision and every run. A flexible inventory based building system, varied classes and subclasses, and punchy-satisfying auto attacking combat ensure this title isn’t just a God of Weapons, but a God of Survivors games too.

I like God of Weapons for instead letting you play for a while, and then deal with the character management portion. A lot of fun, I got myself about 50 hours of play for less than $10, but I feel like I eventually hit a point where I was looking for all of the same pieces of gear after reaching the halfway point of a run. Once I got the hang of things I rarely found myself losing a run if I made it to the 10th wave and succeeded after getting the hang of things. 

There are certainly some bugs and balance issues with some of the weapons/classes, like not being able to complete the ""complete a run with all variants of a class"" until you've unlocked all versions of the class. Some attack animations will just outright miss, which is especially noticeable in the early levels when you only have a few weapons. This meant I found myself favoring certain weapon types with every run. One greataxe can carry a run because of the whirlwind, a shock weapon can sometimes permastun elites. Projectile weapons, specifically crossbows, just felt bad every time I used them. 

But that's all minor to the amount of fun I had once I got the hang of things. There have already been a few patches to rebalance some items, and address the somewhat slow meta progression.

This game provides it and if you bought the game at release, you would know that it was going to/took a lot of time to max out everything. However, there have been patches not even a week after this game's release that made it easier to get the currency to unlocking some of the upgrades and as well as adding more types of upgrades. The game was good before these patches, but now the game is a considerably less grindy. What I like about this game is the accessories that you equip to your build because there is a huge variety of them that makes all weapons viable. There are a good cast of playable characters and each character has three stat variations/unique passives to them. The game has great graphics as well. 

Some of the cons I would like to point out are the camera angle and the hitboxes. The former issue might contribute to my problem with the hitboxes. This game is third person, but unlike most games of this genre, it is not topdown. The angle you are given makes it easy to get hit by offscreen projectiles. As you get farther in the game and you are overwhelmed by the enemies and their projectiles, you will dash into what you think is open area (because you can't see it) and suddenly get hit a stray enemy projectile or a mob of monsters. Then there are the hitboxes, which are hard to tell where they start and end. Going by what you see on the screen isn't always going to be best your bet when dodging, because it seems like the hitboxes are about 10% bigger than what you would expect. It might not seem like a lot but when threading the needle of projectiles, this affects gameplay drastically.

I enjoyed this game a lot. I practically play only action roguelike, top down, autoshooters and this is one of the better ones. The developers seem to be releasing a good number of patches for bugfixes frequently since its release (yes, it can also be seen as a problem) but, I highly recommend this game at its current state.

I've been looking at variation on the theme of Vampire Survivor for a while, knowing that the genre has yet to evolve but holds some real potential. So far, in addition to God of Weapons, I've played the OG Magic Survival on Android, 20 Minutes to Dawn and Soulstone Survivor. 

What struck me in this title is that rounds are cleared based on a very short countdown which, even during the first run, encourages you to pile-up life-leech items and run in circles until it's over. I haven't seen any specific reasons to face the mobs or take any risk. I 'won' my very first run and wasn't compelled to try another. 

While 20MtD and SS go an extra mile, gameplay wise, to add a cursor and let you prioritize your target, while SS proposes colorful setting and enemies, God Of Weapons feels like a step back with a drab artistic direction and no possibility to aim. I couldn't find any rewarding/motivating feeling during my run -no overwhelming attacks, no split second decision about positioning and targeting, just running around. 

I feel bad for asking a refund for a game that cost me that little, especially since it's on Unity and we all know Unity now treats its developers like milking cows, but at this point I'd rather find another game to support.

If you know whats going on in roguelites, you aren't gonna have much issue here, its laughably easy, but it is nice to be able to relax in a familiar genre without any stress. 

The main problem with the game, is that it is way too generous with the re-rolls. Which is why I say it is a good game for new to the genre players. It gives you the concept, without any of the risk really. Each round, I could use well over 10 re-rolls to get exactly what I want, without any real risk, because even if I didnt get what I wanted, I would for sure get it next round. 

It does a great job at introducing you to the genre, because it will throw you all kinds of stats to try to build with, different weapon types, different foundations for class builds, etc. 

Even though I probably wont come back to this game, beyond maybe picking it up at 3am when im fighting the need for sleep, I do think that this game does a 10/10 job for new players!

GOOD
- Nice graphics
- Inventory management, a Tetris puzzle of itself :)
- Power-ups system (perma-boost) with refund option
- Plenty of characters to unlock

- Camera angle feels slightly awkward. Setting the camera angle to high (gameplay options) is only a minor adjustment, but really do make a difference.
- Unlockable weapons/items have specific unlock conditions, some of them are unknown. On one hand this makes it tedious and grindy, but on the other hand it gives you goals to work toward each run.

WHAT IT ISN'T: It's not Vampire Survivors/Soulstone Survivors/Halls of Torment.  The arenas are smaller and the action isn't quite so over the top like the titles mentioned.  If you are looking for heavy skill usage and many abilities firing off at once with flashy graphics... this one is a little more tame.

THE GAMEPLAY LOOP: You take a character (classes unlock in a similar way to Halls of Tormet and others) into a small arena and fight monsters, with the aim of surviving until the timer counts down (1 minute or less, etc).  Once timer hits 0, you advance to the real game, inventory management.  You buy items with in-game currency (earned in each arena) and try to arrange your weapons, armour and artifacts to maximize both impact and synergy for the next battle.  

After 20 of these fights, you have beaten that difficulty level and you get a victory screen.  You will then have a small amount of currency to redeem for meta-progression power-ups OR you can go to the Armoury/Shop and add items to the potential item pool for future runs.  

You unlock more and more characters (each with 3 different playstyles) and grind that meta progression to your heart's content.  

DIFFICULTY: It's more difficult than the average entry, IMHO.  I say this because the game really does expect you to reach certain levels of power to be able to clear the higher difficulties.  So, when you plan your purchases and upgrades, you do need to pay attention and ESPECIALLY, apply what you learned on your next run. 

Meta progression rewards aren't very plentiful when compared to the genre as a whole.  So, it isn't quite a game where you can zone out and cruise.  Combat is simple enough, but to really kick some ass you will need a little luck and some smart planning.  

FUN FACTOR: It is early, as I am like 20-something hours into it.  But, I think this game is about as fun as the genre can offer right now, given the size of the arena and the progression model.   If you do want the flashier experience with more enemies, etc... you might not enjoy the gameplay as much.

VERDICT:  Definitely an easy recommend.  My only caveat being that the focus of the game isn't the actual combat itself, but planning your choices and adjusting when needed.  I have seen people lose patience with the game, so keep that in mind if you want a faster, more intense progression model.

Every now and then you come across games within a genre that really feel like they push it forward and I believe this is one. It gets rid of a guaranteed weapon limit or skill trees in favor for an expanding inventory grid with plenty of items to choose from. The neat part is that some weapons or items count as buffs for others, like giving increased attack speed or weapon reach. This feels like a really unique take. Instead of just getting the powers from a level up skill selection, you need to expand your inventory properly and purchase the item and slot it in each run. The game does have meta progression.

My only gripe so far, after unlocking difficulty 4 and a few characters, is that the return to menu button lines up with the button to exit the settings menu.

Pros:
- Inventory Management is meaningful enough to be mildly interesting (albeit not as deep as Backpack Hero)
- The rest of the core gameplay loop is very similar to Brotato (albeit balancing is a mess at time of writing)
- The devs are active and receptive to feedback so tossing in your two cents isn't totally moot

Cons:
- Balancing is a mess (though there's still a decent amount to play with)
- Visibility isn't great (though it [i]is mostly[/i] serviceable) and the camera does that no favors

This has a little less build diversity than the best games of this genre  but is better than most. most builds are highly dependent on each characters unique starting item options. It would be nice if there was a little more late game diversity, a few more items that were not character uniques that have adjacency bonuses, and a cleaner play experience.

1. It is quite confusing to have a non-linear armor. Stacking armor for only ~10, which is the case for many character, is totally unworthy. To illustrate this point, just imagine the case: is it the same for one to increase 0% damage reduction to 1% or to increase 99% damage reduction to 100%? If your answer is no, you definitely understand what I mean. In game, it seems useless for many characters, even for some melee weapon users, to stack the armor; yet for some character, the combination of armor & shield is just op. If you are playing the melee rogue-raven, what will you stack for survival? For me, I'd put the attack speed at the first, and then the range, and then the recover & life-steal, and at the least willing to even buy a single item for it, the armor. It is not a healthy design at all.
2. Bad balancing. For items or weapons, one would expect the items with same rarity have roughly the same value, with some are just slightly more op. However, we could say that about 50% of the items are trash, with 20% of the items to be much more op. For instance, the stopwatch and the gloves, they are too flexible and too op, compared to other blue damage items. And so on for survival & long-run items. For weapons, spell weapons and some of the melee weapons are just too weak and too slot consuming. I'd expect at least the long sword, which takes 5 slots, to be at least 25% more stronger than the short sword, which takes 4 slots. To be honest, I'd rather say I expect 30%~40% for the extra value, since the extra cost to arrange the backpack. Same, for rods, polearms and all weapons with ""bad shapes"", they are expected to be stronger. However, the long sword is nothing stronger than the short sword, except if you want a long sword to take full advantage of your armor items. The polearms are also badly behaved in game, I don't think they are a good choice for now.
3. It is strange to have dash & movement speed together. There's some point to stack the movement speed in Brotato etc., but it is totally useless to have movement speed as a ""movement buff"", as the dash is already good enough for moving. One reason why stopwatch is op is it actually reduce the movement speed, which makes some items to exploit the negative movement speed.
I really enjoyed the game, yet I'm really sorry to say that there are too many problems for a post-beta game. I hope that there will be a major rework and balancing patch for the game.",1694991239,1694991368,False,14,0,0.594853639602661133,0,True,False,False

The POV is an issue in this game as well. As enemies do damage to you based on touch, the perspective doesn't necessarily let you accurately judge how close you are to an enemy.  The starting knight class doesn't have any hp regen innately so it's all downhill playing the game.

The meta progression is a huge meh, the prices are low but the currency is hard to get if u stick to progression (clearing harder floors). its much more beneficial to stick to lower difficulties u can clear which i think is a bad way of doing it.
The difficulty is punishing - there is no room for experimentation or sub-optimal builds, u either go with a meta build u know slaps or you will lose, thus rendering 80% of the game's arsenal/items worthless.

There is this annoying bug where the weapon dosent damage the enemies it hits, i've noticed it with all melee weapons but its especially evident when using the Halbert.

overall, its a fun game but it dosent follow the ""Rogue-like"" progression formula (i.e start weak and become totally busted in endgame).

- SFX are weak and seem like an afterthought, which wouldn't be a big deal except that there's very little feedback when the player is being hurt. Combined with wonky hitboxes and the fact there are almost no i-frames when hit, you can die very fast in later difficulties without realizing you're even being harmed.

- Meta progression needs work. Outside of working towards specific quest goals, the only way to earn meta-currency is to kill mini-bosses or finish a whole 20-stage run, and it's very easy to make it to the final boss and die, effectively wasting an hour or so of play time.

- Weak level design. Feels really samey really fast, and lots of enemy types seem redundant. Not enough bosses / minibosses. Could fix this problem and the meta progression problem by adding a greater volume and variety of ""elites.""

- I was really hoping for more synergy between items based on adjacency / position relative to each other within the inventory. They could have really ran with that. Instead, you get a single unique item based on your character class that will improve adjacent items, and very few weapons / items that synergize with each other. Really hope this gets expanded on because it's kind of the whole gimmick. Thankfully, the game lends itself to expansion.

- A significant number of easily fixed flaws (lots of typos, bugged items which don't do what they say they do, SFX bugs, and why is the default position of all items upside-down?)

All in all, a good game that could be great with a little more love, and I can't complain for the generous price point. Hope the devs keep working on this.",1694747592,1694747701,True,6,1,0.599725425243377686,0,True,False,False

+Great overall visuals(graphics, enemy, weapon and hero design all of it).
+Gameplay and movement feels smooth.
+The Backpack feature is great the design feels great but at the same time lacks some features like being able to swap items with eachother instead of puting one item outside and puting the second one there.
+The sound design is also great.
+/- This depends on each individual person i dont mind it that much but the game is little slow and less rewarding than the other rogulike/survivor type genre games.
+/- The game gets compared to brotato a lot because well its quite obvious that there is some influence/inspiration from brotato or maybe not idk anyway what im getting at is there is a lot of classes and subclasses and as it is with brotato the game ends up being unbalanced.
- This is a straight con not like the classes one and thats the weapons and artifacts there are so many weapons and artifacts that ends up also being unbalanced but to the point you got completely useless ones and totally OP ones and maybe a few inbetween that are ok.
- This pains me to say but there isnt much variety in enemies and the levels atleast thats how it feels to me and from few reviews i saw im not the only one but that can be updated and changed which i hope the devs will do because i like this game so far.
Last thing is i saw few people say that the game had a closed beta and that devs listened to people which is great but ended up doing questionable/bad changes to the game due to groupthink mentality of people who had no clue about game design now i dont know if thats true or not because i only found the game while doing my monthly roguelike/survivor store browse to wishlist games from but it certainly doesnt sound great.
Still overall i will give this game a positive review because i like it and its much much better than the last 5 survivor type games which were simply dookie and got refunded after an hour",1694721198,1694721198,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's many things that I already like such as the multiple characters (Classes) you unlock. All of the different weapons and the customisation options is great and the inventory management system is a genius idea for a ""bullet hell"" type game. Not to mention how great the game looks. However, there are some annoyances that I would like to give me feedback on. 
One thing I think awkward, is that when you purchase something from the store, the amount of square that item uses disappears, leaving you to estimate where the squares are to fit it in your inventory. It would be a lot easier if they had the squares while dragging the item. 
Another awkward design is that when you try to fit multiple items in your inventory, you can't overlap items and move them once you place the item down leaving you to waste time fiddling with the placements. It would be a lot easier to click and move the old item, while holding onto the new one
This last bit of feedback might be a personal one, but I prefer large/longer fights. I feel like (especially at the beginning) the levels are too restrictive and small to be able to dodge enemies. Increasing the size of the map like in Halls of Torment or in Vampire Survivors. 
God of Weapons seems like a great addition to the bullet hell genre and I can't wait to see new updates to the game. Currently, it's hovering around the 7/10",1694650864,1694650864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the way they combine inventory management with the Brotato formula.
Especially because i think Brotato is maybe the best variant of these Action Roguelike/ Auto Danmakus.

For the price asked (i paid 4.00€) its a really good game. I see about 15 or so characters to unlock, each with 3 subclasses/Affinities, starting bonuses etc.
So theres a ton of experimentation and trying out.
Especially for such a low price, the content seems to be there.
Im not too deep in, so cant tell how far it goes.
I hope theres an Endless Mode or similar, because one thing i ever disliked, was that Brotato stopped at Wave 20 (now features an optional Endless Mode).

I can fully recommend it. It looks fine, plays well, is interesting, filled with content.

I wish we could just stand still and manage inventory while the game plays. I'm just a bit tired of the same moving patterns from these type of games.
