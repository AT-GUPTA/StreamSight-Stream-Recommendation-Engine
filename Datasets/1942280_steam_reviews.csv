""Brotato"" presents itself as a compact and accessible game, perfectly tailored for those moments when you're seeking a quick, entertaining diversion without the commitment required by more extensive titles. Its minimal hard drive footprint is a commendable feature, making it an easy addition to any gaming library, particularly for players with limited storage space or those who prefer a lightweight gaming experience.

At its core, ""Brotato"" is imbued with a fun, engaging gameplay loop that offers immediate gratification and an easy-to-pick-up structure. This aspect makes it an excellent choice for casual gaming sessions, where the aim is to unwind and enjoy without getting bogged down by complex mechanics or storylines. The game shines in its ability to deliver short bursts of enjoyment, making it a go-to for filling brief periods of free time.

However, it's worth noting that ""Brotato"" may not hold the attention of players looking for depth and variety in the long run. The gameplay, while initially captivating, can evolve into a repetitive cycle, potentially diminishing its appeal over extended play sessions. This repetition is a double-edged sword; on one hand, it allows for a straightforward and accessible experience, but on the other, it may lead to a sense of monotony for those seeking a more dynamic and evolving challenge.

""Brotato"" stands out as a fun and enjoyable game with a specific appeal to those in search of light, engaging entertainment that doesn't demand much in terms of time or system resources. Its simplicity and ease of access are its greatest strengths, though its repetitive nature might limit its long-term appeal to some players. It's very low cost which drives the overall value up for most.

This game makes me feel like there's something seriously wrong with me. I enjoyed it way too much.

Brotato is literally just picking up things, choosing a few things and moving around. It's just one big math equation and some running around. The strategy is: get the green stuff and don't die so you can get more green stuff and try harder not to die. But goddammit this $4.99 game is more fun than most, to a ridiculously addicting level. I mean half the time I’m just itching to get to the line of coke that is Wave 9 and literally I'll I'm doing is picking up green shapes.

I loved how the game seemed to promote whatever build you were going for, at least with weapons; it wants you to get your Tier IV stuff, it wants you to hit that Dodge cap, it wants you to be ridiculously OP because you need to be ridiculously OP. This is a great mechanic for a roguelike, because it promotes replay ability by encouraging builds without the heavy reliance on RNG. Overall, the loot pool is exactly what it needs to be; the upgrades, the stats, they even got the rarity colors right, it's so sexy.

I think Brotato is a fantastic example of how simplicity trumps complexity! Enjoyed every minute.",1708635044,1708635044,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, here's the tale of the bros and spuds,
In the kitchen, cookin' up, showin' off their studs.
Potatoes in the pot, bros in the mix,
Mashin' up the flavor, ain't that the fix?

Chillin' with the crew, yeah, we keep it tight,
Slicin' and dicin', cookin' through the night.
From fries to chips, man, we got the range,
Bros and potatoes, never actin' strange.

(Chorus)
Bros and potatoes, yeah, that's our vibe,
Mixin' up the flavors, takin' it in stride.
In the kitchen, makin' magic, that's how it goes,
With the crew by my side, and the spuds, yo!

(Verse 2)
We peel 'em, we boil 'em, we fry 'em up crispy,
Bros in the kitchen, never actin' tipsy.
From baked to mashed, we got the skills,
Potatoes and bros, yeah, we payin' the bills.

Seasonin' with love, addin' that spice,
Bros in the kitchen, cookin' up nice.
From loaded skins to hash browns gold,
Bros and potatoes, never growin' old.

(Chorus)
Bros and potatoes, yeah, that's our vibe,
Mixin' up the flavors, takin' it in stride.
In the kitchen, makin' magic, that's how it goes,
With the crew by my side, and the spuds, yo!

(Bridge)
So next time you're hungry, lookin' for a treat,
Join the bros and potatoes, can't be beat.
Cookin' up a storm, with laughter and cheer,
Bros and potatoes, all year!

(Outro)
So here's to the bros, and here's to the spuds,
Cookin' up together, spreadin' good moods.
Bros and potatoes, forever hand in hand,

I don't like roguelikes, because I'm not a masochist, but I like this one. It needs better tutorialisation, but I've put almost 10 hours into it in less than 2 days. That is almost unheard of these days for me. Especially for the price, you cannot go wrong with this game. I've spent full price on AAA games that are less fun that this, which costs less than lunch. If I had to critique it, I'd say that the map should be 100% zoomed-out instead of following your potato around, but that's minor. 

I would have played Brotato a lot earlier if the market wasn't swamped with indie roguelikes. This one rose even past my store filter for the ""roguelike"" tag - it's that good. Hopefully that means the genre has now peaked and every other game I look at won't be a bloody roguelike.

First ten hours were enjoyable, the rest was just mindlessly grinding achievements

There is a lot of potential here, for things like multiplayer, game modes, maps, character combinations, etc, but none of those exist. You play the same empty map, are given the same variety of weapons, & fight the same enemies, every single game. The characters themselves do not have enough uniqueness to make each run feel different, quite a few of the rarer/legendary items almost never showed up in 20+ hours of gameplay (unless building 100-200+ luck)

Mods add a little extra, but a lot of them feel like they should have been implemented into a game (better tooltips/HUD, combining characters, multiplayer - because as mods they are broken/only half work)

My biggest gripe with the game is that there isn't a more surefire way to build/spec your character between rounds. Most games from this genre have a ""special"" store, or guaranteed drops/pick-ups for certain completions or builds whereas that's not really the case with Brotato. You can't pick up or unlock weapons mid horde. As a result, a majority of the runs - despite the quite varied character selection - can feel similar if not identical in progression to wave 20 or beyond as the stores will invariably spit out the same weapons or items. This isn't to say there aren't challenge or special ""Bros"" you can choose from (Pacifist thrives off keeping the enemies alive, Soldier won't attack unless standing still, Sick will constantly take damage, etc.). I do believe that this game tends to feed you items/weapons parallel to your build. Nevertheless, it's definitely missing something. I think with one or two more major updates - focusing on additional weapons, more innovative ways to spend your money beyond the post level store, additional neutral spawns like the tree, and differing maps - that this game will steadily climb its way to the top.

Some very good decisions where taken while designing the game:
1) you can choose one out of dozens of characters with distinct features at the start of the run
2) you need to finish the run on the base level with each character to finish the game, but different difficulty levels are availble for each character 
3) winning the game with a character unlocks a new character, item or weapon that makes the previously mastered characters replayable or adds a new challenge
4) catchy graphics, nothing is pixelated and the game is pleasent to play. Power ups can be worn by the character and are stupidly silly which is a good thing (e.g. character running with butterfly wings) 
5) huge variety of weapons builds, categories etc.

I think this game is just ridiculously hard. I usually start out well, without any problems getting to wave 10 or so, but eventually around this point in the game I die and I have no idea why. It's not clear if it's for lack of damage, HP, or whatever stat. The game doesnt tell you where you went wrong, and every death of mine looks the same. I read some guides on how to be better, and so I did what they told me, yet it didn't really help. Even tho the runs dont even last for too long, and I could get what I lost in 15 minutes, I happen to rage harder than any game I played in a while. And yes, I know I don't have to play difficulty 5, but after unlocking it I don't feel like there is any point to play on lower difficulties, since I was aiming to 100% the game eventually, and that would be a waste of time. I wouldn't get the same sense of achievement anyway. And before the sweaty fans with a degree of potato science come and say ""skill issue"", I'm rewieving it as a guy who looked for some fun (which I also find in 100%-ing the game). Okay so, I know this review might not be relatable, in fact, it might not even make sense, but that's how I feel about the game.

looks great, reminds me of playing NG games when I was young

music's hype af theres not much else you can ask for


The bad
seriously too rng dependant, it feels like the game is actively sabotaging my run sometimes
difficulty spikes that either hard end your run or feed you more items for your already perfect build
literally everything about the bosses, if I wanted the entire review could be about each one and why they're generally unfair and unfun

I really wanted to enjoy it, which is why I've played for over 80 hours and beat 2/3 of the characters on the hardest difficulty.

I liked the amount of different characters, that each offer a somewhat different playstyle
and how the game does a (mostly) good job at portraying information and explaining stats.

I disliked that my runs would mostly end in a glass cannon build, because offense is often better than defence. This also led to me dying in the second half of the run, mostly at the last wave, which is annoying.

I hated the randomness, because it kills perfectly fine runs. For example most ranged weapons have a huge benefit from the piercing ability, but there will be runs, where you just won't encounter it, which will likely kill you. Another example is, that some characters have an item that is somewhat necessary to beat a run and sometimes you just won't see it. This issue has many more iterations.

I also think the game is quite ugly.

Rougelike Gameplay. Als Kartoffel die bis zu sechs Waffen gleichzeitig tragen kannst, rennt man immer in der gleichen Arena minutenlang umher, tötet spawnende Monster und versucht bis Level 20 zu überleben. Es gibt keine Upgrades, die das Leben einfacher machen. Der Grindfaktor ist so hoch, da es dutzende Charaktere gibt, die jeweils einzeln durchgespielt werden müssen.

Rougelike gameplay. As a potato that can carry up to six weapons at the same time, you run around the same arena for minutes on end, killing spawning monsters and trying to survive until level 20.

Try to survive quick waves of enemies and keep upgrading your chosen character in numerous ways: level up stat upgrades, gear, gear set bonuses.

I suggest running your runs on difficulty 3 for your first clears. You will unlock these difficulty levels when you clear the game at certain difficulty. Gives a good balance of difficulty curve even if you aren't playing perfectly.

+Strategic yet skill based
+Ridiculous amount of unlocks
+Tons of player decisions during run (what to level up, what to purchase, when to reroll)
+Auto-attack works absolutely flawlessly
+Sounds great

Brotato went into early access around the time when bullet-heaven games were booming on steam, while this isn't directly part of that genre, my interest in brotato was due to it.

[b][h2]Gameplay[/h2][/b]You start a run by picking a character and selecting one of it's preset starting weapons. There are currently 44 unique characters you can unlock by completing missions, different characters have their own positive and negative stat changes and unique interactions that really make each one stand out. Runs are split into 20 waves; getting longer each time, killing enemies drops materials which are the currency for buying weapons and items in your run. After a wave you take a stat upgrade from level-ups and then enter the shop. In the shop you can buy up to 6 weapons and a huge number of items which effect your stats and how your weapons perform. Each wave gets progressively harder with more and different enemy types until the final wave where you have to defeat 1 of 2 final bosses or survive until the timer runs out.

There are 5 danger difficulties in Brotato, these make runs more difficult by adding new enemies, stronger enemies and 2 bosses on the final wave. There's a neat way to track your progress on which character's you have beat on which difficulties; there is a colour for every danger level and by completing a difficulty with a certain character their character selection background colour changes to match it.

[b][h2]Achievements (83/83)[/h2][/b]It's impossible to avoid the achievements in Brotato as they are heavily tied to item and character unlocks; winning a run for the first time with each character unlocks an achievement and a new item that you can find in your next runs. For the most part the achievements are just about learning the waves, what weapons/stats work well and getting good rng.

[b][h2]Settings/Accessibility/Misc[/h2][/b]By default weapons aim at the closest enemy, there are options for mouse aim and manual aim at the press of a button. You can highlight your character, weapons or enemy projectiles to make them stand out. You can even adjust enemy health, damage and speed from the settings before a run if you're struggling, or make them higher if you want even more of a challenge. The game even has steam workshop mod support, which helps tremendously in keeping the game alive long-term.
 
[b][h2]TL;DR[/h2][/b]There really is something here for all types of players, a tonne of content in weapons and characters making no 2 runs are exactly the same, Mod support expands this into infinite content/replayability. Achievements are challenging but get easier as you improve. For only £3.99 that is a bargain.

[b]What I like about Brotato[/b]

- tons of characters & achievements, resulting in high replayability
- various number of possible builds caused by many characters, weapons & items
- items don't have a simple advantage, most items have a small drawback, which encourages focusing around a certain playstyle/build
- endless mode (= even more replayability)
- 6 different difficulty levels, as well as the option to make things easier/harder (this enables even the clumsiest one to get all achievements)
- satisfying sound effects and awesome music
- creative community (work shop stuff, etc.)
- frequent updates (till v.1.0, hopefully even beyond that)

[b]What I don't like about Brotato[/b]

- weapon balance could be better (e.g. SMGs are way better compared to a Revolver)
- character balance could be better (e.g. Old makes your game significantly harder)
- many enemies on the screen cause high FPS drops (especially noticable on Pacifist)

To sum up, you can't go wrong buying this game because it's so cheap and delivers a ton of fun and content (at least in my opinion). The frequent updates mean that the dev(s) actually care for their game and ensures that they (probably) won't just discontinue the game and run away with your money. The community also made some cool stuff, so if development should stop at one point in the future, the community will most likely keep this game alive.",1677443342,1706603378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The animations are awesome, watch as your Brotato actually carries all of the weapons and upgrades he has. The game is very challenging and with all of the different builds its also tactical.

I would recommend this game.

Issues:
* Game does not support Steam Deck aspect ration (16:10).
* There no way (at least I was not able to find) to scroll the description of some characters on the Steam Deck.

This all is funny because they nominate the game for the Steam Deck award, and not fixed these minor things.

Your average Brotato can wield 6 weapons from primitive sticks to nuclear weapons, and can utilize a special set of character stats or go for the general brother-potato. During the waves, enemies and trees drop materials (and sometimes crates) to buy upgrades between the waves. The map is relatively small to master and two characters have map size altered. Options for gameplay are not just for pleasing your eye, you can change difficulty options as well. Something i learned when i had like 3 achievements left...

My favorite thing is definitely how each of the characters play and how different they are such as the character who practically deals no personal damage but hurts enemies when he heals or the one who can wield 12 weapons instead on 6.

Pros -
Insanely good value for money (possibly the best cheap game ive ever gotten)
Build variety is pretty good (still room for improvement but mods can solve this)
Low barrier to entry but extreme depth
Each run feels very different 
Great list of characters to play as, all with very different and unique playstyles

Cons - 
Sound effects can get extremely clunky on higher waves

[b]The Allure of Simplicity[/b]
As a top-down arena shooter, Brotato doesn't bog you down with complex storylines or convoluted mechanics. You're a potato - yes, a potato - armed to the teeth (or eyes?), fighting against hordes of aliens. The beauty lies in its simplicity. It's a game that welcomes you with open arms, regardless of your skill level.

What sets Brotato apart is how it makes failure feel like progress. Each defeat is a learning curve, a step towards mastering the game. You don't just play Brotato; you evolve with it. It's the most fun I've had at failure because every setback still feels like moving forward​​.

[b]Customization and Replayability[/b]
The game shines in its customization options. With numerous traits, items, and characters, every playthrough offers a new strategy, a fresh challenge. It's the kind of game that keeps calling you back for 'just one more round.' And with its infinite replayability, Brotato always feels like a new experience​​.

Don't expect hyper-realistic graphics; Brotato charms with its original artistic direction. The visuals are a perfect match for its whimsical nature. Furthermore, it's a game that practically runs on any device. Its low requirements mean more players can enjoy this starchy adventure without hardware limitations​​.

In an era of overpriced games, Brotato stands out with its perfect pricing. It offers incredible value for its cost, making it an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a fun, engaging game without breaking the bank​​.

[b]The Verdict[/b]
[i]Brotato is a delightful, addictive game that proves you don't need complex narratives or cutting-edge graphics to create an enjoyable gaming experience. It's a testament to the charm and appeal of indie games. Easy to pick up but hard to put down, Brotato is a game that resonates with the child in all of us, reminding us that sometimes, the simplest things can bring the most joy.[/i]

[b]Key Highlights:[/b]
[list]
[*]Engaging and simple gameplay suitable for all skill levels.
[*]High replayability with various customization options.
[*]Progressive challenge that makes failure feel like an achievement.
[*]Unique and charming visual style.
[*]Affordable price with exceptional value.

[/list]

This isn't just a game; it's an experience - a delightful journey through waves of aliens, armed with nothing but your wits and a potato. Brotato is an indie darling that deserves a spot in your gaming library.",1705707127,1705707127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, when I first saw this game, I thought, ""Sure, why not? My gaming life was clearly missing a gun-toting potato."" Developed and published by Blobfish, ""Brotato"" is a top-down arena shooter roguelite that's as absurd as it sounds, yet surprisingly addictive.

The premise is simple: you're a potato - not just any potato, but Brotato. Crashed on an alien planet, you must fend off hordes of aliens with up to six weapons simultaneously. Because why settle for one gun when you can have six? The gameplay is fast-paced and chaotic, perfect for when you want to unwind by shooting extraterrestrial creatures as a starchy tuber.

The variety of traits, items, and weapons is impressive. From flamethrowers to SMGs, the arsenal is as ridiculous as the concept. Each run is unique, and customizing Brotato with different combinations of weapons and traits never gets old. The game's fast runs and waves of enemies provide a quick and satisfying play session, perfect for those short gaming breaks.

Visually, the game is simple yet effective. The top-down view works well for the bullet-hell chaos that ensues, and the designs are charming in a ""potato fighting for survival"" kind of way. The controls are responsive, which is crucial when you're trying to juggle six weapons while dodging alien attacks.

""Brotato"" is one of those games where you think, ""Who comes up with this stuff?"" But then you find yourself hours deep into playing, fully invested in your potato's survival. The game's accessibility options are a nice touch, allowing you to tweak difficulty settings to your liking.

In summary, ""Brotato"" is absurd, fun, and surprisingly engaging. It's not going to win awards for deep storytelling or groundbreaking graphics, but that's not the point. It's a game about a potato with guns - and sometimes, that's exactly what you need. If you're looking for a quirky, fun shooter with plenty of replayability, ""Brotato"" is definitely worth checking out.",1705409751,1705409751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The sounds are quite satisfying and the game has a nice flow. There's a sort of meta-progression that unlocks more items to choose from when you level up.

However, the game is quite RNG-heavy, especially at higher difficulties. I will admit that I'm no expert and probably of a pretty average skill level, so take this with a grain of salt. I'd really like to see an option to ""banish"" certain items during the runs, since you are always looking for ONE specific weapon or sometimes you need ONE specific stat and if you do not get it you are usually sh*t out of luck.

It didn't hook me like Vampire Survivals or other similar games. I feel like a lot of people have menioned lots of pros, I'll mention a few of mine, following what bothered me.

[h3]Pros[/h3]
- The game is aesthetically pleasing. Weapons and items show up in your ""brotato"" which is kinda nice.
- Items and weapons seems to be very varied. I didn't see everything, but what I saw was really cool

[h3]Cons[/h3]
- Although I said the game is pretty, there seems to be only one map and I don't like how it looks. It's always a small arena (if that changes later, I don't know). I disliked this concept.
- Also, the ""brotatoes"" are basically the same dude with a slightly different look.
- It is wave based in a small arena. Not a fan.
- Soundtrack feels too simple and repetitive.

I had fun with it, but had no desire to keep playing it. Bore me pretty fast. I would recommend for hardcore fans of this genre, but that's it.",1705270798,1705270798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm currently working my way through the +5 runs, because, why bother doing anything less than +5? There is none given in the game and even if you finish it, you'll just have to do it again to ""complete"" it.

I picked it up when I was looking for some random game to fill the void between several bigger games, just for a couple of hours. 37 hours later, I'm still not satisfied!

On the first glance, it's just another Vampire Survivors clone. That's not a bad thing in itself, but nothing to write home about. Although, 5 minutes in you understand that it has a pinch of Binding of Isaac and something like Risk of Rain mixed in. Still nothing extremely original, but it somehow works. Boom - it's several hours later, you experiment with different builds and explore neat changes that every new character brings. And while sometimes you notice that your runs may become a bit similar - most of the time there's still more options to try.

You build your character with a combination of weapons and passive items. They have both obvious and tricky synergies between them. Shop mechanics and in-game economy allow you to have an actual BUILD, even when you are playing a limited 20-wave mode. And while your wilder ideas may never take off (I haven't managed to build a 12-stick multitasker yet), you always have a choice, you always have something to expand on and risk bulking up more power in expense of your defence and healing. Or vice versa, if you're THAT kind of player.

Right now I'm finishing up my runs with all the characters that are left (honestly, not the most entertaining ones) and planning to challenge myself for some crazy Endless runs. And planning to play a game AFTER beating it to 100% achievements is not a thing I often do ;)",1704729475,1704729475,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

Brotato emerges, a chaotic dream.
Crafted by Blobfish, a gaming affair,
Switch it on, and you'll tear out your hair.

Early access days, a taste of the brawl,
Weapons, characters, items, and all.
New horizons expand with the full release,
Brotato's chaos, a gaming feast.

Turrets ablaze, creatures in your path,
A manic arena, a relentless wrath.
Dodging, weaving, an endless spree,
What the heck is happening in Brotato, can't you see?

Story's lacking, a bit of a miss,
But create your own in this pixel abyss.
Pick your potato hero, enter the ring,
Survive the waves, and oh, how they sting.

XP and gold, the currency of might,
Level up, choose weapons, ready for the fight.
Melee or lasers, a tactical dance,
Pros and cons, a game of chance.

Items galore, a strategic array,
Boost your stats, change the play.
Agility, speed, armor, and more,
A super vegetable hero, a unique lore.

Potatoes made pretty, a visual delight,
Brotato shines, a gaming highlight.
Audio rattles, a symphony of sound,
Slaying creatures with each bound.

Steam Deck verified, smooth as can be,
Controls buttery, for you and me.
Replay value, longevity in its stride,
Brotato's allure, a thrilling ride.

In the hot genre, it takes its stand,
Nearly perfect, a game in demand.
A minor gripe, a muddy creek,
But Brotato's charm, it truly peaks.

Defeat the bosses, survive each wave,
Elite monsters, a challenge to brave.
Gargantuan creatures, in pixels they dwell,
Brotato's potential, a tale to tell.",1704504433,1704504433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, I always feel you get too much trade off than gain when you get a new item. Also, the map is empty, the waves are very repetitive and it lacks variety if you compare to games like Vampire Survivors with its secrets/unlocks/maps or Halls Of Torment with its gears/accessories. There's a saturation of roguelite/bullet hell games and Brotato offers too little to be unique. Hell, I prefer Holocure, which is free, than this game.

My only criticism is that on the highest difficulty some characters feel WAY HARDER than others, making them feel kinda bad to play. Especially the Saver feels kinda bad compared to others, as its gimmick (the piggy bank), feels a bit weak considering you are likely to get it on any other character at the point or shortly after you are even strong enough to use it efficiently, which leads to the character falling further behind due to the 50% increase to item price being way more impactful than the upside of 1% damage for 25 material you are currently holding and the 15 harvesting you start with, which just leads to a weaker run compared to all other characters and therefore feels more like a challenge than a unique character. 
Then again a few of the newer characters are WAY EASIER especially the Cryptid which in turn is equally as unfun as you are essentially handed a run for free and therefore does not feel fulfilling to play.

In conclusion 2 out of 44 Characters respectively aren't fun to me, meaning I roughly enjoyed 95,5% of the time I spent playing through all the characters on the highest difficulty initially, as well as all of the time I spent trying out fun builds or playing random runs with random starting weapons afterwards.",1703881654,1703881654,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The balance in the later difficulties feels completely out of whack with the number and strength of enemies. I'll compare some key points of Brotato with Vampire Survivors and Disfigure:

1) In Brotato, you play in a relatively small arena. Enemies spawn directly in the arena, many times directly next to your character. In VS and Disfigure, enemies spawn off screen and filter in. As a result, you receive much more cheap frustrating damage from the enemies in this game and are much more frequently put in situations where you have no choice but to tank damage to escape being surrounded.
2) In VS and Disfigure, many enemies simply try to walk into you to deal damage. This game's enemies are more varied in their AI, but also rely much more heavily on projectiles. This would be a positive thing, except Brotato does not tone down the quantity of enemies to compensate for the variety of attacks the player will have to dodge.
3) In Brotato, you acquire most items by purchasing them in a shop. The shop has 4 slots and can be refreshed by spending currency. The items have different tiers of rarity, meaning the good items will not show up as often. Getting a good run going is significantly more difficult than VS or Disfigure, which both allow you to more consistently acquire the upgrades you want. This makes VS and Disfigure more strategy and player skill, whereas Brotato is more luck-based.

Overall, Brotato feels like a game designed for you to lose repeatedly until you get lucky in the shop and have it give you the items and weapons you need. In a way it reminds me of one of my favorite games of all time: The Binding of Isaac. Except in The Binding of Isaac, your personal skill could nearly always pull you through even if the items you got were sub-par. In this game, if the shop says no, there's not much you can do about it. It feels like a transparent attempt for the game to prolong its lifespan, and it feels disrespectful.",1703848416,1703848416,False,2,0,0.495911955833435059,0,True,False,False

Thankfully, I don't think Brotato makes any grand claims at being the next sliced bread. It doesn't suggest itself to be some grand, epic tale either. You're a potato who gets strapped to the neck with weapons and munitions and sent out against hordes of enemies. They keep it pretty simple, yet if you're one who likes getting their stats yolked to the max - you can do that too.

Picture this: as you gear up for a run, you face the critical decision of...choosing a head for your potato body. Riviting - I know. A large amount of the game's achievements surround which head you went with. I'd say more but that might spoil your spud. =P

Pros:

- Lots of weapons
- Lots of carnage
- Traps and turrets rule
- Min/maxing is fun
- Unique, memorable graphics
- Priced at $5; anything less is a steal

Cons:
- Lack of enemy variety
- Lack of arena variety
- Why not more colors? (green, purple, red)


For how cheap it is, it's an easy pickup in my book. It offers nothing groundbreaking, but it does provide for several hours of horde-survival entertainment.

Load it up, the menu is completely uninspired, as is the opening UI. One basic fighting model. Like 4-5 enemies you'll have to learn and get used to, and the play area is just a regular square you run around in, no terrain or mix-ups on that

Lucky us! Instead of working on all that flash, the devs clearly put all that time into making the game actually feel really, REALLY good. Combat is pretty great. Tons and tons of weapons with good builds and synergies. There's like 40 characters, and they're not your typical roguelike breed where they have a few different stats and maybe start with a different weapon. The vast majority of them drastically change various mechanics in the game to force you to play to that character's strengths.

It took me about 3 hours to finally get a winning run, which was extremely satisfying. I just got my first max difficulty win 17 hours or so, with all but 1 character unlocked now. I got a lot of value out of this game, and I'm not done yet.

One thing to note is that this game is HARD, and also, it's a game of scaling. If you don't build right, you'll simply get outscaled and die from being overwhelmed by the enemies. That's just the nature of this game. It's also a lot more frustrating in that nature compared to slower paced roguelikes I liked like Gungeon and Hades - you could be having a blast until midgame hits and then a projectile hits you for half your HP and you panic. ""God runs"" can be over in an instant and gone forever, and you have to accept that as part of the journey. Also, I'm a noob, but I've only found one specific type of playstyle to really work for me, I keep getting clapped with any variation from it. None of these are gripes - in fact, probably my only gripe for this game is what appears to be a severe lack of RNG manip to get the builds you want. I think there's /some/, and wikis might have the answers to this, but I'm not one to just reset until I get a good start. I'd like a bit more control over what I build and buy.

But these devs are the antithesis of greed. Right on that boring landing page is a Mods button. There are also difficulty sliders in the options. I'd recommend, especially if you're struggling or new to roguelikes and bullet hells, to just crank the HP and damage to the bottom while keeping speed normal so you can learn the pace of the game in a less punishing manner. Crank them both back up a bit after every win! All in all, this is an INSANE value add to any steam library, I'll probably be gifting it to a few friends for the holidays this year, and I'm stoked to go and play with mods now that I've ""beaten"" the core game.",1702978874,1702978874,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Upsides: Lots of different fun weapons and strategies, a lot of different characters to unlock with lots of different difficulties for each, and it lets you somewhat build your own runs rather than just hoping you'll get something good at some point. 

Downsides: Not a huge fan of the art style or how bland and boring the map is. Lots of the same colors on every single enemy and the battlefield is just a boring square.

Overall, for five bucks, it's got a lot of content to blast through when you want a game to listen to podcasts while playing or have some youtube videos running in the background. Not bad at all.",1702447938,1702447938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans independently in multiple locations, but later genetic studies traced a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago, from a species in the S. brevicaule complex. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.

Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas by the Spanish in the second half of the 16th century. Potatoes are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes. Over 99% of potatoes presently cultivated worldwide descend from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile. The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production during the 21st century was in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world production of 376 million tonnes (370,000,000 long tons; 414,000,000 short tons), as of 2021.

Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in negligible amounts, but, if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.",1702400451,1702400451,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Brotato boasts 49 unique characters and each of them demands that the player adopts a unique play-style to fully realise their potential.

It took me 87 hours to beat every character in the game on Danger 5.  It's an addictive grind as the character selection screen will colour the background of each character with the corresponding colour of the highest danger level you've completed with said character.  The goal of painting the character screen gold becomes quickly apparent as you start to knock over your favourite characters one-by-one.

Fast forward a week or two, now you've completed Danger 5 on about 15-20 characters and as you look at the remainder of the roster, you start to wonder just how in the hell you're going to complete a run on any of them.  This is honestly why I had so much fun playing this game, the characters I wasn't comfortable with truly challenged me and had me on the edge of my seat as I beat the final boss wave to ultimately paint them gold on the character screen.

Have you ever wondered if a potato could rule the universe? Wonder no more! Brotato is a game that answers that question with a resounding 'Yes!' This game is so simple, you could play it one-handed while making a sandwich with the other. Yet, it's addictively complex in its own right.

The premise is simple: you start with a humble potato, barely more than a starchy lump with dreams. From there, you embark on a journey of epic proportions, transforming this unassuming tuber into a god of destruction. The game's rogue-like nature means each playthrough is a new adventure, with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on your toes—or rather, on your one free hand.

But don't let the game's simplicity fool you. The strategic depth is astounding. You'll find yourself weighing the pros and cons of various upgrades and weapons, from the classic 'Fry Slicer' to the awe-inspiring 'Mashinator 3000'. Each choice shapes your potato into a unique force of nature, capable of taking down hordes of enemies with ease.

The best part? Brotato is as cheap as chips! It offers enormous value for its price, providing hours of entertainment without breaking the bank. So, if you're looking for a game that combines humor, strategy, and the chance to see a potato wield nunchucks, Brotato is your go-to game.

Fasten your asteroid belts, because we're about to embark on a comedic odyssey in 'Brotato,' a game where a potato takes on the universe. Yes, you heard it right – it's carb-loading with a cosmic twist!

👾🌌 Imagine a universe where potatoes are not just for eating. In Brotato, you're a lone spud against an array of bizarre aliens. It's like 'Space Invaders,' but your spaceship is a potato, and your weapons are... also pretty much potato-based. The starch wars have begun!

🔫🥔 The arsenal? Oh, it's a root vegetable's dream. From fry-cutters to mashed-potato cannons, your weaponry is as innovative as it is absurd. It's like MacGyver met Mr. Potato Head, and they decided to save the galaxy.

🌟👽 Every alien you meet is more eccentric than the last. One moment you're blasting a space carrot, the next, you're dodging angry space broccoli. It's like a galactic farmer's market gone wild. And yes, the jokes about 'salad days' are endless.

🛸🥗 Customization in Brotato is a blast. You can deck out your spud in the finest space armor (which suspiciously looks like kitchen utensils). It's like playing dress-up, if dress-up involved gearing up to take down extraterrestrial eggplants.

🤣💥 In conclusion, 'Brotato' is a delightful blend of humor and space action. It's a game that teaches us valuable lessons: never underestimate a potato, and in space, everyone can hear you fry.

🌟🌟🌟🌟½: 4.5/5 stars for this spud-tacular space adventure. If you're looking for a game that's both action-packed and a total hoot, 'Brotato' is your ticket to the stars!",1690283396,1701985770,True,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

I can only guess some streamers played this to an audience that had never seen halls of torment or vampire survivors. I saw a review that praised it a lot, bought it and oh boy do I feel duped.
it's clear the guy had no idea what other games in the genre do already. and how stupidly sweaty the game is.
I played for one hour and already got 2 achievements that only a bit over 40% of people had. if I play ANY game in this genre I own, I never get anything that not already 80-90% of people have.

this tells me normies who are impressed with the genre gave it rave reviews, but stopped playing immediately. many such cases... 
it's hard for the sake of being hard. and there is no meta progression that ""gets you further"". there is the lamest unlocks you can imagine, i.e. completely gimped or amputated alternative potato guys you can play. some are decent. but there's nothing you unlock that gives you ANY feeling of progression or unlocking more of the game.

it's the complete opposite of Halls of Torment or the excellent new ""God of Weapons"" with myriad unlocks, classes, subclasses, weapons and items you can unlock or earn though challenges.

this game is trash in comparison. it has a lot of things you can find each round, but it's so sweaty that you feel you have to give it 100% all the time or just die.
that's fine, if I can find ways to grind my way to getting farther, but you can't. that's it, boy, that's the game.

it's basically a highscore type of experience, sans any high score because the game does not save your runs. now get back and do the round! ""why?"" ""JUST DO IT!""

I did almost all achievements in the pretty challenging Halls of Torment or Vampire survivors (it has new ones now I don't have yet) without ever asking myself ""why""... here, I played 1-2h with some alt-tabbing and I feel I'm sick of the game.
I feel zero interest in playing. why? well... I've seen the whole game. there is nothing else.

no maps, unlocks, weapons I haven't seen. sure I have not used *all* weapons, but I've used a lot to test them out, and I barely see any difference. they don't feel unique or fun.

Halls of Torment has insanely unique and different classes and weapons/spells. this is just visual noise.

and the game is pretty unfair at times. it has this obsession with cheap shots, like old coin machine games that made more money when they put you in no-win situations or spawned some boss on you with an attack you can't possibly evade unless you know already from where exactly it will come...

that's how this game feels. you routinely get zero chance of finding something that makes you survive the round.

when I die in vampire survivors, halls of torment or god of weapons, it's my fault. every time. I made a mistake. and usually I know pretty well what I did wrong.
not here. it's pretty much always the game's fault and conversely, if I survive, it feels like it's also the game's ""fault"". it's like playing a slot machine. you really don't have any impact. and most people agree with me. otherwise I'd not have unlocked so many achievements that the majority of people don't have after just 1h playtime.

there is a lot of delusional ""skill issue"" memers in the comments preventing any course correction in this trash heap of a game. 
a lot of games like this have this crowd that never plays, but hangs out in the comments to lord over people who complain that it's unfairly designed or wanna-be hard just for no reason with no goal you can get to.

Halls of Torment is *a lot harder* when you start at zero with no unlocks, a hell of a lot harder especially in the second map with a fresh character. but I loved that there because I knew getting to it would get me some reward that would make me stronger.

in this game, if I get through it does not depend on my skills. and when I do get through, I get nothing from it.

how is this a game? it's a slot machine. it is trash",1701871999,1701871999,False,6,0,0.407851696014404297,0,True,False,False

This one has you running in a limited arena, dodging enemies spawning periodically, taking them down to collect dropped resources in short, mostly 60 second rounds, a total of 20 in a regular game. Between these rounds you pick level up upgrades and buy up items and weapons. It's a very simple loop, with short hectic rounds, and purchasing as thoughtful as you want it to be.

The most hooking part in all this? It's very fun to create and try out entirely different builds. There's a variety of characters to unlock by playing, each offering very distinct ways to play, giving bonuses in exchange for some playstyle or progression limitations. Like one rewards you for keeping enemies alive at end of life while dodging them, another one strongly restricts all ways of restoring health apart from food pickups that drop across level. Then there's weapons. Some characters have restrictions or additions but mostly everyone gets max six each, firing or swinging at closest enemy. Apart from damage outputs and trajectories, there's varied utility effects like improving player regeneration, adding permanent stats for sufficient kills trough a round, etc. And then there's stats and items you buy. See, there's just always at least a couple interesting interactions between those, especially in the second apart of game when you secure rarer artifacts with special bonuses like ""one extra damage for each speed bonus"" - and beyond lower difficulties it's crucial to find a tactic that helps scale the stats to keep up with enemies and give you an edge in survival. Also many items you buy come with a drawback that adds additional nuance - like one critical chance increasing item also slightly drops damage, but is that a big deal when you're focusing on critical chance effects of your weapons?

Only thing I dislike is that it's rather bit... granular. Way too many +1% to +5% tweaks. Sure you stock up a whole bunch of these per run but it's a far cry from how it feels to get a new powerful item in other Surviors-likes. Also I guess depending on build the screen can get very overwhelmed with stuff. Not as much as many other of these games, mind, but space here is very limited so it feels so much more tight. Also wish there was more music. The soundtrack works surprisingly well but there aren't that many tracks there.

I totally recommend this one if you enjoy experimenting with stats and builds, goes real cheap and yet is extremely gripping.",1701304481,1701304481,True,7,1,0.619055628776550293,0,True,False,False

It runs soooo well on the OLED Steam Deck - and is also moddable!

The only problem I have is that sleep is a mandatory requirement - and this is hard to come by when you close your eyes and can only see a homicidal spud laying waste to hundreds of aliens.

This is my first game purchased from this studio but it won't be the last.

Only possible improvements IMHO would be better tool tips (there is a mod for this though) and a built in game mechanics trainer. Brotato is mostly pick up and play - but does have a few 'what does that ACTUALLY do?' moments the more you interact with levelling/gameplay.

I found the answers in forums - but shouldn't really need to (such as what is fruit and what does it do?)

Gameplay in Brotato is simple: pick a class, pick a weapon, enter a small arena, and run for your life as your weapons automatically attack the enemies around you. As you kill enemies you'll gain both experience and money. Experience is used to level you up, allowing you to select randomised power increases. Money is used between rounds to purchase new weapons and passive items from a shop. Items range from very common (and very boring) to rare, interesting, and synergistic. Assembling a selection of interesting items that work together often takes several runs and some experimenting, but it's satisfying when it happens.

More than items, classes are what make Brotato unique. When starting a run you can choose which character class you'd like to play as, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are several dozen classes to choose from (unlocking as you play and win) and each is very unique and forces you to make different choices in both play-style and item selection. There are also 5 difficulty levels, and attempting to beat the hardest difficulty with each class requires high knowledge of the game and a fair amount of luck.

These two paths, items and classes, make Brotato a lot more interesting for a lot longer than most bullet heaven games, which usually devolve into very samey gameplay with few choices after a few repetitions. I was actively involved for the entire time I was unlocking new classes to play as, and it was always interesting to play within the strengths and weaknesses of said classes.

On the negative side, there are some issues of balance. Melee-focused classes and weapons are often at a strong disadvantage, given that it's more dangerous to be close to an enemy than far away. This isn't unusual in action games, but it could have been more strongly compensated for in class and weapon stats. There's also the usual bullet heaven problem: once you're ahead you stay ahead, because you're killing and gaining money and experience faster than the game is giving you enemies; and once you're behind you're staying behind, because there is no catch-up mechanic. These aren't large enough issues to ruin the fun of the game, but you'll absolutely notice them if you play for long enough.

All told, Brotato is an exercise in pure gameplay. It has enough variance in both classes and items to continue to be fun after many, many hours of play, and it's more interesting than most games in its newly-emerging genre. There's also an active mod community, allowing for many more hours of fun. I strongly recommend it.",1701073590,1701073590,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

As much as i love Vampire Survivors, this game bests it quite easily. I'm amazed this is Early Access, it already has more content, tighter controls, more soul and just overall more fun than many AAA $60 games. How they manage to get so much character out of a potato is beyond me but I often found myself giggling at some of the tiny details on the characters in the game. Kudos to Blobfish. 

Don't think about it, just BUY THIS GAME. It's worth double the full price, if it's on sale you'd have to be an idiot to pass it up. It's THAT fun.

It is that easy to get into and get sucked into an hour. What I once thought its a low time investment becomes a time suck as you try to progress and clear more difficult levels. There's enough build options to make you pause and think about your upgrades. My kids when they first saw the game, thought the graphics were a bit retro but don't let that fool you as that's part of the charm. You get sucked into trying to survive the increasingly difficult waves of mobs while gearing up your spud. This is easily a recommend!

That's Brotato, at least the basis of it. There are really loads of playable Brotato, weapons and various items to survive these waves with different stats and strategies. And the characters are not even 100% committed to one strategy, experiments are allowed in the game and depending on how it is built, the game rewards you with a sense of achievement. 

Even when I bought it, I didn't think I would get more than 100 hours of gameplay, but this game is so versatile, yet relatively simple in concept.

For those of you who enjoy playing this type of game, Brotato is an absolute must!

Just buy it, start in 2 minutes, hundreds of hours of gameplay. (At least for me)

First, and most obvious (as well as least-significant) is the graphics.  When I first saw what the game looked like, it turned me off a bit; too cartoony / goofy.  Nonetheless, the silliness works here, because after a few sweaty minutes of trying not to die, you realize that where a mob used to look goofy, it now looks dangerous.  I quickly stopped caring about the cartoony nature of the game, and sorta learned to love it as unique.

Second, the game is faster-paced than its peers, and this requires twitch skills most of the other Survivors games lack.  Yes, true to the game genre, you're still just running around to pick things up or avoid them.  There's very little aiming to be done.  And yet the pace of the game is pretty frantic at times.  This keeps it entertaining.

Thirdly, there's more bullet hell in Brotato than I've seen in many of the other Survivors games.  Rather than the screen being swamped with mobs, it's a mess of mobs AND bullets - and some of the latter can be beneficial.  I like being forced to recognize between stuff that has to be avoided, and stuff you want to get closer to.  Similarly, some of the mobs have to die *fast* because they're dangerous, so you'll find yourself choosing when to charge and when to run away.

One last thing I've noticed (which makes this game stand out) is the length of a run.  In the first couple of difficulty levels, each run contains 20 ""maps"", and each only takes a few minutes to beat.  This keeps the frantic pace from tiring you out too much; you can go nuts for 10-15 minutes, and then pause between maps.

There are lots of other details, but the bottom line is that Brotato is a SOLID competitor to other games in the genre.  Don't be fooled by the graphics: it's seriously challenging in all the right ways.",1697230712,1700889928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Short Game Description[/h2]
Brotato is a roguelite bullet hell game where players are attacked through twenty waves by different types of aliens and must upgrade their character on each run to become stronger and survive.
[*][h3]Positives[/h3]
Discussing the positives, firstly, the gameplay is quite entertaining, featuring a wide variety of unique characters, different difficulty settings, and a diverse selection of weapons that offer many challenges to overcome. Secondly, the roguelite aspect is decent, with numerous stats that are each important, allowing for various winning strategies. Additionally, the weapons are well-balanced, and you will find yourself utilizing most of the available arsenal.
[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]
On the negative side, the main drawback is the limited number of bosses and the repetition of the same aliens throughout all the waves. This lack of monster variation, coupled with the fact that each weapon tier looks identical, can make the gameplay feel monotonous. Improving this aspect would add more liveliness to the game. Additionally, the roguelite system has its flaws, as even after unlocking new items in the shop, the same items tend to appear repeatedly, leading to repetitive runs that rely heavily on random number generation (RNG) rather than player skill.
[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]
In conclusion, Brotato is a decent roguelite bullet hell game with numerous challenges. However, it falls short in terms of repetition, and adding more content would greatly enhance its overall appeal. I would rate the game a 7.25/10.",1689532173,1700827817,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

the characters all feel like different challenges for the most part, too.  some are definitely easier than others, but figuring out how to win with each one provides a lot of replay value--and even after getting every achievement i still want to try and 5-tier each one.

i guess if you enjoy VS but find it somewhat tedious and samey, then this might be the answer for you.  its snappier and more build-focused and just a blast.",1700800650,1700800650,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Brotato is one of the most creative roguelike games I've ever played. Like I said in some of my other reviews, creativity runs in this game genre. Brotato manages to take it to another extreme entirely, to combine the game loop of a classic like Vampire Survivors and turn it into something else.

Each round is very short, but still exhilarating alike. The action never gets boring, and even  though I've put over 300 hours into this game, I still catch myself longing to play Brotato. A while back, I tried to quit, but couldn't. The gameplay loop just encaptures this feeling of one more round, one more attempt, that I hadn't felt in a while. The last game that truly hooked me like that was Slay the Spire, though I'd argue Brotato reeled me in way harder.

There really isn't much to say about this game, except that its great. I do think it could use some more content, though with the countless mods it has, even that is not much of a downside.",1664380634,1700764963,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Brotato is a game developed and published by Blobfish

The game offers some nice graphics and environments, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same and has a really great aesthetic

For an Early Access game and in it's current state, it already offers so much content that other games in the Early Access phase pale in comparison, so props to the developer for offering so much content and constantly adding more

Brotato overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a great action roguelike, bullet hell game and to play in short bursts

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

 This game is SO well polished and JUICY! I love the art style, the use of colour is very clear and well directed. Every character class feels buttery smooth, there is a little bit of skill involved, a little bit of luck, and MOSTLY strategy - meaning that the game is always fun.

Very polished, has a decent engine and 20 to 30 minute runs

It has so many different characters and mods, every different one would make the game feel different a bit so it has variety

The only downside is that it's extremely hard later on and luck based, so it gets frustrating not being able to decide what gun or what skill/item you want and it's downright gamble at danger 5 runs especially with harder characters

It's locked to 30 FPS and no resolution or graphic options either and it looks like it's been made by sadists LMAO, cause you'll understand when you get to danger 5, so easy to learn, VERY hard to master and as I said, it's based on luck a lot of the times for you to get what it takes to win so good luck xD",1700645657,1700645657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is simple to learn but difficult to master, with a wide variety of weapons, traits, and items to choose from that allow you to create unique builds.

The core gameplay loop is very addictive. Each run starts with you spawning in an arena with a few basic weapons and some currency. You then need to fight your way through a series of waves of enemies, collecting currency and picking up new weapons, traits, and items as you go. Once you reach the end of the 20th wave, you'll face a boss. If you defeat the boss, you'll win the run.

If you die, you'll start over from the beginning, but you'll keep any currency or items that you've unlocked. This allows you to gradually improve your character over time, making it easier to progress further in each run.

The game is also very visually appealing, with a simple but stylish art style. The music is also great, and it really helps to get you pumped up for each run.

Overall, Brotato is a great game that's perfect for fans of roguelikes and top-down shooters. It's simple to learn but difficult to master, with a wide variety of content to keep you coming back for more. I highly recommend it.

Pros:

Addictive gameplay loop
Wide variety of weapons, traits, and items
Great visuals and music
Affordable price
Cons:

Some enemies can be a bit too difficult
The game can be a bit repetitive after a while

Here are some tips and tricks for you if you want to try:
-Character Choice: Try a ranged character like the ranger for effective gameplay.
-Beta Branch: Play on the beta branch under Steam preferences, as the boss is easier and less buggy there.
-Defense Strategy: Focus on acquiring a lot of defenses like HP, Armor, and Healing, allowing room for mistakes.
-Shopping Strategy: Avoid buying small gains unless they're cheap. Stick to your plan, and prioritize rare weapons for better value and power increase.
-Luck Factor: Focus on Luck early in the game. Luck in the initial turns (1-5) will significantly strengthen your run. Continue focusing on luck until about floor 10, then switch to concentrating on weapons and defense.
-Weapon Choice: Lifesteal works well with very fast weapons like SMG, Minigun, and Flamethrower. It's also effective, albeit to a lesser extent, with AOE weapons.
-Item Availability: The items you hold will appear more frequently in the store. For example, holding a wrench will result in more wrenches appearing in the store.
-Stat Prioritization: Some stats to be wary of are:
Range: It slows down melee weapon attack speed, and ranged weapons already have sufficient range.
Harvesting: Generally not worth it, except possibly very early in the game.
Engineering: Avoid dabbling in this unless you're fully committed.
Elemental: Extremely strong if fully committed, but avoid getting distracted from your main build and survival strategy",1700618316,1700618316,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yet, like any younger sibling, you only you get to hate on him, and will defend him from anyone who tries to pick on him.

I have a love/hate relationship with Brotato. On the one hand, the art style, gameplay, and easy to understand game mechanics lure you into the sense that this game will lead to a chill play sesh (+1 if you are using the Steamdeck, which it feels perfect on). On the other hand, unlike Vampire Survivor you are constrained to an arena, which makes the increasingly difficult mobs even harder to manage, and it truely feels like a bullet hell. What I like about this game over Vampire Survivor is the emphasis on creating a build using in game currency to buy items and weapons that alter stats. You may increase your damage, but now you have no armor and your speed is reduced to nothing. Every purchase is a decision that can bite you in the ass later.

Also, if you have trouble beating levels, you can adjust enemy health, speed, and damage in accessibility settings. There is no shame in it, and getting all of the unlocks is more fun than repeatedly dying over and over again, which you will do.

Yep, it shares similarities with Vampire Survivors. So what? I feel like it expands on the formula a little by changing the purpose from surviving for 30 minutes in a giant stage to surviving waves of enemies in a mini-arena.

Pros:
+ Artstyle
+ Gameplay
+ Optimisation
+ Replayability

Cons:
- This one's debatable, but I feel like game prefers certain builds over others. It's insanely hard to beat the game going melee, but might be a skill issue on my part. On the other hand, equipping thousands of turrets with decently sized HP pool and/or heavily upgraded armor/HP regeneration/life steal/dodge will secure a victory for sure.

I initially struggled to connect with games in the ""Vampire Survivors"" sub-genre, finding them mildly entertaining for about half an hour. However, Brotato managed to capture my interest more than any other game of this style. The game's unique twist, placing players in the shoes of a potato, turned out to be surprisingly engaging. The potato comes in various forms, and unlocking different characters with their own traits added a layer of depth, making each playthrough feel distinct.

I appreciated the game's adjustable difficulty, accommodating both seasoned players and newcomers. Throughout the gameplay, the progression system allowed for character enhancement and weapon upgrades, leading to a sense of accomplishment and eventual victory. Brotato proved to be a well-thought-out rogue-lite, offering a fun and casual way to pass the time without being overly complicated.

The combat mechanics were a standout feature, providing a satisfying experience with precise hit-boxes and diverse combat styles. The consistent and visually appealing art style, along with excellent sound design, contributed to an overall polished feel. The extensive variety of weapons, items, and characters demonstrated a careful balance, ensuring that each choice mattered during gameplay.

While the game had its drawbacks, such as overly easy achievements and occasional glitches, the positives outweighed the negatives. The affordability, replayability, and short run times made it a game I'd recommend, especially for those with a busy schedule. It's clear that not every game is for everyone, but Brotato managed to exceed my expectations and offered a unique and enjoyable gaming experience.",1700600214,1700600214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]10 points of self-hatred and inner pain out of 10.[/i]

On a more serious note... The game is really great. 
[u][b]Music[/b][/u] is amazing, very energetic and puts you in the right mood for the game. Game sounds are very comfy and nice.
[u][b]Visually[/b][/u] the game is very eye-pleasing: animations are very simple, they don't distract you, as it should be, everything looks very smooth and polished.
[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u] COULD seem repetetive, BUT you actually have a lot of options how play:
[olist]
   1) there are bunch of weapon types and weapon classes, each one is unique. Weapons have on hit effects, kill effects, knockback, class bonuses(2-6 of the same type will provide you additional stats, for example), different range and number of projectiles, projectiles can pierce, ricochet, melee weapons can hit multiple target in one swing etc. You can be melee, ranged or you can play around turrets and mines, you can focus on elemental\magic dmg. You can choose weapons that deal dmg based on your HP...;
[/olist]
[olist]
   2) there are bunch of characters, or better to say BROTATOS, each with it's own specialty and playstyle. You normaly can have 6 weapons, but there are characters who can't have weapons, but they explode when hit, some can have only 1 weapon, some 12, there is even a Pacifist Brotato, who benefits from not killing enemies!;
[/olist]
[olist]
   3) each time you complete a level you get to choose how to lvl up and what to buy and you never have the same run;
[/olist]
[olist]
   4) there is an endless mode c:
[/olist]

[u][b]Conclusion:[/b][/u]
For me it's a mustplay game from the genre, very enjoyable to watch and to play.
Definitely recommend to everyone who enjoys this type of games.
Not easy, not insanely hard. Good balance.

Solid Game though as well, the game came out in early access around the time the whole Vampire Survivors craze occurred. While most games like this being released at that time were carbon copies of Vampire Survivors, this game managed to use the same formula while changing it up by having multiple waves instead of just a continuous run and a shop in between waves to buy items from.

Short version if you looking for reviews to know if this game is as good as Vampire Survivors, the answer is a sounding YES, some what more fun.

After a while, with all the progression, Vampire Survivors becomes a bit boring, with no challenge and basically an achievement hunt process. 

Brotato's characters are more varied, with even a small learning curve on how to play each one of them properly, and you can experiment with different builds on same characters upgrading different stats/skills. With no meta progression, aside of unlocking new weapons and characters, the game is still challenging even on Danger Level 0, even after unlocking everything.

It's simple and very fun. Go for it!",1674054738,1700594794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's very much stat based, especially with all the classes. You have to know what everything does, even when it's not explained properly and knowing the optimal strategy for each scenario (class) is paramount. Also, you're just really moving around in circles for the most part. The game is 80% strategy, 20% execution (gameplay). 

You can make some pretty broken builds if the RNG gods are with you. You can also just suddenly die because you didn't have enough dodge or armor or HP or some stat that just never came up. Maybe you're just too broke to buy that one upgrade that you needed. This game is perfect for mathematicians / statisticians ... honestly a college course on this game would make math a lot more interesting.

This has to be the best game for Steam Deck 2023? Right? I nominated it.

This game took me on an adrenaline-fueled journey unlike any other. From choosing my character with their unique stats to battling increasingly powerful monsters through 20 intense rounds, the thrill never let up.

The strategic element of the game is what truly hooked me. With each round presenting tougher challenges, the need to upgrade and fine-tune my character's stats became a thrilling necessity. The balance between earning money and deciding where to invest it for maximum impact kept me engaged and strategizing every step of the way.

The rush of excitement as I faced the final boss on round 20 was unparalleled. The satisfaction of using my hard-earned upgrades to conquer the ultimate challenge was incredibly rewarding.

Brotato isn't just about battling monsters; it's a test of wit, strategy, and resource management. The escalating difficulty curve adds a layer of excitement and accomplishment with each victorious round.

In summary, Brotato is a five-star triumph in the gaming world. Its unique blend of strategy, character development, and thrilling battles makes it an absolute must-play for anyone seeking an adrenaline rush and a truly epic gaming experience.",1700462950,1700462950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ставлю около 7.9-8.0
С большей вероятностью зайдет любителям рогаликов vampire-like'ов
Полный забег идёт около 25-35 минут что вообщем классика для большинства рогаликов.

В игре неплохой баланс и на первых порах забега нужно выбирать 1 из 2. 
1) забить хрен на один и/или несколько параметров
2) попытаться усидеть на всех стульях. 
И оба варианта вполне играбельны хотя имхо, под конец всё-равно нужно будет следовать 2 варианту и бо это vampire-like а в них если в лейте тебе не хватает чего-либо то в основном это тебя и убивает. 
Благо перекос можно спокойно убрать вол эдак за 6-10 (смотря на сколько он сильный. Есть и пара исключений, например призрак или пацифист. 

Ну и раз подняли тему классов/персонажей то самое время и о них что-нибудь сказать. Персонажей/классов в игре аж 34 и каждый реально играется по-своему. есть например пацифист который получает материалы за каждого живого врага в конце волны, или стрелок который не может использовать оружия ближнего боя, или призрак у которого -100 броня(больше урона получает), но +30% к уклонению и вместо 60% потолок уклонения 90%. И вот так с каждым персонажем что очень хорошо.

Ну и про материалы. Они выпадают с мобов и получаются за разбор вещей из ящиков(покупные нельзя разобрать)и разбор оружия. Есть и исключения, к примеру ранее названый пацифист, но суть ресурса одна. По окончанию волны открывается магазин где можно купить новое оружие/копию своего/предметы. 

Большинство предметов дают что-то и забирают что-то другое, например +2к броне -1% к скорости, или +8% к уклонению -1 к броне, но усидеть на всех стульях вполне реально. 

Теперь о пушках и зачем нужны их клоны. А нужны они для смешивания непосредственно апа пушки этим путём. смешать можно только 2 полностью одинаковые пушки и получить 1 более высокого уровня. Уровней пушек всего 4. (кстати и у обычной прокачки за лвл есть уровни, их тоже 4) максимум пушек 6, но и тут есть исключение. 

Так же игра не дает стоять на месте, враги появляются в разных точках карты, а не из углов экрана что местами заставляет ходить по карте. 

Ну в целом вроде рассказал о всё о чем можно было, однозначно рекомендую",1699972100,1699972100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have never seen a dev misunderstand its own customer base so badly. The whole point of this game is to play over and over untill you get a good run with great RNG so you can push further and further. The dev will intentionally nerf items and change stat values to stop you from doing that. There is literally no point in playing as you will inevitably run into a wall where you simply cant keep up with the buffs the enemies get. You cannot get better at the game. You cannot get a lucky run. This is because any item in the game that works will be nerfed beyond useless. Any strategy you develop will only serve to inspire the Dev to nerf or otherwise sabotage that method.

 Why would I be motivated to play again for a better run when I know the run will die because the game suspiciously suddenly stops giving legendary drops despite my luck stat being through the roof? Why would you punish players that want to go into wave 100? This isnt a competitive game. It has no esports scene. There is literally no reason to balance the fun out of the game. Understand that its not a skill issue. The game now has mechanics in place to kill runs for the sake of killing runs. You cannot get better to counter this its hard coded.

Brotato became popular because of the broken builds. Thats why people loved it. You could get good at the game and push for a good run and become a potato god. Now you die on wave 36 with an overpowered build because the game refuses to drop the items you need to keep up. You heard me right. Its not an RNG thing. It is literally designed to stonewall you.

For a game in the ""Walk n' grind"" genre it's pretty great. It's like Vampire Survivors, but each round is about a minute long, the map is much smaller, and artstyle is similar to Binding of Issac in a way. It's pretty fun and you unlock different characters/items instead of permanent upgrades when you win a round which I prefer. 

Only complaints I have are minor. Elemental feels very weak compared to other weapons/stats. There is also a specific boss in the game that is crazy hard to beat compared to the other bosses I have faced throughout the game (Butcher). Finally if you are after a game with more control to it you won't find it here. What I mean is the only control you have is your movement with no way to aim or fire your weapon since it's done automatically.

Brotato isn't your average run-of-the-mill roguelite game; it's a delightful journey into a potato-infused universe where the stakes are as high as the starch content. As a roguelite aficionado, I found myself enamored with the tuberous charm of Brotato and here’s why this game is worth every peeler's time.

A Quirky Concept with Stellar Execution:
Brotato takes a whimsical premise and executes it with a finesse that's as smooth as mashed potatoes. Armed with an arsenal of up to six weapons, you, a combat-ready potato, face off against relentless alien invasions in a top-down arena. The crisp execution of this concept kept me engaged and eager for more.

Potato Power: The Art of Customization:
The game allows you to tailor your potato to your preferred style of gameplay. With a variety of traits and items to choose from, the customization options are as vast as a field of Idaho Russets. Whether you want to be an explosive spud or a stealthy tater, Brotato accommodates your strategic desires.

Roguelite Done Right:
The roguelite elements in Brotato are as integral as gravy on poutine. Each run feels unique with procedurally generated levels, diverse enemy patterns, and randomized item placements. The constant companion of permadeath doesn't feel punishing but instead drives the motivation to adapt and strive for that better run.

Tater-tainment Galore:
The humor in Brotato is a hearty serving of fun. From the clever item descriptions to the playful enemy designs, the game exudes a light-heartedness that's refreshing. It's a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously, making it accessible and enjoyable for both casual and hardcore gamers.

A Visual Feast of Potato Goodness:
With its vibrant, pixelated art style and a clear top-down perspective, Brotato is a visual delight. The quirky design of aliens and smooth animations add to the visual appeal, making the chaotic battles a sight to behold.

Spud-tacular Challenges and Achievements:
For the completionists out there, Brotato offers an array of challenges and achievements that are as satisfying as achieving the perfect roastie. The potato-themed challenges extend the game’s longevity and provide a satisfying crunch of accomplishment.

Room for Improvement?
Every game has room for growth, and Brotato is no exception. Some might find the difficulty to be a bit challenging, and a dash of diversity in level environments and enemy types could be the extra seasoning this game needs.

In Conclusion:
Brotato is a spud-tacular roguelite arena shooter that serves up a unique blend of humor, challenging gameplay, and customization. Whether you're a roguelite veteran or just on the lookout for a quirky game to dig into, Brotato has got the goods to keep you coming back for more. So gear up, grab your potato-themed weaponry, and get ready for a spud-fueled adventure that's anything but half-baked!",1694916592,1698906890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
