In fact, one of the paradoxes of Foxhole is that while every individual thinks they're the best on the faction with the worst luck, the faction is far worse than how good any individual thinks they are. This inescapable skill cap can be explained by how every time you play anti-infantry, your anti tank sucks, and your faction loses, and every time you play logistics, your QRF sucks and your team loses. When your teammates try to point out that you're the common denominator, you could ignore them completely because they don't speak the same language.

Foxhole tries to be too many things and ends up being bad at all of it. Too many aspects deserve to be refined. I don't design nor develop video games so my opinions are largely invalid.

The developers do [b]NOT[/b] value your time nor sanity, and many mechanics take exorbitant durations and/or effort. The developers try to introduce some Random Number Generator based things in Foxhole to increase relevancy of teamwork and tactics (instead of pure ""how-fast-I-can-snap-my-mouse-to-head-shot""), but just end up making the game feel unfair. Not only this, many underlying mechanics that the player base should be able to understand for a fair playing ground is not explained in any way, and community management and communication is nonexistent except for a stream every third of an year and vague patch notes without solid numerical data.

Every bit of respect for the developers and their work but with the state of the game, it can not be recommended with good intent and sound thought.

The gameplay itself is fun and addictive, a grind at times but enjoyable with friends. However, this enjoyment is overshadowed by the negative aspects of the community.

The toxicity within the community is a significant issue, particularly for women and LGBTQ+ folks. You will have to deal with sexism, ableism, slurs, death threats, stalkers and nazis with little to no support from the larger community. 

Joining regiments and interacting with people on both sides can be an experience‚Ä¶. A lot of these regiments have your average gamer brain person with no short supply of slurs and using mental health or disability related terms with negative connotations. Toxic vets (high ranks/long time players) that set the behaviour of regiments and the faction as a whole creating a reinforcement loop for everyone around them to act in bad ways. You are expected to ignore the abuses going on around you, if you stand up for yourself you will be outcasted from the social circles or have to exile yourself.

Regiment drama and inter personal relationships will have your head exploding, leave the community servers and hubs its not worth it for your mental health. Devs need to add a way to disable world chat as it will have you questioning why we even got out the primordial soup.

For new players, the learning curve can be steep, with some veterans displaying a lack of patience It's awful to keep seeing new players shouted at and reported for being alts rather than guided and supported.

It's difficult to address these issues when the bad actors seem to be in the majority. The current state of the community leaves much to be desired, and it's unfortunate that such behaviour is tolerated and even normalised.

Find a good bunch of people to play with try not to let the foxhole brain worms infect you. Winning or losing does not matter, have fun, be kind to each other üò≠",1676160990,1708792958,False,1,0,0.505617976188659668,1,True,False,False

You can hop around different roles and work in different areas and it makes the game fun since all roles are extremely important (logi, infantry, artillery, armor, facilities, etc.) Regiments also will help you and most people are surprisingly newbie friendly. 

I will say if you do start (and well even for vets), just know every piece of equipment you use is created by other players. They mined, crafted, and transported EVERYTHING so treat equipment well and try to avoid stealing if someone clearly is trying to save something for their own operations.

-Server instability 
-Bias of developers and interference
-Quality of life for logistics and bases (maintenance supplies can be produced 15k+, yet can only be transported in small batches; logistics in terms of gameplay is severely lacking more complex systems and streamlining that make it nearly unplayable)

After spending some more time with the game I realized I just got a bit unlucky with whom I was interacting with. Honestly a majority of the players are pretty relaxed and more open to help then anything. This game isn't perfect; but it's certainly unique and for that I would have to recommend giving it a try. I would also have to advise that it's a bit tedious though; a lot of the game is waiting on menu's. Unless they are going to add among us like minigames (which would be worse) not sure how they could solve this issue. At least a fill until full option would be a nice quality of life feature for logi players. The servers also tend to have issues sometimes, not sure if this has to do with the new boats or if this has been ongoing for awhile. The combat also feels kinda jank, where it's mostly RNG. Bayonet's should not be the best weapon for mid/close range but all you have to do is get lucky and you can kill someone with an smg by charging them. To be honest I think it's a combination of the way aiming works and the server delay that makes bayonets stupid. If someone is running full charge you basically have to aim a bit forward to account for the delay, ontop of server delay this becomes just basically luck. Pretty sure my soldier with pistol would have at least finished off the guy he just shot three times before getting stabbed. Like point blank; how the hell do you miss a man running right at you, it's one of those things that just feels super stupid when it happens. Oh right because it's a lottery system. Make the combat feel more skillful and realistic and then I think I could recommend this to everyone. All I can say about this game is it's good parts are good and it's bad parts can be really bad. Whether you'll enjoy the good parts over the bad that's for you to find out. I think it's worth picking up to try out and just return it if it's not your cup of tea.

OLD REVIEW: 
As much as I want to like this game. It's basically just queue simulator hosted on laggy servers. The community is also pretty toxic sometimes. Where they will destroy your stuff, basically throwing a temper tantrum because they wanted something you grabbed or decided to use. I'm talking about people on your team; not enemies to be clear. The combat doesn't really feel reliable because of the servers so sadly I can't say this game is good other then in concept.",1707449678,1708455011,True,0,0,0.498090207576751709,1,True,False,False

The teamwork doesn't improve the situation naturally, it is controlled artificially. When an algorithm, or an adult decides that you have teamworked correctly, the game makes you successful. If you want to win the game, tell other people what to do, or follow other people's orders. If you just do your own thing in your corner, you will be bullied by people that are paid to bully you until you join other people. Its a game of herding people or being herded.

The shooting is simplistic. Logistics, artillery, tank gameplay is boring. There can be strategies, but not in the world chat because some players use multiple accounts to spy on the other side. There can be strategies inside a regiment, but it will be made successful / unsuccessful by whatever adult is in charge of deciding if you teamworked correctly or not. And by the way you have to teamwork the way that the game wants you to teamwork, expecting other players to fulfill other roles will be made to not work.

The best you can get from it is the feeling of being part of something bigger, but in fact its the same as being manipulated into being part of a Cult. The rules of the game limits your gameplay into a style and reinforces it with psychological manipulation.

Its a game that might've been corrupted by Canada's sponsorship for videogame development. A propaganda machine. Many veterans have left since the Inferno update, which I guess was when the ""teamwork"" changes were made.

I thought that maybe I was wrong and tried really hard to find ways to enjoy it, but I've had enough experience to have a strong definitive opinion about this game. I wouldn't use videogames to propagandate my kids, and surely not with those ideas.

All the cool stuff is behind a massive grind fest of logistics that I'm pretty sure most players don't give a F about. I certainly don't. It's too in depth. It's probably a reason why the game's pop is dying drastically. People just want to play a persistent war, not a persistent logistics nightmare. I don't think most are interested in the logistics, but if you want a tank, arty, a decent rifle, ammo, bandages or anything besides a pistol and 2 mags, you have to create everything from scratch. It's honestly annoying and far too in depth. 

I thought the game looked interesting and bought it on a whim because friends play sometimes. But with the 2 hour return window, you will NOT have enough time to understand this game and if it's something you'll want to continuing playing. I found out that hard way that Steam changed the return time window. I haven't requested a refund in a long time and with only 5.9 hours they denied me. I think 5.9 is reasonable. Now I'm forced to find something I like about it to get my monies worth and I despise Foxhole and Steam for it. 

Do not buy this game at full price. It doesn't feel polished nor popular enough to justify the price since it relies soully on a dedicated community to actually function. I don't think it has enough of one. I'd wait for a sale of at least 50% or more off if you really want to try it. Also watch a ton of video. I mean hours worth of tutorials and guides to see if the logistical grind or anything is worth it too you. 

Game would have been more fun with minimal logistics mechanics if it needed it at all. 

Also, Steam can go screw itself for the 2 hour return window. With how games are today, most need a 6-8 hour return window.",1707788501,1707932971,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You want to win the war, but you are meant to figure out the short-term goals, motivations and rewards on your own, as the only systems the game offers for that are 'commendations' and the 'ranks', neither of which have any mechanical effect on gameplay.
It also, like most of the multiplayer warfare simulators on the market, requires unrealistic amounts of coordination from mostly random strangers, and the only systems the game offers for that are 'map markers', 'squads' and  'regiments', all of which are very primitive and feel like an afterthought.
It is naive to expect every player to be able to, to know how to, and to want to communicate with other players verbally all the time, and it is very sad that Foxhole's devteam chooses to add more weapons, more vehicles and more complex features, instead of bringing the basic player experience to an enjoyable level.
The game is IMMENSELY fun when played as a large (10+ people) group of friends, where you can compensate for the lack of in-game features by organizing and communicating externally, but you as a potential buyer are statistically unlikely to have that many friends, let alone that many friends willing to buy and learn a new game.

P.S.
Logistics are boring and un-rewarding, infantry combat is wonky and frustrating, and there are also no plans to add EU or Asian servers that I heard of, so as a Eurasian player, you are stuck with a 300+ ping Canadian server, in a game with one-hit-deaths and full friendly fire.",1652306440,1707932933,False,5,0,0.530812203884124756,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately, the game lacks the proper polish and balance due lack of community engagement and development changes.

Pros
+Player built structures allow for diverse strategic options
+Worldwide 24/7 servers create unique and engaging experiences with other players
+Player-run economy allows for in-depth logistical planning and tactical choices
+Private squad/regiment system allowing you to group up with friends or other teammates

-Lack of direct-communication channels with players/veterans to improve the game
-Lack of moderation and tools to counter cheaters, exploiters and players alting (switching teams to hurt that team)
-Lack of an up-to-date and proper tutorial
-Lack of quality of life game features (notably in logistics; i.e. more automated systems to ease logistics burden in late-game when resource costs and travel times are high)
-Lack of in-game options for team planning / communication
-Best vehicles are locked behind the construction and maintenance of a facility (large base) requiring a considerable time investment (making them unavailable to majority of player-base)
-Developers have removed useful features  (i.e. XP progress bar, end-war leader-boards)
-Many combat issues including reload bug, terrain glitches (stuck locations, invisible walls and terrain assets), random disconnects (typically at borders or high population areas) and many more


What Foxhole offers as a unique game experience is a valuable piece of content for anyone and is worth the price of admission if it's what you're looking for. You'll no doubt leave with some unique experiences, however, you'll undoubtedly be sucked into an endless grind that cannot be maintained due to the lack of supporting systems and player intentions. If combat is your goal, then be prepared to spend countless hours sitting in queues, dealing with game bugs/exploits and driving lots to do so.

I have had a long time with Foxhole, but I have also realized that the game has shifted in favour of relying on a greater time investment from the player and a lack of gameplay polish/features.

But being a lone soldier that can't impact much of anything at all, just doesn't feel fun. You will die constantly, respawn at a base nearby, and repeat the same drudgery for hours trying to make even a small impact.

The most fun I had was running into random groups or clans that let me tag along with them. Then you get to experience tank brigade rushes, or hopping on a ship and working with a crew to actually blow the hell out of the enemy positions. But unless you are committed to constantly joining groups, and coordinating on a bigger scale, there just isn't a single-player version of this game that feels very satisfying imo.

This game is for people who like cooperation, clans, and working with coordinated teams. This game is not for someone looking to go rogue, out on their own, or feel powerful as an individual.

All these actions you do together with your faction. You even have a faction tech tree, that slowly progresses over multiple days while gradually unlocking more and more advanced stuff. The map is semi-persistent, with that i mean, a war will often take multiple weeks (20~80 days) depending on the faction succes. You start out with early slaugtherhouse infrantry pushes, and end up with tactical-nukes and tanklines pounding level 3 concrete bunker defences.

The controls can be a bit hard to get used to, as you are not aiming like a 3d shooter with a croshair, but more like a 2.5d topdown kind of view. It will take some time to adjust to aiming like this. But in the end it adds to a feel that really fits this game.

The community's in this game can be very big, with some clans having lots of people in their ranks. You can also play the game solo, which is fun to learn some of the basics, and getting a bit of a feel on the front-lines, and maybe some basic logistics.
But don't expect to solo build a big bunker or facility complex quickly, since it requires a lot of effort and also maintenance to not have it decay. (Especially in the lastest patches, solo play became more limited and harder overal) Besides that, the community can be very toxic if you touch their stuff, or build non optimal things. I have not had much issues with this, but there are lots of stories from solo players getting kicked/shortly banned by clans, sometimes with decent reasons, but also often for no clear/good reason at all. Dont expect the game staff will do much about it if a clan picks on you.

If you want to get the most out of this game, i suggest you to play with a clan at the current state of the game, and make sure you have at least some time to play for a few hours a few times a week to be able to get something roling.

If you are planning to go solo, i will not recomment the game in the current state, some things that could be done solo before, have become very difficult now. Also most groups don't simply add solo players to fill party slots, since they will be scared of you potentially stealing or losing their expensive stuff.

Considering the game has become more and more limited for solo play with the last years updates, i will for now not advice the game for the general public. I might change my opinion if there will be changes that will allow solo players to do more things as well, or that allow them to more easily co√∂perate with groups.",1707838072,1707838072,False,5,0,0.54601675271987915,0,True,False,False

You will develop love/hate relationship and you will enjoy all different aspects that game offers...for some time. I consider it a pretty highly addictive game, and believe me, it's like a drug. And drugs are no good for you buddy. You will ask yourself why i just found this game now, where was it all along? This is the greatest MMO ever man! But... after a while you will start feeling consequences of this bug infested glitchfest of a game. Unfinished product that still HAS great potential. Unfortunately, I think it will never be something more than that. If you ask me, this is still an early access game.

And yes, everything is good and dandy until the burnout kicks in. How to avoid burnout? Impossible. Btw, this is the only game that I regularly exited with Alt+F4. No game can beat that! On top of that, balance issues, toxicity and teamkills is a regular, especially in the situations when your faction is losing a region. Then pure chaos ensues and... well, things happen.
On top of that you will die in all the ways possible you could imagine 10 times in a row in a span of 30 seconds, just to look 45 seconds of that annoying death screen after every death. On top of all of the above add the fact that most of the time you died, you died because of the bugs and poor design decisions. Some of these things are impossible to fix. I'll just mention a few things that are horrendous and will never be fixed (probly):

-queue bugs (waiting to enter another region for 10-15 mins in a truck full of bmats just to get disconnected and thrown back to the menu screen. You have to redeploy, and probably lost everything)
-queue time (because, time matters, life is too short to watch youtube adds and wait to join in game FOXIHOLE)
-respawn time (especially after a teamkill or some other death you could not control at all, you should have shorter respawn time)
-stuttering (minor nuisance but happens quite often)
-getting stuck in trenches, foxholes, trucks, bases, literally everything.
-getting stuck in jump animation after getting unstuck from trenches, foxholes, trucks, bases, literally everything. (You basically have to go back to the previous spot where you got stuck in the first place and start all over again)
-If you switch to your secondary or tertiary weapon after use of primary weapon too fast it won't load. Basically you will not equip it. (very annoying if you need to throw a grenade pretty fast or use binos after mortar fast) 
-Make WIDER roads.
-Inability to check activity log while dead
-I want to be able to check map when driving without stopping. I didn't use a brake for the love of god, just wanted to check the map for one friggin second! (Especially annoying when trying Logi)
-REMOVE BARBED WIRE from game!
-friggin LAG, this thing is the worst. This is the main reason for that rage inducing part I mentioned.(And it's not on me).
There's more stuff but this is the most annoying thing. 

For now this game is a NO NO. If devs fix some of these things i'll change my opinion as well.

Edit: Nothing ever changed. Maybe just my mental state. I returned to this crap of a game. The game is literal cancer. Artillery is cancer. Everything You will do, that could and it will turn against you. Every bmat you worked for, every flank you did, every action you carefully planned will be nullified by this cancer of a game. If I had a chance to bring the time i lost playing this game I would be happy. If I could I would sue devs for making this cancer of a game. It is a long story to write and I'm not going to do it. I will literally delete this game from my steam, so it would never remind me, that time I wasted is priceless and I can't never get it back. I wasted thousands of hours on Football managers and CIV series, Europa Universalis and similar Paradox games, even on WoW and I don't regret it. But this crap... Even War Thunder was worth it. There, I said it. 

Devs if you read this, don't take it seriously. It was a great idea but terrible execution. The only thing you executed perfectly is the time of my life that I will never get back. Please find a new job and cancel this cancer project you call a game.

Thank You!

The problem is that after getting all of those 'chores' done, the game simply lays out even more obstacles in front of you (and I don't mean it in the fun, intended obstacle way) the tiniest of things you could never have accounted for CAN and WILL happen to stop your plan dead in the tracks even after you've done everything to ensure it works. Even some of the simplest things to do in this game result in the appearance of 20 different problems you have to solve before you can do those things, and after those problems are solved, and you've jumped through 12 figurative hoops to get here, something can still go very very wrong: *The enemies you spent hours setting up artillery to bomb have retreated by then./The hundreds of rockets you've been stockpiling for a barrage get destroyed by partisans (infiltrators behind your lines) the exact day you were going to launch that barrage./Spent 4 days grinding to build your facility? A regiment (people from YOUR OWN faction, that you should be COOPERATING WITH) destroys it because they wanted to make a rail line that only they would use trough there.* These are all examples that happened to me and my friends during our time playing this game. The whole allure of this game is that after doing hours of what are essentially virtual chores, it will give you some big reward for them, except it won't. I am not a religious person, but I swear with my hand on my heart and my eyes towards GOD when I say: this game does nothing but waste your time, it is intrinsically tied to how the game is designed. It makes you run 40 kilometers and jump through 20 hoops for the promise of a piece of candy, which it will crumple and step on in front of you once you're done.",1707765273,1707765273,False,5,0,0.535791456699371338,0,True,False,False

Hello I‚Äôm CmdrConrad, Brigadier of the warden army and leader of the Clover‚Äôs Rifle or better known ‚ÄúCR‚Äù 

1.4k hours spent almost in this game... I cannot somehow recommend Foxhole. In Fact i have to advise against it.Your safety and well being should be prioritised. I've made it clear I don't care about death threats. I‚Äôve already experienced it all In game and Discord. 

My rank and hours don't matter, its just a dumb gesture to show ""Hay I played the game"" that's all it should be! not a way to dictate your opinions. Just because you have 10k hours in the game doesn't give you the authority to dictate whether someone else enjoyed this game or not. 

The Community has had some wonderful people and individuals, who were lovely to me and my Regiment. However the ""clan man bad"" meme is too true, Fun isn't a concept unless your winning. Winning is the only acceptable way for fun. If you disagree you will get yelled at you will be ridiculed and hopefully dismissed. 

Where does the community truly shine? The front line soldier! Fighting in open fields or at bridges and hills for hours on end is truly fun. The people make it even better I can look pass buggy features and terrain with a fun time. 

Unfortunately the game is plagued with middle aged men and veterans that will treat this like a real life situation not even in a larp way just dead serious which is weird because its a game chill out enjoy the experience have fun???

Paranoia is extremely high in this game about alt accounts. The community is also very hostile to twitch streamers due to ""they are leaking map intel"" so if your a streamer looking to play this don't. You will be hassled to get map covers or just straight up told to not stream the game at all. 

Logistics isn't meant for everyone if you do insist on playing Foxhole do not get pressured into it. No one cares about the rank above your head, the dopamine isn't even worth it. I've been there and I'm extremely guilty as charged for it. 

Tanking has never been fun since they made those new defences and tanks that can one shot Ironhides. Wars will progress to a point where infantry will become nullified and you will require tanks. 

I'm very sad that I was ridiculed for using the ""Noble Widow MK.XIV"" or as I'd like to just call it the Warden Hetzer tank. Just like the Ironhide it was one of the regiment favourites. So when updates kept rolling which made both these tanks more obsolete even in the prime tech time. 

The Ironhide is an upgrade to the Devitt MK III. Before inferno update you could make these in the garage if your faction researched them! however in the new update. You were required to use facilities to get certain upgraded tanks... Which locks out most casual players

Facilities! I cannot stress how stupid this update was. They should of been to make the super tanks nothing else. I was fine with the idea you needed a massive coordinated effort to make these super tanks. However mixing them in with tank upgrades killed the game for me.

I was a casual player running a mostly casual regiment, however as inferno came out we had to take this game way more serious and that's when CR was officially disbanded. The Clovers rifles that started in Port of Rime during the glory of battle ended in a fucking factory... 

I still standby everything I said before and now the fundamentals of the game will never change. But I'm no longer a reliable source I don't have the game installed anymore I don't go in to just check things out I'm done with Foxhole. 

Thank you everyone for the support, I'm sorry that I'm not able to write a better review anymore. The game has changed much but I don't want to be stressed or plagued with anxiety anymore, but thank you all for being kind and respectful in the comments.

While its primary allure lies in promoting cooperative play and large-scale operations, these aspects often result in players facing long queues or frequent disconnections. Additionally, the player-built equipment feature, which emphasizes real costs and logistical strategy, is undermined by tedious tasks rather than the in-game resources. For example, loading a freighter with supplies requires 40 non-idle minutes of constant clicking every minute, while loading ammo into a tank is a slow, manual process. Despite ongoing tweaks aimed at balancing artillery, tanks, AI, and other elements, it appears that these adjustments only serve to preserve stalemates. Most wars seem to be decided by whichever side gets bored first, highlighting a significant gameplay issue.

Furthermore, the prevalent problem of players purchasing the game multiple times to create alternate accounts, known as ""alts,"" solely for the purpose of team-killing exacerbates these issues. Their malicious actions not only erode motivation to engage with the game but also render hours of dedicated progress futile for legitimate players. This rampant exploitation of the system by cheaters undermines fair gameplay and leaves the community feeling powerless and demoralized.

          Rampant server issues prevent even the smallest groups of invaders from getting into certain regions by sea. Imagine spending hours of your time collecting materials to construct the largest and most formidable ships only to lose them because your crew has been disconnected from the server leaving an empty ship in enemy territory. To add insult to injury, the ship is now too close to the region border to deploy from the home region (sometimes you do appear where you were before disconnecting, but this rarely happens), making it impossible to re-crew the ship after a mass-disconnect.

          At the time of this review the developers have known of these persistent issues for multiple weeks, yet nothing is being said or done about it. This game is amazing and I cherish the people I've met and the experiences we've shared playing it and I would love to leave a positive review for a game that has so quickly captivated me with it's shear breadth of content.

          However, these issues prevent an entire branch of a factions military from being used in it's current state.

There are many a time when events in the game make you smile, cry, feel anger and more.

However, as of the update Inferno from 2022, I began to see flaws within what the Developer calls their VISION. This VISION has been drifting away with what the playerbase wants and enjoys. It is not helpfull at all even that the people making this game barely play or even fully test the game/sever.

A two week public testing in a more simulated way, does not prevent what the main playerbase does.

However, the issues from Inferno, being bugs and connection issues, have gotten worse with the Naval update.
This manifests itself in people spending hours and days gathering resources only to then have connection issues and seeing the items crafted either die due to said disconnection or worse.

As of this review, any larger Naval OP done by players (which is not withstanding a speedboat with 1-3 people on), gets thrown out of the server. But the assets still move over the borders into another ""hex"" or ""server"".

In good conscience to people their time and effort... Combined with the Dev-team being near utter silent on gamebreaking bugs such as but not limited to:

* Seaports Inventory breaking
* Ships disconnecting
* Mass disconnections during Operations
* Server crashes causing structures to respawn in
* Entities when destroyed able to delete entire units of the map
*...

I can NOT recommend this game. Whilst still playing due to addiction. To people who value a Developer that listens to their customers. Siegecamp is not that. Not untill they address these issues in a professional and composed way.

Save yourself your money, or buy it at least during a sale... No matter how tempting the game is.

I have to start this review by saying that every few months, I come back and have fun. Then, two weeks later, I get reminded why I stop playing this game for months at a time.

Some context: I work full-time in education. I come home exhausted and want to play a fun game for a couple hours before I go to bed and have to repeat the whole process. I WANT Foxhole to be that game, and in many respects, it is so, so close to BEING that game. Time after time, though, I am reminded that Foxhole is not for people like me. You know, the working class. Get ready for a small essay of a review below.

I find the combat mechanics frustrating. I echo some other reviews where you will go up against a veteran player who has managed to figure out how to button mash WASD while also keeping their aim very stable. It is incredibly frustrating to play against one v one. I have seen squads of four players fall to one person using this strategy. Call it a skill issue, I call it discouraging to new players wanting to get into combat. The re-spawn times drives the stake in completely. Why am I punished for 40 seconds, only to potentially get shelled and have to then wait even longer, upwards of a minute or more to get back in the game. Hell Let Loose makes you wait no more than 50 seconds, and it's often not even that long.

That's not even coming close to my largest complaint. I found combat frustrating, so I went to the back-lines to do logistics instead. I find the process of logistics in this game incredibly fascinating and, for at least a week or so, fun.

However, in no other game have I considered installing a TV in my room above my desk for the sole purpose of playing a different game while playing Foxhole, because if you want to gather resources for you and your friends to be able to play (say to build a tank or some jeeps), the game is quite frankly disrespectful to your time. I just weigh my mouse button down with a stack of taped together quarters and play a round of golf in Switch Sports, just waiting and hitting metal with a hammer. ""Use a sledge"" - Yes, the sledge is faster. I still am just sitting there, positioning my player in the middle of several resource nodes while it takes slightly less time to accumulate resources. ""Use a harvester"" - Oh boy, am I going to lay down some fun facts for you, if we want to pretend that driving a slow, tracked vehicle around nodes of salvage (or worse, components) is fun.

A Harvester takes 90 Processed Construction Materials and 25 Assembly Materials IV to create. Don't know what those are? Tutorial Island certainly won't help you. As an honest reply to the insane number of materials you need to recall if you decide to make buildings, just ask for help in the chat. The wiki is somewhat out of date and there are no official resources, but the community really can be the best part of this game and most people are generally helpful. Ignore the turds that talk down to you or mock you for not knowing - stupid people exist everywhere.

Back to the problem at hand. Let's ignore the time you need to set up and upgrade the facilities and buildings you need to make these items and just look at the amount of time it takes to create one single harvester.

One Processed Construction Material takes Three Construction Materials and 20 Components. You need 90 in total.
--- One Construction Material takes 10 Salvage to create.
----- 10 Salvage can be obtained with two hits of a Hammer or one hit of a Sledgehammer. Approx. 5 seconds, either way.
--- Two Components can be obtained with one hit of a Sledgehammer. Normal hammers do not work; You must wait a few days in game for player to collect the necessary materials to ""discover"" Sledgehammers. The only other way to get Components is through a Component Mine. Assuming you find one that's not being hogged by other players (and this is a genuine struggle), you can get nine Components every 30 seconds. 30 every 30 seconds if you have Petrol to fuel the mine with, which, again, is hard to get sometimes. All of this to say that getting 20 Components takes about 30 seconds, either way.

One Assembly Material IV takes One Processed Construction Material and 66 Litres of Heavy Oil. You need 25 in total.
--- (Look above for how you get one Processed Construction Material)
--- To get 90 Litres of Heavy Oil, you need to go to an oil field, build the appropriate buildings (with upgrades), then refine 150 litres of oil to 90 litres of heavy oil. That process takes 2 minutes and 40 seconds, not to mention the resources needed to power the buildings.

Wondering how long that all takes? For the 25 Assembly Materials IV, it takes 45 minutes from one of these facility buildings, assuming you already have the Processed Construction Materials. Those 115 Processed Construction Materials (90 + 25) take 1 hour and 15 minutes. You can do these two things in parallel if you have the buildings, of course, but it takes time to make those buildings. So, we will call it at about 2 hours to make a single vehicle that helps make one aspect of gathering resources slightly faster.

I ask you, reader, genuinely, do you think that this entire process is respectful of people's time? I don't. I would change my tone completely if the process were more engaging for the player to partake in. Some mini-games would go MILES and turn this review from an essay length negative triad to me just saying ""haha hit metal make gun"".

""Join a Regiment"" (this game's version of a Clan) - Fine. That might work for some people. Clans often times ask their members for a certain number of items to be produced at a factory or for them to gather a certain amount of material before you go off and do what you want to. That's not why I play a game. I play a game to hop in and have fun. I'd rather just play Overwatch 2, and I hate that dumpster fire, but at least it respects my time.",1664859125,1707605201,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why? I've clearly got a fair few hours in this game so surely it cant be that bad

Well, its not, its actually quite enjoyable at times. Working together with other people to accomplish a victory be it with lumbering armour, large cannons or just well coordinated infantry , is a neat experience.  You can interact with some swell folks and the game has a truly passionate community.

[b]So why do i say neutral trending towards negative?[/b]

The community combined with the current issues (perhaps they'll be fixed soon, but this review is for the now). 

[b]I'll start with the issues. [/b] Server connections in this game can be *really* iffy and due to how this game works, that can have a MASSIVE impact on the war (if you cant connect to a server reliably, you can't exactly contest the region). 

Part of the issues with this game are the developers, as unfortunate and wrong it feels to say that. They're clearly passionate about the game and put out some truly incredible content, but they seem to focus almost too much on new content, flashy tanks and large vehicles. They put out updates about 4-5 times per year  and  i shit you not this is pretty much the only time they balance anything outside of [b]exceptional[/b] circumstances. This means that if they add a new piece of content that throws the game balance completely out of wack, it is not unreasonable to expect it to take half a year or more for them to rectify the issue. (examples include the Warden heavy field cannon and Colonial superheavy anti-tank gun). The balance changes made also tend to be very large and almost like a sledgehammer being used to adjust a delicate piece of equipment. (the community probably doesnt help here to be honest, both sides fight like lunatics to prove that they are actually victims of poor balance and the developers should buff them and/or nerf the other side)  


Another part is the developers being silent, Granted i admit that i wouldnt want to interact with the games community either (see below), but they seem to be almost allergic to any sort of communication.  In response to the above mentioned server issues the response was ""yeah we know and we'll fix it next update probably"" [paraphrased] . This is incredibly rare. Normally they say NOTHING at all in regards to anything, which also feeds into the next issue:

[h3]The community[/h3]
There are so many great people who  are truly delightful to interact with, but there is also what seems to be a not-insignificant amount of quite loud and toxic people. Exploits are common in this game due to the above mentioned dev-silence and a fair few of the people outside the game itself (eg: on the reddit, discord etc.) are just unpleasant to talk to. 

The community has also been largely left to moderate itself and the end result is just....disappointing. People will actively ignore people exploiting or otherwise partaking in shitty behaviour for the simple fact that they are on the same team. That same person might then turn around and demand a permanent ban for someone doing similar shitty behaviours on the opposite side. 

A good idea, executed relatively well and clearly worked on by a passionate developer team,  marred by the developers refusal to even state what is considered an exploit, and by a playerbase left too long to its own devices that at this point seems to only care about winning an imaginary war (winning wars does nothing but let one side say they've won X wars btw.)  by any means necessary.

War 110. 
Wardens tried multiple times to Naval invade a hex called Fingers. However when crossing the border. The players disconnect and the battleships and gunboats are destroyed by colonial players that QRF the invading force. 
Devman says it is looking into the matter, but then do not communicate or fix the issue for weeks. 
As a result, one side is unable to contest this hex and the other side is allowed to fortify it, set up storm canons and a nuke site without the Wardens able to counter it.

Now the nuke site becomes active and targets a major logistical hub in the hex Endless Shore.
But the local seaport breaks and a large part of the Warden players are unable to access their stockpiles within the broke seaport.
It gets mass reported to the bugs channel and the devs respond with.

Since they added ships to the game, server issues and disconnects have become such a massive issue. Taking a ship across a border causes the entire crew to disconnect. There is literally no way to do offensive play with large ships because as soon as you try to move to a front the game breaks and you lose everything that you worked hard for. I miss playing with my friends but the devs made it genuinely impossible to play. 

 Im updating my review to negative because 5 months and several hundred hours of play time after the ""1.0 full release"" It's quite clear the developers do not care for this title. Its an MMO with tens of thousands of active players across the world but the developers offer zero community feedback and almost zero active moderation of the actual game. Cheating and hacking are current rampant, to the point that it destabilizes the flow of the game and is causing many people from both sides to quit. The game is also still flooded with bugs and glitches which are often used as exploits to aid various cheaters. I would say that if you managed to pick up this game a year ago, it would be the best game you will ever play in your life. Now its just a buggy, grindy mess full of cheating. Until the developers do something to combat the constant alting and griefing this game will continue to slow and will probably end up finally dying. 




Probably the most fun I've ever had with an online game. The negative reviews for this can be pretty absurd. The only time I see group vote bans happening are because the person getting banned is being a tool and generally deserves to be banned for being toxic. The weapons balance issue is really only a massive issue if you are overly obsessed with the whole game and the results. 1.0 is coming out soon so I highly recommend jumping into the game know and getting to know the hilarious community before things get crazy.

Being bullied in a game is not what I enjoy. Im 37 years old and im the one being called a kid by some no life losers. Im done with this game. Deleted it off my account which is too bad, because the game is fun, but like any other MMO the community sucks!!!

Edit:

I have decided to change my review from negative to positive. The original review is kept below and it has not been altered. You can consider it as a sort of first impression.

Everything bad i wrote still holds true. The game has issues, but after playing for an additional 120 hours making a total of 221 hours I felt it would be unfair to downvote the game. In spite of all the bad stuff I wrote about the game, in the initial review, I have just kept playing because the game is just a lot of fun. I don't think the game is for everyone, it is very niche, but if you are into this kind of gameplay then it really is something special.

End of edit.

So I have clocked almost 100 hours in this game over the past week and I have had a lot of fun and I think I will keep playing it for some time. If I could give the game a neutral rating I would have done so, but for reasons that I will get into I chose to give a negative rating over a positive one.

Like I said the game is actually fun, but as you get more and more into it, it's flaws start to become more and more obvious.

First off, there are cheaters in the game and there is no anti-cheat system in place outside of a reporting system. Reporting systems can be abused and I have heard other people claim, that the large clans are mass reporting people they don't like or agree with. I have no personal experience with this so I can't say if it is true or not, but most games that has clans and a reporting system seem to have this problem, so I guess it is reasonable to assume that the rumors are true.

There are cheaters that use auto-aim bots and hacks that increase their health, viewing distance, build speed, run speed and much more. I have my self seen many people flying above the ground while using a set of binoculars to scout. If you are far above the ground you can see more. There are so many ways to cheat this game, just go and make a quick search and see for yourself, what kinds of hacking software you can get for this game. You will see what I mean.

Another way of cheating is to buy a second copy of the game and make an alt account. This account is meant to be set to the opposing teams faction, so that you can move in their territory freely while sabotaging as much as possible. These people destroy vehicles and supplies, they basically grief the other players.

I have had a lot of connection issues. This is not a problem for me in any other game.

There are at certain times at the day a lot of queue time. When crossing from one border to another you are essentially going from one server to another. These servers are called regions. Each region has a max population and when that has been reached you must wait until someone leaves the region before you can enter. At peak times that wait time can be up to 20-30 minutes EVERY time you need to go into that region, which makes it unreasonable to run supplies to those regions.

I have clipped through the ground multiple time while trying climb a trench.

Often times when climbing rocks, you will find invisible walls that will glitch out you player character making him make a sort of weird dance. If he does that while the enemy is near you, you will die because you can't move or shoot. This has happened to me many times.

I don't know what the solution to the cheating problem is. I don't think it is a development issue. It is a player issue. However, the clipping, the queue times and the weird dancing glitch that happens when you climb rocks I feel like are issues that the developers should have fixed before a 1.0 release.

These are just some of my thoughts about the game. The game really is a lot of fun, but I am left with a bitter taste only because it could be so much better.",1680707256,1707067020,False,0,0,0.618866086006164551,1,True,False,False

I have almost 8k hours in the game even though the majority of that is idle time and I will admit I have definitely got my moneys worth out of this game.

However, over the past two years the developers have shifted in a direction that doesn't respect the players time.

And the best way for me to demonstrate this is to walk through a very common process that is required which is refueling salvage mines.


[h1]Before the release of Foxhole 1.0 this is generally what the process was like:[/h1]

[list]
[*] Go to a garage. Build a fuel truck using basic materials.
[*] Drive over to a refinery, access the refinery from the front and pull diesel.
[*] Drive over to a salvage mine, lock the truck, Hit the refuel button on the salvage mine.
[*] If an empty fuel truck was already sitting at the salvage mine when you arrived. Drive it back. If not, you can go back to home region and spawn somewhere else.
[/list]

[h1]After the release of Foxhole 1.0 this is generally what the process is like:[/h1]

[list]
[*] Go to garage. Build a flatbed using components. Unlike basic materials. Components are harder to acquire.
[*] Drive over to the construction yard and build a fuel container with basic materials.
[*] Package the fuel container, get into the crane and pick up and place the container onto your flatbed.
[*] You now can drive to two different places for fuel:
	[*] A. Drive over to the refinery. Get into the crane and pick up and place the fuel container onto the loading dock. Pull diesel.
	[*]  B. Drive over to an oil facility. Find the mobile crane or structure crane. (if the facility doesn't have either of these you need to build one at a nearby town hall or relic). If they have a crane pick up and place your fuel container next to the small train rail. Use the small train car to pull petrol into the liquid transfer rail car and then transfer that fuel from the liquid transfer rail car to the fuel container. If they don't have this setup, place the fuel container onto the liquid transfer station (if they have one) and pull fuel (which takes about 10x longer then the first process I explained).
[*] Alright, were almost there, just hang in there. Now get back into the crane, repackage the fuel container and put it back on your flatbed.
[*] Drive over to a salvage mine. 
[*] See if the salvage mine has a nearby mobile crane or structure crane. (if the salvage mine doesn't have either of these you need to build one at a nearby town hall or relic).
[*] Get into the crane. Pick up your fuel container. Place it next to the salvage mine. Get out of the crane. Unpackage the fuel container. Hit the refuel button on the salvage mine.
[*] Drive your flatbed back to nearby storage/seaport and put it into your reserve. That thing cost components and you will want to save it.
[/list]

Notice how the process went from 4 steps to 10 steps and if you need to build cranes you might as well take those 10 steps and make it 12-14 steps.

I honestly wasn't sure if this game would be right for me, I saw the tiktoks and other creators praising this game and showing off unreal battles but I was just not sure I would get into it. I say that only because I thought it would be difficult to insert myself with such a niche community and that I would end up only playing solo. I was wrong.

The foxhole community showed me the ropes with anything I wanted to do or learn about, they answered all my questions about the game without hesitation and random players would stop to ask if I needed help when I clearly did not know what I was doing.

On paper this game ticked all the boxes for me: large scale map, multiple battlefronts, multiple branches of combat, REAL LOGISTICS, communication and coordination like I haven't seen before and lastly a unique art style and set piece.

In my time playing I have almost exclusively played logistics, as it makes you feel important, that you're contributing to the war machine and without players like you the war is lost. I loved thinking about how the bullets, weapons, bandages, artillery pieces and materials that I ship to the front via truck or boat will eventually be used by another player to help win the engagement. That is a level of immersion I haven't felt. Seeing players roleplay basebuilders, factory workers and seamen makes me really happy because it shows the games unique roles are all being filled by someone.

There are several roles I have yet to play that I'm excited to jump into like being a crewman on a battleship or tank, joining a massive assault on a town, mass producing bigger equipment and building my own base. This is the ultimate sandbox that offers a playstyle for anyone interested in the genre.

I find terribly intriguing with question  what mark foot and his Dev team see ""VISION"" for the future of foxhole. As you just read Devs never really explain in live streams but once a blue moon why changes happen through out Foxhole Development. This consequence results in a recent example , wardens won WC 105 to WC108 and mainly due to facilites clogging up meta areas. Like for one example a clan named ""RST""  didn't help build defenses on the Bulwark and should've knew weeks ahead of time. But during WC 108 everyone wanted to make a dry dock with facilities which lead to the worst highlight  of colonials at the time. If you try making a facility without any defenses clans especially Chinese and Russian clans will kill and pillage everything you got. Even if you knew yourself and knew to make a amazing conc base that takes a week almost to make you still have to deal with theives. I have for one stolon before but out facilities that decay which costs Msupps. Mupps are what prevent decay and with Gsupps and bunker supplies gone its the only way to prevent your base decaying. many players make too many bases in sub region an a hex is considered a steam server (they all are) and what happens is you are forced to pick up a part time job keeping you base alive because of players adding to the Msupp cost to very good to very poor. Most hexes give you this no matter what anyways which makes question what seigecamp was looking in their ""Vison"". Now for some regular foxhole negative highlights. Alting and deliberate sabotaging in each faction is still a thing in 2024. border bases that suck ass that was only ""temporarily use"" still used over 3 years now. Clans mass reporting individuals without real admins putting up sits before a ban is issued is still a problem. Night and day cycle still feels like a light switch you turn up and down. Tank warfare against infantry is point and click still. One faction is either unpopped and ques of one hour or more still a thing. ZERO QOL so far even though promised during 2023 year. Having to go into a region to just mute someone is poor QOL on communications.Artillery making no mans war which makes buildings built on a arty stain on the ground take double damage is still a thing and is dumb.

During the combat areas, it was even less helpful. I have seen more polite players in League of Legends to be honest. 

The forums are about as useful as t*** on a nun, and when you do find one that seems helpful, it is in relation to a game four or five patches ago. So again...t*** on a nun.

Its a shame, really. The concept is great, the graphics are beautiful, the UI is not overwhelming, and the tutorial is pretty good (when other players are not being complete idiots and trying intentionally to ruin the experience) and I just really wanted this game to be enjoyable.

Most war games only lets you experience the forefront battle and nothing behind the scenes as your always just play as the soldier with their gun shooting enemies until one side has more points than the other then restart and go again. With these games there is no constant struggle for dwindling of supply's and equipment while trying to push the forefront on scarce resources. 

Well Foxhole has another thing coming. In Foxhole your whole team of 100's of players will have to work together to supply your team with resources then build, buildings, warships, trains, tanks, weapons, first aid etc, with those collected resources. Then the other side of the team has to push the enemy back with that built equipment. Truly every roll in Foxhole is really important and no one is left out. Another thing I enjoy about this game is that the world is your oyster and you get to design and build defences like trenches, and bunkers like the pillbox bunker and a lot more. 

Honestly I can fall in love with this game... although there one issue that i want to bring to the table.
That is: You can not not remove your allies buildings: In Foxhole there will definitely be moments where you will run into ally constructions and say to yourself ""w*f is this s#*t"" because the buildings that are placed by your team are placed in such a horrible manner that you cant even squeeze you player model through it. Then the worst part is, is that you want to remove it and revamp it, yknow make it look better, make it function better. But no, no such thing as removing buildings in foxhole, you cant even remove it with explosives because then the game will ban you from using weapons for a short moment for 'friendly fire'???
I get it, its to reduce trolling and griefing but then what about the players who really want to make good logistics and defences. I just hope the devs will come up with something. 

I like to play foxhole with logistics with me building tanks and shipping them on a train to the front line... idk that s#*t just cool to me but fr i cant even support my team like that because there are so many ridiculous team buildings in the way.

But other than that i give it a 6/10 just because i cant really achieve what i want to do but still fun non the less and I think you will enjoy this game too.",1706179463,1706179463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Foxhole - A Tactical Warfare Odyssey Review (7 Hours Played)[/h1]

[h2][b]Review:[/b][/h2]

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ

Foxhole, with 7 hours of intense gameplay under my belt, is a tactical warfare odyssey that demands strategy, coordination, and unwavering determination. This persistent world war experience offers a unique take on multiplayer warfare.

[h2][b]Pros:[/b][/h2]

[h3][b]Persistent World:[/b][/h3] The game's persistent, player-driven world sets it apart. Battles have real consequences, and the evolving map reflects the outcome of each engagement.

[h3][b]Teamwork and Coordination:[/b][/h3] Foxhole thrives on teamwork. Coordinating with fellow soldiers to achieve objectives is not just rewarding but essential for success.

[h3][b]Player-Crafted Economy:[/b][/h3] The player-driven economy adds depth. From manufacturing weapons to delivering supplies, every role contributes to the war effort.

[h3][b]Strategy and Tactics:[/b][/h3] The game encourages strategic thinking. Planning and executing successful offensives or holding crucial defensive lines are immensely satisfying.

[h3][b]Community and Communication:[/b][/h3] The Foxhole community is dedicated, and communication within the game is vital. It fosters a sense of camaraderie among players.

[h2][b]Cons:[/b][/h2]

[h3][b]Steep Learning Curve:[/b][/h3] Foxhole is not for the faint of heart. Newcomers may find it challenging to grasp the complexities of war and logistics.

[h3][b]Time-Intensive:[/b][/h3] The game's persistent nature means that significant time investments are often required to make a substantial impact on the war effort.

[h3][b]Occasional Server Issues:[/b][/h3] Some server instability issues can disrupt gameplay, although they're typically addressed promptly.

[h2][b]Verdict:[/b][/h2]

With 7 hours played, Foxhole proves itself as a unique and demanding multiplayer warfare experience. Its persistent world, heavy emphasis on teamwork, and player-driven economy make it a standout title in the genre. While the learning curve can be steep and the commitment substantial, the rewards of meaningful battles and a dedicated player community are well worth it.

[h2][b]Recommended for those seeking a hardcore multiplayer war game, fans of strategy and coordination, and players looking for an immersive and persistent online world![/b][/h2] ü™ñüåçüõ†Ô∏è",1705927418,1705927418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the addition of some new content, the core design and technical issues remain. The tutorial remains unfinished, and many of the mechanics are not explained in game and probably will never be.

TL;DR Foxhole is a very unique game, with some innovative ideas for an MMO. Unfortunately, the execution leaves much to be desired, specifically when it comes to game design, technical issues, and community management/moderation. Therefore, I can't recommend the game in its current state as a whole to the gaming community in general, although some gamers may wish to try it just to experience the unique, albeit flawed, experience the game has to offer.

Foxhole has been my love hate relationship for years. I was originally attracted by the promise of a large open world team game with strategic aspects. As a fan of RTS games, I knew I was most interested in the logisitics side of gameplay. Making strategic decisions about which supplies to make, where to send them, etc. can be extremely fun.

The problem is, the majority of the gameplay is NOT spent devising strategies and making moment-to-moment tactical choices. Rather, at least on the logistics side, 95% of your time will be spent in the most utterly uninspired, grindy gameplay to ever be included in a videogame.

For example, gathering resources, which is the baseline activity needed to create everything else in the game, consists of driving (very slowly) to an in game location, then holding down the mouse button to gather resources until your inventory is full, then driving back, rinse, repeat.

It is incredibly tedious, it does not offer any interesting challenge beyond a sheer test of patience, and it is so boring that virtually everyone who does this part of the game has to have something else - a YouTube video, or a podcast - going just to keep them going insane from boredom. When when of the core mechanics of your game is so boring that people can't even engage with it without distracting themselves with something else, you have a pretty serious game design issue.

For me personally, the grind is the most egregious issue in Foxhole; it permeates everything, and it is obviously a very intentional design choice by the devs, but I personally think it's a pretty bad design choice. Not only does it not respect the players' time, but it increasingly requires so much grind that many tools and mechanics are effectively out of reach for solo players. So the game has become dominated by clans, and while that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world, if you are a casual player like me that doesn't like taking orders in a videogame, you are going to find it difficult to experience everything this game has to offer.

There are two other major issues besides the glaring flaws of game design itself. The first is bugs. Although the game is reasonably stable, there are still many bugs left to iron out. And because the game is so time-demanding, and punishing, even an infrequent bug can make the game borderline unplayable. A common example is for a player to spend a lot of time grinding resources, turning them into supplies for the frontline, loading up a supply truck, only to encounter a bug when trying to cross a bridge, or move from one server to another, that causes them to lose said truck. Boom, hours of work just disappeared thanks to a bug. You just wasted precious moments of your life grinding without even getting to enjoy the fruits of your labor. When the game wastes your time so blatantly like that, it's hard to stay invested.

The final big issue is a lack of moderation. Although moderation is not totally absent in the game, there are no dedicated moderators. And the grindy nature of the game makes it ripe for griefing. If you're playing a match of COD, and a teammate kills you a few times, it's nbd, you can just kick them from the server and that's that. But if a griefer in Foxhole takes all your stuff and dumps it in the river, that's hours of work that you will never get back. This leaves an extremely sour taste in the mouths of players, and it's arguably the number one reason for recent dissatisfaction with the game.

Having said all that, you may be wondering, if the game is so bad, why did I put in 1,000+ hours? There are two answers to that. First, the game is so slow paced and grindy that even just giving it a chance means playing it much longer than other games. This is not a game that lends itself to casual 30-60 min play sessions. Logistics in particular demands pretty huge investments of time. So I have more hours on this game than on other games that I have enjoyed considerably on the whole - because those games don't waste my time and allow me to get what I want out of the game much more quickly.

But more fundamentally, there is a strong dichotomy in Foxhole that is the root of my love-hate relationship with it. There is no denying that the game is innovative. There are very few games it can be compared to, and I might go so far as to say Siege Camp (the devs) have almost created an entire new genre of game. Parts of that experience - delivering supplies to the right base at the critical moment to help the defenders hold of a wave of tanks, or coordinating a large armor assault across a whole region - offer a totally unique experience. And when everything is going right, it can be almost magical. Unfortunately, these magical moments are buried beneath an absolute mountain of grind and downright terrible design choices.

If the unique aspects of Foxhole so intrigue you that you must try it, and there's no other games that can sustain your interest right now, give it a shot. In some ways it is worth experiencing the very innovative ideas that the game is presenting. But be aware that in terms of execution, this is a pretty ""bad"" game. The mechanics are unpolished, and the visual design is adequate but uninspiring. The devs are not super competent, nor super professional, and they don't communicate well with the community. They refuse to add microtransactions to the game, and while many may see this as a plus, I believe that for an online game it makes it harder to sustain and improve the experience in the long run, since you don't have ongoing revenue to support the game. For all of these reason, I can't recommend the game in its current state to most gamers.",1676398295,1705862818,False,6,0,0.513994574546813965,0,True,False,False

Cons - big clans run the show, going to one server shard (which means even more lag), and the community is one of the most toxic you'll ever meet.  

Buy or not?

Edit 1/19/2024:

I cannot further endorse this game. The issues Siege Camp either do not give a shit about or just cannot figure out how to fix are killing any hopes and dreams of wanting to play this game ever again. The main issue is their servers. When scheduled resets happen (every morning around 9AM CST) it pauses action and is SUPPOSED to freeze all players in place and then restore your position with all of your gear, vehicles, etc. just as it had been left then begin again after a timer to allow all players to return to the game. 

However, this does not happen. One side or the other will get ""connection errors"" and not be allowed back into the region's server essentially allowing the other faction to push, destroy defenses, wrench and steal vehicles, etc. UNCONTESTED. In the middle of a huge push where you're about to take ground and a reset happens? Welp you better hope you dont get the connection error or guess what? All your progress is gone.

With this, I will be changing my review from positive to NOT recommended. I suggest either getting this game on sale or catching a free weekend or some shit because spending money on this will let you have only so much fun until their terrible servers eventually screw you and your entire team.",1700656577,1705678902,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Foxhole is a great game, where everyone has to work together to make things happen. Everything from building trenches, to be a Medic on the battlefield picking people up under serious fire, and patching them up, so they are ready for battle again. But if you don't want to be on the battlefield, even Logistics has a key role to this game. Without people producing stuff. (guns, ammo, grenades og bandages) The war will be over. 

I have done everything from logistics to be a simply infantry. Everyone is friendly and are more than willing to help you understand the game. I have had a great experience and will gladly help if I meet you in the game. 

There is no limit to what you can do. 
Pick it up and give it a try! See you on the battlefield.

There are some positives and some negatives to this game. A positive is from what I have seen the community is very helpful in teaching new players how to play and most everyone on this game is pretty chill. The negative however is that if you play solo you can get very bored very fast. This game is really built on community and proximity communication. There's nothing wrong with that and the game itself is pretty unique with unique features that is a big positive. The issue I have with it though is that the aiming system is frankly just frustrating and makes the game not very fun to play if you play by yourself or get separated from your squad/regiment. I personally would really just like to see the aim steady much quicker than it currently does and just give players like one more hits worth of health. Randomized aim is frankly just pretty tilting and takes a lot of fun out of the game. If you're just looking to chill with your friends or find a good regiment there's still fun to be had, the game would just be much more fun with more of a skill aspect than relying on rng. I also think the negative reviews I've seen make a lot of sense. If you're a solo player and don't try to actively get involved with other people and tasks/strategies you will not have fun on this game. This is a game you are definitely going to want to communicate with other players in some way and probably will have more fun with if you look to join and communicate with a regiment on discord.

All in all it's a decent game for the comms and unique features/wars but you might have a hard time wanting to stay on it all day due to the low skill rng fights.

Logistics gameplay feels like a second job, even more so ever since facilities were added. Gathering basic resources (collecting scraps from scrap fields) is a point-and-click adventure. Takes too much time and work to build enough materials to fuel a frontline. No wonder half the bases are devoid of resources. Oh, wait, regiments hoarding resources is a second reason. Speaking of which:

Much of the content is only attainable by the monopolizing regiments who usually may not share their toys with outsiders. Why? They fear it'll be wasted by the ""simple minded randoms"". They hoard anything from mass-produced tanks down to simple Basic Materials. Therefore, the rest of the world is reliant on their local regiment feeling particularly charitable.

Big moderation issues regarding false report spams and alt accounts. Be careful who you cross, or you might get banned for doing nothing wrong. Don't expect the devs to help you about it.

When I got a PC in 2018 I was interested in foxhole but a friend said ""you got to watch out for early access games"" so I slept on it for a while. after a bit, I would see reviews saying the Foxhole community is extremely toxic. since playing I have to say I have NOT had that experience. Most players were more than willing to explain things to me and teach me about the mechanics. Sure every once in a while you run into an asshole but no more than literally any other game. 

I would recommend if you're new going straight to the frontline and getting some blood on you're hands. I mainly wanted to do logi runs and resource gathering but It's a good idea to just fight in a contested area to get use to the feel of the game and see how fun the game can be.

Game has many issues but it is still possible to escape into it.

The main negative about this game is that many times you might find yourself in a situation when after playing for like 6 hours straight in an active combat, you will get a feeling of not achieving absolutely anything useful towards your faction eventual win.

For example, you might die to static AI defences or spammed tanks bunch of times, you might even kill a few dozen of enemy infantry in the trenches. But after 6 hours frontline won't move a bunch. Enemy Static defences are still there on the high-ground. Nothing changed. So you feel that you, yourself accomplished absolutely nothing.

You might think, OK, in this case I will go build a tank destroyer or some big mortar to counter enemies. But guess what? Even if spend tons of hours crafting this things, bring them to front and shoot a bunch of times, enemies will just instantly repair the damage, and you still accomplished nothing.

In a typical FPS match you at least have your K/D ratio.

So, if you are a solo player like me, you myself, you must be aware of this side of the game.

Edit: However, even as a solo player it is possible for you to create entire industrial complex Factorio-style and manufacture trains and heavy tanks for others to use.

I coordinate with others nearby me, there are occasions I get invited to crew for armor, arty. or naval.  I do not play the backline or logi, I dont vibe with that bunch very well.  There is a lot of frustration in their ranks and they tend to take it out on each other.  

They occasionally throw shade at frontline players for not trying hard enough to ""win the war"" also but they are easily ignored.  There's 2 types in foxhole- casuals and tryhards.   I prefer the company of casuals is why I've been able to enjoy foxhole over 5 years.  The tryhards seem to be angry with each other much.  The frontline is mostly cooperation when someone rallies troops to a common goal.  There is a lot of humor on frontline comms.


Tho frontline can be played casual and doesnt always require a clan, things are better in clans this is a clan based game, but for frontline infantry clans are not a must if you enjoy moment to moment combat, open mic comedic larping, foxhole is a very satisfying war sim.  

There are annoying players and know it alls but over all infantry is open mic at a comedy club that I come back for and hear the multi national accents of other infantry nearby.  I'm very satisfied with the current population which in the past I was disappointed by low population but its been fine as of late.  

This isnt a shooter where you come in with FPS skills to play as lonewolf slayer tho that is possible with a lot of experience but it takes time to develop instincts and understand range and aiming system.  Its not an easy aiming system compared to FPS but if you are burnt out on FPS you might enjoy foxhole's combat.

If your a lil doomer baby who cries that every online game is toxic (which is somewhat true) or you refuse to network with other players and demand everything be developed for solo you wont like foxhole.

If you are a vet at war games and you dont let some occasional player static make you sad then you might like foxhole.",1545537312,1704661260,True,0,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,True

For everyone else, though, it's virtually impossible to overcome it without ridiculously massive investment for what - losing a stupid war? 

Don't forget - the community's not too fun, either. Teamkilling and trolls are common, and stealing vehicles is pretty common too. Want to get a tank to the front? Good luck! It's gonna be stolen if you leave it unlocked thinking others will 'help', it will disappear if you log off for a moment and leave it thinking it'll be fine, and then it'll just get turned to dust by the enemy anyways since they always seem to be better off. Good luck.

Oh, and here is another thing. So - the war is usually fought with second rate or third rate units and tanks. Not top tier artillery or tanks or vehicles, not top tier machinery or anything - those are stored up in caches and hoards on either team, held in by people who grind hours and hours... just to look at the thing. They spend hours and hours just to be able to say 'I made it' without actually realizing the whole point of the game - to use it. It's sad. 

I'm not gonna lie - mechanics wise, gameplay wise (occassionally) and resource management wise - it's honestly impressive. But it's like using a Rolls Royce to haul cow shit. The community is downright awful, they don't care for their team, and these so-called Regiments and Clans - well, they see their fellow Wardens as the same as an enemy Colonial, and vice versa.

there's no way to fix fortifications that were constructed wrong. there's nothing that teaches you how to build fortifications correctly. the result is people that want to help, but don't know how, and their mistakes weigh on the ones who do know how to build, and they are already on suicide watch.

click lock is a windows feature that you can use to help gather scrap without giving yourself an RSI. scrapping shouldn't be this bad: it feels like a placeholder system implemented years ago, and the devs have sunk into such a pit of mediocrity that while it was once slated be replaced with gameplay, they've since just said ""fuck it"" and consider the system done now.

in text chat, someone once said, ""I hate this system"" and several folks immediately replied with some variation of, ""which one, the tech system or the ai system?""

this game has problems, but so do i. i built a bunker base, stole enemy harvesters, crewed a tank, grated cheese, and had fun with artillery. and i'll never do it again because this game is designed to be miserable to play.

i've updated this review to confirm that the game is getting worse instead of better. it's been a couple of years and they've made a couple of updates, so i popped back into a war because i hate myself. they've convoluted systems that were already atrocious, i've experienced more gamebreaking bugs and crashes this year than the last time i played, server stability is remarkably worse, and the game balance is, to my fury, also worse.

back when i used to be among the screeching choir of players begging for game balance, the devs said ""we can't make reasonable decisions because we're still _gathering data_."" ladies and gentlemen, it is with disgust that i inform you that the devs are still _gathering data_. it's been years and all they've accomplished is muddying the waters with more stupid items and vehicles that no one asked for. they've hammered idiotic bandaid fix on top of bandaid fix for literal years now: it shouldn't be a surprise that their product is actual trash.",1676404360,1704496368,False,14,0,0.565415143966674805,0,True,False,False

If you're a fast paced action player.. spawn to a forward base and just shoot bad guys. BUT it's so much more than that nearly every aspect of a war is simulated in this game. ITS CRAZY! You can harvest materials on the backline and craft gear, vehicles, meds, ammo, etc. Or you can go to a dock make a ship and cruise around with 20+ people with a person manning every important part of the ship and unleash hell on other boats or the shoreline warfront.

However, you will find the base building to be unsatisfactory. Because you can build the best, and most indestructible base possible, and nobody will help you supply it. Worst of all, the infantry only care about ""pushing"". Noobs are constantly crossing bridges and taking territory they have no hope of holding. They can't be content to hold out, slaughtering enemies outside your fortified gates, and stock up. Nope, they gotta load up with gear, run past all your defenses, then die like idiots in wide open ground. Repeat that, until your base is drained of supplies. So, ultimately, the 20-30hrs it took you to build that base was totally pointless.

The facilities are also disappointing because of maintenance cost. When you first plop down a factory, you might be the only one in the area, so it's cheap to run. But, as soon as you get 2 or 3 neighbors, the cost to run the factory goes up by a factor of 3-4x. As a solo player, that cost will crush you. Because you'll spend a good 2-3hrs of your day just on maintaining the factory. It's fun for two days, but then it feels like a job. Even in a regiment, the workload is not easier. Now, instead of running logistics to support yourself, you're supporting X players in the regiment who don't want to supply anything.

Being a front line soldier is fun, for a while. But unless you are in a regiment, you rarely get to play with cool toys. Mostly, that's because this stuff has to be made by players, which takes factories, and bases to defend the factories (see above). Without access to cool stuff, you just take your chances with whatever someone has already stocked at your spawn point. You'll run to the front, die, and repeat. Maybe your push will be successful this time. But, the next time you log in, all those gains are gone, because nobody built a base to defend what you took.

My last game, Liberation Point was completely neutral and undefended for more than a real day. All defense has decayed away. Nobody bothered to take the point, rebuild the town base. Could've been done by a single guy in a jeep, with some bmats for the construction vehicle that was right outside the building. Instead, they spent all day fighting over the wooden bridge into Abandoned Ward.

There is nothing like this game. It's like a ww1-2 mmo where everything is up to you.

Want to drive a tank in a tank line with five or more other tanks, pushing into an enemy tank line? You can do that. 
Have a bunch of buddies who play? Want to do navy stuff? Build a Battle ship, and you and upwards of twenty other players sail that MF into an enemy harbor and absolutely level a city? You can do that.

It's not punished, not even by other players, it's just seen as an aspect of the game. It's this view on dying that also makes the community very friendly and helpful. They view new players not as a burden on their team, but an individual to shape and mold into the perfect killing machine.

I've been a solo through most of my play time and its now next to impossible to do anything without a large regiment. this problem has slowly been getting worse with each successive war and updates. the latest update (the naval warefare update) proves this really well. if you want to join naval ops you'd better be in a huge regiment because it would take a group of 10 people to even support the base needed to produce materials for the ships, much less build them. this update was aim solely at large regiments, and only reinforced the need for large regiments. the days of being a solo are all but gone. I've put almost 1200 hours into the game and it just depresses me when i load it up because i know no matter how good of a soldier, engineer, etc i am. i will never make a difference on the battlefield because getting even small tanks is a struggle, much less anything that will actually impact the state of the front. unless the regiments want to take land, its almost always a stalemate that goes nowhere. dont get me wrong, i love this game to death and have enjoyed many years of play, but the way the devs are taking the game really punishes solos or small groups of friends.",1704311613,1704311613,False,6,0,0.562447845935821533,5,True,False,False

This is an incredible game that brings together WW2-style themes and places it front-and-center as the MAIN focus: drive the enemy back and control their territory! This is accomplished through deep teamwork, synergy, and cohesion from logistics teams gathering raw materials, processing, and making weapons, ammo, fuel, and everything that ultimately 'fuels' the front line! I'm excited to see just how deep the teamwork goes! 

This game has a bit of EVERYTHING and ALL is equally important to the progress of your faction.  For all those people that like RTS-style games (ie: Company of Heroes), this game adds WAY more depth and complexity to every part of the game! From every gun to every round that's fired, every vehicle driven and the fuel that makes it GO, every tank, even the RESPAWN's of players to a base is supplied and fueled by other players. There isn't anything I've seen yet that isn't player made, supplied, and maintained. It is the WAR EFFORT from each player that fuels each battle and that truly helps maintain pressure on your opponent. Every person has purpose and helps make this game happen! It is TRULY a great accomplishment for the devs, their vision, and what makes this game tick! Yes, there is a learning curve. Yes, there's more to do than you have time for. However, your entire faction is counting on you to play your part! Learn to play your role. Grow to be great at it and teach it to others! HOLD THE LINE! There is a great community out there that wants to see you succeed. Spend some time in training and learn how ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER. Watch a few videos. Then GET OUT THERE and help your team! :D

I have always enjoyed playing supportive roles like MEDIC, ENGINEER, etc. This is a game that RELIES on those roles in an amazing way and truly makes a difference!

I can finally positively recommend Foxhole. While it still has some bugs, it seems like the developers are finally taking on more player feedback and actually making positive steps. Facilities still suck, and there needs to be an alternative to them rather than hoping another regiment in game will help you. But at least they're not absolute cancer to build and maintain anymore so long as you don't make your facility too massive.

Cheaters and alts still exist, but they don't seem to be quite as bad as they used to be even during the Naval Warfare update war of late 2023. If the reporting function doesn't work quick enough, if at all, at least the community seems to step up more to make those people's game experience go downhill. That's just how it has to be it seems. Chinese and Russian players by and large will still spend more time harassing their own team than fighting the enemy though. Exceptions exist, but still more progress needs to be made there.

Big ups to the devs for finally banning certain toxic streamers who were contributing nothing positive to the game or community by bullying other players and even encouraging cheating. Thank you!

For new players, please please PLEASE ask other players in game for help if you don't know what you're doing, especially when doing backline logistics, facilities, or trying to prepare a tank. People will help you, and happily! You just need to be willing to listen.


Old review c. May 2023
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

Despite the changes and attempts to fix the game with update 52, the game is still broken and spirit crushing to play. Alts and griefers will just find new ways to ruin the game and logistics is still a week long grind just to get anything above basic stuff. All the fun stuff is locked behind the 1.0 facilities still, which requires about 10 dedicated players to keep running, and finding any clans with a public or shared facility is a nightmare sometimes. Chinese and Russian players especially seem to spend more time killing their own team than the enemy.

The efforts by the developers have been too little too late, and it seems the game is dying. They seem to have moved on to working on Anvil Empires, which I expect to be plagued with many of the same problems as Foxhole. I've lost hope that this game can be fixed without going back to pre-1.0 and removing facilities, and I'll be avoiding anything made by Siege Camp at this point.

Old review c. Feb. 2023:
d0g sh1t game

In all seriousness, since the 1.0 Inferno release this game has become a second full-time job just to maintain your facilities and bases, depriving many players from being able to enjoy other aspects of the game. Sooner or later, you WILL get burned out from playing this. The main developers in Siege Camp have themselves admitted that they don't/barely play their own game because ""It takes too much time.""

Speaking of the developers, they do not listen to the community at all. Rather than fixing what already exists, they just keep pumping out new content in hopes of bringing in new players temporarily instead of assisting the existing player base. Very little is done about cheating/alting in game, with the common punishment for such things being no more than a 3 day ban, despite one act of cheating/alting could undo WEEKS of time and efforts from 20+ people. It's been getting so bad that since war 100, it's safer to shoot low rank teammates with Russian or Chinese script names and apologise later rather than wait until they do anything.

Because of the above, the game community has become incredibly toxic and territorial, as opposed to the more cooperative atmosphere of pre-1.0. It also doesn't help that a number of higher-profile Twitch streamers for the game not only encourage such toxicity, they engage in it themselves unashamedly. 

Faction balance is otherwise fine in my opinion. It is the game mechanics and development team that needs a huge shakeup. Until something major happens, the only thing saving this game for me is the amazing bunch of people I play it with. I wear my regiment tag with pride.

Siege Camp, if you ever read this. Stop adding crap until the game is fixed. Either fix the game yourselves, or bring in people who can.",1662320564,1704156533,True,0,0,0.542499959468841553,0,True,False,False

And honesly I hate the fact this game is not talked about more. In Foxhole you can choose how you want impact the war effort, from being in the frontlines and fight with 1000s of fellow comrades. If you do not like fighting don't worry you can do logistics only and still contribute in the war effort. You have to understand that everything in the game is player made from the guns, ammo , vehicles, and structures. This surely is one of the most unique MMO games I have ever played. although this game does not really drop below 20 euro, it is for sure worth 20 euro.

From my personal experience, the praises about this game are true: there are complex mechanics, requiring players to consider supplies to wage war as well as the limitations (and any gameplay-enabled advantages) on waging war.  For example, just about any type of supply has to be manufactured, and that would mean harvesting raw resources to be eventually converted into supplies. For another example, there are border bases that can be claimed at the edges of enemy territories, if only to surmount the problem of getting supplies into those territories and forming a beachhead in the first place.

Unfortunately, a steep learning curve mixed with lousy quality of life designs means that the inexperience of players, players' lack of ability to learn, players' short attention spans and language barriers, can adversely affect any chance of deriving any satisfaction from this game.

For an example of inexperience players inconveniencing everyone else, an unwitting player can build a structure in a location that should be clear, such as the front of a resource mine. (The area in front of a resource mine has context-sensitive coding that allows players to place resource containers for easy retrieval of resources.)

For an example of players' lack of ability to learn, there are players who repeatedly send supplies to the frontmost and newest forward base - which also happens to be the most vulnerable to being overrun - regardless of how many supplies that it already has.

For an example of players' short attention spans, there are players who just leave vehicles around, as soon as something else catches their attention and they leave to redeploy elsewhere. (""Redeployment"" in this game is a simple matter of despawning the player character and respawning it elsewhere.) These vehicles inconvenience other drivers at least, and at worst, they can be stolen by enemies that have sneaked past the frontlines.

For an example of language barriers, there are many people from different countries who are players on the same side; do not expect them to understand each other when they should for the sake of tactical coordination. This could be surmounted with skill built from experience, but until then, the barrier is an obstacle to instruct and teach each other.

Having said all that, there is now the matter of long-term gameplay in this game; the default game mode is ""Conquest"", a war that spans across multiple territories. Strategic decisions are necessary for either side to make any gains; these decisions won't come if players play alone and/or are incapable of strategic thinking.

For example, it can be very frustrating to watch another team fail to follow up on their otherwise successful thrust, e.g. failing to build a new base on top of an enemy base that has been cleared, even after its surrounding area has been secured.

If you have read up to here, chances are, you have read other reviews too. Some of these might mention the ""toxicity"" of the community of players in this game. This is unfortunately quite true, and it stems from all of the above.

Expect Western players to have a poor opinion of Eastern ones, and vice versa. Expect players to bring nationality bias into the game, and steal from other players of the same side to give to other players of the same side who happen to be of the same nationality. Expect experienced but bitterly burned-out players to treat new players poorly (e.g. suspecting them of being ""alts"", i.e. double agents currently playing with different accounts to sabotage the side that they are currently on).

In summary, if you are looking for a game that you can play with other people or against other people, this isn't it - unless you are somehow addicted to stress.",1703732379,1703732379,False,14,1,0.627200007438659668,0,True,False,False

No money, just a common pool of resources, and a big scary bad guy. The game has two major factions: The Wardens, and the Colonials. Each faction has it's own tech tree that is unlocked slowly as the war progresses, with different battle tactics that their commanders can call upon. This makes the game feel very immersive, since you really feel like the enemy is another country entirely. Foxhole takes place in a ""World War"" style universe, primarily influenced by the second world war.

[h2] Every player is just another soldier[/h2]
There's many ways to contribute to the war effort. You could grab a rifle and go shoot bad guys, or get in a tank with some friends, and shoot bad guys with a bigger gun. But the main pull of Foxhole is it's comprehensive logistics system. Every time you spawn, you use 1 Soldier Supply, and you'll probably grab a rifle, 2 magazines, and maybe bandages or grenades. All of those things need to be made and shipped to the front by other players, and that's just the absolute basics. Players also need to ship building supplies, maintenance supplies, artillery shells, even tanks and other armored vehicles. One of the most overlooked roles, however, is the role of the engineer. These guys are the guys digging trenches (PLEASE do not ONLY dig trenches at first, trenches by themselves are only any good in very specific situations), building bunkers, and even giant fortresses. Just grab some bmats, a hammer, a shovel, and ask where you're needed. 9 times out of 10, you'll find someone engineering.

[h1]Issue #1 - alting[/h1]
Alting is leaking information or griefing using an account on the other team.

Basically everyone and their cat has now been accused of alrting (myself included - on Reddit!) and while I think some of it may be overblown on both sides right now, it is happening. I don't know what kind of consequences the alting accounts face, but there are some things I feel that some things could've been prevented in a different way. Usually they drive vehicles into water.

For instance, there was an incident where a base got destroyed much more easily because someone added another piece to a bunker, creating a glaring weakness in the defences. This could've been fixed if there was a claim system in the game where alliances or regiments can lay claim to a certain area (and then have the community minus the claimants vote yes/no) after which that alliance is the holder of that area and no one else can build in it unless structures nearby are getting actively destroyed.

I've also found tanks parked in suspicious places.

[b]War 102 update[/b]
During the defence of The Baths, Drowned Vale, I had eyes on 6 griefers/alters + several other being reported in other areas.

[h1]Issue #2 - UI readability and mechanics[/h1]

The UI in this game needs so much work, a lot of this affects new players in particular.

Map - close to the edges of each hex on the map there's two different zones where placing buildings is increasingly costly and makes them decay. It would've been nice if the default map showed this. This can be fixed with a mod. New players also need to take time to recognise mountains on the map. [strike]You also can't see certain important player-made structures such as vehicle assembly stations or field modification stations.[/strike] This is now fixed.

Colours - it would be nice if you could make all enemies on the map appear as red regardless of side. I'm not colour blind, but when you're zoomed out it can be actually a bit tricky to discern blue mixed with other colours from green mixed with other colours. This can also be fixed with a mod, but should really be a game option.

Information - it would be nice if the menus specified limitations. For instance, you can build construction vehicles and cranes using hammers (amongst a host of other things). What the UI doesn't mention is that this has to be done near certain kind of bases or landing ships.
It would be nice if tanks showed in their inventory what kind of ammo it takes (you can see it by getting into the gunner seat).

Inventories - it is difficult to read bunker inventories on the map because things are not colour coded and do not have text. Answering questions like ""does this bunker have bandages?"" takes more than a couple of seconds because everything is monocolour. There are mods that help this issue.

Gear confusion - unless you run around these things all the time, knowing which upgrade a vehicle assembly station has is difficult. There's five different kinds of assembly materials in the game, all with almost the same icon except for the type determining bit in the upper left corner of each. These could've been more easily distinguished if the UI had some colour or texture difference. Other names would've nice too such as ""oiled assembly materials"" or ""hardened assembly materials"".
It would be nice if the ammo type was listed on the icon of weapons - this isn't a problem with your side's gear, but what about looting enemy gear mid combat?

[h1]Issue #3 - bugs, glitches, and other annoying things[/h1]

There's a character recovery mechanic in the game (for when you crash/get disconnected), but you flip a coin about whether or not it works every single time. It feels terrible when you spend a long time getting somewhere only to disconnect and not recover when crossing a hex border.

Sometimes vehicles you grab from your private stockpile stop being possible to put back into said stockpile for no apparent reason.

There are places where you can walk straight through a mountain.

Climbing is a mess because it relies on the geometry rather than developer-defined areas where you can vault. This makes it incredibly inconsistent where you can sometimes get up rocks, sometimes not and the remnants of destroyed bunkers are sometimes impossible to climb out of despite being literally 40 cm high.

I've dismounted an AT gun and that has launched it forward (into enemy AT).

Just being near a moving tank will often kill you even if you'd be realistically bumped by it rather than crushed. Other times, vehicles (in particular half-tracks) can dance on top of infantry not killing them.

You can't cancel using a wrench.

You can't claim border bases unless you have no claimed areas in the hex. This leads to both sides purposefully not capturing areas to prevent border bases being available.

Friendly fire mechanics are not great. Say you steal an enemy vehicle and you try to get away, during the escape someone gets a sticky on you and you're now moving at 0.1 m/s through enemy territory, unable to go up hills. You can no longer reliably destroy that vehicle even if you had the means to do so because if you do too much damage to it, you might get flagged for team damage and get locked out from using weapons for 20 minutes.

As a partisan, the damage you do indirectly by dropping (recently stolen) enemy vehicles in front of enemy garrisons or into water is not counted nor are the resources you destroy counted. This makes gaining commends to give others as a partisan difficult.

[strike]You can't see who the last person (if friendly) to touch a vehicle was.[/strike] As of war 102, you can now see who touched it, but not which side that person is on. You can still effectively check that by trying to squad lock the vehicle (which will not work if an enemy took it) 

Sometimes squad locks on vehicles expire even while you're in the vehicle, meaning that when you get out you may have a situation where you both can't get in, nor use a wrench to unlock the vehicle, but the enemy can. [strike]Additionally, even if you're in the squad that has access to a given vehicle through a squad lock, it must be your currently active squad for the vehicle to be accessible.[/strike] This is fixed, but you can sometimes end up locked out by making a vehicle public while locked even if it is your lock.

I've been booted out of the game several times and completely unable to return to my position. Usually that should be possible. This is often an issue when Valve does maintenance on their servers.

Honestly, just give us a health bar in vehicles already with the thresholds for being damaged etc. marked. Some tanks can be repaired from inside and as long as the repairing person has materials, they can tell the rest of the crew the damage state, run out and I don't think you can anymore.

Also, why can 12.7 mm damage some buildings, but not 20 mm shots (that can actually destroy tanks)?

This game desperately needs an in-game view of resources and their sources as well as vehicles and how to make them.

[h1]You seem to be enjoying this game though[/h1]

Yes. Which is why I really, really want these things fixed. I'll be happy if I don't see a single piece of new content for a very long time if they just polish up the game and fix the above issues.

The game right now has a really steep learning curve that needs fixing and basically the only way to play it in an enjoyable way is to join a regiment.",1676645148,1703630136,True,0,0,0.617730438709259033,0,True,False,False

Save your $30 dollars. Although I enjoyed it for what playtime I have logged, I cannot in good conscience, recommend another person to pay for this game.

Okay, let's roll with it. It's hardcore, I get it. But it's too confusing, like for example - 

- You have levels, but the game doesn't even teach you how you progress them. So I wasn't able to figure it out at all.
- Shooting is wonky, as you get a line of sight, but even when you're prone, it's hard to aim and get shots where you want, as a line of sight becomes red in every possible way. (I did basic training, where it explained how to shoot, move, etc. but it's still hard and needs a lot of practice I guess)
- Squads didn't even work for me, as I joined the most populated war area at that time, there were only two squads open with 4 people and nobody even spoke there or gave any commands. As all other squads were locked I could not join them at all. So I was roaming confused as to what to do. Was running in covers and to sounds of action, where I didn't even understand what to do or where to shoot, or run. You have only a compass on you, without any indicators of where to run or what to do. The big map was also confusing af.

I did watch a basic tutorial on this game which was on the main menu of the game. It helped a bit before I started to play. This game needs a lot of practice and has a learning curve, it is hard for newcomers. And I just didn't feel like digging all the tutorials for this game, to just learn and understand what to do there. Maybe for someone this game is exactly what he looked on to. But that's not me.

I've done everything from fighting to construction and logistics. It is not fun.

Firstly, the controls suck. They made looking on the 2d plane occluded by 3d objects, making it a pain to target an enemy on the other side of a tree or rock and requiring crazy mouse movements to do so. You also don't see into buildings in the only plane that matters to you, which is the one on your elevation, unless you are a foot's way from a wall. Even then, you might just have to enter the building to actually see inside of it, but good luck with that. You're probably going to end up dead by enemy gunfire from people that can see and shoot you, but you can't see and shoot them.

You want to autorun?
Use an external program.
Build anything?
Use autoclicker lest you wring out your mouse.

UI Response to the events also sucks. If you get damaged, there is no indicator that you have been damaged unless you take a very close look at your character in a lit area, and even then it's hard to tell. Status effects don't tell you what to do, so have fun figuring that out on your own. You could try to ask in chat or vc, but you may or may not get an answer unless you find someone nice.

There ain't a good way to do logistics, much less even move around. Players are limited to existing in hexes instead of a better seamless transition between space because the game is not designed to properly handle players transitioning between areas in such a way, even going out of the way to prevent to many players of one side existing on the same hex.

On that point, everything is already priced in by already existing guilds. You're definitely not going to set up a factory somewhere since you won't get any space, and you're definitely not going to gather any meaningful resources to affect the war. God forbid someone claims an unused clan technical lest the grudge reports be loosed and you get suspended for a while. If you're not banned from the game from your teammates, you'll probably make a small base that's well defended by AIs. The only issue lies within a large enemy clan simply waltzing in with 80+ mammons (high explosive grenades) and twenty guys to trip up the AI and blow up your base immediately. It doesn't matter how many guns you have if they are unable to fire as the AI cycles through targets to kill, but ends up hurting none.

On that point, constructions. This also sucks. Because the terrain changes when trenches and bunkers are built, the system isn't tolerant enough and you have to 'blueprint' the entire base to make sure it can fit. The algorithm behind it is too rigid to be used without quite a lot of finagling. Additionally, you cannot delete or modify the tops of bunkers once built. You have to destroy them with mammons, and that'll end up with your weapons being locked. Any time you cycle through build tools, you'll also be kicked out of the build menu.

This also reminds me of the inability to choose what goes in your primary or secondary slot. Shovels and hammers take up the same slot, the primary one, as well as any form of weapon. If you want to dig a trench, you'll have to make do with a crappy sidearm. Any good weapon, such as submachine guns or rifles, will always take up the first slot. And you have to keep in mind, the one who shoots first wins in these engagements. You simply cannot compete a rifle with a sidearm.

This reminds me of another gripe, the lack of an explanation on anything. You'll get a tutorial on how to move and shoot, and that's it. Go talk to others to learn anything else. That'd be a good idea, if the other players even knew the ins and outs of the game. As I've heard from other players, most of the data known about the game, such as construction, is data-mined because zero information is provided about the stats of buildings. You'd think having a low structural integrity would make a bunker easier to destroy, but it fact it only makes the bunker only a little harder to destroy with each piece you talk on. This kind of game design is counter-intuitive and needs to be explained by the developers, not data-mined by the players.

The game is not even optimized, causing many lost frames and freezes when using binoculars and when environmental effects like rain come into play. Keep in mind, I'm on a Nvidia 1660 Ti GTX and this should not be happening. I develop on UE5 with this machine doing crazy things and I rarely lose frames in this manner. This of course, is only a small point and I digress.

Steam would not refund me for playing this game for 30 hours, which is barely any time spent in this game.

It strikes a harmonious chord between overly realistic simulation and action-oriented combat. There is really something for everybody in Foxhole, as everything that is used to fight has to be made by the players, and the roles you take are really up to your imagination.

There are flaws with the game, but the developers do spend a lot of time seeking resolutions to these problems. However, there are two issues which just seem to be amounting and would have to take some drastic changes in course to resolve.

The first is the widening seesaw of balance the game sees as larger, more exciting content gets added to the game. This results in victory streaks that last up to a half of a year (yes you heard me right). One of the largest regiments even had to swap sides to throw it off with intentions to prevent nerfs. While victory streaks have existed in Foxhole for a long time, the duration of the wars has only increased consistently as the map expands with newer content.

The second is the direction that content is heading; the recent major Naval Warfare update mainly featured large ships that only the largest of regiments could make and field, leaving a very disappointing update for the vast bulk of the player base. Going from just gunboats for years to reworked gunboats alongside destroyers, submarines, and battleships is sort of like if only tankettes/scout tanks existed for years in the game and then suddenly battletanks and supertanks were added, without ever seeing any medium or heavy tanks added, except to an even greater scale. I find this to be a major misstep in the development process and think it has a lot more to do with marketing than anything else, as less than two months in the average player count is already down to a third of what it was earlier when the major update hit, showing that retention is lacking because the content is just not for the players.",1597945855,1703177128,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This top down war ‚Äãgame put‚Äôs players on the same giant server, where each side battles it out to gain ‚Äãterritory and ultimately win the war. The main selling point of this game however is the ‚Äãsense of scale and purpose achieved within the game.

Foxhole‚Äôs design philosophy is to create a large map with a grid system, and instances ‚Äãare created for individual grids which contain every player nearby. This allows the ‚Äãentire player base to feel a sense of comradery as they are all fighting the same war, ‚Äãwhile the actual game itself is able to save a lot of processing power due to this ‚Äãsystem.

The gameplay of Foxhole is so much more than your regular Battlefield or Call of Duty ‚Äãgame however. Combat aside the addition of a company based system allows players ‚Äãto create large groups on third party sites like discord, and coordinate large ‚Äãoperations together. The fully imagined logistics mechanic within the game provides ‚Äãdifferent play styles to just being on the front line, as every weapon, vehicle, bullet is ‚Äãcreated and transported to the battlefield by players. The sense of depth they have ‚Äãachieved through this system makes for a large scale strategy that is unmatched in the ‚Äãspace, as the biggest reason for losing territory is it‚Äôs neglect for logistics.

The combat however is the area which needs some work. The top down aim system ‚Äãcould do with more fine tuning, as often you will find yourself aiming at nothing or ‚Äãfiring in completely different directions to intended despite how long you gave the ‚Äãweapon to aim accurately. Despite this, there is such a unique form of enjoyment that ‚Äãyou get by pushing a bridge or objective for hours on end, and the proximity chat ‚Äãallows you to develop temporary friendships with players that have a common goal. ‚ÄãJokes and strategies can be shared across the mic, and teamwork can be achieved to ‚Äãsuch a higher level once people have heard the voice of their fellow players, and don‚Äôt ‚Äãsee them as just a pixel on the screen. One slight disadvantage worth mentioning is ‚Äãthat the community has created a merit based system, which blocks new players ‚Äãbehind a 100 hour wall before they are given access to some of the late game content. ‚ÄãWhile there are tanks and artillery in the game, aswell as sniper rifles etc; they are ‚Äãoften allocated by more experienced players to the most deserving on the team, ‚Äãrestricting newcomers to a basic rifleman. This experience can ultimately disway many ‚Äãplayers from sticking around for more than one battle (which tend to last around a ‚Äãmonth) as it often leads to constant corpse runs back to the front line after a gas ‚Äãgrenade or a machine gun caught you off-guard in an uncounterable way.

Foxhole is definitely a must-play for diehard fans of war games, and offers many new ‚Äãsystems to the table which feel fresh within the genre, but it‚Äôs the moment to moment ‚Äãgameplay which will keep this game as a neesh community of experienced players, ‚Äãand only those who want to really dig deep into it will ever experience everything it ‚Äãhas to offer.

Infantry has different styles for play from fast and aggressive to more slow place cover to cover with a wide array of weapons to use. Also from being a partisan's who go in the back of enemy lines to sabotage them. to being artery or a tanker. The fact every thing player driven from both side real help the game from being the same battle over and over again. Every thing is player made and from the ammo to the guns by back line personnel delivering the supplies needed for the front (Logie). To a really active community for player that work together so achieve a common goal to win the war that happening. To player made factory that produce tank,ships, to trains to faster get thing to the front. The war happens until one side win so it can go for weeks at a time. 
  
    Now the bad I had wanted to give the game a shot before i join a clan so i did a little bit of everything so see what i like to do. I had like the Logie side for making tanks for the front and stuff. So I had built a small facility to make tankets and armor cars witch took forever to get set up with coal,scrap,rations to keep it from falling apart. Also had to find a good spot to put it so way back to one of are traffic hub city's in the way back to keep it safe from partisan's. But that wasn't what i had too worry about. Someone from my side had stolen everything from it was so frustrating. I'm a better person so i gave it a another shot thinking maybe it just bad luck but it happened again someone on my own side sabotaged me and took everything this time even destroying some part of it. And i don't have the time to rebuild every other day for hours. Most people in the game are really cool and will help each other out. But for some random guy to trash hours of hard work for what nothing is a real pain. The game requires team work to win to work with others. But a few bad apples make the game awful to play for a solo or a clan to do all that work for some guy on your side to mess things up for everyone. Its not Rust not all for your self but it how some people play it an i ruins the experiences that game set forth of large scale team for for the greater good of your side.

The game is a mechanical mess, balanced terribly with minimal playtesting (this isn't pre-alpha anymore ffs) and is only held together by the incredibly dedicated playerbase who invest all their time and energy into keeping this persistant war going. 

Without the playerbase, this game would literally not work and from my perspective the dev team are not doing enough to make them keep playing (QoL is the most requested thing by far). Siege Camp loves to drop more content for the game, but below the surface all it does is to increase the amount of investment the average player has to put into to gain access to it. Burnout players are unfortunately the norm because this game is grindy as hell, and that's by design.

This game features only a barebone tutorial and there's no dedicated test enviroment apart from a very short time period when a new major patch is implemented, which only purpose is to iron out the biggest bugs and the most controversal of balance changes. The rest will just go live and the entire war becomes basically a testing ground with the playerbase as playtesters. The latest Update pretty much was so bad they had to implement an emergency patch it right after the first update war ended. That's how little confidence they got in their game, and they make the players work through that.

Mechanically, this game is janky and unforgiving.
Building is time-intensive, unintuitive and a big investment with little return.
Double that for facility buildings, which are a very controversal addition that would blow the scope of this review.
Maintainance mechanics which are poorly explained and commucated.
Couple that with the most barebones of commucation tools and you got a toxic cocktail going that causes a majority to fail and quit the game.

Speaking of lacking communicational tools, Siege camps offloads that onto the playerbase too which resulted in each faction having several hubs on 3rd party apps such as discord. Which is frankly ridiculous as we're expected to communicate in-game too as people have to claim territory for building. All of this results in unneeded toxic conflicts (especially at the start of a war) but the dev team has put exactly ZERO effort at improving this for crying out loud.

The dev's focus on adding more content rather than fixing this game underlying problems hasn't shifted in the 2 years I've played this game. The game was never even once in a polished state, It's unacceptable at the point of this review as it's been over a year since this game went out of early access. 

If you're only going for casual infantry/tank gameplay and join a clan to leech for their resources, you'll likely have a good time with Foxhole. If you intend to spend any more time/effort into foxhole to go deeper into the mechanics...

They've completely ruined any backline partisan work by announcing every single thing you do to the enemy structures and vehicles in chat. The enemy gets more information than your own team does for your actions.

For everyone else who is very invested and spend a lot of time setting up the infrastructure for you to have fun on the front, you will not have a lot of fun. Tons of hours can be tossed away by any random troll in minutes.

Foxhole transforms players into vital cogs in the machinery of war, placing them in the trenches rather than commanding from afar. With a staggering variety of roles, from front-line combat to logistical support, each hour brings new challenges and rewards, keeping the experience perpetually fresh.

The game fosters meaningful conversations and genuine connections among players, sparking discussions, plans, and debates in the pursuit of victory. It transcends being just a game; Foxhole becomes a platform for team building and strategic collaboration beyond the digital realm.

The persistent world map adds consequence to decisions, with wars unfolding over days or months, impacting the battlefield. Engaging in all facets of warfare with real players makes every moment matter. Despite occasional balance hiccups and technical challenges, the developers' commitment to improvement shines through constant updates. Foxhole isn't merely a game; it's an odyssey where friendships are forged, tactics are honed, and each invested hour feels like a step toward victory in the ever-changing theater of war.

Definitely not the type of game you will be playing solo in terms of getting your own gear, vehicle or base. This game will require you to use and share resources with the people in your team. Sure you can build your own base, vehicle and gear, but its going to require you quite a bit of time to do that since the game is meant to be multiplayer and not solo. 

If you prefer to just grab a gun and go, then this game is still a good option as you can just grab an equipment someone else made on the frontlines bases and just go to town. I do have to say that if you want to focus more on driving the fun armored vehicles or artillery pieces, then you might need to ask around, find a abandoned one, steal from the enemy, or try build one yourself as these assets are valuable to the war and can easily change tides if played right.

Overall I say its a good game, with a decent community. Definitely try it out if you want to actually play with people (Not just see people).

Raw materials are harvested to create manufactured goods which include the weapons you fight with, the vehicles you drive, the support buildings and infrastructure across the whole campaign map. This gives the game so many different play styles whether you're looking to jump straight into the front lines as a grunt, supporting soldiers on the ground in tanks and other armored vehicles or being one of the logistics men who put in the massive amount of work it takes to keep weaponry, vehicles and supplies going to the front lines. These are just some of the various aspects of gameplay that Foxhole has as I'm just barely scraping the surface. Foxhole has everything I want to see within the genre but I can't recommend that people should buy the game due to the community.

The in game experience is unfortunately failed by how the community chooses to act and play the game. While there are plenty of great clans and solo players that help make the experience positive, all you have to do when you launch in to your first war to see the problem is look at the global chat feed. It's nothing but and endless stream of toxic s**t about why certain people think teams are losing, alt accusations, players stealing resources etc. When you pick your side in the war (Wardens or Colonials) you will be locked into that faction for the remainder of the war after a period of time in game. It prevents players from simply abandoning ship mid war to ""win"" but also traps players on teams where certain clans will steal public resources and guard them for their own operations, certain players will simply just sabotage the team's operations because they want to troll or potentially are ""alting"" where they'll play as one faction to sabotage it to help friend's or clanmate's. While I really love what this game is on paper I'm harshly reminded what the actual experience is whenever I get the itch to reinstall and play. In the end Foxhole is a great game thats sabotaged by it's own players in the pursuit of victory in game.

- climbing anything is unresponsive and buggy
- spotting height differences/ climbing spots on rocks is near impossible
- top down view angles can completely block vision on things such as enemy players/vehicles/defenses EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE FULL LINE OF SIGHT
- aiming system is wonky AF especially when you have to aim up or down, basically hope the game gives you a good angle
- aiming when fighting with bare hands is ridiculously tedious even when you are literally touching the enemy THEY REALLY SHOULD MAKE IT CONNECT BETTER WITH ENEMY TARGET OR MAKE IT MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE OVER ALL (you do get animation locked for about a second when punching)
- IF you can land a hit with your bare hands it does a MASSIVE 50% damage on an enemy player MEANWHILE I CAN NOT EVEN ATTACK WITH A BLUNT OBJECT LIKE A SHOVEL, PLEASE DEVMAN IF YOU MAKE FISTS SO STRONG, WHY NOT MAKE ME HIT AN ENEMY WITH A SHOVEL EVEN IF IT DOES SAME DAMAGE!!!! THIS WOULD BE AN INSANE IMPROVEMENT FOR ANY ONE DIGGING TRENCHES
- since the naval update there is a new sound bug that affects 100% of the in game audio, making it unbearable to listen to and which forces you to restart the game to fix (a bit rare)
- since the naval update there is also another new audio bug where you lose all you audio from the game after entering a new region (happens almost every time i play, making the game experience super ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•)
- squad/regiment voice chat is even more unreliable than previous mentioned audio issue, making it totally useless.
- MG sound bug that melts your ear drums when a tripod MG gets destroyed while shooting
- anything mounted on a tripod will float in mid air if the structure it's placed on gets destroyed (really silly, can't imagine it's intended to work like that
- excessive team killing, happens often
- abusing alt accounts, for spying and sabotage
- lots of team griefing, it's quite easy to do
- (false) mass reporting, often by clans
- disagreements are often settled with guns, not with words, civil war is not uncommon
- poorly designed reporting system (innocents get punished/ true toxic players, team killers and alts get away)
- frequent theft of friendly vehicles
- squad locking anything just makes it worse for team mates while not being useful to the person who locked it in terms of securing the vehicle.
- you can't even lock bicycles
- some one locked a boat that's (only slightly) in the water? well good luck getting that unlocked again! YOU CAN NOT CROUCH IN OR NEAR WATER, YOU CAN NOT CLIMB ON TOP OF SMALL BOATS (EVENT THOUGH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS, I DON'T SEE WHY NOT) AND YOU ALSO CAN'T USE ANY TOOLS OR WEAPONS WHILE SITTING IN A BOAT (EVENT THOUGH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS, I DON'T SEE WHY NOT) LET ALONE IF THE BOAT IS MORE THAN JUST SLIGHTLY IN THE WATER
- when parking a gunboat next to a locked ironship, you can get locked out of selecting the driver seat of the gunboat and instead can only select the ironship if you end up in the wrong position.
- lots of toxicity, saltiness and white knight behavior from a large portion of the player base.
- the deployment map is not good at showing where people are needed on the front, especially confusing for new players
- map colors don't make sense half of the time, can't tell what you look at on map
- want to navigate the map while driving any vehicle that is faster than a snail? good luck! the mini map sucks and even the main map is not that much more better
- for some reason the nearly indestructible enemy maintenance hatches show up as defensive structures on map for no good reason, they actually have their own icon but only for your own faction, is this a mistake in coding !?!?
- so many chokepoints on the map that barely move that it becomes stale and boring quite fast, only a few fronts available with more move options
- map design on a macro perspective is quite bad, once one side makes an initial breach breach past one of the main choke points it's a downwards spiral for the opposing side. IT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE
- AI defense systems are in the top 5 of questionable design choices in this game since they favor the side which already has higher player numbers, adding even more to early game defeatism on the losing team. should it not help defend at lower player pop?
- in theory a faction can always make an epic comeback after an initial setback, but defeatism prevents this most of the time, people rather quit after losing ground
- want to build anything larger than a coffin? good luck competing for building space!
- you want to build anything on a front-line? good luck finding a spot where backpacks are not blocking your building space
- don't know which RPG ammo goes with which RPG launcher? well, good luck figuring that one out
- having two systems that do the same thing but differently is just poor design. YES I'm talking about barbed wire and how its fu*n STOOPID how you can remove some of the barbed wire with a wrench BUT NOT IF IT's PLACED ON A TRENCH FOR NO FU*N REASON BECAUSE OF COURSE ITS LOGICAL THAT NOW I NEED TO USE BMATS INSTEAD EVEN THOUGH THE COST AND FUNCTION OF THE WIRE ON THE TRENCHES ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE THAT YOU CAN PLACE ON THE GROUND
- trying to place 2 types of walls/barriers like barbed wire or sand bags next to each other? don't bother trying the auto snap function is horrendous and greatly limits your placement options.
- the idea of having weather systems (snow/rain etc) is cool, especially when it affects the game play, BUT WHY IS IT COMPLETELY RANDOM AND NOT A PROPER SEASON SYSTEM which would be infinitely better
- although I do think the muddy feet penalty from rainy weather is actually quite a good idea, meanwhile it's actually ridiculously easy to warm when it snow's, to the point that if you are aware of the mechanics it won't really affect you as infantry even without a winter uniform (you can simply get warm from sitting in a trench, pillbox, vehicle (yes even riding bicycles get you warmed up!) or any building structure, even if it's shot to pieces and has massive gaping holes in it.)
- did some clan claim an entire oilfield and locked down the facility on top of it? too bad, guess they are the oil mafia now
- if you think claiming oil fields is bad, what about squads claiming front line bunkers and than logging out without releasing them to the public making it impossible to properly maintain.
- occasionally all your graphics's and resolution settings will be broken upon starting the game and you have to manually correct it and or restart the game (I've had the game start up in windowed mode while settings tell me it's in full screen) AND THE WORST PART IS THAT WHILE YOU ARE PUTTING ONE SETTING BACK TO NORMAL THE GAME AUTOMATICALLY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• UP MORE SETTINGS FOR YOU!
- occasionally clipping in pre-existing objects in the world like that time I sapwned into a table, went back to home region, deploy again aaaaaand stuck in the same spot again!
- also climbing over or jumping on objects in the world you can get stuck especially if there is buildings around pre-existing objects but also possible when climbing on rocks.
- unstuck tool? useless, going back to home region is faster/less effort most of the time, which also sucks sometimes since you have limited deploy's per time unit.
- typing in chat during your respawn time out is buggy, you will get randomly cut from typing in chat for no good reason
- You can also randomly get cut from typing at a map post
- don't even bother to read chat, all people type there is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and ****
- devman makes lots of new content but with poor prioritization (no balance no polish on older content etc).
- build able signs are occasionally useful to display messages, but lets be real 9/10 times they are made to advertise some clanman Discord server, which sucks since they still cost Bmats
- occasional server connection issues

The community is super serious about gameplay and rights and wrongs. Which can be both good and bad for your playing experience. 

There are people dedicated to teach newbies on the basics and get them up to speed. I had one, Beef. Taught me logi, basic building and mechanics. Later people will tell you what kind of battleplans work and do not work, how the enemie tends to work in different fronts etc. 
People can also tend to get agitated, like when you build somewhere a clan has built something already and they don't like it. You will get yelled at. It's best to apologies and move on. 

The game features player built towns and frontlines, every weapon you hear, tank you see, hole in the ground etc is made by players.

I'm myself main medic, i can tech you basics or advanced stuff, discord: vedagi , i'm behind uncompleted ""Medical Guide"" project, and [work in progress] ""Medical Library"" project, as medic you will save a lot of lifes, medics tend to be helpful and friendly all time, being medic become at this point more like job to me, i'm not the best, but to be honest one of the top i would say, not just because of my experience, but also thanks to having a lot of time to play, there are medical regiments, DM if you want to join some, i'm probably the only person who knows most of medical clans in game.

In general, Foxhole is amazing game, and you'll cry one day when you'll think of the people and friends you met, and never seen again, the great times when you know people from enemy team, the great stories what you'll made, and one day, you ask yourself, why did i stay?",1684088709,1702491261,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Excellent persistent world concept, appealing aesthetic, shooting most weapons and driving vehicles is well done and satisfying, many different roles.

But more than one year after the full ""release"" (which doesn't mean anything), I can list several issues: 

- The front line regions (hexes) are either deserted OR there is a queue of dozens of people (likely because the game is centered around big clans);
- When I finally get to a region with some action, I get stuck in the corner of a building due to a bug and have to leave again (many instances of getting stuck in the terrain or around buildings for no reason, this is not ""1.0"" worthy);
- The performance is not good. It seems the game is heavily CPU limited, as driving through factory areas DESTROYS my FPS.

I also dislike some game design decisions:

- People suicide too much because the life of a foot soldier is completely worthless. Although this somewhat matches what happened in the Great War, no, they did NOT do solo kamikaze grenade runs to blow up an empty car. And kamikaze Japanese pilots did so to try and sink freaking aircraft carriers, not destroy a light tank or a house;
- Outside of shooting and driving, the gameplay is pretty poor/non-existent. Building is mind-numbing, you swing a hammer, sometimes missing the square hitbox that was right under your cursor for no reason. Shooting mortars is frustrating, because even if you try to quicksope binoculars, there is a recovery time so that you can't even see if you landed the shot. Only one person, the spotter, will see that;
- Ressources are often hoarded by clans (Regiments). To build my own simple car, I had to steal rare ressources from ressources fields that were empty most of the time.

Here are a few QoL changes I wish to see in this game:
- Binoculars allow to animation cancel the mortar recovery time, allowing all players to see the result of their shooting;
- Keybinds that allow to move forward or build without holding the key for several minutes. Most MMOs do that. Even Skyrim does that;
- Allow the player to keep his loadout if logged out in a safe town center that wasn't captured by the enemy. Sometimes, finding the precise items I want can waste minutes by having me drive a bunch for no reason. As a consequence, I hide even my most basic items in a single crate on the map, which is a risk and another needless waste of time.

These are just examples. I hope to see lots of QoL before the game inevitably becomes deserted.",1700688934,1702227268,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you want to end up with severe paranoia, trust-issues and PTSD that is.
Foxhole is ruined by both its community and its devs, I'll be giving you some examples:



-Firstly, you'll love this game if you have a year of time to spend on it, however if you always have limited time, don't even bother playing it.

-In Foxhole, if you are a Colonial or a Warden, your enemies aren't the other team, but actually your own team. Piss off some hardcore no-life player? He'll wrench your truck full of RMATS and BMATS then throw it in the river then kill you, you took a single stack of RMATS to go build a tankette but a dude was gonna take said stack to build a jeep for no reason? He's gonna follow you in a truck yelling the hard-R at you for 2 hours, waste your tankette's fuel and ammo then drive it to the other team's frontline and blow it up.


-In Foxhole, teamwork is a neccesary element to any war, sometimes it needs to be coordinated, so clans have been created, and this led to almost every big clan being full of power-hungry no life hardcore basement dwellers that if you even DARE to piss of once, they'll cry to their clan and tell them to mass report you and you'll be banned within an hour. When oil was added in-game, big clans at the start of the war imediately did a bee-line for the oil fields then killed anyone who even DARED to try to take a single jerrycan leading small clans and regular players with no way to fuel their vehicles, this led to literal civil wars in between big clans controlling all the oil fields for their own stuff and killing anyone approaching the fields, small clans leading attacks and sabotages on the big clans oil wells and regular players just trying to win the war.

- The devs are very respectful to critisisim, if you even dare to leave a constructive and backed up negative review, the chances of you being shadow banned from the game and discord are close to 100%, they also listen a lot to their community, main example is the famous L.O.G.I strike, basically, logistics player were complaining to the devs that logistics was tidious, boring, unrewarding and riddled in bugs, they made a letter to the devs and gave them a deadline to either respond or fix the issues. They, of course, never fullfilled the deadline and this led to logi players going on strike for the next war, guess what the devs did? They removed half of the refineries and emptied world storages instead of listening to their community in order to punish EVERYONE leaving both teams needing to swap out their frontline duties for logistic ones, I guess I don't need to mention the fact they are ready to ban a new player with 3 hours of playtime if a high clan member asks them to, but if said clan member sabotages their own team or even hack, you can be sure nothing will be done against them.

- Foxhole has the amazing ability of sapping your morale away faster than spending 5 minutes on Twitter. Picture this, you've been supplying a frontline bunker base with shirts and BMATS and other resources for 3 hours, you help build defenses, barbed wire, mines, AI bunkers and so on, you team up with other logi players and build a battle tank, you take it to the frontline go fight with it and your teamates and capture a town so quickly the enemies don't have the time to take their vehicles with them and end up abandoning them, after a hard day of work, you decide to log-off and go to sleep, when you wake up you hop on the game only to see your team has lost both the town, the battle tank, the vehicles, the bunker base and the seaport, all of that within 6 hours. How? Simple, a Warden logged on with his Colonial account when most players were sleeping, took the vehicles you captured and brought them back to his team, dismantled a part of your trench so he could sneak his Warden account in and burn it down and did the same to the Town Hall and gave the areas with no defenses to his team, worst thing? This happens ALLLLL the time and the devs REFUSE to do anything against it, they refuse to take any action despite the community literally begging them to do anything. This caused a majority of players literally ending up with depressed or with no morale because anything they worked hard for could be rendered meaningless and useless within 2 minutes by some basement dweller.

- The moderation in Foxhole uses a bot, logical, most games now use bots to moderate right? Well, Foxhole's bot does it differently, does it base itself on the evidence, on who is getting reported or on your actions? No. It bases itself on how many people report you, you decide to report a hacker once? He'll never be banned since its not enough, however if a clan decides to report you 254 times for bullcrap reasons? Expect to be banned in the following hour because logic is that ""If there's a lot of reports coming from lots of players on the same clan on a single person it HAS to be real"" But it doesn't stop here, the Foxhole devs in order to stop people yelling slurs in the chat have introduced a ""Communication Rating"" system, basically the Reddit upvote/downvote system but the devs have somehow made it WORSE. Upvoting someone gives you no rewards whatsoever, downvoting someone however screws them over as if their Communication Rating becomes ""Bad"". They'll simply and casually be PERMANENTLY MUTED FROM GENERAL, REGION AND LOGISTICS CHAT leaving you with only Local chat access, now it might not seem like a big problem until you realise something. In order to get your Communication Rating up, you need to be upvoted, but the thing is, you CANNOT upvote messages in Local chat effectively leaving you muted from the general chats for the rest of the war and since downvoting messages for no reason don't give you consequences, you can effectively shadow mute anyone from communicating in a game where teamwork and communication are key.


Overall, I wouldn't recommend Foxhole at all, the game's slowly dying with dwindelling player numbers because the devs just refuse to listen to their community, useless update adding more and more useless vehicles and mechanics (who thought decay would be a good idea? And who seriously uses the ambulance?), the community is a toxic mess full of power-tripping clans, alts and hackers that get no punishements whatsoever, the game can go from the most fun experience you've ever had until, Uh oh, a bunker base needs shirts and BMATS, time to drop down your rifle in a war game and go scrap for 5 hours straight while being constantly griefed by big clans, only for your progress be meaningless because some guy with an alt account waltzed past all your defenses and burnt down your storage and up with severe paranoia resulting in you shooting anyone next to your storage because they seems suspicious and end up shooting a clan member that then tells his entire clan to mass report you only for you to end up being banned.",1671555927,1702226739,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whether you are running around trenches, hunting for weapons and ammo, or grouping with 7 people to rush an enemy structure so you can all throw 4 HE nades inside, or if you are relaxing whilst driving around delivering supplies to the front, it has potential to be fun.

But the devs just cant quite grasp it. Yes, the balance is fucked and warden is objectively better tech wise. But you can overcome wardens having better tech, and we were. But suddenly every colonial in Clahstra gets kicked, all their AI gets disabled, and wardens are just able to undo hours of progress with no effort. They were on their heels, losing ground, and they were saved not by their ingenuity, not by some amazing call or plan, but by the devs. Dozens of people quit the game on the spot, many claiming they didnt plan to return because it simply ruins the fun and feeling like you have an impact when the devs allow this. 

2 hours post the event, and no dev has responded, not comments from any staff on the official discord or in game. I have lost many times in this game, and all of those sucked. But this was not losing, this was getting cheated. No fault of our own saw us lose hours of progress and resources.

I been playing this game since it first came out in 2017 and i had the chance to play late 2016 as well. The Bias between the factions keep getting worse. The war should come down to which said has more skill. But one side has way better Toys then the other. With one side being designed to ""mass produce"" specific tanks and gear.

Some things I'd like to see fixed...

1. Can't stand up once you start cocking a grenade (I've seen tons of people blow themselves up because of this), HUGE delay for crouch after throwing one as well.

2. Both your team and the enemies buildings under construction are blue, it's literally impossible to tell whose is who. Which can be hugely important. Also the flags over the buildings are very hard to discern, I think wardens look yellow and blue and collies are pure yellow? I'm not even sure, they don't look distinctive at all in my opinion.

3. Everything surrounding building, maintaining and upgrading trenches is bad. It's very difficult to build them or connect them. You can't shoot through the rope as they are being built. You need building materials to fill them in or remove sandbags / barbed wire upgrades (I think it's dumb you use a wrench to remove barbed wire as well, they should just make wire cutters).

4. It's extremely difficult to climb in and out of trenches as well, you spam spacebar in every direction and it frequently takes 5 secs or more, which is certain death when your trying to run from a grenade.

5. I think it's dumb you can't right click to assemble and equip items from your bunker base. 

6. The logistics system is bad too, it's really annoying. There should just be a separate tab at the bunker base where players can request items from the logistics people. Right now it's just a million people making posts on the map begging for basic items. I would build them myself but after nearly 170 hours of play I still have no idea how to do that. The tutorials are horrible. So many new players don't even know how to use to a bandage, much less use construction vehicles, or build a tank. I think the only realistic way to learn how to play this game is join a clan. There aren't even good youtube tutorials. 

7. I think it's dumb that you win the war and like nothing even happens. Some guy in France probably knows but I still have no idea despiste winning two wars. I went to sleep after playing for a long time and next time I log in it's just like ok wars over. I don't think it even says who won, you just infer it was your team. There should be fireworks in the spawning area and a parade or a video cut scene or SOMETHING. It's really a bummer, I don't know if you can even check your stats or anything. It would be cool if it told you how many kills / deaths you had, trenches / items built, literally something to reward players for such a huge time commitment.

8. The game is heavily dominated by armored vehicles because there is absolutely no way for infantry to get past the endless number of automatic gun turrets that instantly target and kill you. Really dumb, you log in at the start of a new war and there is basically no point in even playing until tanks or artillery are unlocked. Mammons have ridiculously short range, it's basically 100% suicide if you try to use them to destroy a vehicle or a automatic machine gun, they even insta kill you if you are standing in a trench.

9. Another thing that's very bad is the aiming system, I was shocked when an enemy was 4 ft away from me and I spray fired 30 bullets with a sub machine gun only to have all of them miss? Ridiculous. Or how you pull out you pistol to finish an enemy lying still on the ground 2 ft away and to have 4 shots miss? You have to stand there and aim for like 2 seconds to shot them. It's really a bad system. Also your frequently shooting at people and it you gives you the red line that means you can't hit them, and surprise you can! People somehow turn immortal when they lay down as well, the whole system is pretty bad.

10. Lots of toxic players, people saying all kinds of slurs and teammates screaming into their mics. If a teammate kills you on purpose you can't report them while your dead, you can't commend people either (The commendation system is really bad, you can alt + right click to mute / report / commend people but I'd wager roughly 85% of players don't know that). People can kill you and instantly close their game to avoid all punishments. There should be an immediate pop that asks if you want to report them - and if there's excessive team killing other players should be able to watch clip of the incident while there dead to ask if it looked intentional and give them a 90 min ban for first offense and escalate if they keep it up. Right now there basically no moderation at all. 

11. It is STILL very easy to get stuck on mountains and raise trenches, you can type !unstuck to get out of it BUT not if there's enemies near??? Surprise, there is! Like literally every time, BECAUSE WE ARE FIGHTING A WAR. Most people don't know that, how would they, even if you do know that it takes two minutes??? that's 4 deaths? wtf. I've seen people begging teammates to kill them because they can't get unstuck - just really bad.And it's on super common terrain that's copy and pasted like a million times, how is this not fixed?",1701853870,1701856993,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Figuring out the game with the current setup and tutorials that haven't been updated and are mostly useless is not easy. as a solo player if you dont find a kind person who is willing to show you the ropes its gonna be confusing.  

My tip would just be to figure out a casual regiment you can join. The community of this game while toxic if you make dumb mistakes at the front line is actually one of the most helpful I've ever seen if you just ask questions. ask how you can help. turns out most people are willing to explain a few things for an extra hand. At its core this teamwork is what makes foxhole great.  (mandatory FMAT plug ;) we do logi for wardens and alot more.) 

I will end this by saying its a tough learn but IMO 100% worth it and makes you feel useful in a way that isnt replicated in any other game I've played. Saving the front line from collapse sneaking through a logi truck or using your mic to rally people for a counter push. I love this game and plan to continue playing win or lose for a long time.

The game itself is a nice idea , i do liek to play it . there are sadly are several Issues with game , making it unplayable 
its really fun to make everything yourself int he game, satrting from gathering resources, refinign them, making ammo, rifles, tanks, etc out of them and deliver that to storages, seaports or frontline Bunkerbases.
The combat itself is fun aswell , untill you run in a wall of the enemy while you are out numbered , eventho your side is queed and no one else can reinforce, the enemy side outnumbers you and has no quee . 
Factionwise Warden infaterie Weapon is absolutely underpowered to fight colonial counterparts . how do i know this , wuit easy , with warden weapons i have a kill death ratio of 0,5 kills to 1 death
with Colonial weapons it jumps to 4 kills to 1 death , their weaposn are easier to handle, have better range and accuracy . ontop of that colonials can make 12.7mm light mgs without needing Rmats . colonial weapons are way easier and cheaper to make than warden ones . All good Warden weapons need Rmats . 
Since Wardens need Rmats for  their ""good"" infanterie weapons the rmats are missing in tank and artillerie production , giving the colonials another advantage.
Colonial tanks are cheaper , eventho warden tanks are supposed to be faster, the turret turn speed is too slow to keep up with that .
Facilities are a nice idea, but terribly inplemented , that needs to be reworked . why teh fuck do you let peopel play human pipe and not give them pipes fromt he beginnign instead of next industrie tech .
also make the powerplants atleast last 24 hours with a full load of fuel . you totally misregard the casual player here . the same goes for Gsups . the consumption is way to high. you are offline 2 days, everythign you build is gone, if not another player did supply it .
the Quee system is utter bullshit . its so buggy , your side gets a quee , eventho its outnumbered . loosing terretory liek that is not fun at all .
on top of all that and a lot more things not working well you have all the cheaters hackers and alters .
in this War 100 it became so rediculious its no wonder hundrets of players quitted over it and that goes for both sides .
you wonder how the fuck you got hit during the night , on open field? guess what teh other uses a nightvision hack .
you wonder why the fuck your fatser tank gets overtaken by the suposed to be slower one ? guess what they use speed hack .
bug and exploit abuse is common in this game .
in the End the Faction cheating, hacking and alting most wins 
so no stay away from this and dont buy the followup game, it will be just teh same
the developers dont care about cheaters and alters, every alt is more money for them, so why do anything about it .

It alomost seems the Dev VISION is to Wardens always loose 

proove of OP Colonial infanterie Weapons is that every WAR Wardens have way more casaulties

the game was a great idea, but developers and communty ruined it

However, the community has taken a major reverse double back flip into the ground. Not to say everyone is like this bc you can meet alot of cool people. On the other hand the game is controlled by massive clans. Think rust level clans, teams of 50 60 dudes rip all the resources, all the equipment and just about all the fun of the game straight out. They will take the game and their plans so seriously they will actually post on the discord to mass ban someone for taking items other players need while they hoard them for an event they have planned when the other team hops off for the night.

They seem determined to disrupt the server whenever the Colonial side advances into Warden territory. The game's imbalance is evident in the equipment provided to the Colonial faction, favoring the Axis team and resulting in their consistent victories.

It is unique and has endless hours of gameplay to offer.

[h3][u]Pros:[/u][/h3]
[list]
[*] MMO with an ending, each war ends and then restarts. Yes, there are game loops in this game the require a grind  but only if you want there to be. I find myself grinding 1 war to get resources for something fun and powerful, like a battletank and then the next war, more casually playing. These options help prevent burnout.
[*] Great co-op play with friends. It is a full pvp game. 
[*] Death, destruction, absolute chaos. Big battles are intense. Honestly, I've had more fun losing in a last stand than winning a lot of the time.
[*] Attention to detail/realism. For example, to fire artillery, you need a trigger man, a guy who loads the shells manually and a spotter who provides coordinates to fire at. You also have to make the artillery piece and shells, then transport them to the front.
[*] Sandbox/player made elements. The logistics/economy/factory side of this game is amazing. It is complicated and has a learning curve but it's actually kind of fun. I normally find that type of activity to be tedious(it still can be at times) but Foxhole does make this interesting.
[*] Tanks are awesome.
[*] Naval update was a game changer, excellent new content there.
[*] Allows for different play styles. You can be casual and have fun at the front or deep dive into the extreme resource gather, building and facilities end of the game.
[*]  Community - there's some cool people who play and that will help you out if you ask.
[/list]

[h3][u]Cons:[/u][/h3]
[list]
[*] Learning curve. It isn't easy to figure out at first. There's a training area that was okay when I first started but not great. It is a true sandbox and you have to figure things out as you go. It can be overwhelming and it took me months to figure out the way things work. I feel like I'm just now getting to the point where I'm comprehending all the elements of the game(end to end) and their importance. Go to the front early and fight, that will get you hooked imo.  
[*]  Time investment - you can play casually but if you are like me, you might find that hard to do. There's always stuff to be done which is bad and good.
[*] Connectivity issues and bugs sometimes. Not terrible or game ruining, but not extremely polished.
[*] Can be a little too much sandbox at times. It gets frustrating when people take your important stuff from your facilities without asking. There could be some improvements to the game mechanics around that in my opinion.
[*]Community - for every 5-10 good people, there's a few that are just toxic or annoying for no reason. Can be brutal. 
[*] Larpers - Way more than you would expect but maybe I'm just not into that.

Update on 3/7/23
So, most of the problems has been mention by Update 52 Dev Stream. Until I got my hands on the changes for 3-4 weeks, I'll hold my opinion and will change my review if it's actually good. It seems that this game might on the right path again.

Update on 5/12/23
Right, I should have provide the update to my review a long time ago. Here's my 2 cent, until the devs made the update that fixes communication and logistics, I'm still not recommend this game to anyone at the moment.

Update on 11/30/23
It's been a few months since my last review update, and you might be wondering what's new. The developers have implemented some changes and are committed to introducing Quality of Life (QoL) improvements that will enhance the game. Based on this latest update, I now recommend giving this game a try.

""Foxhole"" stands out as a gem in the realm of cooperative war games, offering a truly immersive experience that hinges on community and communication. The game's shining attribute is its player-driven warfare, where every soldier, builder, and logistician is an actual player contributing to a persistent war effort. This setup fosters an incredible sense of camaraderie and teamwork, as success in ""Foxhole"" heavily relies on effective communication and strategic collaboration. The sense of achievement you get from coordinated efforts with fellow players is unparalleled.

The game's community is one of its strongest assets. Players are generally welcoming and eager to work together, which is vital in a game where coordination is key. New players can expect to find guidance and support from more experienced soldiers, creating an inclusive and engaging environment.

However, ""Foxhole"" is not without its challenges. Factionalism is prominent, with extreme loyalty to one‚Äôs faction sometimes leading to a divisive atmosphere. This can occasionally detract from the overall experience, particularly for new players navigating these complex social dynamics.

Additionally, some of the developers' game design choices have been met with mixed reactions. Certain updates and changes have sparked debate within the community about the game‚Äôs direction. While these choices show the developers' commitment to evolving the game, they can sometimes feel misaligned with player expectations.

In conclusion, ""Foxhole"" offers a unique and compelling experience for those who thrive on teamwork and strategy. While it has areas that could be improved, particularly in terms of factionalism and certain game design decisions, the game remains a standout choice for players seeking a deep, cooperative military strategy game.",1676273181,1701379470,True,0,0,0.560752689838409424,0,True,False,False

Devs are stuck chasing ""their vision"" no matter how un-fun and grindy that makes the game. 
They're fixated on some immersive war simulator that doesn't value players' time and discourages teamwork whenever possible. 

If you're not part of a regiment, good luck getting fucking anything done. If you are, enjoy having everything you make get stolen by dudes who don't want to work for it. 

Enjoy having devs sit idly and refuse to ban griefers and known alt accounts. Send video evidence of alt accounts only to see them log in the next day after a 24 hour ban. 

===========

Spring/Summer 2023 Patch:
Yep, Devs are just adding useless fluff crap features instead of fixing existing content.
They haven't iterated meaningfully on facilities and logistics in 9+ months, but not a single crippling issue with the game has been addressed.  

Game is on life support with individual team members just adding whatever feature catches their eye, rather than getting together and making meaningful changes to core gameplay loops.  

It's easy to see most of their motivation left and went to work on Anvil.

===========

Fall 2023 Patch (Naval):

They added crappy boats that don't fit into the flow of the game, take massive resource investments, and had to give them their own hexes to make them relevant. 

The least fun and interesting update they've ever pushed. Buggy boats and more grind.

Again ZERO quality-of-life. They added MORE grind and MORE tedium while ignoring glaring issues with the game's core gameplay loops.

They just announced their next set of patches and ""QoL"" that includes minor UI fixes, but again, for the 500th time, does absolutely nothing to address the game's overwhelming hunger for your time and utter disrespect for the effort you invest into it.

Most other people have probably already talked about the mechanics in the game so I'm gonna go over some other points/suggestions for new players:

1: Play on Charlie shard (shards are servers). Able shard is full of toxic tryhards and really not worth playing on (and this is coming from somebody who has roughly 50ish hours on this game)
2: Build trenches, but build them well. Research IRL trench formations and try to copy that, alot of IRL tactics/defenses actually translate well over to Foxhole
3: When fighting tanks, aim for fuel tanks, turret and tracks. Taking out the tracks makes them nearly immobile, damaging fuel tanks means that the tank looses alot of fuel and taking out the turret disables the turret from rotating. 

And the final tip (or rather an answer to a question most newbies ask): Which Faction to pick?

First off, lets start with the Wardens. The Wardens (Or the Caiovish), culturally, are based on the Celtics while most of their equipment is inspired by the French (with a little german inspiration sprinkled in). In terms of lore they are fairly conservative and value individuals, often making statues of great leaders/people in their society. They were once a massive empire that is now in decline, and while they weren't an empire in name, they were a trading nation and there is evidence to suggest that they held a monopoly on trade in the region. 

Second, the Colonials (or Mesean Republic). The Colonials aren't actually one peoples, but rather a collection of smaller cultures, the main one being the Meseans (Italian) with smaller countries in it such as the Velinians (Greek), Kraunians (French) and Estrellans (Spanish). The Colonials use a variety of equipment, guns from Estrella, tanks from Kraunia, ships from Veli and general gear/equipment from Mesea. In terms of lore, not much is known about them with people either calling the Republic a Democratic Liberator or a Tyrannical Oppressor, all that is 100% confirmed is that they are a highly militaristic state, with a collectivist mindset and little care about individuals unless they made a great contribution to the Republic.

In terms of gameplay, both factions are somewhat identical though the Colonials have better Infantry weapons while the Wardens have better tanks",1701190881,1701190907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've seen people dumping stuff , driving fire trucks into water or enemy tank lines , people throwing stickies on friendly tanks , placing mines behind friendly tanks and even You Tubes of people openly alting for weeks before getting banned. (I play both sides and it happens on both) I used to love this game and all its mechanics and it had moderators in the past and cheating wasn't nearly as common. It is a shame the game has progressed into what it has with the cheating , lieing, alting , bullying and lack of tutorial for new players. I say bullying because of the reporting system of in-game multiple people clans can instant ban people by simply reporting 6-10 times ruining that persons experience. This system has also led to clan wars and infighting over resources and facilities again abusing the report mechanic on each other (war 103 perfect example for collies) and our teams supposed to be working together shooting , reporting and destroying other clans facilities and players. This is the worst state of the game I have seen personally and I think ever. I know it happens on both sides but it never seems to get fixed for alts or they just buy a new account and boom back again. I want this problem addressed or fixed not just for myself but for everyone who wants a fair honourable war without cheating , alting and bullying from clans I have never in my years and hundreds of hours of game play (9600 roughly since 2017) seen the cheating or civil drama from clans this bad ever. Examples from clans on the same side having straight up shoot out civil wars over building areas to false reporting people for using there facilities without permission and don't get me wrong amazing game its just the 3% are ruining it for the 97% and yes not everyone you'll get along with in game its the internet after all but to report , cheat and alt is just disgusting. There's no hardware ban ik tons of people banned in game with new accounts literally within the hour. and yes I get with the name wardens will be like ow colonials whining but I play warden on my other pc and I have seen the same clan bullying , hoarding , reporting and even heard about alting on that side (never personally seen it as a warden but guarantee both sides partake weather for ""revenge"" or just there sides benefit. That being said somethings gotta be done it's killing the community and the game play and its sad to see all this work and progress of the game for these fun insane unique game play options. Cause don't get me wrong this game is unique and insane and definitely one that ill always remember and many others will but it gets ruined by the cheating and alt accounts as many other games have fell victim to. I hope the devs see this and address it its nothing personal against you guys at 10k hours almost 7 years i'm a addict and have loved the evolution but please don't let this amazing game be ruined by that 3% that wanna cheat and alt and bully on both sides not just one but both we need a better system or the moderators back in game thanks for the hours of fun and I hope that you can fix this bump before it derails the game cause the problems only growing as of right now (not talking about the gambling). I hope that both sides can put away the differences right now to address this problem and fix it and that the devs take action and care about the game as much as the players keeping it alive do before the game destroys itself. as of the current moment I personally find the game unplayable because of this issue and very frustrating.",1629863930,1701183966,False,4,0,0.491100400686264038,0,True,False,True

Let me start off by saying I really like this game and enjoy the loop. From logi, to tanking, to clearing the trenches. I just have to warn you now, The community is rabid. Alt accounts, a practice where a player will purchase an alternate account with the express purpose of joining the enemy side to sabotage key facilities and provide intel they would otherwise never gain access too, are out of control. You cant trust any new players because they might just be there to ruin you're game time. This creates a cycle where new players come in and get burnt our by the community for making new player mistakes since the older players have to keep this practice in the back of their minds when ever they try to help. Too many have been burned and lost a base SOLELY because of alt accounts . The regiments would usually love to help new players, but there is a genuinely high risk of that account being an alt. It ruins the game and the devs have NO idea how to actually fix it. Also the balancing is a complete joke, the game BARELY respects your time, and the devs will NOT hard cap faction sizes. This means that the current overpowered faction will ALWAYS have more players. And from everything I have heard in game, the devs are OK with this and actually give unfair balances to one side depending on who they want to win. In other words, YOUR ACTIONS MEAN NOTHING. I will keep playing this game because there is nothing else like it, but only because there is nothing else like it.

Overall the game is super unique and actually very engaging. I did a mix of activities some front line combat, solo ran a small public facility for vehicle upgrades in a convenient location that actually made me some good friends in game, and did back line to mid/front line logistics. Enjoyed all of it. So why the not recommend?

The community. Before buying I was told on reddit that the community there was way more toxic than in game....that was nothing short of a lie. This game is a huge playground for toxicity and griefing. Most of the ""toxicity"" I saw on reddit appears to be valid criticism of the game. In game is soooo much nastier. From world chat that is constantly on about who is at fault for losing and nonstop whining about losing, to fights over who stole what (especially trains), whose resources are whose, and top it off with folks intentionally sabotaging your own side. Because everything is player made and some items are difficult if not outright impossible to secure from your own team griefers can and do wonder the map to find high value assets and destroy them. My own facility had people on multiple occasions just come through and throw manufactured materials on the ground to rot, disconnect power to structures, and unlock and move vehicles out into the road to block pathways into and out of a nearby town.  This happened right before a big attack on the region which of course suggests it could be alting (a nasty practice of having an account on the other team and using it to sabotage stuff for an advantage) but could just be vindictive idiots. Sure, I've met some good peoples and helped some folks about but I've also been team killed for trying to set up a public crane at a public mine by a clan that set up their facility on top of it and received obscenity laced tirades because I was parked ""wrong"" at a refinery because someone else was parked wrong when I got there so I made do. Dude was truly unhinged because it took him 5 extra seconds to access the building...

Finally. Because there was a new update released the devs opened a new server to accommodate the influx of players, new or returning. Pretty standard stuff for an mmo right?  Well expect in this case the devs play the game and want to protect there ""pure"" vision of the gaming experience from anyone new that might disrupt that. So they put up big warnings about ques on the Alpha server, which is their own private playground and shunt any and all new players to Charlie. The whole community on Alpha treats Charlie like a joke. They call it a meme server and call for it to be shut down after the current war. You as a new player are literally seen as a lessor by the player base here and shoveled off to a lessor version of the game. Is it a scam? I wouldn't go as far as that but i would call it a cash grab. There is no subscription and no cash shop so the devs have to make money somehow. To do that they put out a new expansion, run a sale or something to bring in new players, give them an experience that is good enough to keep them around until they can't refund the game then have the community and gameplay drive away 99% of them so they don't have to open another server and can keep the purity of the one true war.

I think I'll stop there. I could touch on other issues like the attempt at asymmetric balancing, server issues, or how mind numbing some of the logistics loop is but I'm sure others have and will cover that.",1701102568,1701102568,False,331,17,0.839549005031585693,0,True,False,False

But after getting some sessions. you slowly going to see the same patern in the game mechanics and you have to use the experiences you get from previous wars and put them in good use in the next up coming battles. that being said let be point out the Pros and the Cons of the game.

PROS

- It's a very simple looking game, but with a huge in-dept cooperation mechanic. (Simple put. It's like an ARMA game.) 
- Very huge maps with it's own uniqe feature in maps. (one map has a Swamp, the other are islands and some have huge options in flanking.)

- Interesting way of telling how old Warfare during WorldWar was carried out. (from Logistics to Frontlines. Every department has to help each other out in order to achieve victory.)

- Price. For what is delivers it is worth it for just 20$ as a just gonna help a team out in the weekends or just every day. (and with the SteamSales the prices are even more worth while!)

CONS

- Huge flaws in teamwork can quickly be a bad game expierence. (players that start from the beginning instantly go to the Frontlines without proper training on what to do and will get very frustrated when the enemies can overwelm them in better logistics arms.)

- Un-even maps, can make some area's of the map unfair. (even tho the Devs wanted this way, i do see that some of those maps form a huge issue in order to make an orginized assault possible)

- Cheating. (Yes... even in this game cheating happends, and while the Devs are aware of this, they have not found a perfect
solution to find and stop the hacking toolkit. They are thinking about an Anti-cheat system in the near future.) 

- The Disconnect between Logistics and Frontline. (Logistics are the foundation of the war. They deliver Weapons, Vehicles, Building Materials and more to the frontlines. most of the time a lot of newcomers will ignore this and go straight to the front. and that leaves more empty hands in order to get supplies to the Front.) 


Well then. I hope if someone is reading this. it will give them a better understanding of the sistuation of the game and if it is worth you're try. My personal opion is. Yes. In the in between moments i had a lot of fun with playing with Random players that just charge towards the enemy while also falling off a cliff and instantly explodes on impact....

We are not even talking about the balance of technology. For example, the Warden anti-tank rifle is made simply for basic materials, allows you to carry it in your hands and allows you to sit in an armored pillbox and shoot from it.

This rifle is relevant the whole game. The colonials' anti-tank rifle is mounted permanently on a tripod, which is very difficult to put in time in battle, you are not mobile, you cannot hide in the bushes and shoot at tanks. 
You can't hide in pillboxes in a place with her. You can't take it with you to the tank, so it's a large item. It costs purified materials, instead of basic ones, and requires the production of a tripod.
Yes, they are produced 5 instead of 3, very cool. You can make hundreds of them for basic materials.

By the way, some players have lost large ships that they have been making for more than a week, cool. Like because of the crash of servers.

These are balance issues, they are solvable. By the way, I periodically play for both sides of the conflict. It's only now that developers have begun to do frankly dirty things.

""Some of the crashes worked out in the favour of the Wardens. After that, during one particular server crash, the devs intervened to save a Warden SHT and several BTs from being captured by Colonials, while the Warden crews were frozen/teleported way back on the map. So some Colonials took that as proof for dev Bias.""

In general, the developers rolled back the server 3 times to save the concrete bunker of the Warden base. When the same thing happened with the colonials, there was no magic of server rollbacks, for some reason. Brilliant developers do not understand that if this continues, no one will play their cool game? 

No one wants to play for the colony, everyone will go to play for the other side and the game will die?",1701005108,1701005126,False,5,0,0.502006709575653076,0,True,False,False

It may tempt you to grind resources and manufacture supplies for the front line, and you may do it on a small scale. There's no use in trying to mass produce or try and build combat vehicles unless you have a big squad. Most materials (like coal ) need time for refining even after mining them. Be careful to set resources to private if you intend on using them later. To properly mine or gather basic resources, you'll need big vehicles (flatbeds), not the puny R1 Hauler type which you will have used a lot and then realise what a waste of time that was. You'll make the big trucks, only to be stolen after you logout. So, unless you've got a big squad, just have some fun in the front line or do small scale logi related grind and deliver it to the front lines. It's immensely satisfying. Then, you might ask, if I've gotta play in the front line, why should I do it in a silly top down manner where there are plenty of realistic front line experiences like Squad? Well, it's a different experience. And the front line is just chaos (unless you've got a good command), with you trying to aim and shoot, only to realise that a teammate has come in your ""line of fire"" and that you've shot them accidentally.

That said, if you have a squad, then there are a lot of things that you'll be able to build and supply. The manufacturing process is unbelievably in depth, realistic and complicated too. There are trains (both small gauge supply and normal gauge ones with cannons fitted) which I feel is a pretty cool thing.

In short, unless you join a clan or have a lot of friends playing this game, you'll just feel exhausted after putting in a lot of effort.

Just treat this game as a way to pass time. Do some small scale logi, deliver it to the front lines, get commends, try to take out some enemies. Don't just stick to logi or fighting, experience it all. 

Update : The servers, being based in EU, are pretty laggy and it isn't a fun experience for a player from Asia. I get disconnected 20 times a day, that too at crucial junctures. Most of the times, it says, ""connection refused"". I've never had such a consistent problem even in other MMOs with EU only servers. Lost a lot of resources because of sudden dcs.

Final Update: The game has become unplayable because of too much alt activity. Players from the opposite faction just come during low pop. and dump vehicles into the sea, steal material and ammo from facilities, etc. Basically, whichever faction has more alts is bound to win. Not gonna play unless the devs decide to do something about it. Countless tanks and other vital machinery are being dumped into the sea / destroyed by alt. accounts.

Don't be fooled by any cool posts or videos you'll see of this game. That kind of interesting, video worthy stuff almost never happens. 

You can join a regiment sure, but nothing will happen. Most of the time even concentrated team efforts are just like solo ones. Either way you'll just end up ramming your head into a wall and the wall wins 95% of the time. 

And the other 5% where you beat the wall? Nothing. Most of that time, the enemy comes by when you're not around and undoes everything. None of it mattered. 

Unless you are willing to sink huge chunks of your limited time on earth into this game, and then also manage to team up with the right people by chance

You will never do anything of note. 

Tank crew or ship crew? Forget it. Everything but the smallest boats and tanks is ridiculously expensive and takes many real hours of waiting and grinding to get. The only people that can ever afford to do that are the large regiments who will rarely use their toys anyway because they're so expensive that they can't afford to lose them. 

Not to mention, a lot of interesting vehicles or resources are blocked behind facilities. Which suck.

There are facilities that offer public resources out and are willing to help you with what you want. Can you find them though? There's literally no way to know if a facility is public, what it does, or who runs it unless you happen to walk into it and find someone in there. Most of the time, their someone in a regiment who treats all randoms with suspicion and will try their best to get you out of there. 

The communication tools are maybe one step above barebones. You have map posts which easily disappear or a world chat that offers nothing of value 99% of the time. That's it.  

The core gameplay is terrible, and is missing so many quality of life features that the community has been asking for for years. 

The worst part of it all is the developers. These are some of the most out of touch, slow paced, and uncommunicative developers for any game I have ever seen.  Developer interaction with the community is almost zero. Developers listening to feedback from veteran players who've played the game for years? Also zero.

They come out of complete silence after several months, announce some content that they've put a miniscule amount of thought into, then go back to ignoring everyone and every thing. The content is admittedly impressive and looks shiny and interesting when they reveal it. But in practice ends up being locked away from the vast majority of people and is often even grindier than the last peace of poorly thought out content they made. They will add more and more content that is completely unfun, poorly thought out, and broken instead of trying to polish what there is. 

You will get no quality of life features, the enjoyment of this game is all down to the players and how willing they are to deal with your early game questions. The tutorial of the game is downright awful, and hasn't been touched in the slightest in years. It's literally missing content from several major updates. 

I desperately want to like foxhole, hence my playtime, but the game is missing so many tools, so much polish, and so many little fixes or tweaks that it just feels terrible to play. 

Please do not buy this game. The developers have only made it worse overtime and refuse to listen, interact, or even acknowledge the complaints that much of the community has.",1700885036,1700885036,False,5,0,0.505459189414978027,0,True,False,False

Post full release edit: Even more amazing than I could have ever dreamed. A massive world with an active war happening that alters the landscape. You will drive miles of road passing grass by.

You will catch a non-zero amount of artillery shells on your head. You will smash a hammer into a blue outline more times than you ever expected to. And most importantly, you will find yourself having fun even as you witness the scorched earth your artillery fire left behind. even as you wake in the morning to find your stockpiles destroyed.

There are many many items all with their own uses/ purposes. Everything is player built, giving a purpose to people that just want to craft bunkers and foxholes. Ammo, weapons, medical and all building resources are created by players who farm resources in each zone. Those resources and equipment are moved across the world by players driving trucks, trains and ships. 

This game has some bugs but in the 70 hours i have played they are few and far between. My main issue is with the aiming system which is a bit finicky. I'd like to see improvements in the organization of squads and regiments, with ways to issue orders from high command to individual units.

Day 1 already got drafted by a lonely Iranian boat captain to game-changingly shell the frontline for thousands of damage

I say good
Every few weeks it cycles and resets the persistent map when one side wins though, and late-stage war seems like an impossible tank slog. One thing I don't like: all the man-portable AT involves either the RNG-based Armor Penetration Chance system or the RNG-based getting close enough system. And none of the successful hits can involve instant tank crippling to the point that you're safe from the return fire.

90% of the game systems are intuitive but extremely arcanely built and unexplained. Tutorial Island doesn't let you play with all the parts of the game, nor does it leave you tanks and boats to learn how those work (the thing killing you most often while learning the game) I believe it's possible to assemble them on Tutorial Island but you would have to craft it manually. You know, the thing where immense legions of Chinese and Russian gamers have literal human 24:00:00 days of crafting queue time to get the resources for. 

Fast tracked education tidbits for new players:
There is PvE in the form of bunkers built by other players that auto-shoot you if they're within range of an upgraded enemy spawn base, and you can shoot them with a lot of bullets to suppress them
All weapons have damage spread (for some reason) so if you died in one shot there was an element of dice
BB is short for bunker base, which you must manually set your spawn at when you get to. It's the FOB of this game, since the actual FOB structure is a direct downgrade to the bunker base.
Run directly at the nearest player with a rank next to their name and ask questions with your mic to learn everything. They will see you have no rank next to your name and immediately know how to help you - which could mean pointing you at the higher ranked guy.
The fandom wiki (unsurprisingly) is full of holes, but helps you learn old game systems like what it takes to make a jeep. Spoiler alert it's 200 components.

The way you do logi is bonking salvage nodes and filling up material containers or trucks. But that process takes a long while each trip and it's very mindnumbingly monotonous. I tend to do solo logi, which I focus on stocking up the local refinery with bmats and emats..

Don't get me started on fuel trucks. You can only pull 3 cans max at a time and a singular fuel truck can fit 200 bloody cans. Game's been out since 2017 but there still isn't a button to auto fill instead of wasting my time having to shift click every 10 seconds or so. (Do correct me if the pull time is wrong)

Some will say ""why don't you make your own fuel then to pull out faster?"".
Problem is refineries tend to accumulate fuel cans that number in the thousands. Seeing over 6k cans in refinery isn't rare and no one is going to bother pulling it due to having to pull it all yourself without respite. That isn't gameplay that's wasting someone's time.

As far as I've seen they want to make logi more clan reliant. Have people scroop for salvage, have some others ship them or truck them to refineries. Other people use the products from the refinery in factories and then move the complete product over to their clan stockpile or to a frontline BB.

Problem is that really screws over people doing solo logi. Even with a flatbed it can only carry 5k salvage which isn't much in the grand scheme of things. You have to go back and forth every single time and you only make about 2.5k bmats per trip. Not all that much considering that thousands can get used up on frontlines on an hourly basis or so. It also doesn't help that the distance between refineries and factories are soo bloody unnecessarily long. Sometimes you have to go to a whole different hex on the map just to get your salvage to a refinery.

Best town I ever did solo logi in was Ogmaran (Before the devs fucked it over so hard that only the seaport or a garage or was it a different thing?). 

I liked Ogmaran because it had a high number of resource nodes in 1 hex, it always had a nice ratio of salvage:components fields.
It had 1 refinery, 2 factories, 1 mass production factory, a garage and a thing where you built those immovable machine guns/AT guns unless you had a crane.

Even though trucking stuff from the nearby fields to the refinery took a bit longer that I would have liked, I still enjoyed it as I didn't have to through very awkward routes to get there. 

Ogmaran was easy to deal with for solo logi and was also the first logi town I was in when I first started playing, now it is a husk of what it once was unfortunately.

Now yes, I can just ignore logi entirely and focus on the fighting aspect. But that's like ignoring an entirely crucial mechanic in a game. Without logi, people would have to walk all the way to the frontline armed with  only pistols.

(What else would you be interested in having a tad more elaboration in if I might be able to help)



14/2/2023
In the last part of my review I rambled on about something that was not important in the review. I am also redoing this as certain things have changed.

So I still do not recommend this game unless you feel joy from not feeling like anything is an achievement. There are ""alts"" which are people that join team to sabotage it to help the other, it's like if teamkilling had no repercussions on the perpetrator. However these alts can destroy hours upon hours of work with next to no consequences for their actions AND THEY KNOW IT. There is zero moderation at all in this game.

 Even if someone were mass reported for an allegation with video proof, nothing is done to ban them permanently. They just get maybe a week ban at most and then they can just get back right to destroying people's hard work. Sometimes they're not even doing it to help the other side, they just like seeing people' reactions and they know nothing permanent will be dealt unto them. This problem is rather far more worse than a blatant hacker as I don't even know of any alts that have been banned permanently.

The utter lack of moderation has caused a noticeable number of the community to be very paranoid about alts. Some fears were founded, but most of the time it just ended up being a newbie being accused of just having no clue what to do and not do. A worser case of this is a streamer that accused a new player whose only sin was trying to build a Bunker Base (think of a base with defenses or small drop off points) and not knowing how to do it because the in-game tutorial is shit and you only figure out from another player telling you about it, you can search for the video if you want but I won't link it because no need for more fuel to the fire.

Facilities, my my.
The devs really would like you to believe that Foxhole is definitely a 1.0 full release game (no bug guaranteed), yet still multiple glitches persist and balancing choices that seem to entirely ignore any of the feedback from the community. They used to do QnA sessions with questions from the community, now they don't anymore and are already making a new game. 

So to actually talk about facilities, they are painful and I have never felt like it was an achievement or it was satisfying to ""engage"" with. Trying to deal with the bullshittery of the devs telling us to use facilities but putting heavy maintenance costs on them if you think of building anything bigger to build trains and the like while having defences because ""too much strain on servers"". Why add facilities to the game if you are going to limit us because the game can't handle it? 

The introduction of facilities also marks the dreaded vehicle variants. If you look at the vehicle roster of Foxhole, you'll see quite a decent amount of vehicle types. However they have locked all but the ""base"" vehicles from being built in the vehicle garage. Now these variants require a facility vehicle pad in that's also upgraded with the right upgrade to built the variant you want. However, there is no easy way to tell where the right vehicle pad exists if you are a person going solo (with other random/friends in a tank). So you have to ask in game chat if there is a vehicle pad available for X vehicle, in-game map is useless in conveying any useful information of that type.

Another thing, facilities really kill off randoms joining together to supply things. Logistics is of great importance in Foxhole, and a decent chunk of it is just random players sending supplies to whatever front need it. With facilities though, there is no way for randoms  to be able to help with running other players facilties on and off short of joining the group that owns the facility. In-game coordination tools are horrid, even the devs tell us to use Discord for better communication. I don't mean joining squads in Foxhole, I mean one-off communications with people you probably aren't going to see again coordinating just for the 1-4 hours you happen to play together with that isn't being right next to eachother.

The in-game ""tutorial"" is still a joke, if I didn't get abducted by a random dude on spawn island wrangling up newbies to teach, I would have refunded the game before it even hit an hour of playtime.

The game has so much potential being a one of a kind where you won't get large clans being the strongest by virtue of hoarding shit since time began. Sure there are still clans that hoard supplies en masse, but it ain't like EVE where you gotta play for 2 years before you can join an existing group. And with the end of a war comes with the GREAT RESET, where the technology tree randomizes and resets captured territory reverting to starting war state and we get to do it all over again.

REVIEW 1.0/RESE√ëA 1.0

The game not only suffers from a big imbalance, but it is not finished, the developers have included mechanics in the game that are not finished, they are not tested. It is in its version 1.0 but it really should not have been like that, it is a game unfinished which I would not recommend to anyone until the developers correct many things.

Game too ambitious.

El juego ya no solo sufre de un desbalanceo grande , si no que no esta acabado, los desarolladores han incluido mecanicas en el juego que no estan acabadas no estan testeadas.Esta en su version 1.0 pero realmente no deberia haber sido asi ,es un juego inacabado el cual no recomendaria a nadie hasta que los developers no corrigan muchas cosas.

Juego demasiado ambicioso.

Non seulement le jeu souffre d'un gros d√©s√©quilibre, mais il n'est pas fini, les d√©veloppeurs ont inclus des m√©caniques dans le jeu qui ne sont pas finies, elles ne sont pas test√©es, il en est √† sa version 1.0 mais √ßa n'aurait vraiment pas d√ª √™tre comme √ßa, c'est un jeu inachev√© que je ne recommanderais √† personne tant que les d√©veloppeurs n'auront pas corrig√© beaucoup de choses.

Jeu trop ambitieux.

Das Spiel leidet nicht nur unter einem gro√üen Ungleichgewicht, es ist auch noch nicht fertig, die Entwickler haben Mechaniken in das Spiel eingebaut, die noch nicht fertig sind, sie sind nicht getestet, es ist in der  1.0, aber es h√§tte wirklich nicht so sein sollen, Es ist ein unfertiges Spiel, das ich niemandem empfehlen w√ºrde, bis die Entwickler viele Dinge korrigiert haben.

There is a lot more to this game however. You have logistics which can be different. You could either collect scrap to make items, you can run supplies to backline bases to keep them from decaying, or you could run supplies to the frontline to keep everyone stocked and able to keep pushing forward.

If you want to frontline you can either use basic gun and shoot the other people, you could be a medic running around healing your team and reviving fallen soldier, you could man a tank or artillery and start shelling the enemies making their defence harder, you could grab a hammer, shovel and some building materials and help make the frontline base stronger to repel attacks.

If none of that sounds interesting you could go into the enemies backline with some others and sabotage their supply lines, destroy their supply hubs to reduce their production, or try to steal some enemy tanks and cause some havoc before you get taken out.

There is probably more to do but that is all I have done and enjoyed.

From logistics to combat, stopping by to transport and build defensive structures to support your faction assets, you can find a lot of different kind of gameplay.

In this game a player is but one cog in the great war machine, for better, or worse.

And after having played for few years, in the current state I can only say it is for worse.
The game albeit interesting in its asymmetric warfare system, suffer great imbalance from one update to another, for one faction to another. It has always been the case so far, but it became an even worse issue when the content added brought so much length to each war and grindiness in the game.

It sorely lacks quality of life tools, and when the grind is so bad, - even worse since the addition in 1.0, the game become painful. Player base tire and population vary so much in a single war due to burnouts that it worsens the imbalance. 
Hours and hours of work can literally burn in mere minutes, you won't even get the rewarding feeling that ""it held well even it fell"" because... well no one was there to defend, and the IA defences can't do much against PVE. There is nothing rewarding in that.

Developer do not moderate (or there is so very few things done that it make no difference). There is no anti cheat, no actions against abuse. There is no proper voice moderation nor text chat regulation. Nothing against bots, nor against alting, and griefing is only punished by ""player justice"", whether it is justified or not.

The game overall I think has a lot of potential and can be a very fun game at times, the sandbox aspect of the game and thousands of players working together to fight/build/run logistics to the frontline is such a great concept to the game.  However there are some major flaws that cause the game to have issues:

1- Clans and groups taking control of major resources and hoarding them, or preventing people from using them for other uses causes major issues and limits other players to enjoy the game.  This issue actually occurred to me my first week of playing, as I was looking to get some components and after harvesting a good number I had also gotten some broken ones, so I went to the groups facility (Who even put a sign saying will trade broken for fixed comps) and did the math and took them from the PUBLIC facility.  As I was leaving I was then shot by the group accusing me of stealing.

2 -  Server issues caused quite a number of big issues during the war, causing rollbacks to happen in which concrete bases (which are the toughest available) were reset after being destroyed multiple times for Wardens.  Not only that, the Colonials had an issue with their login servers to where they could not get into the game, and losing a zone because the Wardens could join in and push through without any issues.

This may be pure speculation, but based off the things that have happened this war, I can only help get the feeling that there is some biased hotfixes and rollbacks that only seem to favor one side.  The wardens had multiple tanks stolen recently after a server crash, and immediately the developers rolled back the server, restricted Colonials to get in the server around that area, and moved the tanks back towards the Wardens.  After that a hotfix was made to restrict tanks being taken after a server crash.  However as I previously stated the entire Colonial army could not login to a zone to try and push back an assault, but nothing was rolled back in that instance.

Will I still play this game?  Of course.  Even with the issues that have came up, I still managed to have a fun time doing it all from frontline combat, to logistics, to just harvesting resources.",1700681204,1700681204,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Here's a personal example:
I'm running logi and dropping off some supplies at a dockyard with my tanker ship. Clan comes up to me and starts cussing at me to move my ship because I'm blocking the deployment area. Instead of waiting for the few minutes it takes for me to submit all of my supplies and leave, they shoot at my tanker and then mass report me, which results in me getting banned in seconds.

The worst part is that there isn't even any kind of support for this widespread issue (just look at most of the negative reviews, it's almost the same story every single time). When I tried to inquire about it on the Discord, I was just straight up banned for no reason. What kind of moderation team enforces rule breaking?

The game in itself is fun, but the community is absolutely awful, especially the large clans who will just claim everything as theirs and just steal it from you.

Getting banned isn't even the worst part; the game displays your infractions publicly, which leads to getting mass reported for ""alting"" and getting another ban.

Devs only communicate any updates or progress of the game once every 3 to 4 months, then ghost us and the cycle continues. There are often bugs and balance issues that the community are very vocal about that seem to just get forgotten.

The game is divided into 2 asymmetrical factions which sound cool until you learn that one faction has weapons that are in general significantly more effective that the others, both factions have this but one overall has worse stuff.

Servers constantly go down, lagout or just dont work.",1631439507,1700637734,False,5,1,0.567939877510070801,2,True,False,False

The solution is the much needed port to UE5, or even their new Anvil Empires R2 Engine which could potentially support 1000 players per hex.

Foxhole is a supremely unique game, allowing you to contribute to multiple wars in the game. Every person you see running around is a player and they all have their jobs and things they need to do. I highly recommend that you work together with other players by joining one of the many clans within the game or get some friends to join you. There's so much you can do in this game. Whether it's getting materials to make supplies for the frontlines, or be at the frontlines in combat with the enemy, or healing the wounded and getting them back in combat. Foxhole's greatest feat is allowing you to choose what role you want. You're not forced into any role you don't want to be apart of.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Foxhole gives their players a choice of what they want to do and how they contribute to the war, which is more than most games give, especially how many roles you can play as in Foxhole.

[*]Foxhole gives you a choice of what faction you like to join and every faction has different weapons as well as vehicles you can choose from. 

[*]Any amount of cooperation with other players can change the tied of the battlefield. If you enjoy playing with other players and teamwork you would enjoy this.

[*]Foxhole's price is perfect for early access and for what it gives you. I never had any issues with the price, at least to me anyway.

[*]If you like lore, Foxhole has a massive amount of unexplored lore that the devs placed in wanting players to find. They also have a wiki talking about the lore and factions about Foxhole. So if you like having a background story during the wars this is also a fun thing they have.

[*]One last pro is the community is awesome, there's so much that the community does and makes up, yes it's a bit toxic here and there but in the end, the community is pretty cool and the devs are giving out some awesome upcoming updates.
[/list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Foxhole is a game that requires a massive amount of cooperation. I know I said this is a pro but to people who like to work alone this is a massive con. You can't do much on your own. All you can do on your own is send supplies to the front and just be 1 guy on the front but you'll end up dying more than anything.

[*]Foxhole is still in early access so there's still a bunch of bugs here and there, but I wouldn't let it ruin your experience being in a war-torn world.

[*]In Foxhole, there are sometimes massive queues in certain regions, so much that sometimes you'll be waiting for 10-15 minutes to get into it, there are ways around it but still a massive issue if Foxhole continues to grow. Queues happen when there are more members of a faction than the enemy side. It happens due to the server size as well. Only handing a certain amount of players.

[*]Another con to Foxhole is how you rank up, there's a commends system. So basically with what you do and how you do in the war, some other players will commend you which you need a certain amount to get a rank up. This is a very long process, so if people play this casually don't expect to get ranked up fast with this system. Some people will even ignore you if your rank is too small. When I was a Corporal in-game I was telling a 2ndLt and some other people that we were getting flanked but they refused to listen to me due to my low rank and they ended up getting flanked and killed by the enemy. Some people can be ignorant when it comes to those things.
[/list]

[b]Overall[/b], Foxhole is a fantastic game that gives you so many possibilities and roles you can be, especially with every new update the devs do that makes Foxhole so much more interesting. With the cooperation of other players, you can do anything to change the tide of the war. I highly recommend you try this game and if you don't like it you can always refund, but give it a chance, also try joining one of the many clans to get the full war experience Foxhole can truly be.

[b]Edit/Note[/b], New things are being added every season, so there's so much to look forward to in Foxhole. Best of all, the Community recommends things and the devs listen. - Edit Naval Update was added and brought me back to it a bit, Always loved Naval combat and beach landing in Foxhole, now even more it's possible to hit your targets by using battleships.

Be it a logistical driver in the back lines making guns and artillery shells or a medic trying to heal the wounded of the front line; each has its costs and its benefits. This game is relatively easy to get into, as it is often or not obvious where the front line is, thanks to the in-game map. Just spawn, press E, grab a gun, two mags, and a bandage, and you are off to the races. However, if you are not a fan of being a common (often disposable) grunt, you may not like frontline combat. 

Some of the good factors I found while playing in the last three wars.

1: Every day is an adventure. You will most likely do something new and meet new people every time you log on and go to a front.

2: The audio design is very good. Despite the camera being the way it is, guns feel unique and memorable. 

3: Plenty of jobs that you can pick from and get good at

4:  A job for anyone, and often any mood. If you want to fight in the frontline, go for it. Do you want to build Verdun? Go for it. Do you want to be a tanker? Go for it.

5: The lore (despite being a mess at times) is very cool, and you can find yourself immersed by your sides traditions. Like the Wardens (Also known as blueberries) often say, ""Praise Calahan."" 

There is plenty more probably that I can't think of right now.

Some negatives about the game:

1: The map is constant. There is little to no change to it, and eventually, you will see it all. Of course, there are unique landmarks and towns, but eventually, you will probably see it all, and I have not seen much change.

2: The war is constant, which means you build a base that needs defenders due to a lack of AI defence. And players don't spawn at your base to help you; chances are the nighttime players (Often Asain and European) will steamroll the base.  This also connects to my next point.

3:  Player count for each side can quickly become unequal and can stay like that, which means that you are often outproduced, out teched, and outnumbered in these situations because the other team simply has the manpower to do things. It can be rather demoralizing.

Apart from all this, I would rebuy it and recommend it to just about anyone. ( Updated ) (EDIT FOR 2023 game reward)",1630632888,1700596950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You feel there is not enough weapons or bandages on the front? You can make everything by yourself starting from the basic material you can collect on the field, then you can bring it by truck to the factory, where you can make weapons or other things from it. Then you can bring these to the frontline to help your soldiers!
You have much freedom, what roles you want to play in this game, be friendly and try to learn from the experienced players. Feel free to ask for help in chat and join teams to make the war effort greater, but you can always make difference alone, even if you don't feel so your help matter, however sometimes the weapons and aid you bring to the frontline bunker can arrive at crucial point of the fight on the part of the front!

6/14/2022: New review, but still the same old. If I thought the game was buggy before, it is a lot worse now. Lag is crazy from squads lists, to massive bunker bases, to just poor optimization of certain functions in the game. The land is still littered with rocks that you can't climb, blackholes from trenches, or trying to climb out of trenches being buggy unless you find the ""sweetspot"". QoL is awful for players unless you just pop in for an hour to play infantry on a frontline IF you can get through the queues. The devs have done a great job with such a small group to add so much to a game like this, but it feels like they are trying to rush to 1.0 and just leaving so many things broken to fix later if they do. Many things have been broken since I first played. It's just scummy in my eyes to ignore so many bugs and continually creating new bugs with new things being added and expecting the playerbase to just truck through it. This game solely relies on the player base to even function in the first place, and its the reason many players quit or take month long breaks from the game. I'll end off with saying at the current state I would rather play a different game to waste hours of my day and time to lose to alts or a volatile front in 30 minutes or go back to previous versions of this game.

11/20/2023: The game is still exactly in the same state it was over a year ago. Sure flashy new updates come and bring in a influx of new players who leave after a few wars and the population is back to the same usual number and devs do nothing for the ones that commit their time to the game. The newest naval update was a great concept and long awaited, but this update war has by far been THE worst war i've been involved in. the home region of all places being unable to get to from the world conquest, several regions crashing consistently, the ships introduced acting like floating fridges on water with how bad the handling is unless you use blueprint turn, creating a terrible asymmetric gunboat, and the drama from their flawed input of the next logi grind of rare metals. I come back every few wars and check in to see if they ever fix the things that are broken, but never do. The community is even more toxic than before from reddit to discord to in-game to faction specific streamers. The developers used to have very consistent updates letting the community know what was going on and created fun events to break up the monotonous of the wars. Dead Harvest and relic wars were great. The devs say they dont want any monetization in-game, but focus more on flashy new toys and a new art for foxhole store page to bring in new players, but wont improve the QOL in the game.",1575008655,1700532076,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game struggles with server issues due to population in any major update, bringing to question whether the devs can actually pay for the servers or deliver a game that is capable of living up to the Vision‚Ñ¢ or the supposed max player count. When there is an issue, the servers frequently fail to enter their recovery mode correctly, leading to unfair outcomes. And then if the devs intervene, because they have no clear or stated policy, that likewise ends up looking unfair.

Notable balance issues can go unaddressed for long periods of time as the devs insist on keeping balance tied to milestones in a roadmap rather than using incremental balancing common to modern PvP games (keeping in mind the average war length these days is well over a month). This, in combination with the questionable communication, leads to periods in the game where one faction or the other perceives the game/devs as biased.

The lack of good CM also means that the community is still one of the most hyperpartisan battlegrounds you'll encounter outside of American Twitter.

Each player should be able to PERMANENTLY RESERVE A LIMITED NUMBER of vehicles, like 3, so the truck i just loaded up with fuel doesn't get stolen with i got to make Basic materials real quick, plan and simple, not that hard to do, you have a limited number of commends for each player, you can keep track of that  why can't a system be implemented where players can reserve at least ONE vehicle that cant be unlocked by their own team, not the enemy team, but by the players on their OWN team. Please figure something out, but until the DEVS can fix this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it will ruin your day when you are working hard on something in a game after working hard in real life and players own your own team take your stuff you just worked hard on and think its funny, cause they know, you and no one else can stop them.

Warden bias in most aspects of the game. Dog shit game.
Naval update war:
Warden's concrete dies few times in a row... devs do rollback.
Wardens lose their supertank to Colonial, cause of skill issue, devs rollback and delete captured tank from Colonials. For fair they might to rollback concrete and equipment lost during this time, but no. Devs love only wardens.
Infantry stuff:
Warden infantry small arms is OP. Wardens have fiddler (SMG with very good accuracy and high damage for it firerate), sampo that literally clear out enemy infantry, blakerow which is much strongiest rifle in game, due it magasine size and accuracy and all warden rifles have better range, which in most ways mean that you as Colonial cant get close to make a shot, due bad accuracy of omen or low firerate and slow movement with volta. The only normal  Colonial infantry equipment were Dusk ( before movement debuff and accuracy nerf ). Thankfully Colonials have argenti. The only rifle that can compete to warden rifles. 
Anti tank stuff: 
Flask is OP, it tracks your any tank/halftrack with 100% armor always due its 7x modifier. Also flask has autoequip, like its very light antitank grenade with high damage and impact. And flask could be used on barges which means that you as Colonial cant fight against it ( even flask splash UNDER WATER can kill barge)
Colonial ignifist (igni) - ..... it was normal ((in 83rd war) no need was debuff it). it could pen and deal damage, but now it useless waste of resources that can't kill JEEP. Also it has no autoequip and cant be used on barges.
At rifles - wardens have bmat only mobile at rifle, which can make lot dirt to your ac/tanks (even in late)/ht. 
Colonial at rifle - ""uh... you know I didnt knew that at rifle means rifle, thats why I made tripod at gun"" and this at  gun can be destroyed and dissappeared in 1 shell of enemy tank. Also this costs rmat ( some will say with facility its almost free and costs bmat ( well yes)) but why I need, as Colonial, to build facility to produce it for bmat when wardens can produce it on factory? 
Tanks:
Warden tank produce lines is OP and no dont pay attention on cost, cause its a joke, if to be honest for these toys, very VERY CHEAP.
Outlaw 40mm 45m range tank that have shift speed boost and great movement. Why its not facility pad locked? Wardens have AT turrets outlaw ( why its not base variant)? 
Chieftain - facility locked imortal tank for pve (In game there's armor mechanic which can no give you damage if armor of your tank got ricoschet. All wardens tank, chieftain ( silverhand ( base variant)) have very strong armour that often catch ricoshets). And this tank can live under AT garrisson fire much longer than 2 balistas. And it has a 200 ammo box size machine gun for 360' turret and QRFing it is not possible if you play as infantry which Colonial at stuff ( dont say "" Use bane/venom"", cause its cant penetrate it and you have only 3 at rockets at maximum, if you want to be able to run and qrf before your defences go down).
STD - super tank destroyer.... 3 shots to battletank and it dies. Very fast, too high damage and powerful armour than silverhand.
SHT - super heavy tank... thats fine if main gun were in center of corpus. Well ofc there Colonial SHT too, but Colonial is useless due its guns located in center of corpus, which is big dev mistake.
Colonial tanks: 
Its a fucking shame and piece of shit. 
Colonials have mass production tanks like balista and falchion, but it doesnt help alot, due players limit in one hex that dont allow to realise this quantity, which costed to tanks quality.
Falchion - mpf tank 40mm 40m range, but almost no armour. The only reason why people use it, cause Spatha ( 40mm 40m range tank and only normal 40mm tank in Colonial late game ) now is facility locked and cant be produced in mpf as it was before, which is too big mistake of devs.
Balista - no speed, no armor, no movement, but mpf tank and have 3 more slots than chieftain. Yeah good tank ( no, it dies very quickly always), when wardens come with flask it means death with no chance for balista. If balista had more speed and 360' mg than ok.
LTD - paper tank, that could be decrewed by pistol, cause open top and back.
Bardiche - the only tank that colonials can use, sadly it has 35m range, not 40m, which could solve many balance issues if devs make bardiche 40m range wikthout changing other paramenters.

The Winter Update as always brought great new art to the game but after that most of the new addition make the game majorly worse. Artillery has been reworked to take out skill and ability to kill tanks with artillery. The Gunboat went from most powerful artillery in game to being weaker than a barge. Colonials do not even need to use tactics anymore they can just spam tanks that are half the cost and double the HP of warden tanks, the game balance is broken. The developers ignore this inbalance but patched one of the rifles after day 1 even though there was nothing fundamentally wrong with it they just did not like that Warden clans were more organized so they felt colonials needed a buff against organization. It a shame we had a great war 69 that was soley based on strategy and tactics and for update war we get mindless artillery rework that ruins the balance of the game. Not to mention one faction can shoot artillery 50 meters further than the other. 

Game is still not closed to balance, currently factions are WW1 France vs 1946 USSR. Wardens win soley based on skill.

The Summer Update plus removal of mods has made this game AMAZING! I gave the game a positive review then. Recently the devs felt game was broken so they reworked entire game yet AGAIN, this time it has failed so hard pop is dropping even when game is on sale. There is no reason to play this game if population is below 600, if you want a war experience you do not get this during low pop. 

This game police free speech harder than any other game I have played. I have seen Colonial players used report feature to get Warden players permantely banned simply for using slang curse words (not even full words). The developers became really hostile to players recently.

Foxhole. This game is good in concept. Bad in execution. Let me start with your time.

So, I just had a blast, I was in a tank, killing the enemy, running around killing partisans, ran out of fuel, got some more, killed more partisans, enemy was attacking and pushing beyond the bridge, I swung around with my buddy and we murdered them all and got our allies back up onto the bridge before they could counter us with AT. Waited a while for some enemy to show up, then found some and attacked them, then went back to waiting. Eventually we REALLY ran out of fuel and had to head home. 

I wanted to keep the tank. 

I'm in a clan so I went to a storage depot to return the tank and keep it for later. This is where the problems began. 

I went to the nearest storage depot a sector away, ok, and tried inputting my tank to save it for later. It tells me I need to repair the armour. Ok fine. The nearest garage is 2 Sectors away.  Full server changing map sectors. Ok fine.. I'll drive there. I found some fuel along the way. So I drive, and drive, and finally get to the garage. Then the garage tells me, I need 100 bmats to repair the armour. ....Okay Fine... Where are bmats? Scrounge around for these damn bmats and finally repair the tank, refuel and then take it to the nearest storage depot. 3 sectors away from where I want the tank to be when I play again tomorrow. 


This, why do I have to go through all of this just to keep the tank? There are plenty of other situations where it's annoying and tedious on purpose and it doesn't have to be. Sure I get 100 bmats to repair ok. But why aren't there more garages, refineries, etc? It's just wasting my god damned time.



Naval Update:
Naval units are so expensive they're not worth it. We have all in our clan literally decided not to use them. Subs are severely too expensive to be worth using as the enemy destroyers can just ping away at us and kill us. 
The QOL is so abysmal for it as well.
Battleships are useless after you get onto the land obviously, They're only useful for bombardment on the shore and a bit inland. No one foolish enough would dare attack the batlteship without a full enough fleet, and once again the price is exorbitant.

there are so many ways to play it and do whatever you want 
but like most game its not perfect! and need some more things flushed out such as

-locking system
 
everything you own will be wrenched by friendly's and stolen if u look away one second ! precious   expensive important vehicles Like trains always being stolen !! so they need to have something like privet train station there where u can permanently lock it and cannot be wrenched 

-squad management

squad system is atrocious and bare bone ! there is no higher rank in squad itself no fixed squad leader if you made the squad and u gone offline !! someone else will be the leader !! 

and that someone when he is not active in the squad he is leading can still be the leader and the original owner or maker of that squad cannot kick or do anything about it

not a jump in and play game. you need lots of hours to grind and learn or build
Game is also suffering from serious balancing or just quality of team issues as both servers have the wardens destroying the colonials.
Then there is the building reservation system that keeps things private but actually leads to very serious griefing issues where other people can come in and claim something if you forget and you can no longer use that building to craft.
DEVS PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!! If you build something no one and i mean NO ONE else should be able to just takeover you stuff until it times out after like a week of the owner being offline.
someone has snuck in and claimed both my powerstations from under my nose and now i cant turn my power back on to build things to supply the front!

then there is the issues of ALT accounts that clearly have a impact on the game. Sabotaging vital routes and facilities or stealing vehicles to bring back across lines for their friends to take all while dressed as the team they are hurting.

UI needs to be streamlined and overhauled as the current system has become more complicated then the US government

Or, if a clan mass reports, you collect player logs on all of the people reporting and the person reported of the last 5 minutes and make it a manual review, because manual reviews should exist in a MMO. Go ahead and start getting some GM's or moderators who will actually start cracking down on the trolling and racism, I'd do it for free but considering I've never seen anyone other than 1 admin, I don't think you're hiring.

- My positive review with 28 hours of playtime

Update: 
I am honest that I like the New Super tank and Battle Tank but..
The Game changed from being chill to a stressful game. Logistic back then was very complex, gathering resource was easy since it is infinite. With limited resources now and expensive assets, you are very limited with operations, not only that most of the stuff that needs producing take a long time. On the player side, well slowly it's turning into tribalism. Groups/Clans do not cooperate well together, because of personal agenda (to what I have seen atleast) and would do things independently. Besides that I would only play the Update Wars, since playing everyday will make you bald. There are still a lot of bugs in the game and Griefing often occurs on both sides.

I liked the gritty feeling to it, the unique perspective and system of shooting, and the idea that is was a constant, live world war with players all around the world. Plus, the game had pretty good specs and ran mostly fine. The graphics are really good and I like the art style.

For those not interested in reading my entire thesis, here are the bullet points for why I wouldn't recommend this games:
[list]
[*] Foxhole is highly social. You will not get the most out of it without a mic and discord server with friends or a 'regiment'. Most vehicles require multiple people cooperating and communicating in order to use them. This isn't why I'm not recommending the game, I'm just putting this here to warn others like myself who thought they can play this solo/casually.
[*] Total lack of QoL features. Doing even the simplest things in the game requires an excessive micromanagement, mouse clicking and keyboard pressing. 
[*] Time is wasted liberally in this game. Logistics is a constant, tedious grind, all so OTHER players can have fun. Lack of QoL features also wastes time. If you have a job or an actual life, then forget about it, because playing this game is basically a second job.
[*] The game makes you feel guilty for playing it. Since every weapon, magazine, tank etc is made and delivered to bases by players, wasting these materials is bad. Knowing how awful logistics is, you basically avoid using anything more advanced than a rifle in fear of losing that weapon and thus wasting another player's time.
[*] Occasionally the playerbase is toxic and takes the game far more seriously than they should.
[*] The game has a research system. When a war starts, 90% of the equipment in the game will be flat out unavailable anyway, regardless of whether you have the materials to produce them. You have to rely on logistics players to deliver aluminum to engineering facilities to advance the research for your faction. This takes IRL days, so you're stuck with your basic rifle anyway.
[/list]
Below I'll expand on this points in more detail.

As I said, the game is highly social. If you don't have a mic and were thinking of playing Foxhole casually/solo, say after work at the end of the day, then this isn't a game for you at all. This is a hardcore game and will take hours of your times just to do very little in the grand scheme of things, and to get the most out of it, a mic is the minimum requirement. I'd also recommend joining a regiment. Most of the game will simply not be workable otherwise.

That was a bit of a bummer, since I don't have a mic and don't intend on getting one, but what really killed my joy for the game is the total lack of QoL features, and the fact that the developers seem focused on expanding the boring aspects of game as much as possible while minimising the fun parts.

In any other game, when you spawn in, you automatically have the weapons and kit you need. In this game, you have to spawn in a rear base, travel for five minutes (usually on foot) to a forward base (closer to actual combat), manually set your respawn so that in the VERY likely scenario that you die in combat, you won't respawn again in the rear base. Then you have to manually go into the base's inventory/stockpile and equip a rifle and some magazines. You almost always equip just basic stuff, because people die so often in this game that if you want to use anything more complex, you have to be 100% sure you can use it effectively, otherwise when you die that weapon is likely lost. That's IF you equip anything, btw, because people die so often that it's often encouraged to just navigate your way to the active warzone and loot the gun and the appropriate magazines from the bodies littering the ground (while dodging bullets). I'm not going to lie, that part is actually kind of fun, but sometimes you just want to get into the game and shoot stuff without all that time wasting time scavenging off bodies.

You COULD grab the SMGs/RPGs/Tanks/etc if you want, but unless you're very experienced, you're probably just going to waste it by dying immediately. Thus, the game makes you feel guilty for doing basically anything fun or unique in the game, because all the equipment/resources are extract/refined/manufactured/delivered by players. That's ignoring the fact that often groups of players will claim ownership over resources/equipment, so that you can't use them even if they're publicly available. If you try to, you'll be team killed.

Plus, the inventory and equipping system is janky. Say you have already set your spawn in a forward base and you've just been killed. When you respawn you have nothing but a pistol, so you have to manually access the base's inventory, grab a rifle and magazines (which isn't instant btw, it takes ""assembly time""). Then you have to close the base's stockpile, open your inventory, transfer the rifle from your backpack to your hands, close your inventory, press 1 to equip the rifle, then press R to load it. You have to do this every single time you die (which is a lot). I just wish a rifle and 1 magazine/clip were part of the ""soldier supplies"" to begin with, and that when I transfer a weapon to my hands from my backpack, the game automatically equips it instead of forcing me to press 1 every time. If you swap a rifle for an SMG, the game automatically unequips you, instead of just keeping you holding whatever is in your main weapon slot. It's janky, unintuitive, tedious, time-wasting and unnecessary.

Another thing, because of the social and hardcore aspect of the game, it tends to attract sweats, tryhards and buzzkills. They take the game far more seriously than it deserves, and so they ruin it for everyone else trying to have fun.

Another thing that I briefly touched on before is that this game will waste hours of your time. Grinding for logistics, delivering supplies to the front, equipping basic weapons to go fight, just to die and wait some more to respawn. This is how logistics goes: once you have made or requisitioned a truck, fuelled it, driven to a scrap yard, bashed the scrap, filled your truck with scrap, drove to a refinery, refined the scrap into usable materials, delivered the materials to a factory, manufactured guns/ammo/whatever, then congratulations! You can now spend the next 30 minutes driving back to the forward base, loading several servers in the process along the way (since the map is so huge that each region is a separate server, so to travel between regions requires loading time), just to deliver a dozen rifles and a handful of bandages that they needed an hour ago, and which someone else has probably done already. That's if there aren't enemy ""partisans"" (i.e. enemy players in friendly territory) that don't kill you during your journey, thus undoing about an hour of two of progress.

This game is TEDIOUS. Torturously boring. Logistics is so convoluted and dull, that half the game is unplayable except if you're playing a podcast or youtube video in the background, while playing truck driving simulator to the front. It sounds cool and unique on paper, but actually playing it is frighteningly dull. All for what? So you can support OTHER people's fun? To deliver a tiny amount of supplies that probably won't make a difference, since every war lasts about a month?

The game feels more like a social experiment than a game. As a result, I can't recommend this game unless you're looking specifically for a game that is a chore from start to finish, in which you can waste hours ans hours of your life contributing minimally to anything in the game.",1700257476,1700257476,False,6,0,0.546561777591705322,1,True,False,False

You need a group of about 5 players regularly playing to really enjoy much of the game. Building and gathering is extremely time intensive and all of the work that can go into a base of 50 hours building and mantaining can go up in flames very quickly if you don't log in regularly. 

So if you bypass base building and upgrading vehicles you got the combat, which is decent. The combat is a bit simple but due to the sheer amount of equipment from field guns, tanks, and small arms equipment smg, rifles, grenades, and flamethrowers etc you get alot of tactical options. With all those tactical options though, you again need a group to work with, that or rely on the many many random people out doing their own things.

 So you may log into fight a bit and have a very boring stalemate of people running around willy nilly dying one by one with no aim, or you log in seizing ground inch by inch through well coordinated pushes, or better yet blitz the land with a group of people that synergize well and use the gear for awesome combined arms. There is alot going on in this game thanks to all the equipment being player made, but this also hampers the game because you just can't do much without a large group or extremely dedicated small group.

I can't recommend a game like this just due to it being too  unreliable in delivering a fun experience, I don't want to my fun to be completely dependent on many random people and can't force my friends to play a game. Still cool game when all the cogs are running.

To my complaint to the game moderator on team-killing and false-reporting that resulted in my ban from the game, the game moderator's reply in essence was: the appropriate course of action is to hope that other players will join you in vote-kicking the offenders. No apology or direct action taken. I have not touched this game since then. There are friendly and toxic players, but here the toxicity stands out not because of the players but because the developers are the enabler of the toxicity.

There is a legal duty for shop owners to protect their customers. This duty is based on the concept of premises liability, which states that property owners have a responsibility to keep their premises safe for their customers. This means that shop owners must take reasonable steps to prevent injuries to customers on their property. The protection extends to harassment from fellow customers. 

The same legal duty is expected of the owner of this game. While the customers are on the game‚Äôs premises, i.e. the game server space, the customers are expected to be protected by the owner of the game. Unfortunately the owner of the game has failed to take reasonable steps to protect its customers from harassment by other customers while on its premises. Since the owner is a Canadian, all we need is a Canadian customer who was harassed by other customers to file a lawsuit. If the lawsuit succeeds, a class action lawsuit can follow.

Alts sit in a trench somewhere with a radio that does far more damage than any of the above.

THEY WILL NEVER EVER BAN HACKERS BUT WILL BAN LOYAL PLAYERS WHO SPEAK POORLY OF THERE GAME.  NO MODERATION AT ALL.  NO COMUNICATION FROM THE DEVS ABOUT BUG FIXES, BUG FIXES NEVER HAPPEN.  ONLY FOCUS IS ON SHINY NEW VEHICLES AND MORE CONTENT THAT ADDS NO REAL VALUE OTHER THAN MORE BUSY WORK FOR THE PLAYERS.   DEVS DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO FIX THERE GAME BUT CONTINUOUSLY ADD MORE UNPLAYABLE END GAME GARBAGE THAT DOESNT WORK HALF THE TIME AND THAT NO ONE CAN EVEN BUILD BECAUSE OF HOW EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING IT IS. 

JUST TODAY GOT NIGHT FIRE SHOT AND SHOT FROM AN INVISIBLE PERSON WHICH IS NEW. 

Getting Night Fired is basically shot at threw the fog of war where someone shouldnt be able to see you yet because your not in range but they can see further at night using hacks.
Alting is where they make a 2nd account and play on the other faction and just use a radio to sit and get infinite intel about everything.  Then they call out all this info to there regiments and even in world chat to the whole faction.  

Speed Hacking is where they can up there characters move speed
There is also aim hacks ppl have used before
There is hacks that allow your tanks to shoot faster basically increasing the speed of the reload timer.
All of these cheats have been documented by streams through clips and videos.  The people in these clips still play the game. 

I saw discord message leaks of people admitting to hacking and cheating then i literally saw the people from those messages in game the very next day still playing.  I saw someone who stream sniped Summit when he played using alted info to guide summit around defenses.  Without Summit knowing this obviously.  Person still plays the game.  Then a year later he was still playing.  This same person then went to someones twitch chat who was griefing the colonials vehicles by throwing them into the water and they told them where to go to grief and who to grief and encouraged them to do this.  That person still plays the game.  All these instances where there is hard evidence of people hacking, cheating, exploiting and alting. 
 These people STILL DONT GET BANNED.  

It doesnt matter how much evidence you have it will not change anything.
Constantly getting stuck in terrain, constant lag due to poor optimization,  No balance whatsover,  Dev's will roll back servers for one faction.  The Cheating/Alting/Hacking has been happening for years constantly with no mention to stop or try to prevent it.  No ban waves,  And even when people do get banned they make another alt instantly for 3 dollars and continue to cheat and hack.  There main will never get banned.  Players are expected to moderate the game yet can abuse this by mass reporting and banning innocent players.  Everything is Clunky and unoptimized.  Lag in regions that have a lot of bases/concrete.  Combat is just bad, prone = invulnerable, trenches = invulnerable.  People Glitching into mountains to be invulnerable.  Can't climb out of dead concrete bases.  You will lag backwards 5 seconds and get hit by a bullet even know your behind cover,  You will get stuck in literally anything and everything.  You can get stuck under a trench in water and drown.  half the time you cannot climb outta trenches in general.  


Rain encumbrance is a dog water mechanic but supposed to be colonial advantage.  Oil coats do nothing. Tiny row boat being able to block a massive barge or large boat.  character not being able to swim more than 5 feet without drowning.  Bridge battles... being absolutely the worst part of any front.  Border Bases being horribly designed and never mentioned for years and years.  Border bases giving free mats because why?  I mean there's so much wrong with this game you literally couldnt fit it into 1 single post.  The only Thing that makes up for a lot of these flaws is the fact that there's no other game with the depth of logi.  But most of Logi is just plain and simple busy work that is mindless and boring.  Something to do while watching TV or listening to music,  Why play something just to be doing something else while playing.  Most ppl will say doing logi is like a second job because its something that has to be done but no one really wants to do it.  It's interesting to provide stuff for the war effort but not to swing a hammer for 8 hours straight at nodes.  These devs have had so many opportunities to turn this into a successful game but they squandor it adding more busy work for the players and providing no new player experience or retention while also letting the cheaters ruin everything.  

Then going a step further and actively helping one faction during the war.  The Bias is obvious and has been for a very long time but the real problem is they  let hackers and alts run rampant with no repercussions forever without care.  People who are holding out hope just don't, they will never change because they have had a million opportunities to do so and never have.  They will continue to add more unusable garbage and will not fix or moderate there game.  I come back every now and then to see how the moderation has changed.  I literally get night fired cheated on 4-5 times in my first session back every time as well as seeing speed hacking first day back playing almost every single time i pick the game back up.  It's almost always the same clans and players who just openly exploit/alt/hack every day all day.  They do it because they know they will never get banned.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!  

And if you do play don't expect any cheaters to be banned, expect to face hackers and alts on a regular basis.  If you can look past that then you can have some fun occasionally.  It's to bad devs continue to disappoint and drive players away.   

If you got this far shout out to all the dope players coming together to have some fun times!  Maybe anvil will be better lol xD",1700002478,1700003591,False,6,2,0.44620668888092041,0,True,False,False

  This game has grown on me more. I have discovered there are solo options , and I have really enjoyed this game so far. Since I have purchased this , I have not played anything else. Very fun and very addicting especially if you commit yourself to 1 war (server) till the finish.

  I was playing the colonials . Built a tank , supplied it , linked up with another tank , recruited a squad of 12 or so infantry , planned an assault over a bridge to take a fortified position. Our tanks punched a hole in the enemy line , and our infantry stormed in after to secure our gains. Worked like a charm. We took the flag , and using the resources the enemy kindly left us there , managed to win the war 2 days later.

  Game is great. Has gotten much better. A lot has been added and the war is HUGE. Very fun once you get into it.

No scamming micro-transactions! This game is simply fun and addicting! Lots of Frontline warfare, with many players of two opposing sides making an IMPACT to the world during a Persistent War. Everything is player Controlled, Run and Made. Infantry, Engineers, Medical, Tanks, Naval, Artillery, Logistics, Partisans and so on. Play as you like. You can play this solo but do expect to work with others on the field to get more things done like running a facility or operate multi-crew vehicles. Lots of veteran players who are willing to help you out, don't be afraid to ask. Also check out Foxhole's Discord and Wiki for more [the community make support apps and reskin and over mods too]. Its not you're typical shooter or MMO.

Buy the Game, Choose a side, Spawn on the Front, Grab a Rifle, a Few Mags, a bandage for bleeding and GO FIGHT! o7

SUGGESTION/TIP for NEW PLAYERS: Press 'T' to speak in Local Chat.
Now go Learn the game by finding a higher ranked player/squad/clan that is willing to assist in teaching you. Its better to learn how people play and operate in this game. Doing something dumb that damages the team might anger another teamplayer and resulting in conflict.

2. Poor game balance: Before the newest updates, It seems the DEVs are very hostile to Colonials. However now, destroyers of Colonials have a huge advantage over submarines of Wardens. I don't know how they deal with such a terribly balanced game.
3. Boring logistics: Work work...Why am I playing this shit but going to work and earn some money for a delicious meal?
4. Almost useless tutorial: Teach your grandma how to play foxhole, duh?
5. Worst game servers: I have never seen the servers of a game could be so terrible.Endless connection failures, Dopped from the games, Waiting for the queue and then drop from the game, Amazing!
6. Impassable grasses and bushes: In the The Deadland, there are many anti-tank grasses and bushes, And any trees of this game can not be destroyed, too. They will make you crazy one day.

Okay, When you accept all of What is said above, you will find these in this game:
7. Meaningless trenchs, foxhole, or other defenses: Sometimes I thought the trashes of these defenses may be built by the spies?

I find it relaxing to chill down with Truck Simulator sometimes, and Foxhole can be the same way.  Except that when you haul a load of goods in Truck Simulator from Flagstaff to Las Vegas, there's no real point to it.  But in Foxhole, you know you're bringing things to the front lines that they need.

Every shell, vehicle, gun, trench, barbed wire, uniform is made by people and brought to the front lines by people.  A lot of interesting game mechanics are at play here.  For example to shoot artillery, you need a couple of people operating the gun to move it, someone outside of the gun with binoculars to see where the enemy is and direct the shots, and someone to load the gun.  You can sort of get away with doing it with 2-3 people instead of 4, and with multiple guns, you might be able to change the balance of who loads things for truly optimal efficiency.

It's also like factory and truck simulator game, in the back lines, as well as trains and freighters in the water.  And it's also possible to infiltrate enemy lines and mess with their logistics.  There are trucks, trains, factories, flatbeds, cranes.

One thing that surprised me is that things like boats, tanks, and planes are far more accessible to a new player than I expected.  The challenge is learning and figuring out how to do it, which is fun in itself.  For example, you might think as I did that something like building a tank is only for people who assemble in a large team and work on it for a long time.  But in truth, you can build a low-end tank yourself in, say, 1 hour.  But for me it took me days of learning and experimentation to figure out how to do that.  The trick is don't try to gather the materials by hand; start by building something else that makes it easier to do the next step.  Similar to how in Ark Survival Evolved building a stone house is a big ordeal, but if you get yourself a wood gatherer and a stone gatherer first it's not such a big deal.

Another thing that really struck me as unusual was the community.  Driving a truck around the back lines, whenever we'd accidentally crash into each other due to high traffic, people would say ""oops, sorry"" via voice, which is always active by default.  Once when I was in the training ground shooting artillery, there was another guy learning there, and after we missed a shot, he said ""Hold on a sec. I need to do some math.""  These are not typical gamers.

Rank and promotions are solely a function of how many people click to give you a commendation. Each person is limited to commending someone else a certain number of times per day.  It felt really great to figure out how to do medical and spend some time out there keeping our people going and discovering I'd been promoted at the end of that session.

If anyone's old enough to have played an old f2p game on the ""Sony Online"" platform called Infantry - the ""core"" gameplay is similar - You are part of a (very) big faction, fighting over a persistant map. A lot of different equipment can be used, next to a very large selection of vehicles. On top of that, a very complex and complete building and logistics system fuels the whole thing - base building, resource extraction and conversion, actual supply chains complete with transport by land and sea, trucks trains and boats... It's very similar to EVE Online in that aspect too. 
You can play solo or in a clan, both are viable however if you want to really experience the deeper aspects of the game (serious base building, tank warfare, artilery missions or the brand new naval combat) you really should get in a nice clan because these types of resources are not available unless you build them yourself - which you can't do all alone ;)
Free expansions usually add a lot of new features...

Next to the whole gameplay aspect of the game, there's the community - It's also similar to EVE Online, with a lot of ""on the spectrum"" and general ""internet idioicy"" all over the place. Imagine vanilla WoW Barrens chat, but multiplied by a ton. Basically if you've grown up with the 90s internet you'll be right at home.

After really getting into this game recently and enjoying the mechanics. 
The disgusting side of it emerged. TOXIC player base. Players from the same team can decide if they don't like you because of competition for resources or building space to run up to your facilities flag them and destroy them without repercussions and when you defend yourself you are banned and kicked for TK.
I don't get how the devs allow this. You can report them but that doesn't stop them from destroying your stuff. In a game as grind as this it's Unplayable at that point when you've put in days of work to get gear and vehicles only to get grieved. CGC clan is a prime example of trash player base. 

I was also getting some resources from a factory and ran a guy over from another clan,whom I didn't see. As I was on the road where vehicles are meant to travel not made for people to walk on. And this guy starts lecturing me on the inconvenience I've caused him and his clan.. It's pathetic actually tell me how to play the game etc.

SOLO:
You are essentially forced to work in a regiment (a clan) to get cool equipment. While it is possible to build stuff as a solo player it will require a chunk of your time. Cooperating is sometimes easy, other times it is difficult as regiments claim 'their stuff' in the form of resource nodes.

GROUP:
The developers have created the logistic and base system to supposedly make the game better, however, in reality it necessitates large clans. The limited number of nodes, combined with the labor required to maintain bases at said nodes, creates a system where large clans dominate: while smaller ones die due to not having the 'fun stuff'.

THIS IS A HIGH STAKES MULTIPLAYER GAME!

I will try and use this review to drive a point trough that many people might not immediately get when approaching the game for the first time. People discover this game and become enamored by the concept of a massive player driven MMO war, that's what happened the moment I discovered it and I had a blast playing it ever since. BUT! I repeat myself.

THIS IS A HIGH STAKES MULTIPLAYER GAME! 

At first glance this might seem absurd right? This is the game where you play as a single soldier in a massive war, a cog in the machine, your actions are mostly minimal and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. How could this possibly be a high stakes game? All of those statements are true, however the counterpoint lies in the fact that we are all fighting in a SINGLE month long war, and people REALLY want to win. The stakes become even higher when you consider people are spending hours every day building, gathering resources, planning, training, recruitnig, studying just to get that W. 

This game is not like a single 25 minute match on your average MP game, people really get passionate about their faction and winning the war. This passion is, in my opinion, one of the most amazing and unique aspects of the game, It is the main driver behind the comradery and dedication you will often find on the battlefield. This passion brings out the magic moments of cooperation where hundreds of players organically acomplish something amazing like an epic last stand, an overwhelming offensive or even building a megabase.

But on the flipside, everyone expects you to be a team player. And being a good team player might not seem exactly obvious when you are starting the game. The vast majority of the community is super receptive of new players and someone will almost allways help if you are struggling with any aspect of the game, just ask around in voice or text chat. Does this mean your actions as a single new player actually have a significant impact on the front or even the greater war itself? 

NO!
(99% of the time at least, there are some things you can do that can really screw everyone up, but don't think too hard about that. Just don't build any bridges by yourself and you will be fine.)

Your negative actions or missplays won't cause everyone to lose, but people may call you out on it. Not because you are going to tank the war by yourself, but because you might not know what you are doing. Not knowing obviously does not make you a bad team player. The problem arises when you don't know what you are doing and you don't care. In this case you are not being a team player, and people care about that, players are passionate and they won't be receptive of new players wasting public resources selfishly.

Now, a few ways not to be a bad team player when starting out:
-Be humble and always assume you are ignorant! If you are not sure how something works ask first before wasting public resources !
-If you want to learn a new weapon ask how to use it, don't waste all the public special weapons by dying while brute forcing your learning!
-If you want to drive a tank just ask for a tank crew, don't just drive one by yourself!
-If you want to build a base ask if you are in a good spot!
-Never build bridges without massive infantry and vehicle support behind you.

Fundamentally you will have to understand this is not a game about YOU, In Foxhole we all win together, all the thousands of players on the same faction. This goes for new and old players even some elitist player clans. If you become humble and understand that we are all in this war together, you will experience the joy of being a good team player in an amazing community.

Shooting and driving mechanics can be a bit jank at times, but that is a negligible issue for what this game brings to the table. 

The problem lies with the total player control and clans being as big as they are, if you plan to be part of a clan then i assume you'd have little to no issues. However from my experience being a solo player, trying to stay committed to the front or even having fun can be strained when interacting with some clan members. The total power given to players means that some members of clans will act insanely pretentious, and will at best disregard other players thoughts/ideas outright, and at worst you will be tk'd if you are seen to be interfering with their work, even if that isn't the case. From my experience they're no point trying to reason with these individuals as they will simply argue against/disregard your point.

It is very fun.
You can switch your play style however you like.

You wanna have more chill gameplay? Do backline logistics - mine resources, build facilities with your friends, produce everything from bullets and weapons to tank.
You wanna have a bit more thrill? Do frontline logistic - haul produced goods from the backline to the frontline, look which regions is running low on what, check for partisans on your route and weigh your option between the faster or the more secure routes and get celebrated as you bring in the much needed ammo, medical suplies and materials to fix tanks and buildings.
You wanna have action and kill wardens... I mean enemies? Go to the frontlines, fight in the trenches, kill enemy tanks, or man your own tank with friends or random players.
You wanna have even more thrill? Be a partisan - sneak into enemy territory, disrupt their logistics, destroy equipment before it even reaches the frontline, destroy whole production facilities or just sabotage them sneakily and have the enemy look for hours why their production isn't running, because you destroyed one of their power lines.

Now you are wondering: ""That sounds like a fun game for everyone - solo players, coop with friends, coop with strangers. Why the negative review?""
Well, let me tell you about alts and cheaters.

First the obvious - there are cheaters out there, which simply circumvent mechanics like limited sight at night, which conveniently lag every time you shoot at them or which are able to fly over or run through structures.
And then there are alts - players who have a second account on the enemy side and use it to grief, spy, give equipment to their side, screw with your fabrication, block logistics by putting stuff in the way or disable your massive defences by parking trucks in front of your automatic guns.

Let me paint a scenario:
You have built a small facility with your friends, gathered resources over multiple days, traded with other groups to finally build a big battle tank. What could go wrong?

Alts taking your resources along every step of the way and just load it into a truck and driving it into a river or into the frontlines.
You would have been okay if the occasional player uses your buildings to refines their resources or even take a bit for their own needs, but now you have to make private stockpiles, lock everything away and start guarding and shooting at your own ppl, because they could be griefers, but often you just kill a curious new player who was exploring.

You dealt with griefers, so what else can hinder you building the beauty of a battle tank and having fun with your friends killing some wardens... I mean enemies?

Well, innocent looking player from your faction with binoculars look at your facility and stalk out where you store your resources, where your important production buildings are, act as if they are newbies and look exactly at how much stuff you have in your stockpiles.
And a few minutes later a single partisan or a group of them sneak along the borders a few hexes into the backlines and make a bee line to your stockpile, destroy it and leave.

So now you build start building defences - place pill boxes that shoot at enemies, build trenches and bunkers, haul tons of resources just for building them and pay their upkeep and shoo away and shoot at every player that comes even near your facility.

Just so you can be finally save and have you facility survive just the last few hours until the battle tank rolls from your assembly pad.. and finally you are done. You see the majestic curves, the smell of fresh oil - there it is. Now you just need to call your friends back from mining resources, put ammo and fuel into it and drive it to the front.

As you do suddenly you notice a hauler parked right in front of your defence. You wrench it open to check which newbie parked it in the most inconvenient place ever and drive it a bit further down the road. But as you enter the truck you hear explosions coming from your facility, you run back and you see a single partisan, which ignored all the overfilled stockpiles and important production buildings and went straight to where your tank was waiting for it's first action since its birth.
And you only see a smoking husk, which just despawns as you arrive. The partisan is quickly dealt with and you can still hear their spiteful laughter as you think about how you have to tell your friends that your weekend of driving you snazzy new battle tank was ruined by a single person with 2 accounts.

Your friends and you are now close to rage-quitting the game, but you decide to give it another try, you schedule your vacation time, use another week to gather the resources and are organising guard shifts among yourselves and finally you are sitting sleep deprived, but happy on your way to the front in your new battle tank ""Betty II"".
You dodge the conveniently abandoned cars on the road, the 3 ambushes which totally random pop up exactly where you are driving, despite you first driving on smaller not often used roads and then even completely off-road over the ripening fields of corn, seeing the raging farmer in front of your inner eye.

You arrive at the front, talk to other tank crews, are celebrated as the reinforcements everyone was waiting for, form a tank line, barely survives the enemy infantry concentrating their hail of AT-RPGs and anti tank grenades on you and there it is. The sound every tank driver dreads... the ringing of the bell of a bicycle and just as you are pulling back to fix the holes in your formerly pristine battle tank, they park behind you and for some reason a single bike is even sturdier than a reinforced wall... No screaming and cursing at the lowly Private on his bike helps, the enemy pushes forward despite it being dusk and you, your friends and Betty II the battle tank explode, sucking in their last bit of fresh air - ultimately killed by a bicycle.

So now you find yourself typing an angry report of this player and his bike. Looking if you have any message about the reports of the previous 10 accounts of alts over the last 2 weeks. Looking through the forums to see dozens if not hundreds of stories similar to your own. And you decide enough is enough. You edit your previous positive steam review from an enthusiastic report about the helpful community and the many-faceted gameplay options to a report of your heart-crushing futile fight against players, who don't play by the rules and devs who don't seem to care, because every alt is just another sold copy of their game... and you leave defeated looking for a game without pvp, because human scum always find a way to kill the fun for everyone.

Foxhole is a great concept and has a (mostly) good community.
But, Foxhole is a grind. Now I usually like a grind but the Foxhole grind is never ending and never fun.
Every war is the same.
Sit around bridges early game getting sniper or grenade rushed.
Mid-Game is just an artillery spam so good luck having fun because all you're gonna do is get nuked by artillery.
Late game is just tank spam so good luck having fun because if you're a solo player you won't get a tank or any decent AT.

Decided to play Logi or work really hard Solo to get a tank or cool vehicle or build a cool base?
Too bad! Because despite you putting hours of effort into that some alt came and destroyed it in 5 minutes or a 'friendly' player was sitting around with binos and oh look the enemy have perfect arty placement who would have thought.

Foxhole is cool but massively flawed.
If you wanna have fun then you're basically forced into a Clan which is dumb. And you'll have to sink hours and hours of time to get basically no where.

Now how could they improve it?
Honestly the alts or cheaters are the worst ever I am not really sure how they'd fix this tbh but it really needs it.
- Logi is awful still, even since the reworks I would argue Logi now is actually still harder and less fun than ever before there's just way to much crap to produce and it takes way to much effort to scrap, refine, produce crap.
- Every war feels the same, arty is way to over used and tanks spammed out late game isn't fun. It is extremely rare you'll ever get genuine gun play between the two factions.
- Toxic clans exist and are everywhere and they will resource / vehicle / item hoard and will destroy you if you even step foot near their base. Can't blame em sometimes though with all the useless randoms and alts about.

2. front line battles can be fun but one area becomes maxed with players very quickly and 19 people wait in que to load in. no one wants to go to the low populated areas. everyone just wants to go to one area.

3. the game has potential but in this stage it becomes boring fast. alot of trying to find out where the most active front is when the game is in low population hours.

4. took a guys vehicle i didnt know he was using. he and his team cried i was a spy, they jumped on discord and the admins banned me for two days over something so stupid. clans gang up quickly and community can be toxic at times. mass reporting by clans and miss-communication is a big thing.

5. building is really really slow and takes hours. its boring as hell and can be undone so quickly by being destroyed.

6. crashes and glitches can be common.

7. some updates can break the way the game plays, only explosives to damage structures was one of them.

8. zombie event has no direction for zombies. not much they can actually do besides kill structures and people. vastly out numbered and out teched with vehicles and defences.
i wish they could do more. the mutation ranks are just meh and can be lost by dying.

9. bias towards one side by devs and uneven game design, wardens can fire grenade launches out of apc's but collies cant. warden side has to constantly deal with the frozen side of the map and make fire to start vehicles and wear winter clothing etc. wearable armour also has a inbalance

10. players complain or teamkill over trench digging, mine placement or barbed wire placement and will move them or grief in order to make their point clear

Other gameplay: 8/10
Overall: 4/10
I really wish I could give this game a good review, but it just drains me to play. The actual fighting as well as building (to an extent) is really interesting. However, logistics is utter bullsh*t (steam wants me to censor it), and that's what really topples the game over. Without logistics, there is *nothing*. No guns, no ammo, no vehicles, no structures. And there is so rarely anything other than basic rifles and rifle ammo, *maybe* some anti-tank, that there's nothing to do other than blindly run at the enemy with a gun. This is not good tactics. If you want something more, if you want to help actually *win* a battle, you most likely need to do the logistics all by yourself. For the most basic supplies like rifles, rifle ammo, and respawns, this means:
1. Find a salvage truck (harder than it sounds)
2. Search on the map for a salvage yard that isn't empty (harder than it sounds)
3. Drive to the salvage yard (several minutes)
4. Sit around in the scrap yard holding down left click to gather salvage (tens of minutes)
5. Move over to the salvage truck and put the salvage away
6. Repeat from 4 until the truck is full
7. Drive the truck to the refinery (several minutes) and submit the salvage for refining
8. If you need more materials, repeat from 2
9. Put away your salvage truck in a storage depot (several minutes)
10. Wait for your materials to be refined (can take hours)
11. Find a supply truck (harder than it sounds)
12. Drive to the refinery and take the materials out (several minutes)
13. Drive to the factory and put the materials in (probably several seconds but could be minutes)
14. Wait for the supplies to be made (several minutes), take them out when they're done
15. Repeat from 12 if you need more
16. Drive to the front. (several minutes) Repeat from 1 if you are ambushed by partisans.
17. Unload the supplies, drive the truck back to a storage depot to put it away. (several minutes)
This is the most basic list of instructions I could think of for making basic supplies. All of these minutes add up to a huge amount of time. Trying to make anything else is even more complicated and tedious, *especially* if it has to be made in a facility rather than a public factory. Facilities are player-made factories that require constant and heavy logistical upkeep. Most of them are private, so you can't really use them. Worst of all is that they're nearly impossible to find on the map, and there is no indication of whether they're public or private. 
It seems like some people like the routine of logistics, but I find it to be an anti-fun mechanic at the backbone of an otherwise very good game.",1699513012,1699513261,False,1,1,0.454245895147323608,0,True,False,False

Fighting on the front lines is something to can do, but only because of the hundred or more people behind the lines doing Logistics. Everything from the guns you use, to the bullets you fire, the radios, the grenades, the tanks, the fuel. EVERYTHING is made by players for the most part. If you go into this thinking that the game is only fighting in trenches, I don't think you will enjoy this.

If you go into this thinking of going into Logistics (the crafting of everything that goes to the front), you will find a sometimes frustratingly in-depth system of resource management, material collection, and base construction system that can have you grow into force to be reckoned with simply with how much you provide the military-industrial complex of your chosen side. 

Regardless of what you choose, this game is infinitely more fun with friends, both for the social aspect, as well as the fact that if you leave your builds for too long without resupplying, they will start to break down (This takes 24-48hrs after resources run out, depending on the structure).",1699507570,1699507570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it's a game that doesn't respect your time, life and ultimately isn't as interesting as people make it out to be a lot of the time filled with bugs, imbalances and a team who focus on hyping up the playerbase update to update with large new, largely untested features with very little insight to how it will effect the game.

This company refuses to do the most basic of communications with the people who play it. Most of the player base has very little to really say positively about the game, but also is under massive effects of Sunken Cost Fallacy for how much time they spend having to do fundamentally boring and mundane busy work and call it ""Gameplay"" something akin to Stockholm Syndrome.

1.0 was a terrible thing with facilities that just further went into this brown-nosing of the insane, after years of hype, Foxhole was on the front page with 1.0 and with it started coming an even worsening of the games respect for the people who play it. It was buggy, it was very badly thought out, the game slowed to a crawl for multiple wars. The 1.0 hype train didn't improve the game. It wasn't the ""hoorah!"" we were excited for, it was a flop. Their big shot they hyped up for years, and it came and went with a large sigh from pretty much everybody.

Honestly, the people who continue to play this game are mostly masochists and psychotic people who want to find meaning in holding m1 and validating the insane amount of hours it takes to do anything with a hollow idea that it somehow makes it all more interesting. 

The reality is, players who play this game hardcore have NOTHING ELSE going on in their lives, or are big streamers who created a niche market for themselves and people needing more hammers, help for *their* ideas / to further their own brand by pretending to be community ambassadors for a company that won't even open an email from them.

You lost a war, what happens? Fuck all.
It doesn't matter who wins or loses because every update is as fucked up as the last, the balances all switch and even the map and weather itself is artificially controlled. Which makes you wonder why everything is designed to be played by robots instead of a living, breathing, thinking human being.

Sure, its cool the game hits so many different genres and niches. But there's a better game that does each of them better.

1.0 was just more crap that was exactly what everybody complained about for the prior 4 years. The Naval Update is the same exact story. Trailers we were excited about for years -- incredibly underwhelming. Naval ships and mechanics for 1% to ever experience. Brash last second changes to live servers without any testing or care with Rare Materials.

They don't have money for Moderators. But they have money to produce and pay people to make trailers and updates for a very select few to experience. They just want you to come back to go ""What's new?"" to get you to sit around thinking you are doing anything different than you did 4 years ago and be intoxicated with the ""oh what if?"" -- there's no gold at the end of this rainbow.

You learn to accept this and move on. ""Greatest Idea Ever."" ""Worst Game Ever Made."" -- Einstein blueprints created by a tribe of monkeys, enjoyed by the brainless dead.

Why is everybody so Toxic, angry and generally distrustful of each other a majority of the time? It's by design. It's the #DevVision. 

And so many people defend it, mostly to their own detriment, because to be honest about it triggers a defensive response. Even if they agree, they can't admit it. Everybody needs the last word. Everybody has a point to be made. Because they're sitting around. Accomplishing. Nothing. Spending dozens of hours for little hits of feel good chemicals to further justify their hour counts.",1635558893,1699424419,False,1,0,0.505813956260681152,1,True,False,False

I am one to prefer the routine of back-line logistics, going through the motions of mining resources that are needed and turning them into supplies, weapons or vehicles that are needed throughout various stages of the war. My greatest sense of pride is seeing the crates I made from the factories being shipped out by truck, train or ship.

I have experienced front-line fighting in my first hundred hours or so, half of that on foot and the other half as armor crew before being recruited by an armor regiment (clan) and introduced into facilities to make some of the facility-locked tanks and upgrades for vehicles/tanks. I fell in love with the ability to build your own facility and produce all sorts of items needed for other facilities, and it does get complex at times with facilities and it is rather easy to get lost into it.

This game is heavily based on finding a group of players to work together towards goals for the war, finding a Regiment in this game goes a long way in helping you understand the game and have the manpower needed to help you in various tasks, whether logistics or front-line operations. Seems to be the most difficult part is finding group of players to work towards certain goals, not too hard to get into the big regiments that are around but I prefer to avoid the bigger regiments as I personally steer clear of the bigger clans and prefer to keep to a smaller regiment size as it's easier to manage and a little less chaotic. I highly recommend newer players to join the bigger regiments just to help get a feel for how the game play is as they'll have more clear cut goals and more people to interact with during their ops to understand how operations run for the most part.

For logistics, spawn in the back line and ask in the regional/logi/world chat about needing help understanding logistics and someone will be more than happy to help. I always do my best to help players that ask questions to help them understand what is going on, when I first started playing and I opened the map I was completely overwhelmed and had no idea what to do or where to go. Always ask questions! 

Now on to the bad of the game.. This game if you ""enjoy"" logistics is super grindy, you can spend all day working on a facility and getting resources needed for the facility just for you to log back in the next day and it all be gone due to the power running, other players taking all they can get to reduce their own grind or partisans coming along and blowing it all up while you are asleep. In this game it feels like you are punished more for actively wanting to do logistics and especially so if you want to run a facility. You have to keep in mind decay, in which your facility (depending on the quality of supply is) can decay completely in 24 hours, so you are forced to log in everyday and grind for X amount of hours to ensure your maintenance supplies are where they need to be for X amount of hours you will be away. 

There is toxicity present in the game, but I tend to avoid it. Not as bad as League of Legends but it can get toxic or crazy in world chat sometimes, but there is an option to minimize the chat so it's out of sight and out of mind. As long as you find the right people in the game, and avoid the crazies you can have a fantastic time in Foxhole!",1697520216,1699375039,False,0,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It was enjoyable! We held the flair, contributed to the war effort, there was a sense of progress, of accomplishment.

8 gunboats leveled a weeks work in less than an hour. And the wardens landed like never before.

Flair stood.

Through blood and pain and in the rubble of our lives, hope endured. Flair was not lost to us. I was enjoying losing, /knowing/ we could perservere.

Flair stood

For what must have been 18 hours we held off the wardens in the rubble of our homme.

Flair stood

But we had to sleep eventually. I was one of the last to log off, secure in the knowledge the randoms who had held the Flair under my direction would hold it stil. That in the morning we could rebuild. That the Flair Stood.

The Flair Fell.

In the wee hours of the night, the wardens erased all that hope without us being able to give even a word of resistance. All that meaning, all that hope, all that righteous fury, gone in the wink of an eye.

I'm not sure I want to return to the game, though I probably will. I doubt I'll enjoy it as much.

People are genuinely nice, responsive, explain the game, it's easy to form groups and have some nice team play. Team play is actually everything in this game, you cannot do shit without other players. It's complex and demanding and there is no good entry point, you will learn the hard way. It's not immediately pleasant, and you have to invest tens of hours to develop skills and understanding. In this sense it is a truly great game.

But, having said all that, it is hard to enjoy it. If you want to do anything it just takes a lot of time. The game loop for catching a gun and running towards an enemy is good for a couple of sessions, but then it becomes boring. Most of the time you spend running, choosing equipment, waiting to spawn. If you want to take part in the logistics operations, then you will be driving from one side of the map to another. The game looks good, people are nice, you feel like you are taking part in an important and large operation, and you want to contribute, but then you realise it takes good 30 minutes to build a truck, then to process scrap material, bring it to a factory, make some guns and then another 15 minutes to deliver it to a front line. And this is only for the most basic items. Anything more complicated is like playing Factorio. It is not fun if you don't want to dedicate some serious time into it, and coordinate what you do with others. It's a big game, and a big world, it takes a lot of effort to build a tank or anything bigger. Building trenches and other structures is incredibly boring - you essentially have to hold a mouse button pressed down for 2-3 minutes to create anything, and that's the time you cannot spend on doing anything else. I'd say it would be a little bit more enjoyable if you could just press a button and leave for the necessary time for your soldier to finish the job. It is simply boring. It does get better when there is a team with you, that cuts the time down, but still it is brutally slow. The game is highly addictive, but after spending 40 hours playing I really feel I am wasting my life not even clicking, but holding two buttons - one on the mouse, and one on the ""w"" key to move forward. I do feel like joining again and going to that stupid bridge in the east of Endless Shores, but I feel it is pure waste of life. Because of that I don't feel like playing anymore.  

Another aspect is that the game is not new, and you will play with a mixture of total newbies and veterans, and there is a palpable tension between the two groups of players. Again, people are super nice, but I understand they want to play their complicated operations, they put tens of hours to prepare a naval attack, and suddenly a new player comes along and wants to build something that goes against the big savvy group's plan and it's just not entirely pleasant. It is also hard to join as a casual player if people are really treating the game with dedication, like a serious sport competition.

Have you ever tried establishing a base away from the frontline to support your team through crafting? Well, it's not that simple. Unfortunately, toxic players seem to be everywhere, and it's a daily struggle to protect your resources from would-be thieves.

Whenever my friends and I attempted to build our own facilities, gather resources, and contribute to the region by constructing infrastructures for everyone, we encountered this kind of behavior. And if they aren't stealing from you, they might resort to griefing your base.

You might wonder if there's a way to report these disruptive players. The truth is, there is a reporting system in place, but it only works if you can gather enough reports. This means that if a large group decides that you're an inconvenience, perhaps because your base is in a location they desire (a true story I've experienced), they could falsely report you, resulting in an automatic ban.

It's quite unfortunate because the game itself is enjoyable and has the potential for even more fun. However, the situation has worsened as the developers seem unwilling to address these issues.

1. Everything you make can and probably will get stolen. Nothing is protected. You can lock your vehicles, but people will break into them and steal them. You can squad lock your facilities, but that doesn't even seem to work. If you're in a squad with friends, as I am, you're going to constantly have to deal with over-selective or under-selective rights. You can't lock a structure your squad-mate built, only they can, and it may not even work. You can't unlock a vehicle that your squad-mate locked personally, unless you break into it like a common thief, a process that takes shockingly little time. I spent hours grinding out base supplies just two nights ago, and when I get on the next day, we're missing most of our supplies, which took hours to grind, and I catch someone leaving with hours more and spend half an hour in a stand-off with the guy (go find a better way to live your life, [DOE] Beetle) as he tries to gaslight me into thinking the base actually belongs to his friend. People will even steal stuff that's easier to make than it is to steal, like our liquid container. And if you finally make something nice, after days of hard work, like a Taurine Rigger, it'll get yoinked the first night you sign off, with NO WAY to find out where it went or who stole it. Was it partisans? Friendlies? The same person who robbed us yesterday or someone new?

2. If you don't play for a few days, the whole thing will deteriorate into nothingness. We have to move 8 truckloads of scrap every single real life day if we want our mid-sized (6 factory buildings, 2 power plants, a resource transfer station, and a small assembly station) base to endure. That's a chore that will take probably 2 hours, every single day,depending on how available the local scrap yards and mines are, just to keep what we've already spent hours building.

This game is undoubtedly great for some things, but if you want a casual game to play with friends, to build a base and support the war effort, then find something else. I want to love this game so much, but when you can have no true security (I'd even be happy with just an unbreakable 5-day squad lock that can only be used within friendly territory on vehicles built by squad members. We need some sort of protection that can't be broken in less than a minute by partisans, trolls, or thieves) and when you need to grind hours just to maintain what little you've built. The decay is too aggressive for small groups to be able to do anything effectively. It needs to be halved, or quartered, or more, and the supply consumption modifier needs to not be so aggressive.",1699199983,1699199983,False,2,0,0.47413790225982666,1,True,False,False

Foxhole has been a thrilling adventure every time I play and the combat is nothing less than exciting. If you are considering picking up the game I recommend doing so. 

Being in a world where every building, rifle, and vehicle are created by players is something I have never gotten to experience before. And yes it is just that! Every single tool you see in the game and many of the buildings were created by players and you will often see players utilizing factories and scrap yards if you are in the production zones. But it doesn't stop there. You will also find a variety of players creating fortifications on the front lines! 

But if you choose to be just a soldier which is what I have spent a majority of my time doing then you will fit right at home in the trenches holding off one of the two factions of the game the Colonials and the Wardens. Something I will say about this game is that you are not usually going to be a war hero. This game isn't about that. You are a part of the wider whole and a member of a large and diverse team. Rarely does going at it alone do anything more than get yourself killed. But that doesn't mean you can't try it out as a partisan and disrupting enemy supply lines. 

With all that being said the truth of Foxhole is that our achievements and victories are part of a larger war. We may have felt that we won an adrenaline fueled battle the likes of which could never be topped only to remember that the enemy has another base over the next hill. But that is the beauty of Foxhole. No two fights are the same and the experiences you have over VOIP are game changing.

New content not accessible, it plays litearlly like a repeat of previous wars, fundamental issues like base time to build vs suvivability to recent buffs to weapons not addressed, meaning any base is killable with infantry and 120mm.


New wonder weapons that are not needed, nerfs to howis to make bases even less useful, everything dies to grenade spam rushes.  Base building is stupidly grindy and requires massive ongoing maintenance to be even marginally effective, and the wonder weapons to break bases are just not needed as the factorio update makes 120mm artillery ammunition basically free so just make more guns and fire until everything falls down.   

And yes, running arty shells is still mind numbingly boring after the novelty wears off.

None of the fun strategies to go around the choke points, flank your enemies or ambush their support lines work. 

The trench warfare is just absolutely boring. Why is there not some peek mechanic, where if you aim and shoot out of a trench, you also get vulnerable to being shot from another trench?

Logistics is sadly a one man job. There is just absolutely nothing to do for a passenger. No loading the crates onto the truck, no shooting roadside bandits out of the window. Nothing.

Sure, there are a few issues with the game. Some battles and fights can be boring, especially when low on supplies but that's more on the logistics of the game instead and how spread out they can be during war times.

All in all I'm having a blast. Sometimes it can be mentally exhausting and but I think I messed up my sleep cycle playing this none stop.

It's just the fact that it's all organic and human. Every bullet made, every shell shot, every trench built. It gives off this vibe of a living, breathing world at constant, intense war. The community as well is a major pro as well. The lore and jokes and immersion from the playerbase who have been fighting on both sides for years really makes things more fun.

A good game if you have no job and no life and want to waste your time, can keep you occupied all day just moving things from one place to the next because it takes at least 5 min to fill your inventory. And by that I mean when you grab something from a friendly base it starts a timer which is anywhere from 30 sec to what seems like 5 min, for each individual item...

But I can provide a POV of what it feels like to be on the flank of the enemy at the very far side of the map. Less chaotic, less resource to deploy to destroy pill boxes, and more concern for enemy if they start getting numbers. Its a push and pulled back situation most of the times. Medics are rare. But if you're the type to enjoy at least least chaotic battles, you should definitely come. Worth my money too.

Another opinion. It's up to you if want to take this, especially for people who are always/mostly busy, those who wants to play casually or play only an hour. 
1. If you intend to buy this game and play for an hour, expect to stay in one position. Let's say you intend to push the bridge with your teammates, in an hour, the result you can achieve there is by killing 2-4 Warde- I mean, enemies. You can expect to shoot down 2-4 enemies. And mostly at those times you'd be sitting to cover for your team to prevent them from pushing and taking over your spawn base. You'd be dying and dying over just to realize you have to take this game slowly. 
2. You can get kills under an hour, and sit there doing nothing since you realize you can't push because of automatic pill boxes. 
3. You can't get as much result as you expect it to be. Take this game like real war strategy in real-life. It WILL take you almost a day to even get a proper support from the Logistics Guys and some other Squads who handle artillery or armored vehicles(Shout out to these guys!). In short, you can't expect to push through territory and take the land in a day, it will probably take a week or more. 

My conclusion as someone who played the game in 4 hours total and a newbie, it's peaceful and good for casuals. But for people who only have an hour or two free time, you can't expect the game to be fast paced. This is extremely slow-paced! if you get interrupted because your mother told you to do chores, it's fine. You don't get punished in this game but you just spawn back at your town base or bunker and ruins the immersion.

The ""No Idea What I'm Doing"" Award: If you've ever found yourself frantically building sandbags in the middle of a forest, convinced it's the perfect tactical move, then congratulations, you're a Foxhole player. ""Foxhole: Where Shovels Solve Everything!""

The ""Art of Ambush"" Medal: Foxhole is where every bush becomes a potential assassin. I mean, who knew that shrubbery could be so dangerous? It's all fun and games until the bushes start shooting back. ""Foxhole: Where Foliage Is Your Frenemy!""

The ""Logi Life Crisis"" Trophy: Logistics in Foxhole is like playing a game of ""Human Tetris"" with crates and trucks. You'll learn to appreciate the thrill of a well-organized supply run, but also the agony of getting stuck in a traffic jam with 20 tons of ammunition. ""Foxhole: Truck Simulator on Steroids!""

The ""Epic Vehicle Stunt Show"" Plaque: Foxhole is where you can see armored vehicles attempt the craziest stunts, like backflips off bridges or interpretive dance on minefields. ""Foxhole: Where Tanks Have Better Moves Than You!""

The ""Friendly Fire Fiasco"" Ribbon: Nothing beats that moment when you toss a grenade with the grace of an Olympic athlete, only to realize it's headed for your teammates. ""Foxhole: Because Who Needs Enemies Anyway?""

The ""Guerilla Marketing"" Accolade: In Foxhole, you'll find yourself manning radio towers like it's a nightclub DJ booth, broadcasting propaganda and misinformation to confuse the enemy. ""Foxhole: Where Wars Are Won with Propaganda and Dubstep!""

The ""Invisible Sniper"" Pennant: Sometimes, you'll be 100% convinced that there's an invisible enemy sniper hiding in the bushes just to mess with your sanity. ""Foxhole: Where Camouflage Meets Mind Games!""

have a new prototype weapon to try out? gone, reduced to atoms.
spent a half hour getting resources? haha nope.
carrying a bunch of supplies to the front? too bad.
driving a tank? WHAT TANK.

if you don't want to sit all day long behind computer, grind, be part of the clan culture and just casualy from time to time sit and play for few hours, this game has nothing to offer - all you can do is to take gun, run, get yourself killed, repeat, waste 2 hours of your life by healing other players, mining resources or move supplies forth and back
tanks, trains, boats, building, basically anything that seems a bit fun is limited to clans because most non-clan players and newbies who buy this game on sale, have fun getting themselves killed for few hours and then uninstall and as a single person you have no power to do anything, my biggest achievement was wasting several hours learning other non-clan players flanking route so we could capture town - next day i logged on and the city was back in enemys hands and tons of players just getting themselves killed endelessly because IQ 80 ""run forward, shoot twice, die"" as they were day before
gun play is shit, worst decision ever made to make shooter from bird perspective, you can't hit enemy lying in the grass because your crosshair always aims 1.5m above current ground level, fighting on rocky hills was a nightmare because it takes two magazines until you hit that correct spot to actually aim at your enemy, not on the rock below him

u need 5 people to tag a building, so u can destroy it with friendly fire (kinda makes sence, but its a bad thing for solo builders ... also entire groups come , flag your buildings and destroy them and u cant do anything about it , they also report u for building  disruptive stuff in your own base, since they dont want you to build a base at this location .... 

players start building small rails, stop in the middle, and now i cant buld my bunker, since a guy closed me in with his small rail ... and of course i cant destroy it since i cant find 5 people to help me flag it ... 

i prepared everything for Msups , went to bed, a random came 5 minutes later, changed my production, took my resources, and i cant do anything ... in the morning i have to hurry since i have only 100 msups, require around 50 per hour ....

randoms walk into my base, lock the vehicles, move stuff , disconnect the powergrid, build new poles, that are not required ... etc

Since I am a slow learner, I was hesitant at first because of reviews talking about how clans mass-report to get people banned. I took the chance anyways, and do not regret it. So far, I have seen two cases of clans calling to mass-report a single player, and even though it was for a good reason both times, the players were not banned and I saw them both the next day(s). FYI: There are different types of reports. For instance, build-griefing reports result in their build ability being temporarily disabled, and excessive friendly fire will eventually result in a weapons lock. 

The gameplay itself is big enough to make my current 60 hours of gameplay still classify me as a noob.  The last games I got so addicted to was Factorio and Sea of Thieves, and this games has parts from both, so my personal life is officially screwed at this point.

Despite being 5 years old (with a 1.0 release only this month), the game's community is growing.

There are only 3 servers for the game, regardless of the country you live in, so you play with people from all over the world.  I really enjoy this aspect ever since I logged in at 5am central time and experienced a squad of Russians breaking into enemy lines and pushing their borders back.  This is a game of war, and it does not stop. Even server patches are rolled out per map region.

The game is not without its issues, but none of them come close to making the game frustrating to play.",1665099069,1698710830,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Day 1 of purchase

1st Spawn:
Spawned in, asked some random player to take me to the frontlines. We started driving and instead of going to the frontlines he took me on a covert mission behind enemy lines, destroying towers, coal mines, etc. In game days took 3 days. At the end of it we took a wrong turn and died.

2nd Spawn:
Found myself in a place called ""The Dead Lands"" fighting at ""Pommel Annex"". This zone has seen fighting for 6 irl days, many people have fought and died there, its one big stalemate... Long story short, i am still fighting there, still sweating blood with my Colonial brothers. We've had many close calls, we almost lost our HQ there, we almost ran completely dry of ammo, but we made a come back, we got our ammo back, we pushed the Wardens back to where they were.

A lot of content requires ton of resources and custom facilities (player-built logistical structures for advanced in-game stuff) buildings which need to be done and maintained (regularly or else structures will decay with time) to produce everything else that isn't done just in ""normal"" logistical structures. (world structures that are avaiable to everyone and don't require any processing on custom facilities)

You've probably heard it a lot already but this isn't your classic MMO or war game as everything here is done by players - defences, weapons, ammo, fuel, resources, tanks, ships etc. which sounds super interesting but also means you can't just have it all and to get it you'll need to grind and often wait hours to get some more advanced stuff like basic tanks (dont forget about fuel and ammo for it) as most players and clans value them and wont gift it away even though you are on the same team.

You still can enjoy game solo even somewhat casually being at fronline as infantry guy roleplaying a bit and having your PTSD from constant shelling and mg fire or play with ""classic"" tanks (tanks/armored vehicles that aren't a special gimmicky variants that can be done in facilities) if you grind resources and find some random players (or friends) to man it. 
But if you want to experience all content (advanced tank combat, artillery operations, rocket artillery operations, naval combat with large battleships (since naval warfare update)) then you'll need to join clans or bring friends that are gonna be as dedicated because otherwise its very hard to do alone.

tl;dr This game is heavily clan based and teamwork is what its buit on and what makes it so fun. You can play game solo but you won't be able to experience all content without communications.",1698647031,1698647819,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here's a personal example:
I'm running logi and dropping off some supplies at a dockyard with my tanker ship. Clan comes up to me and starts cussing at me to move my ship because I'm blocking the deployment area. Instead of waiting for the few minutes it takes for me to submit all of my supplies and leave, they shoot at my tanker and then mass report me, which results in me getting banned in seconds. 

The worst part is that there isn't even any kind of support for this widespread issue (just look at most of the negative reviews, it's almost the same story every single time). When I tried to inquire about it on the Discord, I was just straight up banned for no reason. What kind of moderation team enforces rule breaking?

The game in itself is fun, but the community is absolutely awful, especially the large clans who will just claim everything as theirs and just steal it from you.

Getting banned isn't even the worst part; the game displays your infractions publicly, which leads to getting mass reported for ""alting"" and getting another ban.

A living and breathing world similar to Rust, where everyone works for a single goal: victory over the enemy. And war, just like IRL, is just a huge grind.
From a worker in a scrap mine, to truck driver, to scientist, to actual frontline soldiers.
No stats to pre-grind, and no pay to win every human is equal. The only difference is the amount of effort people put in their commitment to the war.

This game takes the cake. It is very entertaining and the endless war/game concept is spot on. The game has plenty of active players, so its easy to interact with a community of soldiers. Games are full. Worth every single penny. And then some.

EDIT: October 29, 2023
This game still continues to blow me away on a regular basis. The updates that the Devs push out are incredible. Just when you think they cant top it, they top it. At the time of this review, they have just pushed a Naval Warfare update out, and I'm speechless. This game has become so full of content, its becoming overwhelming. You can dig into whatever you want as a new player because the game has it to some extent. Trains, yep. Ships, yep. Tank warfare, you bet. Trench warfare, yes. 

I keep telling myself, we will NEVER see biplanes because of the way the game is built with top down camera mechanics, but at this point... nothing would surprise me from this Dev.

Main reasons for that is the community and unwillingness of the devs to see whats is happening. The basic explanation of this is the game is designed for the team in a two sided war to work, gather, research and produce together for the war effort. Which on paper sounds like a good idea but its far from that. What ive seen in game is people on your side will turn on each other to steal and murder anyone for what they want. Got a good amount of resources, be prepared for someone to steal them. Have a nice tank, watch as someone on your side breaks the lock and steals it. Want to stop them, be prepared to be banned for team killing to stop the theft.

Basically the devs think the community works together and leave everything up to the ""community"" to behave and not basically raid their own allies. But that dosent happen, as you cant lock or store anything at your player built base that someone cant just come and take. And it dosent help many people have ""Alt"" accounts on the opposite team, and will eaither spy, steal, or scout for the other side.

In my 24 hours in game ive been killed by more allies then hostiles.This was becasue me and my friends where trying to build a base and get a long range artillery site setup. But a large logistics group wanted our resources. So the stole, attacked up, and destroyed parts of our base constantly. But you cant shoot back, because if you do and happen to kill one of them, their whole group reports you for team killing to have you banned just so they can steal your stuff. The Game really dosent let you and your friends have anything private owned, and what little it does is very small and even then easily stolen from.

This is the kinda toxicity and clan bullying, control that is ruining the game. Basically its either fall in line, bend over, and let them have their way with you, or be banned.

With only being able to report 3 people a day it nearly impossible to stop the greifers, especially since it take multiple reports on the same person to get anything done, and those that just want to steal and break what you have. And lets not mention the large 'Clans"" of player who abuse the report system to get people they don't like banned.

Maybe in the future this game will get better but as of now i would stay away from it.",1617836255,1698504555,False,0,0,0.46709132194519043,0,True,False,True

Because various clans claim component and coal fields for themselves. And the chinese clans keep the competition away by reporting buildings for ""Disruptive structure placement"" and above mentioned teamkilling. 

Do not recommend, seems like clans have got all the power and solo logistics player got nothing. 

Also I deposited around 40 crates into a busy storage depot, it was gone in 10 minutes, absolutely great. It is great it gets used, but it leaves no room for frontline logi run. As it's all in clan storage and public shirts and bmats are empty. So as solo you have to do the whole logi chain yourself. Mine -> refine -> craft into usable stuff -> transport.

Also more experiences from logi perspective. In a logi hub there's 0 chance of playing as logi right now. Let's start by you need a truck right? No trucks in any storage anywhere. Well you can make those with basic mats right? There's not a single bmat anywhere either. Well you can scrap and refine that into bmats right? Yes if only scrap fields weren't completely empty.

505460,149021734,76561198044749570,0,1,7472,0,7472,1698441665,"First off, I want to say I played 125 hours within the past two weeks.  Clearly I enjoyed the game and what it had to offer.  There's a lot of variety of different things of what you can do.  Fight in the front lines?  You got it.  Want to help do supply chain logistics, you have that too.  Want to go behind enemy lines and disrupt their logistics, there's that too.

The game has sucked me in with the continual purpose of contributing in the war effort, constantly doing my best to supply the front with the ever so needed armaments or trying to do a large push to destroy a relic base for zone dominance.  

But at the end of the day, I definitely cannot recommend this game to others.  The amount of toxicity I have received from others really left a sour taste in my mouth.  Don't get me wrong, there were so many pleasant experiences I've had with other players.  So many players were accommodating towards me, teaching me on certain operations or asking me how I like the game and what not.  Teammates have come to my rescue in defending my base against partisans in numerous occasions, rallying against the forces of the other team.  Neighbors constantly asking me what I've been up to, sharing resources and vehicles, and just being that friendly accommodating neighbor everyone wants in their lives.  I once joined a group of players in vehicular warfare and the driver was guiding me on what to do.  He was extremely accommodating when I made a mistake (I shot a AT bunker as a tank), and said it's OK, it's a learning experience.

But despite all of these positive experiences from players, I've had way too many toxic players.  As a solo player, you get bullied from groups of players truly taking advantage of you.  You cannot go to certain sections of the map as clans will kick you out.  Certain resources are under lockdown as they are 'owned' from the other clans.  I've built bases/facilities for the purpose of having a public facility yet all of my vehicles and resources get taken out of my bases before I can get them running.  I would have to travel 2 hexes to gather resources and would have to sit in my own base to wait for them to process in fear of my own teammates in raiding me.  Teammates would wrench my own vehicle to in order to steal resources from my truck while I am in the middle of gathering resources.

What really made me leave this game, was when a player constantly followed me while cussing at me, just for the point of griefing me.  Just for context, I primarily played this game in logistics and I primarily gathered resources where no players usually went to (places where resources were constantly out of gas and were often capped out, so I assumed the zone had a lack of players maintaining that resource node).  In this instance, while driving towards a refinery, this player was driving in the middle of the road and we ran into each other.  I get it, cars will always run into each other, even if both players happen to drive on the right side of the road, it just happens.  You both back up, make space, and move on.  In this case, I backed up while this player started yelling at me while driving forward.  His teammate/squad then decided to come behind my vehicle and block me while this player continued to yell at me.  His teammate gets out with a wrench wanting to unlock my car, and I'm thinking wow, this is not fun at all.  Eventually as I leave, to continue to gather resources,  this player continues to follow me, blocking me off the road all the while yelling and making fun of me.  I just want to play the game.  He eventually was able to unlock my car and decided to sit in the passenger seat, so now I'm left with him wherever I go.  Fine, you win, I quit, you must be happy now.

If this is the experience I get while I play this game, I decided I'm over it.  I also do want to note that all of these players that have been toxic have always been a high rank.  If I'm constantly running into higher ranks that are toxic already, then I'm going to keep running into them if I were to keep playing this game.  You feel useless, discouraged, and inferior against a larger group of players that bully you.  I definitely do not want to put these experiences that I've had with any of my other friends.  
 
TLDR: The toxic negative experiences you get aren't from the other team, it's from your own teammates.",1698464757,1698469341,False,562,29,0.916764676570892334,0,True,False,False

Some people may be wondering why I am not recommending this game to others, given that I have played it for over 100 hours. There are many, many things to love about Foxhole. Its gameplay is unlike anything I've ever played. Foxhole is a massive war simulator inspired by WWI and II in which every building, every structure, every vehicle, every gun, every bullet is player-made. Gather raw resources, refine them into usable materials and use them to craft supplies to sustain the war effort. Whether you play frontline or backline, combat or logistics, Foxhole is a collaborative game at heart, and you won't go far if you play all alone. The satisfaction you get from seeing a project come together thanks to the efforts of a whole team of people is incredible. But those moments are merely the silver lining of a game experience which, often, is otherwise tedious and frustrating. As it is, I simply cannot recommend Foxhole. Here are some reasons why:

1. Programming and game design issues. There is no proper tutorial. The existing tutorial only goes over the bare minimum of the commands and doesn't actually tell you how to play the game. There should be at least some semblance of a tutorial for logistics: they make up a significant portion of the game, and yet you cannot grasp logistics-related gameplay mechanics unless you pour over the wiki for hours or you know someone who's already been playing Foxhole for a while and can show you.

Also, the game physics are really rough and unrefined. There are numerous issues regarding hitboxes, people clipping into buildings and getting stuck, etc. Instead of fixing these issues, the developers... gave players access to an unstuck command, presumably because they'd rather work on more game content. Those issues would be understandable coming from an early-access game, and Foxhole was early-access for a very long time. But now the game is at update 1.53, and is supposedly officially released at this point. These problems are simply not acceptable coming from a supposedly finished game.
 
=> Edit: after some more game experience, I've come to realize that hitbox and skin problems, while real and annoying, are marginal in comparison of another issue which has existed for a long time and is getting more and more pressing with the naval update: the game is held back by its hardware. Due to server limitation, the world is not continuous; rather it is divided in regions colloquially known as hexes, and hexes only allow up to 100 players of each faction to join, creating issues with queues and wait times, especially for frontline regions. And the game is going to have to dedicate yet more of those already sparse resources into handling water physics and boat physics. And the boats are big. The developers need to make it a priority to upgrade the game's servers. I dream of the day when we might see a truly open-world Caoiva...

2. The relationship between the community and the development team. The developers are... uncommunicative, which is an issue for a game like Foxhole which depends upon a relatively small, but dedicated community of fans. I remember when the community was awaiting update 52. The game had numerous issues which made it frustrating to play. Among chief complaints were: lack of balance between the two opposing game factions (I'll get back to that one later on); slow rates for building structures; a confusing map, with many people feeling the need to use mods to make the map more readable (that is still a problem to an extent); a confusing rail switch system for trains; and a poorly-implemented new system for logistics and production revolving around facilities, which was hard to use, time-consuming, resource-hungry and desperately needed to be streamlined. The developers left the community plunged into a radio silence for months regarding this much-awaited update, which was supposed to bring many quality-of-life improvements that the game very badly needed. Eventually, frustration, resentment, anger and apathy grew and festered in the community, with ""devman doesn't care"" and ""devman bad"" sentiments being pretty widespread at that time (the latter one remains a frequent occurrence to this day).

Another issue concerns moderation. Foxhole being an MMO, it needs moderation. The moderators are... none other than the developers themselves, which in my experience only breeds suspicion of devman bias (whether real or perceived) and resentment towards the developer team. Even worse, suspicions of devman bias extend beyond the moderation aspect into the very way the game is built, with many players firmly believing that the game unfairly advantages the Colonial faction against the Warden faction. One of my friends, who played both factions, once expressed it like this: ""Playing Warden is playing Foxhole on hard mode."" I only play Warden, so I cannot personally assess whether this sentiment is true, but in my opinion it is too frequently expressed to ignore.

3. The behavior of the community itself. Foxhole is not spared from the toxicity issues that pretty much every online multiplayer game has to deal with. Foxhole's player base is pretty international, with not only British and American players, but also Eastern European and East Asian people, as well as a decently-sized French community. However, the game is mostly in English and the majority of the community remains English speakers. The language barrier leads English-speaking players to frequently antagonize players who are Chinese or Russian, and French players frequently complain about unnecessarily rude and sometimes xenophobic comments from English and American players.

Faction loyalism is also a major issue, with players getting too caught up in the fantasy the game sells and unnecessarily antagonizing players from the enemy faction simply for being from the enemy faction. Petty infighting about whether Colonials or Wardens are better is pretty frequent, and can sometimes morph into something deeply inappropriate, such as some players claiming that the Colonials represent the Allied forces of WWII and the Wardens represent Nazi Germany, due to a misunderstanding of the loose historical references within the game and despite developers clearly stating that the in-game factions have nothing to do with any real-life armed forces, whether historical or current.

This petty infighting even exist within factions. As Foxhole is a team game at heart, it is possible to create regiments within a faction, colloquially known as ""clans"", to better facilitate player coordination. Clans frequently fight each other and it is not uncommon for small ""civil wars"" to break out over the course of a war, despite there being restrictions placed on friendly fire (mostly in the form of restrictions, kicks and bans at the discretion of the moderators). This is not helped by the fact that the raw resources in this game are very competitive: almost all of these civil wars break out over a conflict for the securing of resources. On top of that, while some clans dedicate a significant amount of time each war to building public facilities for all to use, others hoard resources and supplies, making it harder for everyone else to play. All of these problems create antagonism between clans and between clan members and non-clan members, with ""clanman bad"" being another fairly common sentiment.

TL;DR: the game has major programming and design issues despite having been officially released for months; the developers are uncommunicative and appear to be favoring one faction over the other; the community struggles with toxicity despite a few silver linings when playing the game with friends.",1688165005,1698222206,False,152,6,0.826956510543823242,0,True,False,False

A mother, smothering their own child believing that they are saving it. As the new Naval update is about to be release, I prepare myself for arguably what will be my last war on Foxhole, and what I believe is about to be the death of the game. A game, where content, and new experiences should be celebrated, and I find myself dreading it.

The Devs, who previously I would have supported in taking time to make good development choices, have shown themselves to be almost wholly blind, and lacking in any thought when it comes to choices they make. Asymmetrical balance so bad, that guns/vehicles WITHIN a faction are made completely redundant by virtue of other weapons in the faction (ignoring progression); not to mention that some weapons are just simply pointless to make. Not to mention the bugs that have been present for years still go unfixed.

Do not waste your money on this game, this development team, or this company. You're money is better spent on Overwatch 2 in comparison.

To any Devs reading this I have the following comment to make.
It speaks volumes to create a game that you don't even want to play; that forces the dedicated players into horrible game play loops for the 'greater good' of a fictional group. It tells a terrible story, that the community on your own game commonly states 'dev man bad' because there is no other explanation for why mechanics are the way they are. You've successfully managed to take a genera leading game, and have failed on game play loops already proven to succeed. Your 'vision' is so blind, that I now question if you ever had eyes in the first place. In a weird twist of irony, I can only truly congratulate you on one thing. You've made a game, that is as hopeless in real life, as is the situation in the world of the game. 

Here is a summary of game play loops/mechanics.
[u]New player experience[/u]
A) You found a vet who happily teaches you the game. Victory!
B) You were unable to find a vet that teaches you the game, and combat + Logi is forever a mystery.
C) You ran into one of the toxic clans, and looked at someone the wrong way, promptly being accused of being an Alt and banned.

[u]Communication/clans[/u]
Operations used to exist, allowing for randoms to group together effectively to do things. Still waiting for this to come back.
Squad/regiment system is easily the worst system that I've ever seen. Foxhole clans exist on discord, not foxhole. 
Voice comes will randomly disconnect, and you will need to restart the game to fix it. Pray no-one kills your sleeping body so you can return to the same spot.

[u]Infantry[/u]
80% I shoot more bullets than you/luckier than you, 20% game knowledge/position/skill
If someone is spamming grenades, then they win.
Infantry AT is actually pretty nice to use.
The only sniper in existence isn't the sniper (worst weapon in the game). It's the anti-tank rifle. 

[u]Vehicles[/u]
I heard you like line battles? 
I heard you love RNG even more than infantry
I heard you love several hours of logi, 20-30mins of arming the tank/yourself, only to be killed in 5mins because of a bush 94.5mm AT gun.
If you can really good at tanks and have a well coordinated crew, they can be really fun.

[u]Artillery[/u]
Arguably the only balanced area of the game. Good sounds on the guns too.
Rocket arty is extremely fun to fire, but generally worthless.

[u]Making defences[/u]
2-3 people with autoclickers + 1 person designing the place + 2-3hours = bunker base.
You will have no defences at your base (unless its literally the front) for 1-2 RL days, during which point its very vulnerable to attacks. 
You will pay your several hours of logi game play each day to keep it alive, otherwise it will decay.
Also pray that someone doesn't come and destroy your plan because it isn't ""meta""

[u]Logi[/u]
Do you like no QoL? How about your QoL being removed?
Do you like taking 30mins to make basic materials for basic guns?
Do you like artificial timers and autoclickers? 
Do you like taking 20-30mins to drive to the front?
Then logi is for you!
Also, There is also a 50% chance, you'll meet people who exist to deny your ability to do anything for fear of wasting 'their' resources. There is also a 50% chance you'll find the most amazing and helpful people in the game.
Note: Devs have never actually played logi, and it shows. Seriously devs, you actually just need to play logi on both teams for a way as normal players, and you'll understand 99% of the problems of the game.

[u]Facilities[/u]
So, foxhole is literally the ideal place for some Factorio/Satisfactory game play. Shame this is the Foxhole devs version. This is not a factory game, this is a Idle phone game with a side of logi.
For the uneducated out there (including the devs), complexity is a GOOD thing, and should REWARD players that engage with it successfully. Instead, foxhole punishes the entire community to access what should have otherwise been basics.
Could have had actual tank factories with actual ability to produce variants.
Also, you will pay your 1-2h of forced labour every day to keep your small factory alive.

[u]Partisan[/u]
Good game play loop (for those who like this sort of thing). It's been made more difficult to do, but still doable. Also, the asymmetry of the two stealth buffing uniforms, could have been made really interesting, but was deployed terribly, rendering the benefit of using one of the uniforms redundant.",1698067884,1698068473,False,38,1,0.640489339828491211,0,True,False,False

You won't be yelled at in a game that requires mandatory Loudness Normalization via WIndows, you won't be harassed, you won't have your vehicles stolen or your character griefed because a clan claimed a public resource as its own and don't want you on ""their land"". You won't even need to join a clan to enjoy anything in that other game most likely. In Foxhole you are essentially required to be in a clan or you're locked out of most of the game's content.

The frontline fighting in this game is fun, but it's nothing so special that I would go out of my way to recommend the game. The last time I reviewed this game I had a change of heart that it was actually alright under certain circumstances, but I see no reason to be so forgiving to the game when most of the frontline gameplay relies so heavily on what is essentially free digital labor and the people are exceptionally toxic in the backline sometimes where most of that digital labor takes place.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
This game has an amazing concept and SHOULD be really fun but the basic gunplay is completely non-functional.

Your gun can only aim accurately if you're hiding behind cover, so combat out in an open field is essentially impossible unless you know how to zip around and abuse the 1 second window where the game doesn't apply the aim debuff.

If the only way for your gun to actually shoot where you're aiming is to abuse actual glitches, there's something wrong with your game.

Thankfully, Siegecamp's next game, Anvil Empires, has a mechanic to prevent this. Plus, it's melee combat anyways so aiming won't be an issue.",1693504201,1697902161,True,0,0,0.476857483386993408,0,True,False,False

Either playing it casually or intensely a few weeks at a time then not for a few months. Each time i come back to it, i fall in love with it all over again. 

Since i got this game, nearly 3 years ago, it has dramatically improved in play ability and there is so much more content. Given i was happy with the original level of content at the time of purchase, this is easily the best value PC game i have ever purchased. 

Biggest Positive: There are so many different ways to play this game - builder, logiman (driving trucks, trains and ships), manufacturer, tanker, artillery man, guerrilla fighters (Partisans), infantry man, scout, miner ... 

Biggest Negative: As with all MMOs, there are a few toxic players who will cheat with alt accounts to get intel or act as a fifth column but that in a way makes it more realistic (Spies and Saboteurs) but frustrating.

I play solo, which can be a bit of a frustrating experience. But soloing as a medic and doing the best you can to make sure your teammates don't have to respawn (and spend the required respawn resources) is honestly very rewarding. Yelling ""it's okay, I got you"" as someone is RP screaming down the mic while you're patching them up and saving their life leaves a feeling that can't be described. 

As of writing this, War 107 has ended in a Warden victory. I was lucky enough to have logged in today. But for my faction to have also won makes me want to fight in the next war even harder. Sitting in a trench, gunning down Collies as they try to push our position and praying to whomever that you don't get shredded by an artillery strike is a hell of an experience. And it's only made sweeter by the victory screen.

If you're debating whether to get this because you have no one to play it with - don't. Trust me, you'll feel a sense of belonging just from fighting alongside countless fellow soldiers. And you'll find a play-style you like.",1697486361,1697486361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't been berated by the community for walking around aimlessly at times. I've actually had a few nice interactions so far even when im doing something unorthodox. I've mostly been fighting on the front-lines and have yet to dip my toes in any of the more technical aspects of the war. But the combat is rather fun and tricky to learn. Once i got the hang of it ive been enjoying even more than i already was. I think the main fear of getting into this game is the community and to be honest its scarier then it looks but i can assure you there are way more nice and engaging comrades then there are bad ones. 

I also think that if you find games where you're doing a lot of hard work and getting little in return to be not as fun then this might not be a game for you. Attacks and killing other players can be rewarding in itself but if you're expecting to hop on a push the front line even further then you're going to find yourself mentally exhausted because more often then not you will be fighting in the same spot for hours or even days. The other day i was fighting in one area and decided to get off and take a break. When i returned we were still in the same spot doing almost the same thing. Fighting in the same trench as before. But it does feel nice when you get back on and you see that the area that you fought for hours and days for was finally captured.

But then, you realize that games like this are a  prime breeding ground for terminally online losers who require the validation of others in the form of clans. Simply put, piss off a collection of these losers and you're banned from the game, essentially. The moderation in this game is the form of mass voting people off, and the devs picking up the pieces in the forms of tickets submitted to their help desk. A clan can ban you for a few days, and your only recourse will be an unban that will occur in 1-3 business days. 

However, this process has improved greatly as of late. Serial mass-false-reports tend to be banned more often now (See the case of ""BadManLarry"" in the Foxhole community), but there is still much room for improvement. New players tend to be targeted the most by clans because they are suspected of being alt accounts, and older players who tend to piss off clan men get mass reported the same as well. I would recommend this game under 2 conditions:

1. You're willing to join a clan, willing to be bossed around, and willing to be a punching bag for certain people who haven't found a way to manage their anger issues, and take it out on newer clan members. (Of course, you'll have clan guys who say ""We aren't like other clans!!! we're different!!!!"" but as someone who's spent hundreds of hours trying out various clans, they tend to be all the same.)

2. You're willing to deal with the fact that you may or may not eventually piss off a certain clan member, who will then go to his discord or squad chat with 10-20+ people to have you banned off the game, forcing you to make a ban appeal and wait a certain amount of time before you can return.

Otherwise, the community makes what could be a really fun game, an absolute cesspool.",1601797677,1697471925,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

the logistics of the game is fun but it's ""challenging"" in a sense. it does require a lot of time.

the infantry aspect of the game is also fun, however, i do not mostly do infantry so i do not have a lot of say in it.

the tanking mechanics of the game is FUN. a little farming is required to get that tank but when you do, using that tank will be fun. you will need the ammo and extra materials before you do get to use that tank (remember to always wear a gas mask).

the people. the people are what make the game great. the people you play with will define your playing experience. i've played with this group of people and they're always fun to play with, there's always some banter, but we all have fun in the end.

then there's the bad. people will buy more accounts just to log onto the opposing side and attempt to ruin things on said side. 

there's also, in my opinion, some questionable update choices. in a recent update announcement, it was said that push guns will have to be deployed to be utilized. that pretty much lowers the total capability of a push gun.

The developers are continuously developing the game and never charging for expansions, dlc, micro-transactions etc.  If you enjoy the idea of a persistent war that continues to develop while you are offline, this will certainly be an interesting game for you.  I highly doubt you will regret spending $30 on the game.

On the other hand...it is difficult for me to ""recommend"" this game based on the grindy, addictive nature and the generally toxic community.  People love to hate players in the ""enemy"" faction and it gets pretty bad.  It's just a game, but not everyone thinks that way.  Many people joke that Foxhole is a social experiment.

The balance is a very contentious issue as the asymmetry in this game is more extreme than any other game I've ever played.  Any frustration is exacerbated since you have to pick a faction for the duration of the war which can last months in the real world.

The latest update for naval only doubles down on this.

In inferno, once easily accessible vehicle variants and more where all shoveled into the terrible Facility system. Facilities serve the purpose of making what was once a relatively simple logistics process into literal nightmares of tedium and constant upkeep. Only large clans have enough manpower to reasonably run facilities by splitting the maintenance tedium among members and building out large enough facilities to make the higher end vehicles. This has largely resulted in large clans hoarding resources and keeping everything locked to themselves, and really why wouldn't they. There do exist some that do what they can to share access, but that is essentially a bandaid to the hurdles the devs intentionally put between the average player and their ability to access those things.

For the naval update the devs have decided this was all a great idea and have doubled down. All the new toys are still facility only. All the new ships and spgs have exorbitant costs and construction times. Even the basic trailers are facility made only. And to add insult to injury, the new towing mechanic screws over field gun arty with nonsense undeploying and redeploying to change the aim, and the towing isn't even fast enough to be considered useful anyway. Yup, even a basic function like towing was made to be so hopelessly inept at doing something basic like pulling a gun to the front without needing a flatbed, it is instead an entirely useless mechanic.

The average small time player is no longer part of the dev's vision for this game. So save your money and go else where, it simply isn't worth your time.",1697223740,1697223740,False,42,0,0.677532792091369629,0,True,False,False

A world to build anything and everything.  A place where you can part of a truly huge war driven completely by players.  And a healthy community to have fun.  

But!  I have to be real with myself and those looking to buy this game.  While fun, this game requires TIME and ""not so fun"" teamwork.  Time because this game needs a few hours per play session to feel meaningful.  Teamwork because anything meaningful (assault, logistics, building, and operations) require a group of your friends/teammates.  Perhaps this is not really a negative as much as the nature of this type of gaming.  However, for those of us that are fairly busy, unless you have a tight group of friends to play, this game may not be for you.

This is the kind of game where you kind of have to figure things out as you go and listen to what other players tell you when it comes to doing certain roles. This game isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. Logistics can be tedious and combat can be as well. 

However, with all that being said, this is honestly one of the best games I've ever played, period. There really isn't any other game that quite captures the vibe that is Foxhole's mix of quiet, back line logistics and deafening, sprawling front line battles with dozens of players. Being there for a major battle at the end of a war where both sides are throwing everything they have against each other are some of the most cinematic experiences I've seen in a game before.

From being infantry, medics, tankers, recon, base builders and much much more. The world is constantly evolving and changing around you. Fight in one area all day long and make a large push into enemy territory then go to bed and wake up to the enemy pushing you back or vice versa. If your addicted to building bases and testing out your defenses and trying to fix those errors in later bases, you can do that! The back line feels like a war where preparations are made. Most players will gladly help you with questions you have. Your fighting and get bored of that?  change and find a new front line where you could possibly help the war efforts.  

Game has alot content and  updates once purchased you get all future DLC with no pay to win mechanics.  With a another big update this October! Naval Warfare! 

My only gripe about the game is being a solo player its become much harder to do solo things because your so torn apart in having to make gear or fight to defend  regions, or even needing an extra person for a gunner, Really it becomes a problem because alot of new players are scared to build or even tank when you have veterans with thousands of hours that will gladly lay into a new player for a simple mistake anyone could make.

With that, not everyone is a control freak and the community is what brings me back every time. From friendships I've made along the way to shooting artillery at the enemy for 8 hours straight, even having conversations with the enemy, this game doesn't get stale.

I think this game is an amazing gem. It's a world of constant war where basically all of the in-game situations are for players to create.

[h2] In terms of gameplay and fun, it really depends on how you play.  [/h2]

[h3] Playing solo - is mediocre. [/h3]

As mentioned earlier - you're just a cog, a game is balanced in a way that only by a collective effort of a lot of people major changes to the frontline are achievable. If you're looking for MVP SOLO 360 NONSCOPE CLUTCH - there are games that fulfill this need way better. The most fun solo experience is when you're able to communicate with other random players and team up to achieve something. Or just admire the beauty of horror that is happening around you - the situations this game generates are fantastic, you will constantly hear a soldier in a side tranch calling for a medic, an officer yelling at you to push a fortified MG encampment, constant artillery shells taking lives of your fellow soldiers - and much much more, you can find examples of such situations in a lot of different reviews here.

There is also a solo logi experience that basically comes down to driving your truck from salvage fields to a refinery to the factory to the frontline while listening to a podcast or watching a video on a second screen and trying to understand what kind of supplies people actually need at the moment based on map intel. It may be fun if you enjoy the feeling that you actually help your fellow men and the guns you brought may be used to eliminate enemy soldiers, or medical supplies may save many lives.

[h3] Small group - fun. [/h3]

With a small group of 3-5, you are open to much more content such as armored warfare, artillery, infantry squad, sabotage group, gunboat crew, simple base building, and more, but not everything. The game really opens up a lot and you can start to feel your impact but it's still not much. You won't be able to comfortably sustain industrial facilities or large bases with such a small group unless you're investing way too much time in the game, and without those, you won't have easy access to high-end armored vehicles. It's not too limiting but you will feel it anyway once you stumble upon an enemy battle tank or a super tank.

[h3] Being a part of a regiment - fun? [/h3]

This is a way a big part of long-lasting community plays. It's basically a big group of people that are well-organized, with usually their own industrial facilities, consisting of smaller groups that specialize in different types of activities (like armored warfare, artillery, and infantry) and they plan out big operations. They have the most impact on the frontline and wars in general. Being part of such communities comes with the burden of social responsibility, since operations are executed in specific time and you have to participate in those to be noticed. I'm not up to those kinds of responsibilities since I have at least some kind of social life, so there's not much I can tell about that experience.

[h2] Community [/h2]

For some reason, a lot of people say that the community in Foxhole is toxic. I assume those people are new to the internet in general. Of course, there is some level of shit-talk present, but from solo and small group experience, the community is one of the best in video games. Tons of cases where random people came up to help, explained some complicated game mechanics, risked their lives to save me and get to the medic. There was even a case where our group tank was stuck in trenches and another fellow tank took all of the enemy shells while a squad of infantry tried to dig us out of it, we made it out thanks to their help. ZERO, I would like to repeat ZERO cases of intentional griefing or ruining behavior spotted. It might be luck but considering more than 100h of gameplay it is safe to assume that those cases are really rare. Maybe people are talking about regiment communities, but as already mentioned I wasn't able to be part of those.

Overall - I recommend this game since it's a truly unique experience and devs deserve the support.",1696802644,1696802644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the biggest pros for me is that its worth playing even if u have little time to play per day. I have time to play only in the evening for like 2 hours and it still enough. Even during those 2 hours u can do a lot of things to actually help your team. Either by joining soldiers at front or just becoming one of the logistic guys. Con for me is point of view in the combat i still cant get used to it and its hard to aim properly especially when u run around a corner and then u have to rotate camera 90 degrees so u can see because if u dont there is simply wall in the way or bulding so u cant aim at the enemy instantly. But i hope thats just now while having 13 hours in game and it is just something i have to master. Otherwise the game is really fun to play. EDIT another thing that kinda sucks is at the last idk one week before war end where your faction is holdin minimum hexes there is non stop queue to the frontline hexes so if u re type of player like me that spend like 3 hour per day playin game on average u just wont get to play at all. You can try waiting but i believe u ll spend hour or hour and a half waitin until the 40 ppl queue is gone.,1681487859,1696795432,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like have these developers ever played a video game in their lives? They won'y fix broken mechanics just push out more broken mechanics and dumb updates. Yeah the new vehicles are cool if you could actually drive them, ya know, NOT spend 30 hours to get the resources and build it, then lose it in 10 seconds? That would be a lot more fun. 

This game is cool, don't get me wrong, but it's also messed up. It's really hard to play, not learning wise, it's just that you'll want to play, you'll get in, you'll notice a 20 man queue for a region with everyplace else dead, then quit. That's how you play this game. OR you get into the game, spend your time loading out, you know; grabbing gun, bandages, ammo. You go up to the front, took you all of yeah let's say 10 minutes? Then you'll die within a few seconds, then you'll have to spend another 10 minutes to gear up. That's how you play this game.

All of the new players are at the front lines, once you ""stop being a new player"" you'll do mostly logistics and behind the lines stuff. Meaning; your entire armies pushes are being done by novices. It's amazing that anything gets done.

This game isn't about base building, or building a tank and getting a crew and fighting in it.
In fact, in order to build anything you have to set aside A LONG TIME gathering and processing the resources to build even 1 tank. Then you have to fuel it, then you have to load it, and you have to have gathered and processed those resources and the resources to make the ammunition. Ok so you have all that, bring it up to the line, get hit by a gas grenade, enemy takes your tank, all in 7 seconds. 
Moral of the story; just steal or make friends with a logistics crew and use their stuff. 
This is not a pick up and play game, you absolutely have to set aside at least 1 hour.
You know how it's supposedly a MMO? Yeah they have server queues and max limits for players in regions, really really stupid mechanic in the terms of a ""persistent war."" We could claim that it's hindered by the current technology, but it isn't.

[h2]Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ[/h2]

Foxhole is an exceptional and immersive sandbox war game that stands out in the crowded gaming landscape. It offers a unique and captivating blend of strategy, cooperation, and persistent warfare that sets it apart from traditional shooters and strategy games.

At its core, Foxhole is all about player-driven conflict. You're not just a soldier; you're a cog in a massive, persistent war machine. The game's open world is a constantly evolving battlefield, shaped entirely by the actions and decisions of the player community. It's this player agency that makes Foxhole a standout experience.

One of the game's most remarkable aspects is the sense of teamwork and cooperation it fosters. You'll find yourself working alongside fellow soldiers to build fortifications, transport supplies, and launch offensives. The need for communication and coordination is paramount, creating a strong sense of camaraderie among players.

The game's strategic depth is another standout feature. Battles aren't won solely by twitch reflexes; they require careful planning and execution. You'll be tasked with managing logistics, coordinating with your team, and adapting to the ebb and flow of the war. The feeling of accomplishment when a well-executed plan succeeds is truly gratifying.

Visually, Foxhole might not compete with high-budget AAA titles, but its simplicity allows for a smooth and engaging experience, even on less powerful hardware. The graphics serve their purpose well, immersing you in the game's war-torn world.

One of the few drawbacks is the game's steep learning curve. Newcomers might find themselves overwhelmed initially, but the supportive community and in-game tutorials help ease the learning process.

In summary, Foxhole is a gem in the world of multiplayer war games. Its player-driven warfare, emphasis on cooperation, and strategic depth create a uniquely immersive experience. If you're a fan of games that emphasize teamwork, strategy, and the thrill of large-scale warfare, Foxhole is a must-play title that offers an exhilarating and ever-evolving battlefield to explore.",1696655525,1696655525,True,28,0,0.637752890586853027,0,True,False,False

The premise was WW2 massively multiplayer on essentially ONE server. You can go infantry, tanks, planes or navy, it was quite a surreal feel to join a battle with over 100 other guys.

That being said this is close to that feeling. The game is top down which feels weird, and the shooting is hard to master. When i joined you couldn't even see beyond your firing arc. Despite  how jarring it felt it was so interesting that the game was so full of life. A sign from some random guy begging not to steal, people mining endlessly for hours etc. The immersion is a great aspect of the game you feel like your apart of a bigger machine. You fight in different climates and different places that become notable once you play long enough. You can even tell your own war stories because the chaos of the battlefield is always so interesting. I spent little time on the battlefield because aiming is so bad, bullets tend to drift etc it just doesn't feel good unless your in a group, which leads me into the main negative.

If for whatever reason you play solo, it will suck. Anything interesting requires a team or group. Which isn't bad its just how trash the already formed groups are. If you don't have irl friends who are into this kinda game good luck getting into a tank etc. I spent a lot of time as logistics. Working the mines, producing supplies, moving supplies etc. Eventually it became  pointless? Atleast that's how it felt. Why am i spending ours helping to create stuff i won't ever use? The game i initially referenced allowed you to go up in rank based on kill count and held capture points etc. There was a sense of achievement, in foxhole you basically get some guy giving you a thumbs up if you deliver stuff. Plus it was easy to take part in the bigger more complex equipment in the other game. You don't NEED to be in a clan. In foxhole you NEED to be in a clan to accomplish anything worthwhile that is.

 Not being able to participate in fun stuff and constantly having to act as fodder for the war machine aswell as mindlessly and endlessly farming supplies to feel some sort accomplishment that you are affecting the war etc. It really becomes less and less fun.

- You can either fight on the frontline with a plethora of weapons that requires teamwork to achieve good results with.
- Or you can go to the backline to make the factories and equipment that the frontliners will need to push the line.
- Or you can build large bunkers to secure terrain against enemy invasion.
- You will need to organise with hundreds of players to achieve shared goals.
- The two available factions have different playstyles that you will need to adapt to.

The game's concept is amazing. The execution however...

- Game balance has been terrible since the introduction of asymmetry. It is probably worse now than it was during early access. These problems are easily fixable, but for some reason they remain unfixed. [b]One faction has a definite upper hand over the other faction balance wise, which leads to a pop imbalance (who wants to play on the always losing team?) and bigger queues.[/b]
- Factories are unintuitive. Logi is unintuitive. You spend a lot of time asking questions because the interface does a terrible job telling you what the gameplay loop actually is. [b]You spend a lot of time grinding just to work around the game's clunky mechanics.[/b] You will have a hard time learning anything here unless you join a clan or you are lucky enough to come across an individual that is up for spending hours with you telling you how the system works.
- Good bunkers require the use of game bugs to build. The bunker meta is something that only the vets understand. [b]Bad balance in terms of anti-structure weaponry means people who build bunkers can lose a week's worth of work in 1 hour or less.[/b]
- Ingame organisation is awful. If you want to organise anything, it will be all done on discord. The game's squad system and map marks alone are wholly inadequate to deal with the task of organising offensives involving hundreds of people, and yet that's all you have to access. Casuals just do whatever on the front, only clans ever actually properly push something nowadays. This is not ""skill issue"", it is simply because [b]organising for people who do not live on discord is terrible, and at worst impossible when the ingame VC system goes down.[/b]

You can have fun in this game. But on balance you will spend more time being frustrated with the myriad of issues that it has, than having fun. The more you play, the more you will notice the glaring issues in the execution of its design. The more you will become annoyed about the thousands of issues that would take a tiny amount of time to fix that the devs never seem to fix.

You might think ""haha look, another guy who has played 2k+ hours leaving a negative review"". Yes I play this game even now. [b]Would I recommend it to others in its current state? Absolutely not.[/b] Save yourself, don't get involved, don't chug on the hopium/copium that the devs will fix the game. Just wait and see from a distance. I still hope that it will become competitive again, but in its current state it is not. If the devs do manage to fix it in the next few months, I will change this review.

And if a dev answers: I know that you hand-out temporary bans of like a few days, but I don't count that as ""doing something"" because you don't escalate the bans and the alts don't care. They just log into yet another alternate account and keep doing it.
Permaban these griefers after handing out some temp-bans.
Or hand out at least longer temp bans.
And hand out hardware ID bans against these players, so they're banned, temporarily or permanently, on their main account too.

Or, since you're so unbothered by the alting problem, make it an official game mechanic, where you steal the uniforms of enemy soldiers, that you have to repair in the backline, so you can go and do spy shit with some repurcussions (like AI doesn't detect you but there is a chance that they discover you're a fraud).

Do at least something!
""Report them and we ban them for a day"" doesn't cut it and doesn't warrant all the extra work.
Imagine: The alts ruin our fun and then you expect us to go all the extra mile to catch it on video, catch their Steam-Profile ID, upload it on YouTube (in areas with slow internet that can take ages) and report it to you via your website and we don't even get a reply if an action has been taken against that player and his main account or not.

I repeat: I love the game itself but as long as the devs don't take decisive action against the alting problem, my review stays negative, stay away from the game, don't give these devs money, don't give them money for their upcoming game called ""Anvil"".

In the case that the devs do decide to take decisive action, I'm willing to change my review.

PS: So for Update 52 they announced a huge bunch of QoL And Moderation/Anti-Griefing Updates, which is good, BUT they didn't adress the core issue yet, that alts get banned way too short-spanned with like only 1-3 days bans and get no perma bans.

If I could give a neutral review, I'd do it, but I can't, so for now I leave it as a negative review.

Since they added more logs now to track down alts and want to improve their moderation of the game, maybe they will do something in the desired direction with Update 53.

So TL;DR, they're on a good way, but not there yet.

Update 10/5/2023:

They just announced Naval Warfare Update and it is gross, biasing a faction and giving the finger to the other. This is no way to heal this game.

[h1]LONG:[/h1] 

The aiming system sucks. Im perfectly capable of putting my mouse cursor on the enemy and clicking, but even on enemies who are standing out in the open the game decides i didnt click hard enough or something and refuses to lock on, instead sending the bullet way over his head or straight into the dirt 5 feet away from me. There is also not alot of visual or audio feedback for when you shoot someone or get shot. No hitsound, no screen effect, you have to squint your eyes and look for the subtle blood splatters and wait for either you or the enemy to fall over dead.

Navigating the environment can be difficult for stupid reasons. Ive fallen through the floor multiple times, cliff edges sometimes push you out into the open to get shot, sometimes when walking ill get caught on the weird geometry and get stuck until i either get pushed out or die. The climbing system is broken too; sometimes i can climb shoulder-high objects easily, other times i have to shuffle in place and hold the spacebar for several seconds before the game allows me to climb over the shin-high plank of wood blocking my path. 

The social and strategic aspects are really fun though. A single soldier can easily make a difference even in a 50v50 with the right strategy, and there are quite a few playstyles for infantry to keep the game fresh. The community is about what youd expect for a world war style military simulator but it was suprisingly friendly, I havent heard a single racial slur or homophobic rant over voice or text chat. Which is EXEEDINGLY rare for a game like this.

UNRELATED: Once i got caught in the open reloading; an enemy ran up to me and tried to shoot me at point blank range, moving around between each shot. He missed 5 times in a row and said ""What the fuck!!"", as if he somehow wasnt expecting this, like the game wasnt working properly. This epic meta strategy he probably learned about on reddit or youtube had failed him, something about it was so demotivating i logged off for the night. I genuinely felt bad for him, he had given in to the meta, he was no longer a gamer but a collection of strategies carefully crafted by nerds who are allergic to fun and whimsy.",1689153326,1696205342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Players on both factions (though I personally have only witnessed the Wardens) will exploit the game in a way to give themselves unfair advantages such as glitching onto the mountains (which have no legitimate way of scaling) among other things that directly violate the Code of Conduct. (building glitches such as curved bases and so on). The game is a good game but I am not sure I can recommend it in it's current state do the the amount of CoC rule breaking and the rise of toxicity among players on both factions. I have witnessed Colonials execute teammates (low rank new players) calling them Alts because of a lack of game knowledge, clans plague the game with their own levels of toxicity but that is a different story for another person to tell.

Let me be clear, the game is GOOD and definitely unique but the PLAYERBASE is ruining the experience, and Siege Camp is doing absolutely nothing about it. They may fix a glitch but they do not discipline people who violate the Code of Conduct and it has led to a community that essentially says ""well the other team did it first.""",1696196584,1696196584,False,1,0,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False

Tutorials and training are poorly done, making it pretty unfriendly to people who aren't familiar with these types of games. - It gives you a vague grasp of the basics, for a game that has a huge amount of complication, I would've expected at least a better beginners' guide.

The camera is disorienting and makes it hard to fight in rapidly changing situations from a top-down perspective. - It's hard to view what's ahead more than 50 metres unless you're aiming down iron sights, making it hard to plan routes ahead. - I'm used to Total War top-down cameras and fast-paced action, but this took it to ridiculous levels when needing to push through multiple houses and alleys.

Terrain climbing on natural objects is janky and glitchy, moreso on rocky terrain.

Stepping into ankle-deep shallow water somehow turns you into the slowest man alive, and you put away your weapon, despite still being able to use it if you re-equip it, it makes it feel almost like a bug when it happens?

Negative Review Saved Below for Posterity made at 764.2 hours. Thank you to the person who gave me an award for it, I still retain a negative-ish opinion about the devs' PR skills.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought Foxhole in early-access, about 2 months prior to the Entrenched Update and I absolutely love this game. I have by far the most hours on this game compared to any other I own and frankly it shows. 

Foxhole is a game that is incredibly addictive, you can easily go from one position to another in a very fluid manner, with each position incredibly fleshed out and exciting. I'll include an example from earlier in this war:

I, a medic, near the Iris (east side of the map) needed medical supplies and looking on the map found some in a bunker about 500 meters away, running there I found the medical supplies I needed to heal people and found a truck with fuel. As no-one claimed the truck, I thought it would be better to run logi (logistics) to the frontline bunker, so people won't have to run to the backlines to get medical gear like I did. Upon leaving to get medical gear from a logi port, I passed a decayed base (keeping that in mind) I delivered the supplies and returned to the decayed base to repair it. 

In the span of about 50 minutes, I went from medic, to logiman, to engineer and each felt like I would have a clear definable method of aiding the team and my allies. Now some of this is due to my short attention span, but on a good front you can have hours of fun just playing one role. (Infantry, tanker, medic, support). 

Even the scrapping and material making can be fun in small doses, put on some music and drown your eyes with scrooping, or run materials from the far backlines to the midlines. It's incredibly fun.

Additionally, the community is one of the most engaging and welcoming to new players that I have ever seen(for the most part, more on that below). My first 300 hours was all done without the aid or membership of a regiment, and I remember those days fondly. Community engagement can lead to all sorts of fun just with people being themselves, or playing characters on a battlefield. 


So why the ""No"" Vote?

The stereotypical cry for attention. Simply put, as I engage in higher levels of Foxhole discourse I have noticed the developers have ways to just not care about listening to their audience in ways that make us feel heard. I have two examples of this. 

First is the LOGI Union. A group of international players who worked to form a real-life union for an online game. It sounds crazy, but it happened (and is still happening). It was big news in the community, lovers, haters, and the in-between all talked about the Logi Union; it was even covered by a couple Games News Channels. The following update, there were some marginal changes to logistics mechanics, but there was no official acknowledgement from the developers. It was as if they were some big company trying to strike-break a union by offering cookies and crumbs to get them to stop. Despite not fully committing to the Union myself, it was an obvious sign that things would continue in that manner. 

Second, is the problem with alts and cheaters. To preface this, I will say for a long-time I have resisted this complaint, a lot of people use ""alt"" as an insult to to derogate the other people or regiments in the game and can be highly divisive within the community. ""Alt"" stands for a person who creates another account in Foxhole to join the other team than their main account to purposely sabotage logistics, vehicles, bases, and intelligence (planned operations that sort of thing). However, this war I have seen first-hand multiple people who gas out entire townhalls full of people, or drive cranes with emplacements into rivers, try to steal tanks from others, and generally be a nuisance. 

This has always been a problem, however never at a level that has committed vast grievances across the whole community. In the end, oftentimes alts do the work of partisans, and those who are more obvious are caught (but never banned), but the real problem is the damage it causes to the community. Take a quick scan of other negative comments, many come from new players who got ""caught"" as an alt and were quickly mass reported. Alts know what to do, they are veterans who go in with a specific task and leave before they can be caught. A new player makes a mistake and they are lynched for it. Because these days more people are quicker to judge, mistakes have been made that led to waste of resources and we are more suspicious as a whole and I hate that. 
The other day, people were talking in region-chat about a suspected alt, I thought they were just being babies about a new player. 5 minutes later in the height of an artillery barrage, he gassed out the townhall, we survived, but it makes me weary to trust new players. And I went through that experience as a new player.

Siege Camp and the development team of Foxhole hurt me. They insult the players' intelligences and they roll out updates without a word of acknowledgement. I will continue to play, but I do not recommend new players to until this review becomes positive.",1676319638,1695806486,True,0,0,0.552238762378692627,0,True,False,False

The Colonials get the worst gear by comparison- and of course the Colonials get to deal with the obvious developer bias. . . Don't believe me?

OF COURSE- Warden loyalists will moan about the argenti early war (which is relevant for like 3 days and then never again because they get the blakerow which is more accurate and fires faster 7 days after war start) .... OF COURSE wardens will say ""but the ISG"" when they have the Cutler Foebreaker on day 8 and they get to PVE without challenge from 40-45 meters in trenches while ISGs barely reach 35m and deal less damage. . .

The devs LOVE WARDENS- they do so much they have SIEGE glitch and cheat actively on stream (I recorded them several times taking advantage of their own broken mechanics gaining advantages in stream). They do it bold faced and support streamers who only stream wardens (but don't know the game) - meanwhile ignoring the actual pleas and suspicions given up by normal players who want some kind of equality in field of play. . .

Foxhole is one of those rare gems that I've been seeking for many years and yet I cannot help but find myself rather... disappointed in several regards. My review will detail what I love, and utterly despise about this enjoyable, but headache inducing game, and why I give it a tentative thumbs up. 


[h1]What I love:[/h1]
[b]Teamwork the good:[/b]
The game glorifies teamwork. Teamwork is literally the name of the game and without it nothing would get done. Half the time, everything runs smoothly. Logistics is on point, delivering ammo, B-mats, weapons, uniforms, medical supplies, explosives, ect to the active frontlines where they're sorely needed. Players are working together to fortify a heavily contested location; building up intricate bunker and trench lines that are nigh impossible to crack without a heavy armor spearhead and countless artillery bombardments, coordinating combined arms of artillery, tanks, light scout vehicles and infantry into a beautiful blend of overwhelming firepower and morale crushing speed. Medics are playing their roles well keeping the frontline alive and active with their invaluable work, ensuring each squad is back up to full fighting strength without too much downtime. Often going out of their way to pull victory from the jaws of defeat with well timed and well coordinated triage efforts. Teamwork makes the entire game run, and without teamwork Foxhole just wouldn't be possible. By that point alone it's the main selling point that hooked me without question. 


[b]The Community the good:[/b]
Regardless what side of the coin you fall into; Colonials, Wardens, it doesn't much matter. Foxhole offers you a rich and diverse group of players who can move whole armies, shatter impregnable fortresses, craft endless tides of weapons and vehicles for war, aiding and guiding newer players on how to play well, while providing an experience unlike anything I've seen in an MMO before. I've met many a wonderful player who has made the game all that more engaging and wonderful, forging strong bonds of friendship that last even to this day for me. Foxhole has time and time again shown it's an incredible game with everything I could ask for. It's like a blend of RTS and third person shooters, and I adore it beyond words. As cliche as it sounds, when you're hunkered down in a foxhole with three other players with artillery shells exploding all around you, you feel a kinship with those players. Especially when someone breaks out into a shanty while explosions tear the land asunder with everyone else joining in.


[b]The Wars the good:[/b]
Foxhole lives up to the promise in crafting an all encompassing war that spans days, weeks, months at a timeWars that can swing from one side having the initiative and advantage, to it all being lost by one massive breakthrough by the other team. The high stakes of every engagement, the thrill of being part in some grand operation to push the enemy out of territory you need, and the white knuckle firefights where one mistake could cost you hours of progress. It what really helps the game shine, and makes it feel like the most authentic large scale persistent war I've had the pleasure of playing in. 


[h1]What I hate:[/h1]
[b]Teamwork the bad:[/b]
While teamwork is the name of the game... you're not always going to find it in Foxhole. Logistics ignores priority zones in favor of hording resources for specific clan bases, which can lead to massive swathes of territory being lost, and the war tipping firmly into the favor of the enemy. Players run around like chickens without heads grabbing as much ammo and material as possible only to die by throwing themselves haphazardly into the enemy lines losing both shirts and vital resources. Or just as often kamikaze a vehicle into the enemy base in some vain effort to feel like the main character of the game. Medics are screamed at for not running out into the line of fire to save some fool who chose to run headlong into the enemy machine guns or just as often not doing their jobs and healing those who are dying. And the absolute nightmare that is haphazardly constructed bases that are more of a detriment to the builders than to the enemy. Teamwork is the all important thing that makes Foxhole run smoothly, and unfortunately it's a mixed bag which result you'll get. Half the time it's a deeply engaging and breath taking example of what the players can accomplish by working together, and other times it's an utter cesspool of stupidity that there is no real escape from. 


[b]The Community the bad:[/b]
This is where the majority of my criticism lays. In this large scale persistent war you will find the absolute worst aspects of humanity on full display. Granted, my complaints are not focused upon the majority of the community, but the deafening minority who unleash slur after slur at each other for no other reason than to get a rise out of the other. Attacking people based upon the faction they choose to play. Sending death threats and calls to 'remove themselves from living' for daring to play a faction other than their own, harassing and degrading new players for simply trying to learn the game or just outright shooting them repeatedly for the laughs, and countless other examples. The game is supposed to glorify players bonding and playing together for a shared goal, and yet a vocal minority ruins the fun for the rest of the players by being xenophbic asshats who deify their precious faction to an unhealthy degree. 


[b]The Wars the bad:[/b]
In a game about persistent war, there are going to be agonizingly long stretches where you find yourself with nothing to really do. You missed the massive breakthrough into enemy territory and there's no trucks around to give you a lift? Better start running and hope you don't run into partisans. Get killed without setting your spawn point at the Battle Bunker? Best hope you don't get left behind when the frontline charges forward. The wars can be a great deal of fun when you get to take part in the actual fighting, but just as often you can get left behind without warning, or get drafted into resource consolidation by some higher ranking player who can and will kill you for disobeying them. Or just as often staring out across no-man's-land for hours on end waiting for the enemy to attack or your own team to attack. Or, worst of all, being on the receiving end of a total rout. Being steamrolled day in day out with no real way of fighting back, it becomes discouraging, and frankly not much fun. I could go on much more about it all, but I think my point is fairly clear.


[b]Conclusion: [/b]
At the end of the day I give the game a solid 3 out of 5. Foxhole has it's goods, it's bads, and it's ugly. In short, you should at least give the game a try and see if it's up your alley, though I highly suggest getting it while it's on sale. The game may not be for you, but there's no real harm in giving it a try as long as you keep in mind that like any game there will be toxic assholes, and frustrating lapses in action. I have much more to say about the game, but this review is already long enough as it is, and in the end only you can formulate your own opinion on this rough but undeniably gorgeous gem. A tentative thumbs up.

If you really want a WWII shooter experience without feeling like the main character and unfair death is the norm, this game is for you.

First off, your actions have to be slow and deliberate in order play well. You can't just rush into the front lines. I can not tell you how many times in my first few hours in the game how I took a bunch of gear just to go and die because I thought the trenches were just aesthetic. Only poke your head out for short periods of time. Stabilize your gun before you fire. Wait until night to rush across the battlefield. Even tanks can get demolished by going a bit too far into enemy territory.

If you want a more chill experience, you don't have to be in the front lines. The equipment in a base is constructed and transported by far more people in the back lines than in the front. If you just want to collect coal for 8 hours strait while listening to music, you can do that.

The world makes you feel so inconsequential in the whole scheme of things. Even if you are in a tank or manning artillery or get behind enemy lines with a bayonet, your actions can not hope to change the tide of war. A few feet of ground can be an entire region lost tomorrow. Even if you do win, a new war will just start up anew again. If you feel like you let your faction down, just know it's not your fault.

Anyways, Foxhole is fun even when you get pounded by infinite artillery/tanks, the game can be very intense or not if you so feel like it, and the Wardens can eat my Colonial ass.",1695429018,1695429018,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I have yet to run into a bug, which is great for an early access game.  On top of that, when I started off, I had no real clue what I was doing, and while I was trying to get situated, a random sergeant recruited me to help him with logistics, gather scrap and turning it into materials to be used in various factories.

We ran materials to the front, from city to city, delivered loads of shirts (respawn material), rifles, ammo, and grenades, and had great fun for hours.  We lost track of each other when a city fell we were in, and I died before making it back to his truck.  After respawning, I began to dedicate myself to taking back that city, at first simply working with a few others to halt the enemies advance from that one along the back roads to our HQ.  I found my original Sergeant again during a push, and using smoke to disrupt lines of sight, and HE grenades to blow emplacements, 20 or so of us fought for each yard, and eventually each foot on the way back to our lost city's center.

Before I quit for the day, that city was ours once more, and a new front had begun to develop.

If you are on the fence about the game, I wholeheartedly encourage you to pick it up. You will not regret it.



Foxhole is not in a good place right now.

1) Wars last too long.
As of writing, war 100 is wrapping up with a length of roughly 55 days, making it the longest war by a wide margin. The previous record was from War 95 taking 42 days, which was so long it was referred to as the ""forever war"" at the time. The next in line where 36 days and 35 days respectively. In my opinion, wars should never take more than 30 days, as any longer just causes immense amounts of burnout on both sides.

2) Logi and Facilities suck. 
The logi system, which has always sucked, was meant to be fixed by facilities. However, they do nothing to address the array of problems that logi has, and instead introduced a whole slew of new problems.
- They require massive amounts of materials to construct.
- They requires massive amounts of upkeep just to be maintained.
- Automation is practically non-existent, meaning everything needs to be done through manual labour.
- The massive amounts of hours that need to go into running a facility makes it impossible for solo logi and small clans to achieve, as well as still being a massive burden to all but the biggest clans.
- They are really hard to defend, requiring either a massive base to be constructed and maintained, or hoping no partisan comes near your facility.
- They get significantly more complex if you want to build the late game stuff, exacerbating the previous issues.
- All of this is extremely tedious and unfun.
- The best items are locked behind facilities, meaning those who don't want to deal with this are screwed.
The fact that the dev team saw the massive outcry from the L.O.G.I Union, and decided that this was an acceptable solution is a very sad joke.

3) Complete lack of moderation.
This isn't a situation of the devs not moderating enough, but rather the devs refusing to moderate at all. They promote a system of self moderation by the community as a way of not having to pay for moderators themselves, with has just left alts and toxic players getting off with almost anything scot-free. This then leads to a situation where systems like the report player button cannot be significantly changed despite how easily abuseable they are by clans because its the only form of moderation that is available. Better a broken tool than none at all.

4) Complete lack of developer communication. 
A signature move of siege camp is a refusal to properly engage with the community. They can have a literal strike by a large section of the community and they won't even give a ""we are working on it"", let alone seriously engage with the issues presented. The only time they will communicate is when they push a massive update, before going back into hibernation for half a year. Its a big game, they can afford to hire a community manager.

If you haven't touched this game before, you may think its weird I'm writing this after getting 700+ hours out of it, with many other reviews coming from other players with hundreds or thousands of hours, but that's because the more you play this game, the more you are exposed to the deep seeded problems imbedded in this game. Out of all the games I've played, this is the only one where it feels like its actively getting worse with no real hope of change without a significant shakeup at siege camp, which seems improbable at best. I feel powerless to meaningfully change the game in a positive direction, or to address the array of problems not outlined in this post, so the only real thing I can do is post this, and hope the devs take note.

It has some issues that need to be addressed (I won‚Äôt go too much into it, but you can look it up, but little stuff like watchtower shielding, and bunker-bending), and it can be difficult at times (especially if you try to do things solo) but man, this game has some special stuff to it that no other game can offer.

Logistics is a game of its own and can be a lot of fun (although time-consuming) and super satisfying actually seeing things you produced yourself causing destruction on a front line. There is a lot of complexity and levels to it, all the way from the person mining scrap up to the truck driver, or ship captain delivering it.

There are so many special moments you can get in Foxhole you can't get with other games, like being the driver of a truck full of much needed supplies, and sliding through enemy artillery fire to deliver in the knick of time, or my personal favorite: the incredible rush you get from taking down enemy armor as an infantry with nothing but some flasks, your instincts, and adrenaline.

Another thing I love about this game is how global it is, If you play a lot you will end up in squads and regiments with people from all around the world, fighting together for one cause. I have learned so many little facts about other people's cultures, just from shooting the shit in a trench or talking while we wait for daybreak in a tank.

Couple all of that with a community so passionate it borderlines mental illness and you have magic.

Also, a small side note: the ambient sound is so good. It‚Äôs such an eerie feeling when the sun goes down and before all you could hear was gunfire and explosions, and you find it replaced with frogs, birds chirping, and the wind.

Foxhole is for the most part - the military sandbox MMO I'd always dreamed of that the gaming industry had lacked the tech or interest to achieve. Foxhole excitingly achieves this military simulation with an isometric view somewhat limiting your range of vision. This surprisingly creates quite a fun immersive experience, as you begin to notice how insignificant your combat efforts are compared to the larger war machine. Or vice versa, as hero soldiers, covert partisans & tireless engineers change the tide.

Been a persistent faction war demands persistent players and balance on what a single player can achieve. If communication here is not your type of game you may find yourself extremely limited in what you can do. Grab a rifle, a couple of clips & repeat on the front-line.

War 106 has largely been an ""Exploit War' where regiments and people from both sides of the game have elected to exploit things in order to achieve victory, and worse, defend their cheating as legitimate. The community has gotten overly toxic and while I am the last person to ever condemn or point blame at the developers, the lack of communication and moderation from Siege Camp is deafening. The only thing they've done is acknowledge that they're aware of the issues, but refuse to take action on video evidence of people blatantly exploiting unintended mechanics.

I love Foxhole, I truly do. I wanted to commit a large portion of my content creation towards the game, and I've brought a number of people into it; However, I will likely now largely warn my community and to any considering Foxhole to avoid it until Siege Camp elects to moderate their game more closely and strictly by banning those leveraging exploits, as well as actually communicating more with their community on their plans, calling things out for being exploits, and making it clear that the developers will take definitive action against those exploiting the game. Until Foxhole does this, I have no interest in the game moving forward and I anticipate that the player numbers will spike briefly for the upcoming naval update, and then once again plummet.

For the time being, I advise that you avoid Foxhole. You will end up committing a large amount of time towards a game that has been largely abandoned in terms of developer silence and its lack of moderation.",1694284275,1694284275,False,35,4,0.659800589084625244,0,True,False,False

[h3] Pros / What I like [/h3]
What I love about it the most is that you are a very small cog in a large machine, and you'd better get used to the thought when playing! No one player can have an astronomical impact on the front as far as gameplay goes. No one player is going to kill you and all the other friends around you, blow up a tank, and then run laughing back to their lines. Yes, you might get outskilled on occasion, and feel frustrated, but in the long run it is hardly influential to the outcome of the war or even the stretch of front you're playing on. This aspect, apart from allowing even a complete newbie to have fun, encourages cooperation among players (you won't see any squad of 4 people hopelessly destroying your team like you see in Battlefield). Everything  turns out better when you work together with your fellow soldiers!

Another thing I enjoy about the game is that it has one of the best blends of realism and goofiness. It is realistic where it should be, as a wanna-be milsim game, and goofy where it would be too annoying to be realistic. The mechanics are generally fun, the art is lovely, the gameplay simple to grasp. The map is nicely constructed to allow strategical positioning and building, while retaining a cozy feeling whenever you drive around the many different and unique places. Not to mention there's also a little bit of a backstory to it and easter eggs scattered around for players to find.

Continuing the list of aspects I like, I have to mention the fact that winning doesn't matter in this game. Yes, the plot consists of an all out war between Colonials and Wardens. It is a nice morale boost and source of pride for a faction to win a war, maintain a long winstreak, or win significant wars when the playerbase soars and tactics and determination of both factions are put to the test. But does winning matter down to the individual soldier? You can still have fun regardless. You can still crack jokes with your friend while under artillery barrage. You can still catch an enemy tank offguard and destroy it. You can still conduct an operation with your clanmates and push the enemy back. Rude as it sounds as a premise for a game, most of the *fun* in foxhole is derived from the amount of misery you can provoke to the enemy. The more painful you make it for them to take territory, consolidate already occupied one, bring resources and even walk to the front [i]*cough cough artillery barrage cough*[/i], the more fun it is for you. That is, until you're at the receiving end of the same treatment :D


To summarize, why is Foxhole fun? It's a persistent all out war in which cooperation rather than individual skill is the key to victory - which I believe should be the goal of every multiplayer game that pitches one team against another, but none that I played have managed to do so in such an organic way. Not to mention the fun community, the jokes, the roleplay, and the dude blasting Fortunate Son in local voice chat.


[h3] What you might not like [/h3]
Now, let's see what aspects might not appeal to people.

For starters, while I said the mechanics are pretty simple, it will take you a while to get your head around them. The game has a tutorial area in the home region - it's okay for a new player I guess, but somewhat inconvenient since you need to read signs and what not. It's much to learn, but I have always found veteran players willing to teach me in a very friendly manner, and it's way more engaging. I still haven't learned how to build bunkers efficiently after 2k hours, but I know many people who do and whom I could ask for help when needed. 

Another fundamental yet debated topic is Logistics - basically, everything that goes on so that rifles, ammo, vehicles and everything else gets to the front to be used. It's a time consuming process, involving quite a few hours of work depending on what you want to build and ship to the front. Harvesting resources, refining them, turning them into gear and transporting are all simple mechanics, but you need to do them over and over again if you want a healthy stock of supplies to support a front with.

We should also talk about facilities. They are relatively new to the game and are an entire new level of logistics gameplay. In short, they are a pretty long production chain of resources: you build buildings that produce a type of resource using already available materials. Then that resource is used for a new building, producing the next level resource. At the same time, all these resources can be used to upgrade vehicles and make new toys of war. The problem is, it's hard, if not impossible, to do this solo. While regular logistics are ok for a solo player, facilities are usually maintained by clans, where all members pitch in a little and hence the workload is lessened on everybody. Some people / regiments take to maintaining public facilities which you, as a solo player, can use for upgrades freely / for a resource fee. All in all it's not that bad, but doing a solo facility is like getting a job so, for your own good, please don't.

Some people accuse the community of being toxic - in any community you have some bad apples. What bad apples can you expect in Foxhole? People who think their in-game rank gives them authority. People who try hard and start blaming newbies when things go wrong (i.e. their tank gets destroyed and they blame the nearby privates and corporals for not being able to kill harassing infantry). People who gatekeep new players from organized activities - this happens more rarely but as a new player you might see a big clan (lots of people with the same tag before their name) doing something organized. It looks fun, you wanna help or join in, then they start yelling at you to not do something / not mess with their stuff and all that. Sounds bad, it is to an extent, but most often however, it's just too difficult to integrate a new player into an ongoing operation involving tanks, artillery etc. Too many mechanics to explain on the go, and this equipment is quite expensive. Once you get to know logistics better you'll find out why operation leaders are not too keen on letting new players join in in the middle of an ongoing effort (I have been guilty of this myself a couple times). 

Another often toxic interaction is new players building and veteran players telling them to stop doing so. This occasionally devolves into shooting, and yeah, not very fun for a new player. I like to refer to building as a 'delicate art', which myself I don't know how to practice, so building badly can be advantageous for the enemy, and hard for friendly builders to fix after. If caught in such a situation, use the opportunity to ask what you're doing wrong - there has to be an explanation, a reason, preferably a logical one. Try to work out the conflict, instead of escalating.


Many other reviews claim that you need a large group of friends or a regiment in order to have fun. I disagree. I started as a solo medic, had loads of fun at the front on my own / occasionally cooperating with other medics in the same area. I did join a medic regiment and, in time, ended up commanding it, but I integrated so well with the community that I can find another regiment doing an operation at almost any time of day, and they'd be more than glad to have me swing by. You can do the same even by staying solo. Most regiments have auxiliary roles for people who are not members but often play alongside them.

In this review, I will be going over what Foxhole is, what it has to offer, and identify it's strengths and weaknesses in it's current state which at the time this review was written, the version is 0.4 Alpha, the Amphibious Warfare Update.
Let's get started shall we?


[h1]Important information on Foxhole[/h1]

Now granted, you must know this going in, there is a HUGE learning curve here in Foxhole, and if you don't devote some time to reading the tutorials, checking out official videos on how to play, or communicating with your team, you are going to most likely [b]hate[/b] your first experience.

You will spawn in at your army's main headquarters, you will have a hammer and a pistol with a single magazine. You can gether scrap and hundreds of other materials in your backpack, but be careful as your bag gets heavy upon gathering materials, carry too much and you will become encumbered.
 Your objective, win the war. To win, you must capture all towns and your enemies' main headquarters, pretty simple. Upon spawning in, you can do one of two things, you can fight on the front lines, or you can take part in logistics operations. Rifles and other weapons do not grow on trees in Foxhole; they must be created through scrap, components and other various recources from the field of operation, and creating and manufacturing these weapons is quite a process.
One final thing, Foxhole is not a game that can be won by yourself. If you are not coordinating with your teammates through your microphone or text, then you're not going to be assisting your team very much by wasting recources trying to kill the enemy yourself, you will easily get killed all alone. Instead, look for some teammates to tag along with, fortunately the Foxhole community is full of very good and passionate players... mostly. The player's rank is displayed in parentheses to the left of their Steam username. Corporals and Sergeants are the most common and have a good amout of experience on what to do in a squad, don't be shy to talk with your teammates; communication is key.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]


Very fluid gameplay. It's a top to bottom shooter, taking aim will represent a line displaying the exact direction where you are aiming your weapon. There are many many different weapons in the game from rifles (which is the most common), SMGs, Carbines, Mortars, Assault rifles, Machine guns - you name it. Pro tip: you are harder to hit at a range when you are crouching or proning. Your visibility is greatly reduced at night, so you must stayon your toes when partolling at after dusk. I get this eerie feeling when slowly advancing to the enemy town with my squad, the thought strikes you - ""Are we walking into an ambush?"" ""Is there an enemy foxhole just up ahead?"" Combat can get tense.
Even though there are only 7 maps, each of these maps are enourmous, and the average war can take hours and hours to end; I've never participated in a war from start to finish in a single sitting.


[h1]Story of Foxhole[/h1]


There is not much known about the lore of Foxhole, however there are a couple of known facts and notes found by players during the weekly wars that give an idea of what the lore is about.

Foxhole has two fictional factions, the Wardens and the Colonials, fighting a 100-year war in a fictional world (It's locations and setting do not have any correlation with the real world). The makeup of the two factions geographically are unknown, but they do not represent the historical Allies and Axis, even though many players including myself enjoy to depict the Colonials as U.S. Forces and the Wardens as the Axis Forces.


[h1]Issues with Foxhole[/h1]

My largest gripe with Foxhole is how boring and tedious this game can be while running logistics operations, everybody who joins a war wants to grab a gun and fight, who wants to swing a hammer for an hour? And the thing is, logistics is arguably the most important role to play in this game. As I said before, weapons and ammo don't grow on trees. And many players take all these weapons and equipment for granted. Look at it this way: That Assault rifle that guy took and lost.. had taken 3 hours to produce. And yes, it can take 3 or more hours to create an assault rifle, because only logistics can muster the technology upgrades to produce said weapon, [b]which takes a long time.[/b] Logistics needs to be less of a hassle, or simply add a mode where you can respawn with more weapons and medical supplies. I get that Foxhole is supposed to simulate real war in a way, but it would be nice to see some changes.
Another issue is the reprimandation system griefers can use on any player at will as they please. If you are reprimanded, you lose an hours worth of experience points from playing the game; this happened to one of my friends, he was just about to hit the Sergeant rank and suddenly, he was ranomly reprimanded by some troll. The reprimandation system needs tweaking.
The next thing is when an army starts losing the war, the players on that team begin to lose the will to fight and proceed to drop from the server, this leads to the opposing army crushing their enemy beneath their treads as the game drops to 60 VS 20.

Last thing I could say that would improve Foxhole, I believe more Players vs Ememies content is needed, it would help ease more players into the action, and it would be nice to just sit back and have a good time with your friends.


[h1]Summary[/h1]


Overall, Foxhole is very innovative and fresh, of course, this is in 0.4 Alpha at the time this review was written, so there are many spaces for improvement.
Foxhole earns my recommendation for it's diverse gameplay, and the memorable moments I had with my squad on the battlefield. I got my $20 dollars worth from Foxhole. I am currently taking a break from Foxhole for now, once I return, I am hoping Clapfoot will add or improve some of the features I have listed above. If you have any friends that are considering Foxhole, it may be worth giving it a shot.


The final rating for Foxhole is a difficult one since this is an Early Access Game. But for me, the final rating for Foxhole stands at a 6/10. I hope to see a lot more from this game in the future.

This is my first review of an Early Access Game, This is Commander Stealth and I will see you all on the next review.


Over and out. ~Stealth

Edit: I'm revising this review as Foxhole has dramatically changed since this was originally written. Cheaters have overtaken this game and developers have done little to nothing to stop this from happening. Looking back at it now, I've been too nice on this game. Corner-screening always wins, the community is toxic as frack, the population is low and there is no PVE. Not Recommended. Unfortunately I cannot change my recommendation on the review as it will erase this review's ratings, and I will not do that.",1505811725,1693603357,True,61,1,0.758942186832427979,71,True,False,True

If you want to ask about concerns you have with buying the game, feel free to comment or private message me. As someone who's been around in this game and following development off and on since 2017 (first released in early access on Steam), and someone who works in game development, I feel like I have can explain peoples issues with the game and the counterpoints often brought up as well as how the game has progressed over many years. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend it with the caveat that it's not like any other game out there and it's certainly not for everyone. It's a very complex game with many in depth features so expect a learning curve. There's absolutely flaws in the game but in my opinion, it's completely worth it. Especially with how much love the developers put into the game. They're not always right with what they want to do, and they certainly don't communicate as much as they should, but they're clearly VERY passionate about this game and they continue to show it so long as you take off your jaded sunglasses.",1693094744,1693094744,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

From the moment I stepped into the expansive battlefield, I was immersed in a world of constant collaboration, evolving frontlines, and the thrill of cooperative warfare.

The player-driven world of Foxhole is unlike anything I've experienced before. The seamless integration of logistics, combat, and resource management creates a dynamic and immersive environment. The feeling of being a part of a living, breathing war effort is simply unmatched.

The strategic depth of the game is truly remarkable. Coordinating with fellow soldiers, planning attacks, and strategizing to hold key positions keeps me engaged and invested in the outcome of each battle. The camaraderie that emerges from working together to achieve a common goal is incredibly rewarding.

The persistent world adds a layer of realism that few games achieve. The consequences of our actions have a direct impact on the ever-changing frontlines, creating a sense of agency that drives the gameplay forward.

The game's art style is charming and fits the wartime theme perfectly. The sounds of gunfire, explosions, and the hum of machinery all contribute to the immersive atmosphere of war-torn landscapes.

What sets Foxhole apart is the strong sense of community. Whether I'm fighting alongside familiar faces or making new allies, the cooperative nature of the game fosters friendships and memorable moments that stay with me long after I've logged off.",1692920689,1692920689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It suffers from a lot of issues, specially developer communication with the community and cycles of balance issues that generally get fixed in months that are exacerbated by the very embroiled in the game.

-Like massive Multiplayer Games
-Like Wars with tactical and strategic decisions that matter
-Like games that gives you different things to do besides combat including building, supplying or just even participating in the community outside the game
-And have no life

I will recommend this game.

If you don't like
-Very intensive communities related to balance posts
-Games that take time and effort to complete tasks
-Uncommunicative devs
-Factionalism or discussions about the game that makes it looks like a cheap reddit political debate

Putting down barb wire and defenses then watching the enemy struggle into them while my allies picked them off was great. Then it all started to fall apart. 

Whether or not you or your team gets to use certain weapons or tactics is entirely dependent on the clans that run that part of the world. In the current war there are parts of the world my team cannot go because the enemy Storm Cannons (Most powerful artillery in the game, extremely effective) will obliterate us if we try. If we are in range of those guns, they are firing. And they won't stop firing until all of us are dead. 

Meanwhile take a trip to our side of the map? There are SC's one river away from our enemy that just sit dormant because the can that runs them wants to do something else. And because clans can LOCK these weapons, NO ONE gets to use them. SC's will sit fully charged, with 100+ rounds sitting next to it and remain completely unused. When you challenge the clans about this they say you're a noob and need to shut up. You can point out that our enemy isn't letting these extremely powerful weapons just sit there but it doesn't matter they run the world so no one gets to challenge them. 

This goes for a lot of things like logistics, supply, who gets tanks, who gets any kind of support at all. Clans will come in destroy everything you made remake it the way they want it and then leave again and refuse to support you with materials to upkeep. And on top of ALL of this the game has 0 stat tracking. Which means you have no earthly idea if you're making a difference. You can place down 1000 land mines and kill 1000 people or, you could kill no one. You have no way of telling whether or not your contributions made a difference which makes the 3-5 minute slog back to the front lines feel absolutely pointless when you get run over by a friendly car and have to re-equip and walk all over again. Uncertain of if your efforts make a difference. 

It was fantastic for the first few hours. Now I regret getting it, and every time I try to get into it I just find more glaring holes in the formula that make me feel exhausted. If the major clans don't immediately agree with you, you might as well not be playing because you won't be getting any help.

Often people would talk about their bad experiences with a clan that dosent like them, mass reporting them, and them getting banned.

Before i say anything about anything...I would like to say that i have mainly only played casually and alone. That dose not mean i havent interacted with other players and the community as a whole! I have been a part of many small scale operations formed by smaller groups of people or even larger clans. But i am not directly a member of a clan/group, big or small. Now that we have clearly established my position in the player base, lets get into what MY experiences have told ME, about the community, and game as a whole.

I have fought in two wars (at the time of writing), War 105, and 106. In 105 i was a warden, in 106 i am a colonial. I have not gotten into any brawls/fights/arguments/""just a bit of banter""s or general disagreements with other players. Specifically in war 106, in which i started properly interacting with other players. During war 105 i was a lot less experienced and naturally intimidated by the idea of simply joining a tank crew for example. So i have more experience interacting with colonial players than wardens. I cant yet properly say if wardens are any better/worse than collies, but at the very least i can confidently say collies have been VERY noob friendly so far! Now these are only my experiences, which dont speak for everybody, but i personally think that at the current stage of the game (at least if you go collie) you most likely wont have to go through any...Bullying, insulting, mass reports, team kills to players or structures, or any kind of toxicity. But dont think you can get away with doing something legitimately dumb! You will be scolded, but not ruthlessly shitted on.

TLDR: i dont know about wardens, but collies are pretty friendly. Worth the price.

[strike]If you are considering buying this, literally go play anything else, unless you are a masochist or you are allergic to grass. The entire player base loves to hate this, and I quote, Dog S**t Game. Seriously, it is the only reason anyone is still playing it. Unless you are a masochist or suffer from Stockholm syndrome beyond any recovery, just move along and find something better to do with your time. The game is broken since 1.0 and, rather than improve QOL, the devs just double, triple and quadruple down on their V I S I O N‚Ñ¢ ignoring their entire player base screaming at them for months.

If I tone down the raeg a bit, the game is currently in terrible state and needs lots and lots of fixing before it becomes worth recommending again. 

If that doesn't stop you, well, welcome to Hell and try to enjoy your stay.

Edit: With the Update 52 teased and some actual QOL changes promised, I am looking forward to change this review to a positive one, but I won't until the update actually lands, and until I am certain the game has actually and seriously improved. As long as the game state remains largely the same, so will this review.

Edit 2: I am seeing progress being made and I like it. But, I am still waiting to see if it's a one off update, or the devs are finally going to address the ages old issues consistently.
[/strike]
Edit 3:
While a lot of issues are still not addressed, we might see them fixed in the future. I think the cross-faction vc warrants the change of review to Positive. We are finally able to talk to the opposing team in voice chat, and I haven't had that much fun in a while. With that being said, do still remember that the game has a lot of issues with balance and does not respect your time, and a lot of issues are still waiting to be addressed.

I've been a part of the gaming community for years, but Foxhole truly stands out as an incredible gem in the vast sea of titles. From the moment I joined the frontlines, I was hooked by the immersive and dynamic world this game offers.

Foxhole's approach to large-scale warfare is nothing short of genius. The persistent war, where players collectively shape the outcome, creates an unparalleled sense of camaraderie and accomplishment. Teaming up with fellow soldiers, whether it's in the heat of battle or during resource gathering, feels like participating in a real, living war effort.

The game's focus on teamwork and strategy is both refreshing and deeply engaging. Communication is key, and I've made friends and memories that will stick with me for a lifetime. Whether you're scouting the enemy's lines, coordinating assaults, or playing a supporting role, every action contributes to the bigger picture.

One aspect I truly appreciate is how Foxhole promotes creativity. The freedom to construct structures, establish supply lines, and shape the battlefield according to our strategy adds a layer of depth that few games achieve. It's incredibly satisfying to see your plans come to fruition, and the feeling of turning the tide of battle through sheer coordination and ingenuity is second to none.

Graphically, Foxhole might not be on par with the AAA giants, but it's still visually appealing in its own right. The gritty, war-torn landscapes and the attention to detail in both character models and vehicles contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere.

Foxhole's developers deserve major kudos for their dedication to improving the game. Regular updates, responsive community engagement, and a clear passion for their creation are evident in every aspect. The game's learning curve might be a bit steep, but the supportive community and the feeling of accomplishment as you become a skilled soldier are absolutely worth the effort.

In conclusion, Foxhole is a shining example of what multiplayer sandbox warfare games can achieve. It's not just a game; it's an experience that keeps me coming back for more, eager to be part of something much larger than myself. If you're looking for a game that rewards strategy, teamwork, and creativity, look no further than Foxhole.

Original review. 
Had a little bit of fun but overall felt like the game is too much of a chore. 

You wanna run logistics to win the war? In order to get resources, you have to farm mats for them and this is really boring with no personal satisfaction whatsoever. You just hold down M1 button to farm or go drive around the map going to auto-miners. 

Maybe you'd like to be a driver? But your vehicle gets disabled after a few bullets and your supply may end up going into enemy hands after that. Worst still, griefers will come and steal your vehicle full of supplies meant for your home base and rid of your inventory or drive it down to the enemy camp for them to steal. Many times, these griefers are from your own team.

Good luck getting people to vote-kick the griefers if you're a nobody. Much less luck if you are without a clan and don't have any group pull. If you're not in a clan, you belong to a group of nobodies and bad eggs from big clans/groups have pretty much their way to either bully you in game by screaming vulgarities or treating you poorly. 

Maybe you want to be a builder? It might be fun to build walls and establish defences around your base wont it? Yes it would, BUT in game all you really do is laydown a blue print and hold your M1 button between 50-100 times and painfully construct your walls or foxholes with a hammer. Repeat that 3-4 more times to upgrade their tier. 

Developers need to sieve out these poor game design choices and make them more engaging and worthwhile for all parties. Ass of now, being a builder/logistics/farmer/driver is really too much of a chore.

I honestly believe the potential for the most fun and strategy in this game belongs to being in the frontline. You get to scream at logistics for resources, you can plan your attack and flanking options, you even get to go for missions to steal enemy tanks and whatnot. That is what makes a fun game, not pressing M1 button for hours simply to get resources.

Do yourself a favor and join the frontline. Forget about being a logistics, especially so if you're alone or without friends or a clan. Griefers will ruin your gameplay and you'll have no place to address your grievances because you're a nobody. As of now, I wouldn't recommend this game till devs make the game better for all parties involved, and make this less of a chore when it's supposed to be a game.",1539032940,1691991551,True,0,0,0.630494534969329834,0,True,False,True

If you read much of the recent reviews, you'd probably get the gist of the situation right now. Always starts of as the game being a great concept with different working parts to such a player-driven system, from different levels of logistics all the way to the many frontline roles you can fill in, before it devolves into criticism concerning in-game and community moderation, toxic factionalism, QoL issues and more.

My intention for this review is to leave an unbiased review (i.e. leaving out equipment asymmetry)so that those who are looking to buy this game know what they're buying for. It also stands as a message for the developers that, despite all of the major updates they have done and all of the shiny new toys we have, much of the game mechanics remains unchanged and ill-suited to the current state of the game.

There are two main criticisms that people might want to consider:

1. In-game Moderation
     Because persistence plays a major part in Foxhole's gameplay loop, it's to no one's surprise that having a good anti-cheat system, or even just an active moderation team would stop a lot of the cases you usually don't hear on these reviews. 

Cheaters and alt accounts aren't as prevalent as people think, however because of the game's small playerbase and poor tutorial system, they can seem more prevalent than they are and new players can be accused of ""alt behavior"" for something they didn't know was an unspoken rule of the community. There is also the case of toxic behavior and factionalism, however much of it can be attributed to the lack of in-game response that riles people up and causes paranoia.


2. Poor QoL
     Like I said, the game is very player-driven and people can choose what they want to do, however, unless you are taught that there are actual needs to the war you most likely wouldn't know that the non-combat (logistics, building, etc.) gameplay loop takes a lot more time and effort out of the lives of people than it should. 

The map isn't properly adjusted for the new logistics systems in place, base building and facility management is more of a second job to many at this point than it is an ""engaging part of the game"" and causes burnout, there is little in the way of a proper tutorial for new players, and so many smaller issues that have caused minor uproars all the way to an actual, organized strike because of these issues. 

Many will mention that the developers are out of touch and do not know what actually happens in-game, and this is mostly true. While I understand the limitations of their QoL updates because of how the game engine was built or because of time restrictions, I have NEVER seen ""good enough"" community engagement even in the form of a simple Q&A outside of devbranch (which has a completely different atmosphere than actual wars).


TL;DR, the game is good on paper, ignore much of the toxic factionalism and focus on playing the game itself and it's actually not that bad of an experience. Many core mechanics and the gameplay loop needs to change to accommodate its current state, more QoL needs to be addressed, and there needs to be more active moderation in both in-game and the community. 

Don't get me wrong, this game has had some great wars and I and many of my friends have had great experiences over the years, however, that doesn't change the regular gameplay loop that we are forced to endure. There are certain roles that only some people are willing to fulfill, and only so much you can do, and that's okay and kind of the idea of a persistent war game, but that doesn't excuse the shortcomings in other areas that could elevate people's experience. I love this game, the 1k hours of gameplay would tell you enough, but I would not recommend it to anyone in its current state.

Edit: Okay, things have changed a bit. In-game moderation is still player-dependent but we have been equipped with tools and lines of communication that so far have been effective. Even better QOL as well as mechanics overhaul and additions that have made the game more playable. 

 While I wouldn't recommend it entirely I believe that it's still a relatively enjoyable experience as long as you don't delve too deep into the community.",1676177074,1691938595,True,0,0,0.58619457483291626,0,True,False,False

One the one hand, a massive player-driven war economy that produces and harvests all material used in the war to come. Also, a player-base  large enough to sustain the game while also being small enough to be friendly and non-toxic. 

On the other hand, the game can often feel like it swallows you up in the larger war. Players without vehicles are often given few, if any, anti-vehicle options that don't involve suicidal rushes or ambushes. Tank battles are often decided by who has more material and patience rather than skill or coordination. Infantry pushes are often stopped by AI with perfect aim, which is often far more punishing than it needs to be. Maps can also feel incredibly bland after a while, with fights either taking place in either an open field, a small city, a bridge, or a narrow mountain pass.

Foxhole is one of those games that it is a hobby unto itself. If you've ever gotten into table-top wargames before, this is worth a try for sure. It's also way cheaper and labor intensive than table-top wargames. The best part is because of the MMO aspect you can play as much or as little as you want, but every soldier in the field helps.

PROS:
+ Early Access game that is very well done.
+ Always something to do. Always something going on.
+ Playable as social and solo players.

CONS:
- Tutorials only teach you the basics and there is a LOT to learn in the game. (I recommend watching some videos on what you want to do in the game.)
- You'll need mods if you're not great with color. (RIP allied soldiers I blew away before colors registered)
- A lot of the biggest features requires coordination across multiple players, so without a clan or a dedicated group you likely will miss out on a lot of late game stuff.",1691554016,1691554016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On a serious note - I love the concept of Foxhole and its pretty unique. Altough at times it can be kinda grindy, once it sucked you in its pretty addictive. Also the community is one of the most friendly I've ever encountered.  (as long as you stay away from the shithole that is the official subreddit which you only should visit once you've become a salty vet)
There are still couple of bugs in the game, most of which you won't notice until you've become a salty vet. Most of them are funny, some can be... quite annoying and some are a feature by now. The tutorial teaches you only the basic basics and if you want to actually play the game and learn you HAVE to ask players that have been around for a long time and have them explain the game to you.
Communication is not exactly one of the dev's strong suits and updates only happen every three month-ish; so whatever inbalance the devs patched in the game WILL stay there until the next update. With the only exception to this rule being something is so utterly gamebreaking, or the community's backlash is so intense, that the devs are forced to act. ((Kinda sad that the community had to reviewbomb this game to get a QoL update...lol))
 
If you can live with all of that this game worth its money and you'll probably have a blast. If not you better wait for devman to fix the game's issues or hope that Anvil will be better (hahahahahahaha :') )

At first I thought the game would be focusing on the frontline aspect with a little side of logistic.

Like tanks, cars, boat, etc etc would be spawned and ready to use as long as you feed it with resources.  And to get resources you just to go resource drop off station, carry it to frontlines, and it will be turned into spawn points for cars and guns and ammo and such.

But nope, you got to collect specific resources (this is where I draw my line) and turned them into different crafting materials, then you got to go to car factory, choose blueprint you want, and start building it.

When you craft guns and ammo and medical supplies and stuff, you can't even use it outright. You got to put them in crate and have tracks ship them to frontline base where god knows who can issue them to soldiers.

(you can't crate/uncrate them as you wish, btw. You got to specify it when you make a batch of it, which is the most BS part, think if you try to put something in crate IRL and you magically can't because you're not doing it when you manufacture it.)

The majority of the community is welcoming and being a team player is what the game is all about, which makes it so rewarding when an operation succeeds. The key is to keep a balanced playtime as the game can get addictive and grindy easily only if you make it so. More players greatly ease those problems but unfortunately the game wasn't designed to handle so many players concurrently due to technical limitations and you often get into situations of waiting into queues. However their new game Anvil Empires supposedly solves these problems using a new from the ground up engine and its medieval setting is so very promising. Huge potential for a perfect game there if done correctly, do check it out.

Edit: However, infatry movement and combat in general is enough to stop you from playing. Running full speed, stopping and aiming perfectly as well as accelerating with zero inertia equals to shooting teleporting targets and makes for an FPS experience.

Can't recommend a shooting game where every shot is a luck roll essentially. If you do play it there is no need to use anything else than a handgun it just hits the most. SMGs are useless in close range and they spread more than a shotgun blast. No defence to bayonets so a single soldier can run through dozens, the problem comes from broken shooting mechanics in which a dozen people can fire on a person with SMGs at close range and still not kill them. Still cant recommend it to anyone as I know it will just frustrate more than entertain them.

Primary concerns :
* >>>>>> Map collision glitches - Be very careful where you run, more often than you will get stuck in rocks or poorly placed building. The only way out of those situations is suicide. If you log out and come back in you will be back in your glitch spot unable to move.  <<<<<<<<

* Most players are unable to join big regiments which in themselves do not specialise in any single type of game play. This result in an overload of player made buildings. Almost all are squad locked and cant be modified. You might spend 8 hours building a bunker base that is your contribution to the team, only to have another player destroy it all when you log off because they intend to build something in that same spot at some at some point in the future....Maybe. Then you log back in to see your work was all for nothing. There are better ways to spend the precious hours of your life.

* Soldiers have poor shooting abilities. It doesn't matter how smooth and calm your hand is, the soldier your using has never shot a firearm before and has the same shooting capability of  fresh amateur. Allow players to join different divisions which give them a buff in their required skills. Transport div have higher top speed, better fuel consumption. Engineers can build everything and do it faster. Artillerymen get better range and less wind deviation. INFANTRY actually get better accuracy, so you actually feel like an infantryman and not a choco militiaman. The whole grab a uniform and go doesn't cut it and a building needs to be made where players can change their division depending on what they want to do. Cover system does nothing, people don't even use it they just dance around and dodge the bullets.

it seems there is no moderation, cheater go rampant doing sabotage, the only thing we can do is report and pray for it to be enough so the automatic restrictions kicks in but still the damage is done, we can't roll back.
There should be a phone verification, at least, to keep cheaters from creating accounts on the other side to do sabotage.
The developers should also consider taking action on moderating and compensate the victims of sabotage for the trouble, on top of making sure cheaters don't come back to the game in anyway.

Surprisingly accommodating for people with disabilities (you can play with one hand and poor eyesight and still contribute a lot to the war effort).

A bit later i ended up meeting two other gentlemen, joined up with them in piloting a tank - and heres what i like about foxhole (which is also the thing that foxhole markets itself on) the community. I entirely remember navigating a tank, with police sirens directly playing through my mic while speeding up a main road (this didn't work as someone ran infront of the tank, it didn't end well), assisting a whole bunch of infantry into making a pretty decent push and then immediately being in combat with enemy tanks.

A few days later i came back (now heres the less good bit) - different front of course, thought it'd be the same community overall - it was hectic and extremely chaotic, and ended up in about 3 different shouting matches, once again with french people, very different at certain times, but the community overall is lovely, you meet the odd rough and tumble, but those types exist anyway.

Although it has many flawed design choices, it is still an experience like none other, for better or for worse. The game sets itself up to fulfill a task that very few games tried to do, and the developers are exhaustively dedicated to improving it, and receiving what equates to pocket change when you compare to the budget of AAA games. I've seen companies and small studios give up sooner to considerably smaller projects. This is a passionate piece of work, and one that has not yet been tainted by corporate greed.

I would be incorrect if I tried to say this is an MMO, as the population is not massive by any means. A consistent few thousand people, but these people are fighting in the same world map for the same war, spread in multiple regions. Every gun, bullet and vehicle is manufactured and mantained by the combined efforts of hundreds of players. And everything must be accounted for and taken to the frontlines with logistical line of supplies. 

The wars are won by the most resilient, but also the most clever, as your team must develop a strategy to bring down the enemy defenses and conquer the map. You will not accomplish this alone, so you should be well aware that this is not a game meant for the solo player. You will be frustrated and disappointed many times if you try to dive into this by yourself. It is possible, but you will miss most of what the game has to offer, as many of the mid to late game tactics and tools are only available to groups that can sustain their HQ of operations and logistic flow. 

The game can be very demanding and time consuming, as you'll have to likely log in every single day even if for a little bit. But if you do it as a group you should be fine. It doesn't try to be realistic in the visual and tactile sense, but this is perhaps the closest a game will ever get to simulate a war. If the concept of  ""persistent warfare"" vaguely entices your imagination, you should definitely give it a try. You'll either hate it and spend 10 hours in it, or you'll love it and hit 2000 hours without noticing.",1629217994,1689813887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a really great game! There is something here for everyone wrapped in a WW1/2 theme. Sure, if you want to do something more than being a front line soldier then you may have to Google a bit, although I have noticed in the side chat that there are tons of friendly players and if you ask for help you'll usually get it.

I've checked the reviews before and people that complain about balancing issues between Wardens and Collies? They aren't lying. I started as warden and everything was fine UNTIL collies get their ISG's (Infantry Support Guns) and their little Tankettes (armored cars). Mind you while they get these 2 great tools, btw their ISG is a 30 mm mortar carrier with quite a decent shot, what we get does jack shit to their early techs. Also wardens are heavily overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of collies atm. Idk what the fuck they are thinking doing it like this, but no until they give wardens some useful early techs I'm not recommending it. You might buy it and join collies of course, since developers seem to LOVE biasing on one faction at the moment. if you're looking to have fun while competing with the other team, FORGET ABOUT IT. It is a one sided war where one side crushes the other and the losing team (wardens in this case) just get frustration instead of fun. I'd like to shake the hands of the individual who dreamt up this composition. Great job ruining a great game and driving long time players from wardens away. Well done.

Although, since the last few updates devs have promised new features (or returning features originally removed for reworks) and the 1.0 version of the game (despite still having many old flaws players are still complaining about in the official Discord such as bugs and the clear unbalancing between factions) for about a year or so now but have gone almost completely silent. As the playerbase is complaining about lack of communication (& balancing or simple fixes) from the devs, they are simply leaving the game until 1.0 finally arrives while the devs are likely more focused on their new WIP medieval game called ""Anvil"" currently undergoing beta testing.  For a few of the players sticking around there are ""salty vets"" that accuse most new players of ""alting"" (some of which actually are as the devs have to guaranteed method of preventing this) for not knowing an OUTDATED TUTORIAL when you first join the game of which the devs also abandoned, but they'll be sure to update the game with ""fixes"" the moment a well-known Twitch streamer points something (ignoring their playerbase completely) of which I simply can't support. The devs treat the playerbase more as guinea-pigs than respectable players supporting their game as they control most of what happens at the start of each war such as the map, faction tech trees, possibly the weather also, and implement bizarre in-game stat changes sometimes without any patch notes or answers to player's questions about it. So, if you want a game that you can't really see an outcome and anything you do might get you yelled at or left with more questions or sorrow, this is the game for you (honestly I'd prefer War Thunder for that though).

Update: Tried again recently for a war and with the latest updates post FINALLY getting 1.0 and all the patches after it I gotta say while few parts did get slightly better (e.g. item pull time & another few promises added), the game is in a now limbo-like state which imho I would say is probably worse for one reason: Facilities. This new feature never asked for pretty much locks a lot of the game's content behind a higher grind wall for current, new, solo, and most definitely casual players, pretty much forcing you to join a clan or suffer the grind for the most part while worrying someone might take or ruin your facility throughout the entire time of managing it and gathering the resources for it. What was once (dare I say) a simple grind has been pipe-lined to a longer and more tedious process that forces you to make a facility for most vehicle types (some of them having to wait 1-2 days REAL TIME to complete, and that's AFTER getting all the necessary resources) and even on occasion ammo types with the false promise that it would had made grinding more idle (in other words it's NOWHERE NEAR as satisfying or comparable to Factorio or Satisfactory, especially in terms of throughput). Luckily, although there's still some bad apples in the community, a lot of people make facilities that offer some of the necessary resources publicly (at least on the Colonial side from my experience) to soothe the experience, though there's also opposites that exist with the same notion that they suffer the same grind as you will. The devs said they won't abandon this game's development for ANVIL: Empires, but I would not hold them to it knowing their history of only 1-2 devs on this small team still caring for this game kept alive solely by its 1-2k player community.",1632784894,1689446933,False,3,0,0.562021434307098389,0,True,False,True

[strike]tl dr; Bad Devs, Save your money.[/strike]

Edit: Edit:

After a Year ive come back and many of the issues have been fixed and addressed. No more tech in-fighting and it seems that the Devs are finally listening to what the community has to say. Their are still many issues with this game but it has come leaps and bounds from when i originally made this review. I have changed my review from not recommended to recommended because the Devs have consistently updated their game with good updates, aswell as bug fixes and changes that have been requested by the community. They plan to keep making updates to this game and therefore I think its worth the purchase.

[strike]I LOVE THIS GAME. Needs a Better Player Reporting System. and Vehicles should have similar Variants for each factions. Game also needs a Tutorial for New players. Not always Noob Friendly

Edit: 

This game will never fix the problems it needs to address, The devs have no idea how to fix their game with clear bias towards one side. Ive wanted to hold off changing my review to this game for as long as possible but update after update with the same massive glaring issues that dont get addressed, ive come to realize that Balance being the worst part of the game. The maps favor one side, the vehicles favor one side, the player base favors one side. You can still have a great time in this game and meet some pretty awesome people. After so long the devs dont have any excuse why these bugs that have been in forever dont get fixed. The Devs joke about being called bias towards one side or another claiming to be non-biased but they don't listen to the large number of complaints and feedback about integral parts of their game. They are afraid to equip both factions with the same weapon or type of vehicle because of ""asymmetry"". They could easily add 2 different types of the same vehicle to both factions that are special to each faction but still have the balance of having both sides having a variant of the same vehicle. MG Jeep, AT Jeep, Standard Jeep, etc.. They also make changes that directly impacts gameplay based on ""Lore"" aka most Colonial Vehicles are open topped but open top has no advantages at the time of writing this.

Overall: I want to love this game and recommend it, but i cant do that anymore. i tried to play thru the issues but its just stressful and not really fun anymore. I've met some awesome people during my time on Foxhole, the community is Great and very supportive. Its also a very competitive Collies Vs Wardens which i enjoyed, but some people take it way to seriously. This game will always have a place in my Heart, and i truly want this game to excel, but until the Dev's start addressing the bigger issues i have every single time i play i wont play and cant recommend it anymore.[/strike]",1598654636,1689095279,True,0,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

First, it's essentially an RTS, but with the catch that every single unit is a player, from the normal infantry man and average builder, to the driver, gunner and commander of a tank, the only AI currently existing is that of defences, but even those AIs are quite limited.
Second, ANYTHING that a player interacts with, is built by or repaired by a player, the rifle you wield was made by a player, the ammo you shoot was made by a player, the truck used to bring said items were made by a player, the artillery shell landing on you was made by a player. This system creates an amazing logistical supply chain, that can range from simple to complex, depending purely on how deep you wish to go into this system.
Together with an community that can go from hilariously amazing to hilariously stupid in the split of a second because the one guy that was uniting everyone to a coordinated push got killed by a friendly gas grenade makes this an unforgetable game.",1631125436,1689047978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Very good game. Its a very easy game to get lost in but great fun. If you have seen videos talking about having to spend hours and hours in the game for it to be fun you don't. Spending an hour on logistics and an hour on the frontlines is a very fun way to play the game. The community is great and learning is fun and not a drag. You may feel like you aren't doing much if you don't have a massive tank or if your not shooting off artillery but each kill or each truck of logistics helps. As you learn more you can make doing the basics more efficient. Joining a clan is also a very fun way to play the game. Joining a clan does not mean you have to be on 24/7 and joining a clan makes the battles feel much bigger as you will find things you have not seen before.

There are so many things to do and learn, even with 2k hours I didn't experience all of them.


The game is unique, fascinating and immersive, even with it's isometric camera. A treat for a military game enjoyer.

Until you have to deal with it's bad side...

And for me, these are:

- The game is an unpaid job.

To be really effective, you have to work really, really hard. 

And spend a lot of time and effort on organizing and communicating, since everything is made by players and it is a massive war.

It is just not healthy for the average player. It does not feel like a game, but a job.


- Only large organized clans will experience the game in its entirety.

1.0 changed the game with the ""Facilities"", those huge Logistics Hubs with pipes, cranes, trains and all.

And that limits solo players and small groups playing with subpar equipment, aka. Base Vehicles. 

Now the good stuff is locked behind these facilities.


- Unbalance causing unfair battles.

""Power creeps"" are common because of asymmetrical gameplay, turning the game into faction loyalist ego fights on internet forums and players crying for balance all throughout the war.


- Unfixed bugs and instability.

Some regions are barely playable, the engine itself can't handle too many structures, which is part of the gameplay to defend a territory, some bugs are still being exploited despite players reporting them for a long time.


- Long queues at peak hours. (Not so much as the game declined in player numbers)

Maps have limited player capacity, causing very long waiting times. Some players called the game ""Queue Simulator"" before quitting for good. The game does not have a system to kick AFK players from active frontlines, which is unacceptable for an MMO.


- Game is infested with ""Alts"".

Cowardly cheating players that buy secondary accounts on the opposite team to unfairly disrupt and sabotage.

Plus, the devs do not perma-ban these obvious alt accounts. They only get punished with time suspension.


- It has no anti-cheat protection.

Believe it or not.


- Devs silence.

Devs simply ignore the community feedback with long-lasting silence, only appearing at times to announce unwanted new content and not even mentioning fixing it's core issues.


The game is still fun for a new player, the price is really fair, but you might end up not enjoying it anymore because of these reasons.",1676236702,1688682317,False,44,0,0.69243776798248291,2,True,False,False

Ultimately it doesn't matter if you die, but the tension of trying to stay alive during artillery bombardments or the impending doom of enemy tanks approaching is great.

Foxhole in general is a great game, you wont find any other even close to it,  which is why I give it a thumbs up (I still enjoy playing it, and still play it as of today).
Its does have its cons and problems tough, and ill mention them here:

1) Problems with voice chat, constant bugs, not being able to hear local vc.
2) Problems with returning to home region, this happens frequently. Having to spend more time that it would be necessary otherwise.
3) Warden arsenal much, much stronger compared to Colonial arsenal:
- Blakerow, Fiddler, Sampo - 3 most overpowered guns as infnatry - they are OP when it comes to shadow dancing, or stopping shadow dancing. Colonials only have the Argenti that is actually decent, especially in terms of shadow dancing gun. Other guns are simply mediocre.
- Fiddler - the most broken infantry gun in the game - it has very steady aim when moving the mouse cursor fast; the recticle shrinks very fast, and stays that way even when moving; the precisions is hilarious, shoots like a laser gun acually; and the distance it can shoot is also crazy far.

- White Ash - AT weapon that is superior to anything that Colonials have in their arsenal - easy to track enemy armour even with splash damage, quite far from the tracks. Its range is crazy, you can throw over obstacles with its long arc and range. Can be used on barges, autoequips so you can throw multiple without going into inventory. Colonial counterpart, which is the ignifist is so much worse - does not autoequip, almost bounces everytime, even 5 times in a row from fresh armour.

- Warden tanks in general are move powerful, whats more, 3 basic variants can be made in a normal garage, without them being locked behind facilities (Outlaw, Silverhand, HTD).
- Warden tanks have so many variants - the Bonelaw and Highwayman - two distinct tanks which collonials do not necessarily have a counterpart.
- The Highwayman one of the best tanks in the game, shreds armour, has high chance to track or turret, again Colonials have no counterpart, not even slightly resembling the attributes of a Highwayman.

I couldnt care much for the game lore in general, but seems like Wardens have a more evolved lore, where more work had gone into it (which again is a sign developers contribute more to Warden faction).

All in all, develpoers cater more to the Warden faction, by making certain things easier to do, and in general a stronger weapon arsenal.",1634201984,1688319906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The ""Tutorial"" is absolutely awful. 
You get thrown into a huge camp where you can run for miles to read some signs that tell you how certain things are meant to work. If you cant get them to work with the basic text from the sign (Like vehicle building), then your're fucked because the game is not helping you in any other way. Another thing is that you cant even try some of the equipment (Such as artillery) to their full extent because they require 3 people to operate. Truly brilliant game design smh. 
To call that a tutorial is an insult to games that actually provide useful tutorials.

Then when i was bored after trying a small part of the ""tutorial"" i went into the actual war, only to find some stupid clan that has locked LITERALLY every vehicle/gun in a huge radius, which basically forces you to walk all the way to the front line (Because despite their frequent drives with trucks from the base to the front, they are completely unwilling to give you a ride and will even drive over you if you don't dodge them) with just a machine gun and some bullets to then just immediately die because you don't understand the game yet and don't know that you can apparently still get headshotted when you crouch in a trench. Because i couldn't use any vehicles, i had to do this every single time until i got annoyed and closed the game. I died like 8 times and got 2 kills, with one being lucky. Not very fun to say the least.

Foxhole is one of the least beginner friendly games i have seen at this point.

 I was convinced by a long time game guild member to give it a try again.  So I bought it again.

Well again I say that now I feel like I am hitting my head against the wall playing it.  It takes hours to move products.  The entire game is akin to a bunch of ants moving helter skelter around the map some obviously doing good but the vast majority going around in circles doing little to help the over all war effort.  

All everyone does is run out  as a fighter or drive around blowing your horn as a trucker trying to deliver 20 guns and 100 rounds of ammo.   There are so many abandoned trucks around it seems the war could have been won if just one less truck per minute was produced and one more tank or even bullet.

But then a squad buddy told me the game was a  Real Time Strategy Game and the players were like the little men.  You know that you manipulate in those type of games that say ""Yes Sir, Right Away, Sir"" when you click on them to do some task like build a  base, a bunker a factory.  

Then suddenly the game became fun.   Sure you can go to the front line and fire you gun with the same top down view.  That gun someone brought you from a factory way back behind lines.  That gun that has bullets because someone drove a truck and gathered raw materials then drove it to a refinery, factory and put it in storage.  Even your ability to spawn some player had to create and move to the front line base you are fighting for and that allows you to spawn and get another hand delivered gun and ammo.  

So if you enjoy being a bit player,  If you enjoy base building if you enjoy strategy then this game is for you.   Maybe you will build the Maginot Line or the Siegfried Line, who knows.  No matter you will make a impact little by little.   I recommend it to you.   

But the truth be known the combat visuals are myopic top down crap with the need for constant camera angle adjustment.  If you get in a crown you cant tell what your character is doing.",1684961225,1687748480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With the return of cross faction voice chat, its gotten better but the tech is still wonky. I dont use a mic but appreciate the roleplayers and hope more people participate. The other game i am playing at the moment is Battlebit, I wish a mod team is present to moderate like the Battlebit mods.

With the recent surge of negative reviews, I do believe the game needs better updates as it is after all a 1.0 and out of early access. But i would still recommend this game as the first 100hrs is still an experience like no other atm.

Now a neutral that plays the perceived losing side to join epic fights at end war without queue. Will stick to collies for update wars. I find myself enjoying the game more even if the team gets pessimistic while losing.

1715hrs, Maj.
Played several wars with wardens. I really like the weekend zergs that are the signature of the Warden faction. I even typed Callahan propaganda to convert collies. Several wardens i met are cool and i enjoyed playing with them. Will now switch factions after every major update.

War 49, Saved a BT in Loch Mor (Day 371). Joined wardens for a couple of wars. To be honest, its because I am doing less Logi that I am willing to use resources. The flow of combat with many things to do and consider, made the resource-conserving mentality i had as a collie to using resources ""efficiently"" because its warden-made. Full-time scrapper to combat-proficient Capt, I believe i made some progression towards that goal. Its like the moment I solo-ed 2 ptes with a pistol that makes its a fundamental change.

Still hammering Salvage. The consistent updates are interesting to bring top-down logistic-based war to gamers. With new tactical equipment like Smoke Howie shells, I wonder if bayonet charges are now a thing. I look forward to a bunch of friendly kills amidst the smoke. I admit skipping updates that provide a singular item but I am always back for new chunky updates to avoid burnout.

1k Hours. Level 19, Rank: Lt. 
Recognized most vets and some recognized my ign as well. Skipped 4 wars but War 30 is the most fun i had since Nukes were introduced. Cant wait for next war as the new players are getting more experienced and have the ability to help the vets out.

#Trains2020, #Planes2021, #Submarines2022.
With the newest update, featuring the Logi update, scarcity became an issue. Securing resources became the main game. However as with the surge of new players, they often die alot or unknowingly steal resources. Hostility from veterans rose and new players will feel outcasted. Resources are a real problem as people wanting to experiment with them but lack the experience aren't given the chance to. 
The Huge world map made tactics interesting again as diverting regions away from chokepoints to assault other regions is observed by the major clans and vets utilize strategy. 
I am excited about the possibilities of new transports thus the hashtags. (Update 26)

#NukeJadeCove Again! 
16 Dec steam sales, with more new players than usual due to the awesome 0.20 update featuring Main Battle Tanks and Rockets, I joined Fisherman's Row. As a skirmish map that are not considered to be part of the main combat regions, no veterans are playing in it. I was the only OCDT with another inactive in team chat. So, i took charge after seeing how logi requests get ignored, portbase and its stockpile empty. It triggered me so bad that I HAD to do something about it. What if these new players join the combat regions? How huge will their impact be on them? After hours of screaming at them in team chat, they finally abandoned the Sandbag forts and build real defences. It was an experience being the only one to coordinate such an inexperienced group and I enjoyed it. (330hrs in) 


At 33 hours of play, I can guarantee that what the Hypey steam reviews describe about Foxhole is true. Attack and defence is tense when I do not have a clear idea of the number of enemies and friendlies that are in a firefight which can be solved with watchtowers. With experience and time spent on this game, people recognize you for your efforts and give you a commend, which gives you the required levels and ranks up the military ladder. Higher ranks do not provide any additional perks or stats that skew combat to vets. Although with experience, as a Warrant Officer, I did 1v2 two Lcpls with a pistol once.

Winning two wars against Wardens is the best feeling ever. The push to regain territory while we were pushed to port bases was freaking awesome. The big clans took over and basically gathered all solos to join in the great operation of smashing wardens (4 Oct 2018).",1530734783,1687523003,True,1,0,0.515486717224121094,0,True,False,True

the frontline is still kinda fun. avoid bridges and quiet fronts. broken bridges take hours to effectively push past. intact bridges take seconds of concentrated fire to be broken. quiet frontlines accomodate clan players who spend 12 hour shifts supervising the area in preparation for a large push by their subordinates.

if you do find a lively combat area somewhere like jade cove, the meta is to run around in circles and try to quickscope the enemy with a rifle. if you use an SMG, you will get your ass whooped by this tactic beyond extreme close-quarters. by then, however, you're within bayonet range. it gets less toxic after assault rifles are researched, but by then every clan has a stocked base with platoons of mothballed tanks.

It was my first time driving so close to the front. I had just finished my training.

I was driving my truck on a country road to our capital, filled with the ""spice"" of war, our seaport my was goal. Behind the curtain that is the frontline, I was not prepared for the shock. 
I loaded my spice on an Ironship and set sail while aiming for one of our most vital outposts. Some shot were taken but the fear of loosing everything carried me to the objective. It is upon arrival that I understood, I had yet to see war. 

There was a welcoming party screaming and laughing, how have they longed for the spice. They took me in their group and with their help we organized a convoy. 5 people who were total strangers to each other would protect it with their lives for they knew; their brothers are in the dense bloodstorm and they had been out of spice for days now.

For the safety of the delivery, we cut through fields and forests, then we arrived at the destination against all odds, untouched by bombardements or partisans. We got close to the bunker base and that is when I saw the first shell hit. The land was shaking, dozens of soldiers were running around panicked hoping to dodge the mortal blasts that were making the local landscape a flat no man's land.

2 of the 5 trucks from the convoy actually made it to the bunker, I was in the second. Upon arrival, we did magic. I had never seen so many people unload crates so fast. With our armory full, one of our officer organized a team. At least 15 soldiers regrouped and organized a counter offensive. The way was shown to us by the veterans, we knew where and how to kill their artillery.

We joined in a trench half way to our objective, at the hotspot of our frontline. A whistle started whisthling, Hurrahs were chanted in harmony, without realising, my own battlecry was fueling a rush of sudden adrenaline. Then an officer jumped out the trench and ran, 2 followed and I was immediately behind and we poured between the warden's bullets, some fell, some passed through. All I remember is the fiery explosions and the colors mixing together: blue, green and red were making one.

those moments is what make Foxhole replayable. The variety on combat that compensate the logi monotony sometimes. <3 I'm surprised to see that Siege camp did it, and also. It runs better in my 2017 computer that I first played the game. <3 I love all you guys, wheter dev man, warden and collie. WE redefined the genre of top down indie shooter with both realism and fun aspects that goes around precicely well creating a whole new world and a whole new story each war that beggins, with clan splits and new drama, but as always, in the end, we're all sweaty gamers playing with cold blood while logi tries it best to reach to us with the cooked supplies. Can't ask more, the price is perfectly balanced for our ski.... erm MONEY issue I guess. <3

Original Review:

I have had great moments with this game, but I can't, in good conscience, continue to play it.

The amount of player time that needs to be spent doing the busywork so that people can engage in the main attraction of this game (actually fighting) is absurd. Never before have I seen a community so comfortable with managing burnout or expending hundreds of man-hours to build, maintain and defend structures that may not even last a day. Either I am wasting my own time on this busywork, or forcing someone else to do it by my own refusal (read: desire to have fun).

I'm not saying there isn't fun to be had here. I'm saying that the fun is better had in a game that respects everyone's time.",1669641606,1686892189,True,0,0,0.518230795860290527,0,True,False,False

I personally find any chat regarding sexual activities of any nature to be inappropriate and uncomfortable.  The chat in this game is 18+.  There are regularly 40+ chat messages in <60 seconds with graphic sexual words (three letters stars with a c).  The developers clearly do not care.  This would be incredibly easy to filter/ban for, but it is obvious the developers do not care.  

In between wars, I observed a role playing between characters that setup a house to engage in graphic sexual activities.  This is a game where a random stranger can walk up and initiate a voice conversation with you, and this chat channel is not well-regulated.

If you want to play a game where you can affect the battlefield on the frontline you can do so. But you can also produce goods that can be used on said frontlines and its a rewarding experience when you deliver crucial support to battlefields that needs your support. Its a decent game with its own issues but ive stuck some 250 hours into it so i cant really say its a bad game haha.

Sure it has its issues that will be solved over time but the devs keep adding new stuff so im not the one to complain too much.. Outside:
They removed foxholes again in the latest update, that makes me a bit sad.

Edit:
After hundreds of hours later, i can confidently say that Foxhole is one of my favourite and most beloved games of all time. VERY few games have such a special place in my heart.

Whether you want a chaotic war simulation with lots of action, or a relaxing way to spend your time while listening to a podcast, this game has you covered. It is pretty cool actually, because sometimes in the backlines, you can forget that a brutal war is even going on, it is so dynamic!

The community has some bad apples (like every community on Earth, afterall) but those are vastly outweighed by the solidarity the war encourages. Everyone has a common purpose, to win the war. If players help each other out, they help the war effort. I enjoy logistics, and occasionaly make tanks for people who just want to fight without sinking hours into making their expensive toys. Even if i dont get to see the fights those tanks get into, i know that i have made their crews happy and helped push the enemy back in the process. Cooperation is a win-win situation, and everybody knows it!

If you are willing to sink (a lot of) hours into this experience, i urge you to not be swayed by the reviews mocking the community and the fact that many features seem ""locked"" behind teamwork. I was almost a victim of such reviews myself. Listening to them would be such a huge and frustrating mistake..

When my friends aren't able to play, I can team up with almost anyone because 90% of the players are friendly and looking to work together.

I could leave it there and say it's worth a buy, but my personal favorite part about the game is the economy. The idea that every single gun, bullet, grenade, medkit, car, tank, artillery piece, shell, boat, train, building, and more is mind-blowing and adds a [i]weight[/i] to what you use in a fight. The idea that players have to maintain a supply line to keep the war machine going was something I was attracted to. So, I play in this corp of players (shout out FMAT!) that deliver supplies to the front lines so that everyone can keep fighting. The cheers as I deliver ammo to a desperate front keep me invested in their success and I convince myself to stay locked in for hours on end. It's such a unique core game mechanic that I really struggle to find anything similar elsewhere.

The game has so much new content now that you won't get bored. While it does take quite a bit to unlock things, the first days are a little off. When it gets going after a week that's when the fun begins. Devs are still trying to implement old things back in, but who knows what will stay. Well rounded game at the moment.

(Before)
I loved when the game first came out, mainly for the tunnel networks & the bunker walls. It really sucked when they put something big in because it takes forever to align with all mechanics & things in the game, like the bunkers... I'm glad now it's easy sailing.

EDIT: I am currently changing my review to negative due to the poor response from devs to address current issues plaguing the game.  This is not just a holiday thing, it's been a problem for a while.  Alts are rampant during sales and just now both sides are getting griefed to hell from people who buy copies just to troll, there is very little defense against this other than no-lifing and being on 24/7 to watch your shit.

Balance is a nightmare, the most recent update was shoved out the door despite feedback saying it's not ready and to fix balance issues before releasing.

Logistics is a pain and needs to be addressed as well.  I really do enjoy this game for the most part and want it to succeed, but we're running out of options here. Please listen, devs.  Give us a better way to reserve structures so that they can't be griefed and please take a long look at the tech system. I will change this review back to positive if and when these issues are addressed satisfactorily.

DOUBLE EDIT:
After a lengthy logistics strike, and a notable improvement in dev interaction with the community, some changes are finally coming to improve logistics and anti-griefing measures, so I am changing my review back to positive. This game still fucking rules and you should get it.

TRIPLE EDIT:
Things got worse again after 1.0. Devs basically do not listen or communicate AT ALL in a persistent mmo game.  Griefers and alt accounts are rampant, exploits are not punished or fixed, bugs are left in the game for an entire war that are extremely debilitating for one or both sides.  Cheating is increasing because nothing is done about it.  The game itself is cool and a really unique idea but until the devs actually engage, listen, and fix things do NOT buy it.  Don't buy their new game, Anvil, either.

When you step onto the battlefield, things quickly become a big mess. You try to come up with smart plans, but they fall apart faster than a house of cards. It's like trying to solve a puzzle where the pieces never fit together. Who needs strategy anyway when everything just ends up in chaos?

Building bases should be fun, right? Well, not in Foxhole. You spend time and effort constructing impressive structures, only to see them crumble at the slightest touch. It's like building sandcastles at the beach, only to have them washed away by the tide. What's the point of building if everything just falls apart?

And don't even get me started on progression. You work hard, hoping to make progress and get better, but it feels like you're running on a hamster wheel. You go forward a little, only to be pushed back again. It's like trying to climb a mountain that keeps growing taller. No matter how much you try, you never really get anywhere.

Foxhole is a game that leaves you feeling disappointed and confused. It's like a puzzle with missing pieces and a rollercoaster that never goes up.

You are not allowed to complain about someone stealing your things because of EULA rules. You are not allowed to claim ownership of anything. If you do however claim ownership of something the moderator threaten you with actions. 

Though if you on the other hand take someone elses things you get slapped with actions.

Your things are communial things. Other peoples things, depending on who it is, is not. They are private things. Yes moderators play the game...yes their things are personal things. They reserve a right to claim ownership of their things. Because of reasons.


These guys have no moral compass...


The community can harass you with ingame reports. After X reports your actions are silenced Y mins. After X+10 reports youre banned for either 1 hour or a day. This becomes apparent when they do this in a tamper tantrum. In this context it does not matter what is right or wrong, just that you know enough people to use this as a weapon against your team mates ingame. ""Ban him"".""Lets ban him"" are not uncommon to hear. The game is somewhat dying because of the declining server population numbers. Does not affect this. Infact some even go so far as to say ""it does not matter if you win or lose. What only matters is that you are having fun with the people you choose to play with"". ""Choose to play with"" is where this report system really gets activated. Some people who gets banned this way create multiple accounts to work around the ban timer. Everything after that run off the deep end. No need to elaborate on that.

Youre not allowed to farm materials or hoard them...because its an unfair advantage on those who choose not to. Yet you need a very large number of materials for crafting, building, repairing, upgrades and research. Everytime you die you drop everything you had on you at that location and spawn with pre-set gear at a location. Sometimes you can backtrack and get your things but most of the time youre cut off because of reasons. Dying is extremely easy in this game. Essentially he who shoot first most likely win. Using a small arm to damage the vehicle, truck, in the slightest makes the truck inoperable. You then need materials to repair it before you can interact with it. All this amounts to the need for scavanger famers of mats, which according to the moderators are not allowed. Number of deaths on each side midwar is about 50-100k. Thats 50-100k weapons, first aid kits, ammo etc. Piles up. Standard rifle is 100 basic materials. It then goes up from there..alot of different guns. Lets do math.

You want numbers? Midgame through a war campaign the frontline can consume 122k worth of materials each day to maintain.122.000 materials. One, two, three fronts..yea it matters. How and when to play offensively and defensively matters. If you just run around like Leroy Jenkins..in the long run you will lose the war. Maybe you had fun in the process. 

Ok, so how much is 122.000 materials? Lets talk about basic materials here to make it easier. Every type of material have an exchange rate when refined. Basic material has the 2:1 ratio. Which means, to get the 122.000 refined materials im talking about here you need 244.000 material scraps to refine from. One node area spawn about 30k scraps every 40-60 mins. So if you do nothing but that you can farm, theoretically, 150-250k scraps everyday...depending on how much time you are willing to spend. But but large server and alot of people do this you say.....well.....no. People want to believe mats grows on trees while yelling ""Leroy Jenkins"". Thats how the devs designed the game. It part of the difficulty level with gameplay. ""Scavange as you go"". In other words ""scavange off those you kill"". Problem is they carry guns not materials.

The devs favour one side over the other. They rig the system...sort of.


Its a good game....but....Stay away from this. You do not need this kind of drama in your life.


EDIT:

""What do you think about Lercas situation? and do you think there are others who are also trying to win by cheating all the time?""

""Well lercas was using his mod powers to teleport around map to actively ruin operations for other side""


Lying, covering up for a friend who abused their position as a mod, lack of transparent moderation policies, at-will mutes and bans on the Foxhole Official Discord, complete disregard for the complaints of hundreds of players, all of which fall upon the shoulders of the Clapfoot Community Manager.

These guys have no moral compass...told you.



EDIT:

Lately the devs allow cheating. Ranging from exploits to hacking. No, im not listing them here....get over yourself. Devs philosophy is ""we dont know how to play the game, we just code it"". Sloppy coding indeed. 

These guys have no moral compass...told you.



EDIT:

You can address any ingame issue via ""Mod Mail"" on their official discord server. They will, however, not help those they do not like. 

These guys have no moral compass...told you.


Every update, every action, every single interaction with the community drives home just how out of touch they are with the state of their own game.



EDIT:

They are still covering for Lercas,  banning anyone talking about it. Told you, they have no moral compass...Steam award for being the most fu.cked up devs.

Play something better, something that hasn't been in early access for three years



EDIT:

Alts plague this game, many can attest to that. IF you speak against those who defend alts and alt account cheating then the new Dev moderation team perma ban you. 

Toxic players punish you in game if you write a negative review. They want people to pick up the game and play so they can abuse them.

Don't buy this game. The developers support a community of toxicity, filled with unprofessionalism and arbitrary decisions that do not care about the players. Its cancel culture galore. its as if they want to forge a circle jerk cult for themselves. Anyone into that is welcommed everyone else is shown the door.

As one of my friends put it, ‚ÄúThey try to sell you this idea of a player driven game with all this crazy stuff happening around you, but really it‚Äôs just Euro Truck Simulator and Running With Rifles put together.‚Äù

I could rant for hours about the issues with this game, but I‚Äôd rather focus on just one issue, the main issue and the reason why this game will never improve: the developers don‚Äôt believe in fun. Now what do I mean by that?

Well, first let‚Äôs talk about all the different roles in the game and how the developers are slowly but surely making them awful miserable to play. No, you are not allowed to enjoy the game. You are expected to play the game like it‚Äôs a miserable job that you hate but are incapable of getting away from.

So let‚Äôs say you want to build. Boy doesn‚Äôt that sound cool? You could build anything in the whole wide world. Freedom. Creativity. That sounds like a great time. Well, get rid of those lofty notions. The reality is that you will install an auto clicker and sit your character around for hours holding mouse 1. Gotta shovel out the dirt to make your tier 1 bunker. Then you have to upgrade to tier 2 and then to tier 3, but all this entails is sitting there holding mouse effing 1 for your entire play session. This is your best case scenario mind you. If you happen to mess up part of your building or have to demolish something for other reasons, now you get to track people down and have them flag the buildings in question. Then you all get to take turns getting locked from using weapons for 20 minutes. This is the reality of building in Foxhole. And this is a game you pay money to play.

Okay well maybe I just won‚Äôt build. I‚Äôll do a fun thing. Surely, there are other roles that I will enjoy. I know, let‚Äôs do logistics! Logistics is suffering, and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt fun. The only reason anyone does it is because they want to help their team and win, same as building, but by no means is it enjoyable. Doing logi means driving around endlessly, going to resource fields to turn your auto clicker on while you semi afk, sitting at a comp mine while your autoclicker collects resources for you, waiting on emat or factory queues, and many other boring mindless tasks. For every 10 logi players you ask, 9 of them will tell you they do it to help the faction, not because it‚Äôs enjoyable.

What about facility work? That sounds like the more fun part of logistics. What if you could just play Factorio inside of Foxhole? If only facilities were actually that cool. No, the reality of running a facility in this game is that you have an annoying baby who hates you that you have to babysit all the time. Having a facility means farming multiple fields of scrap a day to upkeep it. And you get to do this every day for the entirety of a war (about 35-40 days long). That‚Äôs just the farm to upkeep it. Additionally, you have to farm to run it and you have to constantly fight off thieves as well.

Fair enough, you think. Logistics is kind of boring sounding anyway. What about combat? That‚Äôs got to be a blast. Let‚Äôs start at the front line infantry. It‚Äôs fun at first, but it truly is draining when you realize that it is an endless back and forth. Any gains you made last session will be undone by the next time you log in. Over time, that realization really does crush any passion you‚Äôll feel for frontlining, but if the combat was fun, it could at least make up for it. The infantry combat is pretty janky and mostly just RNG rolls on top of RNG rolls. That‚Äôs not to say there isn‚Äôt any skill involved, but the way skill factors in is in the most uninteresting and janky kinds of ways. It‚Äôs fun for a moment, but it‚Äôs not enough to actually keep you around for very long.

Well, sure, infantry is just infantry. How about the vehicles? What about the tanks? I will say that the vic combat is pretty fun in this game, or at least it was. This upcoming update will place really low limits on the amount of ammo vics can carry. Limits like 25 shells in a gallant, 20 shells in a FAT, 30 shells in a spatha. These shell numbers won‚Äôt even last you a full day cycle on an active front. This is the developers telling you that they don‚Äôt play the game without saying that they don‚Äôt play the game. Not only do you have less shells, but now they are going to remove the very convenient method of pulling them (more on that later).

These super low shell limits are hell for tank players, but it‚Äôs emblematic of a much bigger issue with the developers. Their answer is always to side on less freedom for players. The best moments in this game are when players get creative, when they pull off unorthodox moves, when they risk it for the biscuit. Sure, running 200 shells in a tank is usually a really bad idea, but sometimes it‚Äôs the best shit you‚Äôve seen all week. The devs try to sell you on a vision of this game being player driven and built on emergent gameplay, yet when anything actually emerges it gets killed off. This upcoming update is even going to prevent people from shooting from on top of catwalks as if that is some kind of issue. The trend is always less freedom for players.

In the last update, the devs wanted to tackle the issue of alting. One such method of alting was having your alt account drive your main account into an enemy base in a friendly vehicle. Because it was a vehicle being driven by a friendly, the AI wouldn‚Äôt shoot it. The smart solution is to make AI shoot at any vehicle with an enemy inside it. Instead, the devs decided to remove the ability to enter a vehicle with an enemy inside it. So, back in the day, if you forgot to lock your tank, an enemy would hop inside and take over a slot. You‚Äôd get punished for it, and it made for some of the funniest clips I‚Äôve ever seen. It was a good part of the gameplay. Now it‚Äôs just gone because the devs can‚Äôt think of any other way to deal with issues other than reducing player freedom.

Another form of emergent gameplay was people realizing that small trains can pull items really fast. You see, if you only have an hour of time for your play session and you wanted to run a tank, you‚Äôd normally spend half your time pulling shells from a base and loading them. It‚Äôs an awful part of the gameplay, but with small trains you could pull faster. This is a feature we‚Äôve had for 10 months now and has become a core part of the gameplay. Sure, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù but so what? It‚Äôs convenient. We don‚Äôt like wasting our time arbitrarily. We want to play the game.

The devs, in their infinite wisdom, have decided this must go. And no, they aren‚Äôt going to remove it and replace it with something that makes more sense. They don‚Äôt care about you and your quality of life. They don‚Äôt care about your time. Your fun is literally not a priority to them. Even though the community is universally and unanimously in support of keeping the baby train, the devs are going to kill it. It‚Äôs such a big middle finger to the entire community. You like this thing that is saving you time and making the game more enjoyable? Too bad. The game is apparently meant to be full of down time, cumbersome, boring, and miserable.

The game offers opportunities for solo players and regiments alike, from entire, region-spanning operations, to small partisan operations, cutting off much-needed, player-made supplies to open fronts. Even though every way to play the game is so different, it all helps in the end to achieve a goal hundreds of other players are fighting for alongside you. That small partisan operation can deny the enemy spawn crucial spawn tokens, that region-spanning operation can decay defences, and the logi-bros in the backline fuel it all. 

    It goes without saying, however, that certain aspects of the game need to be refined. But, after all, it is what you get for the first game of its kind to delve this deep into the intricacies of war. Games like Planetside 2 offer large, hundred player servers, but dont include structure building or logistics at a level like Foxhole. Some aspects that do need working on, is developer-player communication, tediousy of logistics, and the decay of structures. Recent updates have been fixing some of those issues, however. 

     I am glad to see the developers working on a new game, complete with it's own engine and different systems, to improve or possibly innovate on this genre and game.

Foxhole is one of the most unique and intriguing games I've ever played. Playing Foxhole is like being part of an ant colony - every player does what they want, but almost every player is working together to achieve the same goals. Down to its core, Foxhole is a cooperative game, and the mechanics work together in a beautiful - if at times flawed - concert to incentivise players to collaborate. You want to command a tank? Well, you better get a crew together - you'll need a driver and a gunner. You'll also need fuel, ammunition and materials to repair the tank when you get hit; you'll need a plan, and infantry support in case the enemy comes running at you with a sticky grenade.

All those things come from other players. And because those things come from players, you end up talking to people, making friends, even if they're buddies you only share a foxhole with for five minutes. Even if your faction is losing, you're having fun because you're talking to people, working with others toward a common goal.

Finding your place in this big world - as a soldier, medic, field engineer, scout, grenadier, gunner, driver, factory worker, artillery loader, quartermaster, whatever - might take some time, but you can try many different roles and have many different experiences. Eventually, you might find yourself leaning into a little light roleplay, too. Once you've identified what you're good at, you'll probably find a sense of identity, and take pride in the work you do.

Personally, I love the quiet (unless you're at a lively battlefront), meditative work of the humble truck driver. I pootle back and forth between the front and backlines, delivering supplies. It's a simple life, but deeply rewarding: because I know that every piece of kit I deliver will end up in the hands of a player.",1654788549,1685742348,True,50,0,0.774071216583251953,0,True,False,True

Devman: they're so tone deaf towards their comunity. Exposing griefers or alts (people that buy a second copy of the game to grief the other side) gets ignored at best, gets you muted at worst for ""witch hunting"". It takes them ages to aknowledge balance problems. If they ever do decide to even do something about it its quite often bandaid solutions that don't adres the core of the problem, or just makes the problem worse in a different way. Feedback about new content is completly ignored, leading to situations that the entire playerbase saw comming from miles away and warned about, yet we have to put up with it until the devs open their eyes.

[strike]Another point is in game moderation: it simply does not exist. Its left up to the playerbase to moderate itself. Bans can be handed out this way but are, at most, 3 days long. This is not even a deterrent for bad faith actors.[/strike]

edit: Since writing this initial revieuw the devs have made a good effort to clamp down on bad faith actors.
However, concerns about slow balance patches persist and haev infact, worsend, with the patch notes for update 54, showing a clear lack of udnerstanding from the devs how their game actualy plays in practice.
[b]Biggest example is the 94.5mm shell.[/b] This shell is stupidly overpowerd, the majority of the community agrees. Previously, the Colonials had a defacto monopoly on this shell, later they leveld the playing field by giving the Wardens a vehicle that also uses this shell. In update 54 they will nerf the Warden vehicle while not touching the Colonial one, [b]instead of nerfing the shell itself acros the board.[/b] This will again hand the Colonial side an undisputable late war advantage that the Warden Side will be unable to compete against.",1676132810,1685734297,False,10,0,0.56040579080581665,0,True,False,False

The game play is okay, it's fun but gets kind of stale after a while doing the same thing. My largest issue isn‚Äôt really so much the game play but it's with the Clan communities. There are a lot of reviews that mentioned this already. It's been a while since I have played the game but I doubt anything changed since I have last played it. I participated in the War #100 on the Colonial side and ran logistics for a few days to learn the ropes of the game with another friend. We ran basic supplies and fuel to the front lines and it was fun but after a while I wanted to explore the infantry side to the game. I wanted to try to sneak into enemy lines and see what I could do. I was walking through a clan made compound when I came across this person who immediately became hostile towards me even though we were both Colonials. I explained to her that I was just passing through but I found the encounter pretty odd. I looked into the area further and found out the clan she belonged to was hoarding vehicles and supplies and several signs were posted that said something in the lines of the lines of ‚ÄúThis belongs to so and so clan do not take‚Äù. Ironically a while later the Wardens made a push into the hex and destroyed the compound and the surrounding area. Those vehicles could have been used but instead this clan wanted to hold onto stuff that was not being crewed.

The best way to play this game is with a group, you will find hundreds of them on the official Foxhole discord, but I have found that the best way to find people to play with is to head to a front line and find a group you like there. Foxhole has the same issues any online game has with toxicity, horrible people, and people who need to touch grass, but If you can look past that, it's really an excellent title. I played around 700 hours in 5 months while in between jobs and I don't regret the time spent, but I would recommend making sure to take a break from the game time to time to avoid burnout. Don't feel like you have to play all the time everyday and certainly do not build any structure that requires maintenance by yourself. I have spent a significant amount of time on both of the teams in game, the wardens and the colonials. Whatever you hear online about the two, just know, they really aren't that different, so just choose whichever side has aesthetics that appeal to you more.

Wardens received a new 94.5mm tanks and the powercreep with tanks keeps on going. 

Some tweaks are still needed, but the devs have realised that they have to communicate with the community more and it feels like they are on the right way again.

Old review:

The devs are introducing new stuff all the time, while not fixing known issues. Communication with the community is nonexistent. Logi becomes more complicated and tedious, facilities are using up all the space and supps needed for defences. Building is boring and repetitive without any qol improvements at all for the last updates since Entrenched. Alting and cheating is on the rise. The powercreep with tanks makes older versions of former top tier tanks practically useless, while access to the new top tier tanks is gated behind facilties and very hard to achieve as a solo player.
Wars take too long nowadays and burn out the playerbase. The community gets more toxic and suspicious of new players because of the inceasing problems with alt accounts over the last few wars.

The idea of this game is great. The community is factionalism beside great, but the devs have to do something to push the game back in the right direction.",1676134360,1684849988,True,0,0,0.525924921035766602,0,True,False,False

I never thought I could fall in love with a video game, but then I found you. You're not just any game, you're a masterpiece. You bring people together from all over the world to work on an MMO war, and there's nothing more beautiful than that.

From the first time I played you, I knew you were something special. Your immersive gameplay, realistic mechanics, and amazing graphics got me hooked. But it wasn't until I started working with my team in Foxhole that I realized how much more you had to offer.

Together, we fought off enemy attacks, built structures, mined resources, and strategized our next move. It was as if I had known these people my entire life, even though we were all complete strangers.

It's incredible how you brought us all together, regardless of our backgrounds, cultures, or beliefs. We all had one common goal, and that was to win the war. And we did it, thanks to you.

You taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. You showed me that anything is possible when people work together towards a common goal.

So, Foxhole, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for bringing people together and creating a sense of community and belonging. Thank you for teaching me important life skills while having fun at the same time. Thank you for being the best video game I have ever played.

With love and gratitude,

The developers have made the least significant steps to combat this, while continuing to add more and more exploitable elements to the game without devoting any real attention to these issues.

The introduction of player-built facilities as part of the 1.0 has also been met with a sour taste, as it removed the ability of solo-players to really contribute to their faction during the war as certain vehicles and weapons are locked into expensive facility metas. It has also weakened the player base as this facility infrastructure was dropped on top of a moderately under-established MMO where building and holding victory points has never been fun, but remains critical. However the need to build facilities to have access to vehicles and weapons has created a defensive imbalance that can dramatically affect wars.

Also, to its very basic interface: Imagine shooting a shot and gambling. No skill or experience is a counter for horrible RNG no matter the weapon being used.",1645914380,1684687015,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There isn't much room in the middle anymore, which is a shame because it turns off a lot of newer players.

At the $30 price point there is a lot of fun to have, and the game finally really feels ""complete"" compared to the disastrous and buggy 1.0 launch in Sept. 2022.

Anything available for the public remains available for everyone else in the game to use and continue providing and fighting for your team.

Clans (regiments) of all sizes want to carve out their slice of the world to make a difference and help provide for the fight where it's most helpful. And the majority of clan groups are very helpful, willing to teach new players about what to do to accomplish things, and provide direction to understanding the game's fundamentals better.

Devs are semi-hands off with the community in a game where cooperation is near-mandatory, but the player-base came together to build a social construct that works to get people where they want to go to play the parts of the game that's most fun for them. There is 1 official Foxhole discord for the global community to commune, but the rest of the collaboration and decision-making is a 100% player-created and moderated society.

International community of more than a dozen languages yet still this large of a community can overcome language barriers to work together.


Cons: Not 100% of the world is player-created: the raw resources, victory points to capture, and which towns have which logistics buildings are set at the beginning of each war and remain until the end of the war (average about 13-20 days to complete a full war).

Because the world is a persistent state, everything you build and provide is available for everyone else to use, which comes with 2 mechanics: 1) other players are able to interact with, utilize, and take away things that may have made more sense to keep there or use differently. 2) everything that is player-created must be used/maintained or else it will decay and eventually disappear from the world if left inactive long enough.
The 1st point can be circumvented with locking your vehicles and creating private stockpiles, but those need to be continuously maintained to remain locked specifically to you as well (vehicle locks in the world last about 5mins, and each player can make 3 private stockpiles per Storage Depot or Seaport that lasts 50hrs).
The 2nd point can be circumvented by using the vehicles, weapons, etc. before it decays, or by providing Supplies (supps) to prevent structures from decaying.

Because of the ability for players to utilize others' created equipment, some players choose to be toxic and claim public things are theirs and grief/troll to prevent others from playing, or if a clan-sized group bands together to act toxic, they may think their efforts are worth more than non-clan or that others will misuse gear, and they may prevent people they've deemed unfit from playing differently.
Luckily both of these scenarios can be circumvented with the player-reporting system and by not retaliating in a toxic manner; the world is so huge that no single clan, regardless of size, will ever accomplish so much to affect the entire war effort, it still requires a large amount of cooperation to win the war. And if someone does something toxic to slight you, use the F1 screen to find the player and Report them.
Once a Report is filed, devs DO engage, investigate, and issue bans of varying degrees depending on how severe the infraction is.


TLDR; Foxhole is an absolutely massive undertaking of a game requiring a large amount of cooperation between people from all over the world. There's a lot to be done, every little bit helps, and expect the same pros and cons here as will come with interacting with dozens of players on the internet from around the world in any other multiplayer game.

A game not for the faint hearted as the only breaks are between wars. WARS that last without fail for a month on average as players across the irl world clash it out 24/7. Everything in this game is player driven from the spawn shirts to tanks needing to be made in the backlines, then brought up to the front to be used by the war effort. At the front there is numerous activities of building, combat clashes between tanks, infantry and even artillery elements dishing it out. The game world is so grand scale that what happens from one side feels so distant from the other side even if there are major battles sending your faction retreating out of an entire region. 

Keep in mind the game won't save your base, respect your time defending areas or care about your very own soul as it goes on the verge of insanity.

I will keep playing this game for the length of the war I started. I have gotten my moneys worth from this game but will not give it a positive review. 

The reason for this review is that currently, it is the weekend and voice comms are down for one side only. This is such a huge tactical advantage that it will likely be the decisive blow in this current war if it is not fixed.

Which makes everything so much fun. You can totally find an epic tank battle going on where the men in the tanks are emotionally shouting at the battlefield in full sweatlord mode given orders to the nearby infantry to charge, while simultaneously some dude in a >bicycle< tries to charge the enemy tankline while playing the soviet anthem and ringing his bike bell.
The big grindy logistical and very strategic gameplay followed by intense combat gameplay(running in between artillery bombs, sneaking into enemy terrain stealing stuff, trying to heal people while being shot from all sides, trying to put out a wildfire spreading in your base) alternated by some of the most ridiculous memes ive ever seen make the game a must play.

Starting off, you have the obvious classes like infantry, tank and artillery, partizan(sneak around kill logistics, steal tanks), (limited naval), builder and logistics and there is alot of subclasses i.e. for infantry you can do shotgun/smg/different rifles/sniper/flamer/anti tank sniper gun/suicide anti tank bomb runner/anti building(grenade/rpg)/medichealer/medicreviver/grenadelauncher/mortar etc etc
and even in the subclasses you can be creative, there is a weight system that makes you choose between carrying more ammo or running faster and you are free to multiclass perhaps you want to take a simple handgun(too keep weight low) add a medic healing kit(not the heavy revive one) and 1 anti tank grenade(because why would a tank expect a medic to suddently suicide run at them? big brain moment)

Besides the obvious classes their are hidden subclasses that are literally made up on the spot, one day ive noticed alot of tank teams are driving back to refuel and restock at a nearby base so i figured i take a small car with a few fuel and materials and drive to our tankline refuelling them by hand so they can fight longer. Which is stupid fun cause fuel is very heavy and sometimes your tankline falls back a little and you just stand there with the fuel while the enemy tanks charge in....haha dont shoot please, im just fuelmen :((
You can also just grab a radio and binoculars and lay in a bush deep in enemy lines, relaying intel to your team about enemy tank movement. Some people have also realised some bases have a long walking time to the front, so they build a bus and spend their days just ferrying other players to the frontline while playing some relaxing music in the bus. No one told them this class exists, but it is useful and they just invented the role out of thin air.
Another one being people that realised there is alot of materials in a place near water but far from the factories so they created a playermade port where they continiously farm materials and deposit them in freighter ships such that freighter specialists can pick up a full ship without having to farm materials while the port staff can just farm away without having to worry about transport. There are so many things you can do/create/organize besides the main classes, its literally insane. And that is just the solomen experience!!! imagine what a complete experienced clan can come up with!!! organizing and coordinating with other clans to plan huge surprise invasions, logistic chains, train networks, you name it.

I've spend my days traveling this open world and seeing what people are doing and what they could use and making up roles on the spot to assist the local needs, super fun and satisfying, everyday is different you start of by delivering a truck of supplies and before you know it some major is randomly shouting in region chat they need someone to deliver a construction vehicle and before you know it you find yourself escorted by a team of high ranked officers in jeeps and what not and you suddenly realize you just joined a small veteran clan operation to build a sneaky base behind enemy lines.
The next day you skip logistics and instead build a small motorboat to scout the enemy beach and halfway on the water you suddently see allied ships pass by with an insane naval fleet carrying tanks, cranes, artillery ships, infantry barges, readying for a huge D-day style invasion, so you end up spending the day joining the invasion grabbing explosives and blowing up enemy buildings.

Frontline combat usually involves throwing yourself at the wildly convoluted new defense metas that content bloat has spawned over the years.

Eventually we lost everything when the 5 of us were busy for a day on the weekend. Literally everything gone in just a day.

I came back for War 102 as I saw we had a lot of changes for decay and I have been playing it rather cautiously expecting to see the decay get out of hand again and to just quit.

At this point I am pretty convinced it is actually resolved and am very excited for it. I hope it remains this way, in it's current form and with how the decay appears to be adjusted it gets a resounding recommendation from me.

Edit: The game is much better than it was, community is still an egregious pain in the ass though and unless you have a group big enough to always have someone at a facility you have built other players will swoop in and take everything from you.",1679233991,1683195532,True,1,1,0.495175212621688843,0,True,False,False

- Lack of communications from devs
- Major bugs that affect the on going war goes unresolved by devs
- Horrible grind upkeep bases
- Ships are janky and outdated
- 70% of tank/vehicle variants and some heavy ammunition are locked behind facilities (facility was one of the reason I got the game but after learning and playing, I realized it's a big grind fest to the point that unless you're in a clan or make it your day job, you're better of making the basic stuff)
- Griefers/Cheaters doing the same stuffs for YEARS with only a slap at the wrist as a punishment
- The server is basically on life support whenever the player counts goes too high
- Queues (I know this is for balancing the forces but sometimes it's frustrating)

So your decision here is ammo of what caliber to choose from when preparing for logistics run. Or what to deliver -- petrol, diesel, coal, or something else. Which is not damn interesting at all.

Extremely appealing core idea about war game with emphasis on logistics and realistic warfare, and extremely disappointing game design and implementation. I tried to start playing three times, each time wasting a day and quiting gaining nothing but mild headache. All I wanted is to get me a truck, load it with anything useful and embrace my autism for hours driving and delivering stuff to the frontline. Game, instead, wanted me to waste hours searching for guides and learn the whole fucking logistics chain, sOcIaLiZe with squadmates of a squad that I had to find myself on discord, while constantly stressing about underperforming and sabotaging other peoples job (my actual impact on a war was one truck full of bmats destroyed by partisans). You wanted to drive a truck? Fuck you, there won't even be a cruise control after ages of development.

You don't need complex game mechanics including four different items to make it enjoyable to heal other players. You don't need more than one type of fuel to make your trucks and tanks go wroom. You don't need a fucking gun shop with dozens of models of firearms, one type of bolt-action rifle is enough. It's a game, it is supposed to be simple and enjoyable, if I wanted to endure trials of logistic hell I would enlist as Ukrainian volunteer.",1683053290,1683053692,False,3,1,0.503562808036804199,0,True,False,False

Foxhole can be very fun, but also a bit overwhelming for new players. And a massive time sink and grind. It's a bit better if you are in a regiment, but it's still much grinding for supplies and vehicles. And the new msupps system for maintenance of facilities is really bad, even worse than the old system in early stage of a war.

The massive battles, with infantry, tanks, and artillery is still great. And big logi ops.

For new players I recommend joining a regiment, as the game is built around teamwork and cooperation. You can still do solo things even if you are in a regiment. But you get access to private stockpiles close to the frontline and helpful people. Most people is friendly in Foxhole, but as we had problem with alts the last war's. People can be a bit suspicious to new players if you doing strange things. Also vehicles (that cost rmats) is expensive, so some people can complain if you do solo runs with it.

Some Pros:
+The massive battlefields will always have a special place in my heart. From the tidal waves of bodies hurling mammon grenades at structures to the tank lines 20 deep on both sides blowing everything in between to kingdom come. 
+As with any game with clans, you can see a group of individuals truly accomplish the impossible in this game. The well oiled machines of the community have bore fruit on both sides of the battlefield in ever amazing ways.
+The fact I need to put in labor to see my efforts blossom is a reward that not everyone will understand. I personally love the idea of facilities and such that players can create and use. The same goes with the logistics as a whole.
+A fair bit of effort can be seen in certain hexes around the map. That effort should be recognized and applauded.
Some Cons:
-Most if not all hexes have what I refer to as wasted potential. Relic bases with seemingly no strategic point to them that simply serve as another place to capture so the map matches your factions color. They're rarely built up by the players and ultimately just become wasted space. I'm sure the developers will eventually address this issue. Another side of this is poorly designed areas that are vital to each faction. Yet serve as little more than meatgrinders at any given war. Mercy's Wish has to be the greatest example of poor design. The fact that no defenses can be built around the vital storage depot remains a mystery to me.
-Builder and logistics QoL improvements are a requirement at this point. Many players burn out when they take on the role of building a defensive structure that can withstand the onslaught of the enemy faction. A random invisible tree stump can ruin hours of planning as can the sudden inability to build a structure in an area previously able.

The only fun parts exist where they shouldn't be, which is mindlessly reloading and shooting artillery guns to kill enemies that don't know you even exist and interrupting logistics operations on the enemy side as a partisan, which is like kicking a baby that has no way to defend itself.

thoughts:
ok ive tried foxhole now
again
they completely ruin a great idea with shitty ideals
bushes shouldnt hide you indefinitely, you should be seen if someone gets close enough
emplacement ranges are a joke, I saw a fucking dude throw grenades further than our RPG turret
aiming is hell for no reason, i was on a machine gun and had prefect line of sight and everything i shot missed because it was on a bridge with height differences
the only fun part is artillery with a good commander and thats stretching the meaning of the word
defenses vital to our survival, which were loaded with ammuniton, were locked and ""claimed"" by a clan that was not there while we were being encircled
none of the bunker guns seem to actually do anything which to me makes it seem like 70% of the big guns you'll see are decorational (wtf?)
bunker building in general makes no sense because the people who make them apparently have a stroke midway doing so and create an unusuable mess with serves no other purpose than to look good and serve as a wall
pvp is very scuffed due to everything from the camera, zoom, movement and aiming being entirely unusable 
I was in a tank and couldnt reliably hit people 15 meters away from me because they were in a trench, but luckily they were able to hit me just fine and shortly after killed the tank
the other side of the game which is logistics is also really shit because organizing is pretty much absent from the game unless you 3rd party the whole thing and join a regiment or something, as well as the whole UI + map being unintuitive. The map also suffers from performance issues when you enable every detail which is pretty annoying
not to mention the awful and boring driving mechanic
the devs have unfortunately created a walled-off garden situation with every town having dfferent people reserving different things, which makes actually using factories a little difficult as well

There's two methods of gameplay that being logistics(Logi) and frontline combat. The experience of frontline combat can be very varied and intense with many possible tactics, subterfuge, loadouts, armored war machines, toxic gas, AT rifles or launchers, bayonets, grenade launchers, lmg/hmg, mounted weapons, trenches, and artillery. While logi is totally casual and relaxed as a solo where you may harvest materials to process into finished products that can then be delivered to frontlines to maybe gain commends that'll rank up your character.

  If you're looking for something more serious and organized you could join a squad or regiment/clan that can coordinate to accomplish ambitious goals like organized tank pushes to take a Bunker Base(BB) and territory, fielding several artillery pieces from which they'll rain death on the enemies positions and possibly destroying the enemies BB. If you like being a seriously sweaty gamer that wants to achieve epic things like building tier 3 concrete super BBs with massive storm cannons, participate in tank pushes made up of dozens of tanks, etc. there's a lot of room to be a super sweat. To join a regiment/clan is akin to joining a locked squad; you need to ask for an invite. Some regiments may be massive and run Discord servers where you may need to apply as well as to stay in the loop of the goings on.

Why is my review negative? Because the devs have signaled that they do not care about the playerbase at all.  Due to how the game works you have to have a high trust in your community to not tamper with equipment produced for the fight or you have to have moderation tools in place to fight against bad actors who are looking to play the game in bad spirit.  Foxhole has neither and its killed my enjoyment of this once great game.

Right now a person can buy a secondary account and log onto the opposite faction and have free reign to do whatever they want.  There's evidence a of accounts with no stats dumping tanks into the ocean to destroy them or dumping supplies from a base out right before an attack or leaving gates open so enemy partisans can have access to a base.

The worst punishment that person will face is a temporary suspension between 3 and 7 days.  That's it.  Hours and hours of work from people playing the game legitimately undone all for that person to only be temporary banned.  These temp bans don't ever escalate to being permanent either.  Users violation logs are visible and multiple accounts exist with 20+ temp suspensions.  It's a complete joke.

The worst part of this though?  The devs haven't said a word on the situation.  They control the official reddit and will ban you from the reddit for calling out alters with clear evidence.  They are quick to ban there but not for their own game.  They absolutely are aware of the concerns and do not give a shit.

My recommendation is to not buy this game ever.  You'll get invested like I did only to be completely let down by a developer team who would rather sweep the issues under the rug than address them head on.

If you're playing casually it's a good time. The combat is passable and the cooperation which the game encourages feel really good when it pays off.

If you stick around and devote your time the shortcomings of the game really start to become unavoidable. The lack of substantial punishment or moderation means that griefing could potentially ruin large amounts of progress made and toxicity can run through the games communication systems, but the main issue is it's development itself. Balance is wack and the new features seem barely tested at all making the players the games Q.A (Quality Assurance[Game Testers]). Finally the core fundamentals of the non combat side of the game are legacy systems with no Q.O.L(Quality Of Life) making it both frustrating and a monotonous grind.

As said at the start foxhole can be enjoyable but only if you take it casually.

TLDR(To Long Didn't Read) do not play this game unless you have cash to spare. Even if you do take it casually unless you 'play'(sell your soul to) games like EVE in which case still don't since it's just worse.

04.14.23 edit #2: Still leaving this as a not recommended. The new UI improvements were badly needed, and are appreciated (despite them needing to have been there at 1.0 start). Devs seem content to all-in on facilities being the stop-gap for 70%~ of vehicle content, making what was once in the past a modest trip with mats to the garage or MPF for tanks a multi-stage, dozens hours, uptime-bloated job to get to the same result, without an equivalent exchange in fun. I'm sad I feel this way as you can imagine, given my hours invested, but i'll likely be on hiatus unless they make facilities supplemental (as originally stated) and not a gate.

---

I've been playing this game for a very long time, first picking it up sometime years ago when devs were still debating whether to include a text chat, boats were in development, and quartermaster was a socially appointed role in charge of delegating where guns, ammo, and resources went. It was a neat game, and I put it down while waiting for more updates.
Sometime in war 83 (each war lasts about a month) I picked the game back up again and all-in'ed on it. 
I marveled at the fact that 99% of everything used in wars were mined up, refined, and produced by players, and that true defensive positions, bunker complexes, were designed, made, and maintained by players. 

I became proficient in and known for building and I took pride in it. The actual building was endless grind and maintenance requiring many players for any kind of efficiency or speed, and garrison supplies, which required raw material and extensive production and delivery time. Yet building was and still is considered one of the most critical aspects of the game, as its the only thing stopping the enemy from rolling over sparsely-automatically-defended AI towns.

Prior to the 1.0 update, despite constant incessant tribalistic bickering between the two factions, Wardens and Colonials, most could reasonably say the game was in a goodish place; everyone can still agree there is nothing like Foxhole.
With the 1.0 update came flame weapons and yet heavier weapons capable of easily reducing dozens of collective hours of building, maintenance, and supply to rubble in less than an hour. Newly constructed bases need at least 24 hours of constant supervision to enable them to automatically defend themselves, or risk two experienced players with flamethrowers burning down a minimum 6 hours of work (not including prep) in less than 10 minutes.
Many variants of tanks and cannon pushguns were locked behind new facility systems requiring their own heavy investment; however, without any additional communication tools informing others what to expect from a facility, what it needs, and what it can produce, there are (still) no reasonable in-game means to coordinate efforts beyond temporary map call-outs and shouting blindly in chat for what you need and what you can give.
Most tank types, including the biggest and most unique, Battletanks and Superheavy Tanks, cannot be stored privately anywhere, meaning unless you take prohibitively annoying steps to secure them, it is plausible for people who have directly invested nothing in their construction to use a simple wrench to take them. 

As someone who has invested and continues to invest so much time in the game, it pains me to say that the game isn't in a healthy place. I do hope the devs at minimum allow facilities to perform a supportive role, such as giving optional enhancements or modifiers to tanks instead of outright restricting their production to them, add an optional ""fire resistant"" upgrade to bunkers, and add additional in-game communication tools such as a bill-board structure acting like 24 hour map signposts needing refreshed. This game is a truly unique, compelling, cooperative experience dragged down by predatory-mobile-game-levels of grind; it may only require an arguably cheap one-time cost, but it will completely consume your time in mindless tasks to ""get to the good parts,"" and depending on your preferred play-style, unceremoniously take those good parts away anytime.",1676079154,1681483917,False,148,2,0.840998470783233643,2,True,False,False

It is a game set in an interwar period in an alternate reality. As the technology progresses, so does the war: from trench warfare with bolt action rifles to artillery duels with tanks and automatic weapons. Foxhole has heavy focus on logistics: very few things manifest out of thin air; every gun, magazine, truck, tank and shell is manufactured by players and delivered to the front by players.

Secondary focus is on the teamwork. There isn't a single combat vehicle that can be operated solo; most require crew of two to four people. Same with logistics and construction: it can technically be done solo, but it's much better with a group. Organization is absolutely necessary to do anything beyond 'one guy with a rifle'.

It is a neat concept, similar to what Squad has but on a massive scale. However, there are ugly things under the hood.

Construction gameplay is divided in two parts: 'hold down LMB for hours to build it' and 'feed it supplies daily so it doesn't decay'. Both of these are just time sinks, exacerbated by the paramount importance of construction.

Logistic gameplay is similarly split into three parts: 'hold down LMB for hours to get resources', 'wait for timer on factory orders' and 'press W to deliver it to the front'. There's a bit more variety here than in construction, but in the end of the day you're either waiting on a timer or holding down one button.

Combat is actually really fun; infantry, artillery, naval, armored and guerrilla are all very well done, with asymmetric balance and some depth. You're not Rambo, you're regular guy with a regular gun: you can't mow down hordes of enemies for hours without reloading. Your tank isn't a magic metal box that repairs itself; it runs out of ammo, fuel, requires maintenance after several engagements, etc.

The worst part of the game is the community. While organization is absolutely necessary to run any kind of operation, the best way to enjoy the game is to not engage with community at all. Foxhole is filled with reddit troons, discord pedos and clan leaders on power trip that can and will mass report and tempban you for anything they don't like. If you're seriously considering getting into foxhole, enjoy it with a group of friends - you'll save a lot of brain cells by ignoring everyone in global chat and major discord servers.

Lastly, weird design decisions. 60 second spawn timers, timers to pull equipment, timers to build things, timers to rebuild things,  timers on crafting, border bases, technology mechanics, quirks with shooting into trenches (or up and down in general), weather system - all of this left me wondering why is it done this way and not any other way.

The other example of weird design choices is weather system. Long-requested feature was implemented in the most unfun way possible. 
When it's snowing, you freeze to death and vehicles freeze solid in 5-10 minutes outside. How to unfreeze a vehicle? Build a fire. Terrain not suitable for building? Sucks to be you, this is the only option.
When it's raining, vehicles are unaffected, but infantry rapidly accumulates mud to a ridiculous point: at maximum muddiness you cannot carry a rifle, a clip of ammo and a grenade without being overencumbered.
There are uniforms to help with cold and rain, but by large the only thing weather does is slow everything down.

All in all, Foxhole is a game with a neat concept, held back by bizarre dev ideas and irredeemably woke community that would benefit from arsenic injections.

Update for 1.0: devs tried to address logi grind, but somehow made it worse.
New Facilities seem fun and add some depth to logi gameplay, but in practice it's a case of building $1000 factory to make three $5 trinkets. This update is a massive failure; Siegecamp made one step forward for two steps back.

Update for 1.52: devs tried to address maintenance costs for facilities, but somehow made it worse(starting to see the pattern with the updates?). Now you're punished for someone digging out a massive bunker or building a giant facility 300m away from you. New maintenance system basically incentivizes griefing your neighbours. Beatings will continue until maintenance supply situation improves. On the upside, developers allowed securely storing combat vehicles now and added several other quality of life features.

The epic skirmishes immerse you in intense battle as the fight between both sides makes you feel the high stakes of war. The world is massive and evolves as players build and defend bases, set up supply chains, and improve technology. The community is very helpful to new players and everyone works together to build, supply, and fight. There is so much to learn but even as a new player, I felt like a valuable asset to the team by helping dig trenches, build defences, or fight the enemy.  

My first time playing as a Warden, we had just captured a city and were pushing the enemy out so we could build a better defence. We would skirmish with the enemy and push them back into their territory only to have them gain back the land we took. Then we would push them back again, and they would push us back. It was a constant game of tug-o-war, but slowly we were able to push back long enough to build a defensive base. It was a great feeling to have won the battle, and even more gratifying seeing how the team cooperated by building defences, supplying guns-n-ammo to those fighting, and coordinating an attack on the enemy. When I logged in again, it felt like a whole new world as the base was way bigger and we had pushed the enemy out of the region.

The asymmetrical equipment for each faction makes for interesting engagements, and allows a lot of room for countering enemy attacks and being creative. The game's art style is really cool, and really allows you to be immersed into each faction's lore. Community engagement is a must in this game, and while there are some toxic people like in any other MMO most other players are very friendly and are there to have fun.

only 124 hrs on record

Awesome game I ever played.
It's hard to feel rage playing this game.
Resources, supply routing, and fights on the front line, all that depends on player's ( this requires teamwork ).
You can actually create clan's, group or something like that.
I enjoyed Foxhole, and I know much of that enjoyment grew out the marvel of watching so many players working together, Flank Enemy's or even rush a tank with sticky grenades, and ect. that makes this game much more impressive.
of course this game is fun with friends. But there is a point, where it doesn't matter.

so, see you in the front line.

What I mean by this.. is that everything you do, actually contributes to the overall conflict.

To new player, I would recommend watching YouTube videos or having a friendly player walk you through the basics at the tutorial zone.

Generally in games i like building, logistics, strategy, etc. All the before mentioned are just a tedious autoclicker simulator in this game which feel like i got a worse second job. There is no automation in the game which is a huge negative for this type of game and there are huge balancing issues between the factions. 
If you join the collies there will be a lot of tryharding but not in the good way as the community refuses to build and use their PVE tools because it's easier to complain about not having the cutler/outlaw/silverhand/chieftain.
If you join the wardens on the other hand there will be a lot ""skill issue"" where the infantry is slaughtered constantly with no way to retaliate (because the collies PVP is just better in every way), so you are just left with waiting and hoping to reach late game armor tech which will win the game because collies won't have more than 2-3 tanks on a front at a time(again easier to complain about warden armor being op instead of building smelters and bardiches).

I played both factions along 5 wars and I think that the asymmetric balance sucks in PVP and logistic/builder work are just a tedium that should be changed in pretty much all aspects.

Update: Facilities changed nothing in terms of tediousness of the logi/engineering activity. They just made more sinkholes for resources that need to maintained for no reason(because they are utterly useless until mid to late war)
Small gauge railway makes for a slow and underwhelming way to transport resources and is just tedious to drive around manually(unless trains can autopilot to destination they are yet another tedious thing).
Proper trains are locked behind late game tech and non-clan or casual players will never have any reason to use them.
There is still no automation possible (using pipes is 0.5% of the possible automation let's be real).
Building as ever sucks and is composed of autoclicking and with the addition of facilities and rails you just have to autoclick more.

Update: Since the latest update, an attempt was made by the dev to address most of the quality of life issues, with debatable results. Overall the game is improving slowly but surely",1662021789,1680809371,False,0,0,0.470711320638656616,0,True,False,True

The developers don't think it's necessary to fix the real problems of the game and punish players for misbehavior. Alternate accounts that sabotage the opposing faction are the order of the day and ruin the game for everyone involved. Instead of punishing these players, questionable mechanics are implemented that force players to log into the game almost daily to protect their built structures and buildings from foreign interference, but these mechanics do not provide 100% protection.
Instead of giving the players a pleasant playtime, they are kept in line with unnecessary content updates. Updates that make the game unnecessarily complicated and drag out the process of crafting various items. Things that are not fun but are necessary for the war to progress, take up a large part of the game time and need to be constantly monitored.
The devs stay hidden and don't communicate with the remaining small community. They only speak up again to introduce new unnecessary vehicles or time-consuming mechanics in the next content update.

Edit:
The recent QoL changes have made a difference and made the time spent playing Foxhole much more enjoyable. However, the game is still a hard grind and alting has been made more difficult but not prevented. Some things need some fine tuning but the game is back on track.

I have made several good friends playing as the game naturally gears players toward teamwork. For many players during the pandemic and those separated from in person table top gaming communities it is a great alternative. After my first dozen or so hours I was amazed at the value per dollar I had spent. Not only did I feel like I had a great entertainment value on my investment. I felt that it was heavily under-priced for what it is.

Key to the games amazing experience are four key elements. Some of them the development team has continued to improve over the time I have played;
1. Foxholes communications: Communications in Foxhole is easy to understand and to master. This is the first game I purchased a microphone for and it works wonderfully.
2. Fictional Geography: From my first battle at Outwitch Ranch to my fully veteran experience defending the Great Warden Dam the geography of Foxhole is second to non. Each bullet fired, each bandage used on a bleeding comrade, and each bunker built endears players to a location more and more until certain locations become places.
3. Moral: This is the first game I have ever played where battle psychology can be used to devastating affect. A single man with a bayonet can cause a whole trench line to flee in terror.
4. Equalizer: The games lack of achievements and war to war accomplishment inspires players. High school students play next to lawyers. Programmers next to sewage plant workers. It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. Skill and competence are all players care for. A welcome escape from class structures.

-some clannies that knows little to nothing will trash new players and even mass report resulting in temp. bans instead of teaching them, both factions have dedicated griefers just because of this resulting in less players.
-clanman will easily grief the faction trying to get an upperhand claiming resources and gatekeeping content from others while spamming recruitment messages looking for fools to farm resources for their fun with TOOONKS

The thing that made me love it is, I met a random guy at a base, who asked me what my plan was as I was just wondering around, and within seconds i was added to his group and we was off on a trip to the front lines. 
Maybe I‚Äôm sad, but hearing grown men and women scream ‚Äúmedic‚Äù with the occasional  group of Russians in a tank singing go past me made me feel amazing, the intensity of the firefights and gun shots and burning through ammo is just amazing, I‚Äôm really not too fussed about the amount of time I would die or get left to bleed out in a trench, to respawn and go back to try and avenge myself was amazing. 

The great fact that everything is built by players is crazy good, I joined maybe near the end of a war or midway through so there‚Äôs lots of tanks and everyone is stacked up, I would love to see what it‚Äôs like at the bare bones of just trench warfare. 

If anyone loves war games and just having a blast with a group of mates BUY this game, holding a town for hours on end is crazy, slightly disappointed when you hold it and log off and then a few hours later your team has lost it to the enemy but that will teach Me.

You have two factions (Wardens and Colonials) constantly at war in a fictional WW1-WW2 like setting. Wars have a beginning and end, with victory conditions over a huge single-shard map, and typically last around a month, after which the victors get a commemorative plaque for their win in their home island, listing the top contributors and the map resets.

There are constantly fights over 1 to 3 fronts in the map, and three distinct roles: soldier, builder and logistics. There's gunfights, vehicle combat and naval combat, you can be a footsoldier, a partisan, a medic etc. It is classless which means the player can do whatever they feel like or their faction needs at the moment. There are static buildings and cities, but apart from these the players can build trenches, defenses, bunker bases, FOBs, howis, vehicles, watchtowers etc and fight over them.

I remember trying out this game [strike]about a year[/strike] [b]years[/b] ago but it was in a completely different state than it is today. My first impression over a year ago was okay, but I could never really find where I needed to go. I felt lost and inefficient.

But now - in its current version, they have vastly improved the UI and feedback of the game. It is clear what the goals are and what is needed. The idea of the war being shared across regions on the same ""master server"" makes this effort easy to grasp as to where to pick up and go fight. They have a decent training area that covers the basic interactions of the game, the players are awesome to interact with, the fights are intense and there are so many different roles you can get into. 

I have my days where I'm energized by a cup of coffee and I'm ready to rumble in the heat of battle. I can fight at the front lines using a wide variety of tools and weapons and change into any role I need, be it Medic, Rifleman, Grenadier, Sapper, Tank Crewman, scavenger (scoop up weapons/supplies at front line and bring them back), mortar crew...whatever ground troop role you can imagine. 

There are days where I get home from work and I just want to chill and run logistics for the team. I can choose how complex I want to get with my logistic efforts for the war. If I want brainless work, I'll go gather materials and refine them so I can stockpile the main bases in the back. If I want to be a little more involved, I can do that, plus place orders for weapons and tools to stockpile the base. If I want to take it further than that - I can drive my logi truck around the front lines and communicate with the team to find out where shortages are, and create an operation with other people who want to do the same and all of a sudden I'll be involved in a large logistics operation involving multiple people coordinating their efforts to keep the boys at the front pushing. 

Shit, I've been involved in naval operations that raid the shores behind enemy lines and connected back to front line troops to cut off the enemy to win a region back. 

People have the ability to commend based on your actions, which gives a bit of a ""feel good"" that someone recognizes your efforts. These commendations increase your rank. 

I really enjoy following the war when I'm not playing. I'll spend a night doing logistics or building up defenses for a town we own - then wake up in the morning to login and see if anything made a difference. It feels good to see the front lines held, but you are left to wonder what happened when you lose territory. In any case, I really recommend this game. I've played lots of war games and I'm just surprised I'm into this game since its not a FPS game. 

I feel like this game and its developers are really onto something here and I can't wait to see how they finish this product and what other types of games they might come up with.

Foxhole as a concept is a fantastic idea for a game that gives you a truly one of a kind gaming experience, unfortunately being a great idea is the only thing that is good about it. Foxhole has been so catastrophically mismanaged by its developers that its own community has actively tried to make the game fail. 

I have played Foxhole in every war from WC71 to WC101 logging over an entire week of playtime during the 1.0 update war, that‚Äôs almost exactly 2 years of consistently playing this game and watching it develop so believe me when I say that this game has seriously gone downhill. The developers of this game have allowed themselves to be stubborn and petty to the point of destroying a revolutionary game.

Here are some reasons that you may want to rethink buying Foxhole 
‚Ä¢Foxhole is filled with long standing bugs, exploits and hacks that the devs have ignored in order to push out bloated content updates.
‚Ä¢The new logistics system in game is overly complex and takes hundreds if not thousands of man hours to maintain a single facility for the duration of the war (usually a month or so). 
‚Ä¢After several years the developers have only recently made changes to reduce the amount of ALT accounts easily destroying/sabotaging your hundreds of hours of work.
‚Ä¢There is an incomprehensive and outdated tutorial that is generally skipped, causing unintentional griefing.

The developers refuse to balance the game. There is a clear faction bias. The last several updates have heavily favored colonials, giving them many cheap yet very powerful weapons and vehicles to add to their already strong arsenal. The new weapons and vehicles have given the colonials a massive advantage over the wardens, a faction whose weapons are generally described as gimmicky and not as useful as their colonial counterparts. Evidence of bias also comes in the form of colonial buffs immediately following the recent 8 month long colonial win streak. 

For the sake of keeping things as concise as possible I will stop here but I'd like to note that these are not all of Foxhole‚Äôs problems, these are just some of the biggest and most relevant that come to mind.

In conclusion I would highly recommend against buying Foxhole, Anvil Empires or any other game touched by Siege Camp.

If you are new or going to restart playing the game, I recommend doing so at the start of a new war. Early war is Foxhole at its simplest, this is the best time to learn how to fight, work together, and figure out the general flow of the game. As the war goes on, territory changes, and technology advances. When first your only option to kill a structure was with mass grenade charges, you could instead use: artillery, tanks, rpgs, gunboats, smoke screens + explosive charges, and more. 

Foxhole has become perfect at extending your attention span for its game. There are clear objectives to complete, many routes to do so, and always more to do. 

It has cool moments, sad times, frustrating defeats, and dumb asses. 

Personally my most satisfying moment as been running in with no gear, serpentine movements through machine gun fire, punch the guy with a machine gun, steal gun, massacre enemies from within their own battlements. 

I am sure you can find something equally or cooler to do.

There isn't a single feature in Foxhole that isn't either tedious, severely-unpolished, or outright too buggy to be fun - building is an hours-long timesink into arcane sorcery that can often be undone by five minutes worth of functionally-unfightable arson with zero risk, manufacturing is inconceivably boring for most players and too-short factory expiration to public means it's often not possible to produce e.g. gsupps during a casual session, infantry combat is plagued by esoteric aiming rules or RNG-based weapons, and other activities like artillery usually boil down to a player pressing one button over and over for hours without any positive feedback from the game. [h2][/h2]Even the interface is bad? Features that've been present in games for decades, like sorting the world squad list (which containing hundreds of squads and is impossible to browse) or searches on any of the many listed interfaces, are completely absent in Foxhole. The chatbox will close itself while you're typing if you click on it, players will randomly be counted as offline and can't be messaged or invited to squads, the voice chat is almost guaranteed to get an unfixable error requiring a game restart at least once per session - usually preventing you from getting back to where you were due to queues, and the list goes on and on.[h2][/h2]If it weren't for out-of-game communities almost no one would play Foxhole.

Had this for awhile its a real mixed bag folks giving it a no based on my experience as a solo player.
[b]Toxicity:[/b]
This was something that I was really worried about when I first got the game most reviews were complaining about this, but the player base wasn't that 'toxic' from my encounters. I mostly played Colonial (green man) they tend to have smaller clans that work together in coalitions and from my experiences do a whole lotta public stuff. The Wardens (blue man) tend to have larger clans that tended to gather and spend their resources on those larger clan operations during the weekends apparently there are civil wars going on who gets to harvest at the rare resource nodes. The only time I've really seen toxic elements is while building, especially as a newer player since poor building placement can really mess things up for your side.

While both sides can be annoying at times, if you hate people spamming CUM or talking about femboys/techmaids then don't join the Wardens it personally drove me away from the faction and I liked almost everything about it weapon/aesthetic wise.
Colonials apparently have large numbers of Furries but I haven't seen any so I cant comment on that, the players talking about that stuff might be talking about out of game fan art or it might be a big meme about being nicknamed Collies.

[b]Optimization:[/b]
The game can at times feel like it isn't super optimized. You can run into some real lag even on the lowest settings when players have large construction in certain areas. Facilities has made this feel worse as you need to build lots of them due to dev vision of specialized facilities trading with one another, not so great for performance power generation seems to be a big part of this. 

[b]Asymmetry:[/b]
Factions have some shared neutral gear but most gear you use will be faction specific, Colonials have recently been buffed as of 03/30/2023 (MM/DD/YYYY) in regards to their lunaire grenade launcher allowing it to destroy buildings more efficiently. Colonials had been asking for something like this for longer than I have been playing (~4 months at least) so don't expect quick balance changes. 

Colonial:
As a mostly solo player I think the Colonials have the better infantry gear in the form of the bomastone grenade a very long range and causes bleeding which forces Wardens to use lots of medical supplies.
They also have a large variety of rifles each serving a purpose close range to longer range all of those early game rifles take the same ammo making logistics better. 
Wardens:
The Wardens on the other hand have more specialized gear, a heavier longer range rifle the Loughcaster (my favorite), a light SMG that uses different ammo great for close quarters or at night fighting, a short range revolver rifle that does a lot of damage but once again uses different ammo. Vehicle differences do exist but I cannot comment too much on them beyond wardens vehicles tend to have more armor but lower hp and might have extra guns that use different types of ammo from the tanks main gun.

[b]Do I recommend it? Will you have fun?[/b]

Yes: If you are willing to join a clan, join their stupid discord and participate in their attempted operations then I suppose you will have fun...provided you and your clan can get past the queues and are in the right timezone my warden experiences have been massive 10+ person queues in which I could be forced to sit in for 30 minutes as I attempted to participate in the organized operation. Even if you manage to get in you or clan members could disconnect at any time and be forced to sit in the same queue all over again.

Yes: If you have a group of THREE or MORE friends that are willing to play the game with you then I can also recommend the game and will vouch you will have fun. Why? Because almost all vehicles require three or more people to function properly and that is not even counting the gathering, processing, construction, AND DELIVERY of the vehicle and ammo. You can also do partisan activities which consists of blowing up the people trying to deliver supplies to the Frontlines. I mostly stuck to using mortar weaponry/vehicles when I could get teams together. Just be aware you probably wont be able to do anything at night if you are in a tank.

Yes: If you are willing to herd random players into actual plans, this takes a special kind of person though and if you are on the shy side it wont happen. You could potentially push a frontline this way but all my experiences with this stuff has been early game with disorganized mammon rushes where some random will gather a bunch of people together to suicide charge enemy fortifications with anti structure grenades. 

No: If you want to do anything combat related as a solo player for vehicle reasons mentioned above and because as infantry your will spend most of your time looking at a 10-60 second death timer while fighting over a stupid bridge that will not change hands until an organized clan rolls in to push the front forward. If you are not on a bridge then you are waiting in queue for the fun regions, if you are not waiting in queue then you are undersupplied because using the weapons + respawning in this game relies on logistics slaves driving across entire hexes to put shirts guns and bullets into your base and guess what? They sit in almost the same queue you do. The charm really wears off quickly once you 'get' combat and can actually get kills.

No: If you want to do logistics AKA a boring second job for no pay. They are basically the slaves of the game who sit there playing a terrible grindy Old School Runescape esque mining and moving simulator so people on the front lines can have all the fun. The only upside to this is you get commends from other players (ONLY IF YOU DELIVER SUPPLIES TO THE FRONT) which will increase your rank in game which is mostly cosmetic garbage, I wouldn't bother with it especially since rumor has it a rank reset is apparently coming.

No: If you want to build, building is akin to logistics you are once again playing a slave forced to sit in place with a hammer or shovel holding down the left mouse button for minutes at a time while other players have fun. The worst part by far is the maintenance which involves doing the slave logistics stuff as mentioned earlier but you are only building supplies to stop your stuff from decaying into rubble if you are far enough behind enemy lines and the war lasts long enough then you may be doing this for an entire month or longer.

No: If you cannot tolerate reporting players that can have up to 30 violations only to have them get banned for a few days.",1680218144,1680218144,False,3,1,0.53586500883102417,0,True,False,False

But since its the only one of its kind I decline to not recommend it even if I had some major bad experiences in my last 100 hours (mostly interaction with toxic clans and players).

Strengths:

- Very unique, niche game 
- Strong team play (also for solo players)
- Casual, but addicting
- Fitting graphics
- Masses (250+) of players on a single map, thousands on the whole world map
- Wars go from 10-60 days and then everything resets
- In general a nice community
- Dozens of different vehicles and buildings
- Dozens of weapons, gear and other stuff
- Lots of cool mini features and functions
- Faction vehicles are not 100% mirrored and also some weapons differ, making it interesting to switch sides from time to time

Weaknesses:

- Servers (Been a major issue since early ""early access"")
- Clans can get toxic if youre single player
- Players can get toxic due to sandbox and building features
- No real tutorial: Which can be frustrating for fresh players 
- No real tutorial: Which can be frustrating for veterans when interacting with new players
- Music and sound lack a bit in this game in general
- Lots of bugs relating the terrain (getting stuck, cant build etc)
- Due to world wide 1 server expect some lags when interacting with other players
- Shooting feels a bit janky due to server issues and world wide mixed players (high ping)

Still in general its worth playing it. 
Last words:

Though it remains an enjoyable and thrilling experience, the development studio has been slow to address issues, though this has recently improved. My The Good, The Bad, The Ugly review follows.

Tldr version:

The Good- Exhilarating war with a role for everyone. The players really make this thing unique and fun. Real life band of brothers vibes on every front. MOST players very welcoming and friendly to newbies. Whether you are a grunt in the meat grinder, a medic treating the wounded, a truck driver, or a salvager, you've got a role and respect since everyone contributed to the war effort.

The Bad: Grind for Logistics mixes EVE Online with Factorio. If you have the stomach for that, it's still unsettling. Balance issues remain that strike deep and harm the grand wars. Still buggy with an unhealthy dose of lag in many regions. Region queues, while necessary, can wreck your game when your squad or friends are in zone, and you can't deploy to join them. You can go elsewheren to die for your side, but it's best played with friends.

The Ugly: Cheesy, albeit mechanically possible, work arounds sneak by developers in betas. Players find them quickly and exploit them until patched.

Longer Version:

The Good: Fill a variety of roles, fight in amazing battles, join squads and regiments and coordinate either small skirmishes or massive tank battles. Or die in the trenches under heavy shelling and machine gun fire. Those aspects were incredible, and still are. The players, though, they make it a truly incredible experience. From shouting for medica to save them and thanking their madnrushbtheough bullets, to Logistics players dodging ambushes and mortars to deliver critical supplies, to the sounds of the Battle Bus zipping troops with grenades to the front, to shouts of Valhalla! Mind blowing and incredible.

The Bad: Have you ever been to Deadlands and rubber banded in-between everything? What about seen a tank commander flying cross your screen as if transported from a game of Quidditch? Ghost obstacles that block you but never render. All of this remains problematic. There is very little attention to these bugs.

Balance remains a key concern, but are slowly moving in the right direction. Avoiding the dev bias remarks each side tosses around, there are remaining balance issues players have voiced for months and years. I recall, during the 1.0 announcement (you can find it on YT) , a dev laughing about how his changes would make the balance team upset. It wasn't tongue in cheek. It was real. Not something that builds trust in the community and, frankly, should have been reprimanded.

The Ugly: Cheating players that join one side to spy or sabotage it (alts) remain an issue. Region queue issues are killing the experience, especially as one side losses players as the war progresses towards defeat. The disruption of the modding community was a hard pill to swallow and shows the overall lack of thoughtful solutions to some of the issues regarding cheaters and balance.",1676091264,1680117041,True,0,0,0.528693616390228271,0,True,False,False

But it's very niche. The gameplay is fairly slow for a solo player and you can't get much done without at least cooperating with others. Sometimes that means you'll have great experiences on the frontlines with natural leaders taking charge on the mics and the newer players following orders, and the whole game becomes a well oiled war machine simulator. Other times that means pure chaos in silence as your enemies encircle your bases and your friendlies are only able to spam nades with no comms being called.

If you are a player that is looking for something where your actions truly matter in day-to-day activities and you want to work with others on achieving common goals and you view the dedication required to the game as a positive, then this game is right up your alley. On the flip side, if you aren't able to at least dedicate a few hours each day to fighting/gathering resources/building, then you don't really get to see the macro picture of the game which is where the complexity and fun is really at.",1680091657,1680091657,True,2,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,False

As always the main objective is to incapacitate the enemy, while keeping a keen eye on your ammunition.

If you run out of ammunition, or the base runs out of supplies, it is your task as a live soldier, to create new ammunition from any type of scrap materials, and refine it. You are to go to where the enemy has their encampments, where you will take out any enemy soldiers, either with live fire, (if available) booby traps, or with your grenades.

On the way there, you take a lookout for any hostile squad, or unit.
If you encounter any hostiles, you take them down, with no aimed shot, at best you are running adrenaline, so keep a cool head and steady your rifle, or handgun, smg, and any heavier weapon, mg, or artillery weapons, canons, and armed patrols.


When you are being overrun, it is your main objective to hold your grounds.
When you cannot hold ground, your objective shifts from this ground, and you will fall back.
Take special care of your rifle, and ammunition, and preferably don't let it get wet (although you can swim in the game even with your rifle).

Take your spot, or hide in concealment. Your area is your last stand, seek out theirs, and find where they are hiding, steal their satchels, and ammunition, at their camp you are being hidden, and remain focused.

If your main area in battle expertise is staking out the opposition, your squad is recon. If you like to ambush your opponent, camp in a section which has enemies passing through, also take special eye if you are sniping for their higher ranks, so they can have them (bullets).

When you run out of bullets, or you are in close proximity, use your melee weapon, or your small caliber handgun, which has more shots.

Firing ammunition should only be practice in the firing range, or where your enemy was hiding.

If you don't want to have a strike on an empty base,
first read battle practice, then read your elections.
If so, then maybe one day, also you will call yourself Supreme Commander.

Now go forth and build us that base.
Carry strike initiatives, and defend your main territory, as well as your squad (of rookies).
You are going to utilize equipment, carry your medics, and operate your squad as a single unit.

So, carry on your soldier, and make uncle Sam proud.

All medics will carry out routine duties, that are always mandatory, and your squad is saving the men and women, that are fighting for our glorious nation, where we can live in peace, with no front aforementioned, had they not struck.

however, the game is managed by a team of developers that are completely out of touch with the community, and almost every update makes things worse rather than better. more and more emphasis is placed on the grind than the entertainment, and more and more player labor is required to do increasingly complicated logistical tasks. the introduction of facilities made an already tedious logistic process into something far too complex for casual players, essentially requiring player formed regiment membership to learn and work with the system. even within regiments, logistics have become a complicated bureaucracy full of toxicity and arguments over materials and location. casual players will struggle with facilities (which have been made ESSENTIAL to logistics and even putting up a fight in the war) due to no adequate tutorial, difficult to understand systems and a relatively heated environment.
  
there is a horrible system of ""asymmetry"" that results in the very weapons the factions unlock throughout the war defining the way the fronts will shift and not player ingenuity alone. and because of this asymmetry, complaining about an objectively unbalanced weapon your faction cannot have that makes combat frustrating will cause people from the other faction to make fun of you and cite how your faction has weapons they cannot adequately deal with as well.

whenever they finally make tweaks to make things more equal, it tends to do the opposite and removes the ""edge"" one faction has over the other, making the other asymmetries in the game so much more apparent. this is why both factions will complain about dev's having bias for the other, it's because there are periods where they will nerf one faction likely multiple updates in a row while only buffing the enemy, keeping the fundamentally broken and decisive system. alternatives between factions is good, allowing for unique playstyles depending on what flag you wave, but some materials are just objectively better from one faction to another and there's no denying this.

performance can be absolutely god-awful in busy regions, and the queues to even get in to combat get unfathomably long. there's very little accessibility options; for example, there's little accommodation for those of us that suffer from colorblindness. language barriers provide a real and unintentional challenge that makes gameplay more interesting, and the ways in which we as players work around it is so fascinating and entertaining, but lack of built in communication methods has led to some racist attitudes in the community that may (can't personally attest as a native english speaker) make new players feel unwelcome. 

overall, foxhole has so much potential that just continuously gets torn apart by its own developers. the game has become less and less fun the longer i've been playing.",1669611314,1679961821,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They also added another meme tank to warden side that obviviously worse than collie counterpart (lower dps, lower HP, not invisible) and of course, it costs 4x more because uhh ‚Ä¶ reasons?

Also devs refuse to moderate their community, and that resulted in both reddit and discord being filled with collie trolls who constantly spam low-effort posts about how collie players are objectively better than wardens players and how balance is ok, it just more than 1000 players who choosed warden side are dumb and skill-less. Add to that the constant requests to nerf the wardens even more, justified by imaginary reasons.

Seems like devs only listen to that constant stream of whining and trolling from the collies. The feedback post, which asked to improve the infantry equipment of the warden to match the collie infantry equipment , and with which both adequate colonials and wardens agreed, and which attracted the most attention from the players, was closed by the moderator for no reason (no other post was closed), and the developers completely ignored it, instead listening to low-effort spam with requests to nerf the meme tank mentioned above even more for imaginary reasons.


In short, DO NOT BUY this game if u want any competitive and balanced gameplay.

if you bought the game, choose wardens if you want to put in twice as much effort to get half the results.(for example: most warden tanks cost a few times more while being either same effective as collies, or even less effective)

Their choice of game engine limits the number of players to 200 on a server (up from a default 100).  Their map has several servers (regions). There are several sub-regions within each region so if you have more than 200 players on a single server they cannot fully play in every area within the region. So fighting two wars in the same region is a pain in the ass despite the map intending on having wars on multiple fronts within a region.  To make matters worse is these areas need resupplied, which requires players to enter and exit the region, but with a limit of only 200 players (most of which are fighting) it makes it difficult to supply the war efforts.  Basically this logistical heavy game, which requires multi-regional access is in need of major solutions.  Until then this game is nothing more than a queue simulation trying to be a game.  So if you enjoy waiting hours (yes sometimes an hour) to actual do something in the game besides pew pew then I'd wait to play.  With this game being so close to gold release I would not hold my breath that they fix something that has been an issue for years.


Edit:  After years of development the game suffers not from it's own design, though there are a few technical issues, such as above.  More so it suffers because the core concept behind the game requires players who are like-minded.  This is as close to a military sim game as  they come, which requires everyone on a side to come together to win the objective. The problem is developers want to ensure that solo players can do anything but individuals doing whatever they want hinders the core concept behind the game.  Name a real life military where individuals can do whatever they want.  This isn't just limited to individuals, companies are also guilty of doing their own thing and not working together with the rest of their faction.  

tldr: Cooperation in a game that requires all to work together is lacking but that's more on the player-base than the developers, but the game developers also do encourage that type of behavior by designing a game that ensure solo players can do everything in the game, resulting in weak defenses, weak logistics, and weak morale, leading to player retention issues.",1619287725,1679500103,True,1,0,0.51649707555770874,0,True,False,True

For those unaware, Foxhole is a giant war where everything, from the guns you use to the tanks the other guys have, came from raw materials that were gathered, refined, and then built in factories and put on a got dang truck and driven to the front line. It's astounding that it works at all! It's a testament to humanity's natural inclination towards cooperation and construction, with people building massive and complicated factories so anyone can get raw materials and refine them into usable stuff.

But it's... too much. Back when I played a lot, you could usually find places where there was somewhere to refine material, somewhere to build things, and somewhere to store them all located close to each other. The ability to really pump out stuff was further back, in specialized buildings that would make lots of stuff at once, but you could usually find a hub in every one of the big hex map areas that had the ability to put together supplies. It was honestly really fun being a small time logistical driver, going around and gathering raw materials from fields, making a bunch of useful stuff with available materials, storing it up, and then responding to front lines who needed supplies. It was a genuinely unique experience, and one that I really enjoyed.

But no longer. Now not only are the buildings to do everything scattered to the winds except in the very first hex, there's now even more complicated steps to produce things that require player built structures. Driving around and collecting things to make sure you've got a stockpile of bandages in case a front needs them went from ""easy"" to ""requires multiple hex journeys,"" and that's like a 15 minute drive each way. Doing nice things like ""leaving the materials to build trucks in the garage"" went from being something that required a couple extra minutes to your entire play session. It's just too much, man. It's not fun.

Well, what about the shooting? I'll be honest, I never liked it. It's top down, and you can't see far. You die easy, guns are strange, and since it's core thing is that supplies have to be moved around, it's not like you're always gonna have what you want. The enemy has artillery that's pounding you? Building artillery isn't pressing a button, it's getting a bunch of different materials from different factories, putting them together in a different factory, putting the piece on a truck(with a crane), and driving it to the front and unloading it(with a crane). Then you need ammo, which is a similarly complicated process. Their guys using automatic weapons? It's not a matter of changing class, you have to have those weapons in your base and have ammo for them. It's entirely possible that your side hasn't actually got the technology to even build something similar yet, because there's a research system. The enemy have a tank? Oh buddy, don't even pretend you can just go pull your own. Making one takes literally hours with all the shit that goes into its production.

If you're part of a gigantic clan who plays all the time, the game probably can be fun still. War is a massive logistical and industrial affair, so small groups can't realistically contribute much to it. There's a reason armies are big. But people usually play games to enjoy themselves, and much of the experience in foxhole is frustration because of just how difficult it is to DO anything.",1679424191,1679424191,False,5,1,0.525891244411468506,0,True,False,False

PROS -- Positive elements of the game.

‚Ä£ Cool concept, every soldier is a real player aside from AI occupied structures.
‚Ä£ The entire war is shaped by the players themselves.
‚Ä£ The frontline combat is interesting and entertaining.
‚Ä£ The frontline combat does feel real, and it can be intense.
‚Ä£ Feels like what an actual war would be like in real life, considering all elements.

‚Ä£ Logistics is relaxing and easy, and you feel your contributing significantly in doing so.

CONS -- Negative elements of the game.

‚Ä£ The game is too competitive, if you see someone say it is user-friendly, sure but not in a social sense. Logistics players are too entitled to the effort they put in to admit that maybe they need help.
‚Ä£ The wars take too long, I do have a pretty long attention span but most of this game is literally just meat grinding on the front lines, once in a blue moon does a special operation happen.
‚Ä£ AI structures, although good as the current amount of players cannot hold the entire front line themselves needs to be nerfed. Mammon rushing is a solution but usually there are not nearly enough to make a dint in the enemies front.
‚Ä£ Get's boring quickly due to the persistent nature of the game, as most front lines don't move for days.
‚Ä£ Can become easily frustrating if your logistics are fail to supply at an adequate standard.

Overall, the game is not really interesting at all, only recommend to retired veterans, people who have a lot of free time and war-sim enthusiasts. But I love the concept, the concept is amazing, just wish a lot more was going on in wars and you didn't always feel like you struggled to even get by.

---------- Edit (Feb 24th 2023) (~1500 hours in game)------------
Foxhole is a fantastic concept for a game and there is a lot of fun to be had playing with friends. However the game appears to be designed for attracting new players with shiny toys rather than making a quality experience once the game is already purchased. The developers clearly either do not play the game themselves to have an understanding of the games problems, of which there are many, or they don't care. Why should they care? the devs make money when the game is purchased and do not have a subscription. It doesn't matter if a player plays for 5 hours or 5000 hours the devs make the same amount and this shows in the game's QoL updates, of which there are none or at least no meaningful ones.

One major issue is with the building mechanics. Pre 1.0 update the game's engine couldn't handle many structures in the world at once so the devs try to limit building by making maintaining buildings as time intensive and annoying as possible. If you have a build to upkeep its like having a second job just to keep it from undergoing decay. Trying to keep a build alive for 4+ weeks is hell. In the 1.0 update however all this changed and not for the better. The devs added facilities which are industrial bases players have to build to get access to many of the games vehicles, many of which were previously available for far less effort. Unfortunately the game engine still can't handle building in large amounts so maintenance hell is still in place but with twice as much stuff that needs to be maintained. This just ends up with laggy servers and miserable players trying to keep a base alive so their clan can have more than basic tanks. Facilities could have been a great feature if the game engine could handle building but it can't so maintenance hell continues as the servers desperately try to cull the number of built structures. The devs added a feature their engine STRUGGLES to support as the main feature of the 1.0 update. I can say with absolute certainty not one dev of this game ever built and maintained a base, facility or otherwise, for the duration of a foxhole war.

Oh also it has a lot of griefers / alts (players who buy and account to play on the other team and grief) who don't get banned.

 It takes hours to days to weeks (real time) to get anything satisfying done, and there is very little reward for the hours to days long grind that logistics guys and builders are subjected to. You cannot manufactured goods sitting or they will disappear in crazy short times compared to how long it takes to amass resources.

it is insane that they make people do nothing but click a mouse for hours to days on end to produce resources. Making things does not require clicking but often takes hours to days longer. It is boring, unrewarding, and receives the least recognition in the game despite having the most impact on gameplay. Most players won't be bothered so shortages exist almost always.

Fighting is difficult and unsatisfying unless you have equipment you cannot even build yourself in most cases. there is no official organization so logi doesn't get done effectively and you fight on a front with mismatched ammo more often than not. Players are not friendly for the most part and will yell at you before they help you. 

Everyone has an opinion on what should be done, nobody agrees and things fall apart rather quickly. This exists among solos, opposing clans, and within clans themselves. People are petty AF.

You will spend 2 hours grinding or waiting for 15 minutes of thrill.

It is all way too tedious and rewarding this type of game format 

And finally, you will pay money for this game only to find that you can never actually play it how or when you want to because of the stupid balance system. Anywhere that matters will have a queue at any respectable time, and it takes 30 minutes to an hour to get in a hex with fighting in some cases. You can get into other hexes, but you will find that either they are not supplied at all or there are no soldiers there. you get kicked if you sit too long in a vehicle waiting even though you are in a queue. once you are in you cannot get back in easily if you are a logi. resources are often waiting at the border while the soldiers starve on the front. Stupid. 

Bottom line. This game can be a great experience. It has some amazing moments. You are rarely going to experience the best this game has to offer, and ever more rarely will amazing moments happen to you personally. You will essentially just bear witness to large clan achievements where each clan member plays a significant but minuscule part.

Imagine sitting in a trench or bunker for 10 or 15 minutes at a time just staring at the empty field between you and your enemy's trenches while nothing happens. Or dying if you so much as pop your head up in sight of the 5 guys doing the same on the other side. Imagine almost never having basic, essential things like ammo or grenades and having to scavenge enemy corpses because their side does have those things. Or spending hours driving a truck around to gather raw materials and then waiting 10 minutes for the queue in the factory to clear so you can finally produce supplies for the front and drive them up.

I think by automating more of the production process and making the setting up of supply chains more engaging, rather than requiring players to spend their time driving back and forth and starting the war with some simple weapons unlocked the game would benefit immensely.

Many comments say the dev team locks themselves away - at least in the personal experience of me and people I talk to, they have been very interactive and their dev streams are frequent. They're open about plans in the game and have decent long-term goals for the health of the game. Updates won't generally happen mid-war (unless it is truly gamebreaking) but thankfully there's no commitment to any given war.
There's a decent variety of roles to fulfill with no real expectations - you won't get locked into a certain playstyle. Combat feels intuitive - generally you don't want to run into a fight by yourself without knowing the area. I would compare gameplay to some older MMOs, there are ""grinding"" parts that are more of a social experience and there are ""active"" parts that require a bit more awareness. You can have fun with either depending on your outlook but obviously there's no reason to do things you aren't enjoying. Frontline roles include medical teams, infantry, tank divisions, and mortar teams. Backline roles include resource collection, production, research, and distribution. So in essence... Real war frontline and logistics. No air support (and to my knowledge no plans for it), navy exists but is plain, but land options are plentiful.
The map has a lot of terrain variety that I think works in its favor. Every area feels like a unique fighting experience with different problems to solve. Snow freezes vehicles and people, so you need fires. Mountains block mortars and create more restricted pathways for fights. Open areas are more vulnerable from sneak attacks. Cities have upper floors that people can shoot from. Bridges... act as a vortex for players that don't know better. I am a sucker for dynamic terrain and opportunities to use it to your advantage are plentiful.
Some minor community issues that I think can be ignored but could be a dealbreaker - some groups can be aggressive, especially to newer players, but on the other hand there are many more groups that are welcoming. I would not look at Reddit or 4chan or any other out-of-game group as a metric for what in-game is like. 90% of my interactions have been either positive or neutral-leaning-positive, but that isn't to say I'm a representative of the average.
The two teams are technically balanced though not identical - asymmetrically. There are waves of strength bursts on either side and occasionally it feels like it's just a research race, especially with high value technologies like some of the late game vehicles.  No strong sense of ""snowballing"" present, though. Colonial weapons and tools are generally cheaper but slightly worse, while Warden weapons are usually stronger but take a lot more resources. This works well for some things but does not account for the relatively even number of players, that will grow and shrink over the day - having fewer weapons is a much bigger issue at larger populations, and having weaker weapons becomes an issue in a small defense. You can always steal from the enemy if fortune permits.. but there are better ways luck as a mechanic could be used. This imbalance also applies to the aforementioned terrain, though I personally feel like the challenges presented there make for a more interesting battle.
Barring actual gameplay and social aspects... At least as of reviewing there are some server issues that I think could be resolved - the game is segmented into hexagons, and travelling between hexagons involves switching servers which creates problems in more populated areas. Some glitches go in your favor, some out of your favor, but I think at least they are predictable enough that there are no surprises after the first time something happens.
I love this game very much and I can recognize why some people have issues - some issues moreso than others - but I would nonetheless recommend the game. Don't go in with wrong expectations, and show some discretion thinking about what you want from video games. You'll know pretty quickly if you don't like it so if you're on the fence you could always buy it and refund it after discovering your feelings. Or you could just not buy it too... I only have $2 on steam and $0 in real life so if I had to choose between buying it right now and not buying it right now well I guess I already made my choice.",1679080641,1679092241,True,18,1,0.676640033721923828,0,True,False,False

It's wizardry at its most believable.

With that stated, it has one blaring issue: Server Queues...

There's great front-line infantry gunplay (deeper than you'd expect from a top-down shooter), rich vehicle battles, artillery, stealth missions into enemy territory, plus a really interesting backline logistics system that supplies all of this stuff.  It really does achieve the goal of so many open-world MMOs: to motivate players with the organic world of the game itself, rather than arbitrary quests.  I just drove a truck full of materials from Foundry to Blemish not because a questgiver told me to, but because I know my fellow players in Blemish need those materials to craft guns and medical supplies for the front line.  I hear the desperate calls for supplies from the front line, and I know what I'm doing matters.

The social element is incredibly important, there are so many things in the game you can't do solo, working together in small groups is crucial.   Probably the thing I like most is that everybody's equal, no player has more power than anyone else, and the game doesn't reward you for being greedy or selfish.  Everybody is working together toward a common goal.

There have been some serious issues, though.  The release of player-built factories (""facilities"") in 1.0 was interesting, but really went against the cooperative spirit of the game, giving players good reasons to hoard resources and lock them away from the public.  The game's most vocal players on social media tend to be jerks, prone to paranoia, witch hunts and crocodile tears and the usual drama you see in any multiplayer game's discord and subreddit.  But my biggest complaint is that the developers don't engage with the community much.  When problems and issues are pointed out, we rarely hear from the developers that they're looking into the problem, or planning a solution, which leads to more infighting and paranoia.

As I write this, the game's Steam review is ""Mixed"": that mostly reflects a coordinated review-bombing by the player base intended to get the devs' attention about real, serious problems with griefing and hacking in the game.  And eventually, the devs *did* respond, with a new update that improves game security and addresses most of their concerns.  Their response was so thoughtful that it really changed my mind about the future of the game, and I hope other players will change their reviews in light of this.

DO YOU LIKE TO BLINDLY FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY, GRAB A RIFLE, A BANDAGE, 2 CLIPS AND CHARGE...
The game is extremely patriotic for whichever faction you choose, you will find each one has its own slurs for the other, Warden's/Fembois/Sticky White Nutty liquid drinkers/Baby Eaters, Colonials/Goblins/Furries and other harmless name calling. Don't take it to heart, as you have a whole faction that backs you into bullying the other side. You will find propaganda is used almost constantly throughout playing which only adds to the immersion.

DIFFERENT PLAYSTYLES! 
Are you a calm and reasonable person? Do you like to Farm and play games like Stardew Valley? 
Or do you like to Drive a truck for hours, back and forth, supplying bases with equipment? Then LOGI is for you!

Are you a fellow scumbag? Do you enjoy destroying things with ease? Do you enjoy hurting the person I described above? Then PARTISAN'S are for YOU!

Are you a simple person, liking things go boom? Do you want to experience the true horror of WW1, as you are shelled for hours by Rockets and Shells? Do you enjoy watching your friends die in front of you, as the poor medic behind you is set on fire?
Then FRONTLINE SOLDIER IS FOR YOU!

Are you a leader? Do you enjoy planning things and bossing others around? Do you enjoy big rolling lumps of metal going against other large lumps of metal? THEN TANK COMMANDER YOU ARE!


For the cons...


When you get this game, first join, there is little to no tutorial, there are youtube videos like HelpingHans who really does help you understand different mechanics, but just like most things in life, you'll learn through mistakes, very costly mistakes.
THE NEW PLAYERS have to understand, that usually the higher ranks consist of 2 people, the toxic veteran, and the helpful veteran. If you meet the toxic one, don't be discouraged, keep playing and you'll have some experiences that you won't forget.
Cheating, is not as much of a problem as other things, but it does exist, through the use of mods players can use different mods or exploits in the game to gain an advantage through different means. The devs are currently working to fix this.
And the big con, you'll find that many vets and other players get annoyed at different things due to balance or the extreme rigour that doing logi is. The devs are always working to maintain balance but the War can always droop to one side as Logi towns and Resource fields are taken over, tech is progressed, and Towns being supplied. The other problem is player count, whenever there is a big update the servers are split into 3 different wars, which effectively splits the playerbase. 


To sum it up, I do recommend getting this game if you have the time to learn it, otherwise wait for a sale. It is truly one of a kind.

It will take some time for the community to lose its paranoid toxicity, but I am now generally willing to recommend.

[h1]I will be leaving my previous review below, as to better prepare new players as to the community they will be joining for the foreseeable future, and as a reminder of the mountain of negativity the same community had to level at the devs to get ANY response, let alone changes[/h1] 

Foxhole, where to truly begin?  Foxhole is a 24-hour semi-arcadey war-sim, where every grenade thrown, round fired, litre of fuel burned and weapon held was made by the effort of other players.  Having played for some time over it's lifespan thus far, Foxhole CAN be a very fun, but a rising epidemic in-game has massively impacted every part of the game, and makes the game hell even when you are trying your best.  The problem is unscrupulous players using alternate accounts, ""Alts"" to sabotage the opposing team without repercussions.  The epidemic of Alts has created an environment of paranoia, fear and hostility throughout the community; with much of the hostility towards new players, whom are often mistaken for Alts due to simply lacking the game knowledge to avoid playing poorly and losing materiel.  however, the fear of Alts and more general sabotage has resulted in anyone, of any experience level or playtime being targeted for harassment for even the most minor of perceived infractions, failures or mistakes.

To make all of this even worse is the lack of ANY communication from the devs, with not even a cookie-cutter ""we hear your concerns!"" to show they are working on a solution.  Some circles in the community believe that the devs inaction is a result of greed, as even known Alt Accounts are rarely, if ever, given a permanent ban;  This light punishment is fuel for a conspiratorial fire that argues that the devs are avoiding perma-bans to encourage alt-ing by demonstrating that alt accounts are safe from permanent repercussions.

If and When these concerns are addressed, I will update this review; until such a time, however, I have one concise statement to sum up my review:

And the thrill of being outmatched or helped by players who know how to play better. The game has seen quite a lot of updates which, in general, have increased its complexity, also the challenge, the graphic quality, the fluency of game, remaing extremely fun. Unfortunatelly, as it relies on cooperation, it suffers a lot from people who just play to annoy others. Sometimes in harmless ways, others really abusing the system and ruining the experience. I have seen people who quit the war (or even game) due to abuses from others. Alt playing, sabotaging, stealing of materials or vehicles.

Foxhole is a very one of a kind experience, that I have seen no other game do. The amount of different ways that you can play this game and help the team out is awesome, and has a role for any kind of player. You like action, get a gun or tank and go to a front and fight. Do you like chill gaming sessions, grab a truck and harvest some resources, or craft some supplies deliver them to a point of interest. Want to mess with the enemy, get behind enemy lines and try to steal stuff or just cause chaos. 
There are so many more ways to play this game that it will be able to appeal to any kind of person. 

The game isn't perfect though far from it. There are many frustrations, people creating alt accounts to hurt the enemy team while on the enemy team, building being so fickle with how you can build in certain places (if at all), the voip errors making where you can't communicate with people, and many more problems. 

Would I recommend this game. Yes, this game is just too unique and fun, you will not find another game with the same type of game play as this, and while the issues are annoying they are not bad enough for me to say that you shouldn't play this game. Give it a try, play different roles to find what you like, and remember to ask in chat, in game if you have a question or need help.  The community over all is very helpful and kind to new players (usually). 

I hope you find foxhole as fun as I have.
P.S. There is a lot more good things, bad things, and roles you can play that I didn't mention. This game is up and down a lot of the time but truly a one of a kind game.",1678465389,1678465389,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

That said, the developers seem hell-bent on squandering the amazing work they have done so far. 
There is complete and total lack of communication between the developers and the players, with the developers not breaking radio silence until major update announcements. There is a refusal to even acknowledge know issues, and plenty of anecdotal cases of players being banned for reporting bugs under the ""no exploiting glitches or bugs"" rules.

Lets talk about bans. This game has no anticheat. No. Anticheat. Whatsoever. The only moderation avaliable to the game is the ability to mass-report, which gives a 3 day temp ban. This game is plaugued with griefers, alts (those who use a second account to sabotoge the other team or steal intel), and other bad actors that the community has no way of dealing with effectively.

So you see someone dumping hundreds of hours worth of your teams work into a river, look at their activity and see that destroying friendly vehicles is the only thing they have done this war, check their ban log and see they have been banned every three days for the past four years... and come to the gutting realization that there is nothing you can do.

Don't let the 1.0 label fool you, this game is unfinished. Bugs, clipping, performance, balance, QOL... and none of the issues are even acknowledged by the devteam. DO NOT BUY, not until Siege Camp studios pulls their head from their asses.
------------------------------------------UPDATE----------------------------------------

Update 52 is a good step in the right direction, and addressed a lot of things the community has been concerned about. That said, my review remains negative due to the continued poor communication. It's obvious that the devteam is listening to the community, but they are continuing to refuse even the most basic levels of community managment and interaction.

Foxhole is great. 
playing in the front line, making big pushes with people you only met feels like pushing with people youve know your whole life

the feeling of taking out another tank with your tank crew is exhilarating and always makes you feel proud and accomplished after hours of making a tank from scratch.

I can't say I agree with every decision the devs made, but this game is so much fun. I've always wanted a war game with a little more ""open-endedness"" in the sense of how you can contribute to winning. This game is just that. A massively-multiplayer sandbox war game. Besides the towns and settlements, almost everything is player-made from player-gathered resources. It's one of those games. And it's great. While it is far from perfect, this has easily been my favorite multiplayer game I've played in the last 5 years. Worth every penny.

Look out for the streamers, and honestly the devs are kinda blowing it currently. That being said, still met some of the best people in this game since I started playing and would still recommend to everyone.

*********************

Update - 3/8/23: This game has changed so much since I first started playing, and I don't play it anymore really mainly just due to life. But despite the saltiness that comes with the blind faction loyalism, the blood-from-stone feedback loop the devs have largely operated on over the years, the Foxhole reddit exclusion zone of high schoolers too angry and horny 90% of the time to have civil discourse combined with a very noticiable lack of moderation skill by the dev team--AND--quite frankly, just some really stupid decisions they've made, I still will always recommend everyone try/buy Foxhole for the single most unique gaming experience I've encountered on a multiplayer scale 

To Siege Camp, AKA CLAPFOOT: Look, I like your game, but I strongly disagree with many aspects of how you built the game, and I don't think you guys have always made good decisions regarding it's development. Just because you have made smart decisions for Siege Camp, doesn't mean that translates to smart decisions for Foxhole (and sometimes have a direct inverse relationship.)

All that being said- Thank you Siege Camp. For providing a vehicle in which I had a meaningful 108 days of time spent in your creation and all the great experiences and people I had the privilege of encountering throughout it all.

As much as I hate the way you guys operate, I'm sure if you ever release Anvil, I will be the guy who sighs before unzipping their pants upon booting it up.

Please, if you buy this game, join the community of many who are fighting to get the players a voice and genuine solutions to the problems that face this innovative and interesting games. Here is my inital *Positive* review, many points still stand but the development team have failed us:



*sigh* I wish I could give this a neutral review or sommin. The game is great, the 13 man dev team are working their assess off to give a game that's loved, while they make blunders in their decisions sometimes and really piss off the community the game is still good. The real problem is the community, I'm a *very* solo player and have argued with a lot of clans in my time playing the game this is not unusual for games, but the community in general needs to improve, Toxicity is very easy to find with both factions having it. If someone is Looking to pick up the game:

- If you're solo, good luck to you I genuinely hope that you don't decide to quit the game like so many have.
- If you're coming from a clan, I don't care what clan it is but when you join don't get pulled into fights or arguments between clans, it's a waste of time and the people having the arguments are usually idiots
- If you've got friends who play you're in a perfect position to play the game, Roam around in a squad from 2-10 players doing whatever you guys enjoy, this game is perfectly geared for that play style and it's what the game needs more of.",1609151114,1678300910,True,0,0,0.740315794944763184,0,True,False,False

In these past few years I have seen best and the worst of the foxhole, the community playing part on both. 

In Foxhole you can hop on and hit the frontline to test your skills against all sorts of opponents and use both your factions weapons and those which have been taken from the enemy, or go to backlines to do some logistics and chat about the most random things while scrapping with some people you have never met before. 
Ofc us veterans can be rather short-tempered at times and we can be rather harsh towards new players making a mistake that we have seen few hundred times already. That is on us, but I have been also trying to help wherever I can and try to teach new players that seem to need help. There are some unspoken rules within the community which some have had to learn the hard way. Also the fact that the home island's training courses are obsolete makes the player to player interactions even more important.

Foxhole still has that little something that makes it unique and has kept it's charm over the years. Player driven logistics, true persistent warfare, after the war starts it's goes on 24/7 till either side wins.

The immersion of playing as just one cog in a machine of thousands; working together, communicating, seeing honest-to-goodness supply-chains come together through team spirit, coordinated pushes into enemy bases, tanks rolling over enemy line while supported by infantry and artillery fire, the list goes on. Many real-world World War I and II tactics actually work in this game, and it makes for an experience like no other.
The proximity chat adds another layer of immersion and community that is sorely lacking in today's gaming industry. You'll hear allies calling out enemy positions and emerging threats as the battle evolves, injured soldiers shouting for medics, and machine gunners pleading for ammo as they use their last clip as sparingly as possible. The further away someone is, the quieter they are, so coms are (usually :P ) not too crowded. Another added bonus of the voice chat is that when¬†you start playing and have no idea what you're doing, just ask. There's always someone eager to help out.
As you've probably seen already, every item and vehicle (and many structures) are created by players. There's something special about passing by a¬†factory that's in full swing; cranes loading and unloading cargo ships, raw materials being¬†fed to factories that spit out rifles, bullets, uniforms, diesel, petrol, gas masks, tanks, and¬†a constant flow of trucks bringing the much needed gear to the front line.
Because of this, every battle matters. If your faction fails to defend a factory, then your side looses not just everything that wasn't evacuated in time, but the ability to effectively hold that region without straining surrounding territories. But again,¬†you're just one cog in the machine, so fights manage to feel meaningful without also putting too much pressure on any one player. It can be a hard balance for a developer to achieve, and I think Foxhole's scale helped Siege Camp to nail this. (Not to subtract from their ability/achievement)

From a gameplay perspective it works quite well and can be an extremely entertaining and engaging experience. Where Foxhole really misses the mark, so much so that I generally do not recommend it to anyone I socialize with, is in its community.

Foxhole has well earned its reputation for having a toxic community that attracts many of the less savory members of the greater gaming community, and it has this reputation for one simple reason: Lack of community management by the developers. Either because the developers don't see the issue with it, or don't care to deal with it, extremist and highly toxic individuals were allowed to flourish in the game for quite some time. So much so that highly inappropriate conversations could be witnessed in global chat channels with surprising regularity. Eventually the developer decided to take the Reddit approach to community management and offloaded the responsibility on to the player base - Now with an upvote/downvote system and comms rating for global chat channels (but not voice comms or local chats) every player in the game gets to decide who may and may not speak in these channels. Too many downvotes and your communication rating gets downgraded, and your ability to use global text channels removed. As these channels include Intel and Logistics channels, this means your ability to play the game (and assist other players as well) may be impacted. Furthermore, automated conduct report bans were also created allowing players to temporarily ban players from the game outright. As a result the visibility of the more extremist elements were reduced, but only ones which are on the truly extreme end of social acceptability. In truth, what this means is that only the most extreme forms of racism, discrimination, etc. are vilified and handled by the community, while lesser forms of discrimination, general toxicity, and occasionally even some degree of racism are left to flourish. In other words you can be an ass in Foxhole all you like as long as you don't cross the line, or piss off the wrong clans (if a clan decides they don't like you and their members are willing to report people if told, they have the power to ban you from the game with mass reports.)

What this means in practice is that while Foxhole may be a downright wonderful game experience minus some balance issues and some creative decisions that result in some less-than-fun experiences for some, your social experience will be another story entirely. In an MMO-style game social experience is important if you want to do things other than just shoot at the enemy, which is only one small piece of the game. If you choose to keep voice communications on, and you actually make use of the text chat, you WILL with 100% certainty encounter people who will tell you that the way you play the game is wrong; they will tell you aggressively, loudly, and occasionally even with a teamkill thrown in that they are better than you and that if you don't listen to them you are wrong (despite themselves often not being very good at the game.) You will encounter other players who suffer the same event with regularity. As a player of the game since its earliest days I still encounter individuals of this sort often multiple times per session often trying to harass other players over VOIP, and occasionally even myself. However, because there is no community management of VOIP conduct, and little to no visible moderation of the game done via the developers, this means that the only way to avoid it is to not use VOIP at all and hope that ignoring these individuals doesn't result in them attempting to abuse the aforementioned community regulation systems or outright gunning you down. With regards to the communication upvote/downvote system getting banned from global chat channels can happen even to well-known and respected members of the community, and has in fact happened many times since the introduction of these self-managing community systems.

So while from a gameplay standpoint I find the game to be a unique experience that players of other intricate, collaborative games like EVE Online would quite enjoy, I can't in good conscience actually recommend it for the lack of community management. Especially in today's online world, community management is an extremely important part of any game of this sort and is not a responsibility that should be offloaded onto the game's own community. When the social experience plays an important role in the goings-on of this game and one's ability to extract the most out of it, I also can not separate this issue from the rest of the game and simply say ""it's a good game but just turn off the chat and VOIP.""

There are a lot of people who will tell you that the community management systems aren't actually that big of a deal and the community isn't ""that toxic,"" that the likelihood of you ever being mass reported and banned is quite low and ""most of the people saying that actually deserved it and lying about how they got banned."" In some cases they'd be right, however they conveniently leave out the part where it absolutely can and does happen, and they leave out the issues that aren't quite as severe. Is everyone in the game a toxic, racist jerk who will teamkill you and tell you want to do? Absolutely not. Are you going to get regularly communication banned or game banned for just trying to play the game normally? Extremely unlikely. Can it happen? Absolutely. The developers also do offer a way to report abuse of these community management systems, but should people really need to file such reports in the first place? Furthermore, the community in my experiences places little trust in abuse reports, as the issue remains ever present and as of War 83 several high-ranking players have had to adjust their approach to global communication to avoid being given poor communications scores for things as harmless as helping coordinate logistical movements, or providing updates for the faction's technology level.

For those reasons I do not recommend this game to others, and will continue to not recommend it until the developers commit to internal handling of community management, or a hybrid approach with far better handling of the existing mechanisms and better handling of abuses of the system.

As a final note, I want to make it very clear that in my entire time playing Foxhole I have never once been banned, received poor communications, or anything even remotely close to either. I am not an aggrieved party salty about being punished for some misdeed. I'm just a long-time player disappointed with the state of the game and its community at present.

- Addendum: The developers also have had, and continue to have, a very lax approach to handling same-team griefing and people using alternate accounts to grief the enemy team. Again, because the responsibility for these issues was offloaded onto the community some vectors for griefing cannot be investigated or handled appropriately, and methods the developers actually do introduce for mitigating these issues are subpar. While this is especially relevant at the moment of writing this addendum (Dec. 2021) it has been a prevalent issue for years just like the toxicity problems.

- March 8, 2023: Developers continue to utilize community-based moderation despite severe issues with griefing and players running alternate accounts to sabotage the other team. While they have, in response to negative reviews, finally added some automatic countermeasures to make griefing harder, they have continued to eschew adding real moderation systems. The moderation systems in place have continued, leading to rampant witchhunting and in-game toxicity, especially toward new players.",1632986814,1678264927,False,34,0,0.632584273815155029,0,True,False,True

I have 1300 hours in Foxhole. It is one of the best and most unique games I have ever played. Unfortunately, alts (people buying second accounts on the enemy faction to sabotage) and griefers (own teammates sabotaging to troll) are absolutely ruining the game, and this problem is only getting worse. 

1. The developers need to implement active moderation in-game

2. add more tools to catch alts and to mitigate their harm

3. actually start permanently banning players who alt, grief, and constantly break the rules

4. communicate with the community on this issue for more ideas on how to fix it and so that we don't feel unheard and powerless

In this game there are two factions: The Wardens and the Colonials.
Wardens are defense oriented: Better terrain, heavy armor, and winter gear.
Colonials are offense oriented: Flatter terrain, mass produced tanks, and mud/rain gear.

The Wardens are a mix of EU and US players mostly split between large and medium sided clans.
Colonials are a bit of a mixed bag - US, CN, and Russia as far as I can tell - mostly fragmented into smaller groups.

Wardens are horny weebs. Colonials are furries. Take your pick. You'll die all the same.

Logistics is often a mix of base building and truck simulator where people run around the backline collecting material to send to the front. The recent facilities update has put a lot of strain on the backline players to the extent that you'd have to no-life the game to maintain anything you build. That kind of commitment requirement isn't sustainable.",1637912577,1678255213,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is truly great! I've already logged 21 hours in the past 48 hours of owning the game- which is rare for me.

This game reminds me of Company of Heroes- except every person you see is another player! FoxHole has pleasantly taken me by surprise in 2017- and is a ruby gem in my books. Buy it! It's fun.

i love this game

^ old review

if you're wondering why the recent flood of negative reviews, it's a boycott by the majority of the community to get the devs to implement fixes and not just new content.

crazy, right? you don't see too many communities boycotting the game they're based around cause there's TOO MUCH CONTENT. the reviews are with good reason. massive waves of griefers and alternate accounts (2nd accounts used by a player to give their own faction an edge by hindering the other) along with a complete disregard by the devs for any bug fixing, balance changing, or even just general discourse with the community.

once siegecamp (you'll always be clapfoot games to me my love...) figures out how to properly manage communications with their community and reduces the complete grindfest that any of the fun mechanics/tools are locked behind, i might reinstall it. definitely not worth the 30 USD in its current state

I came back after nearly 4 years away and went from knowing everything the game had to offer(a pretty large amount of content) to feeling like a new player with all the new toys and systems that were added.  

The reason i quit has been made more vocal recently, griefing and building decay/inaccessibility being my personal nails in the coffin (seriously i made a thread about it back in 2018!). The next update looks to FINALLY start to address many problems that the game has long had, including both of these, while also adding A LOT of quality of life improvements.

You should absolutely give this game a try. Even with all of its problems there is nothing like it currently.   

Ask questions. There is a lot to learn and it is very satisfying to do so. This game offers so much to teamplayers and there is so much depth to be had.  

More updates are planned including a massive naval update from my understanding. The game is still very much being actively developed.

Not recommended for people who refuse to even try to play cooperatively.

One more positive for me.  The international community in this game is amazing.  The amount of tolerance, especially considering the type of game, is great to see.  Naturally there are still people with hate, but overall it just doesn't matter. it's simply wardens vs colonials (or blue vs green) It's easy to forget that all our languages are just different ways of saying the same things.
                                                   Old outdated review below
TLDR:  This game is well worth the money IF you can make time for it, handle the semi more than occasional griefer, and love a team based war game. 

  I highly recommend you watch a few tutorials as the servers are generally hectic nonstop, and new players asking questions can be missed.

Pros: 

-Sandbox warfare take over all the towns to win
-70v70 (looks like they're aiming higher!)
-Scrap, Build, Fight, Drive, Logistics, Scout, Plan.  If you are a war nut this game has it.
-Extremely Active development
-Very well put together for an Alpha
-Line of Sight
-The map has recently been updated and though confusing at first, It really looks/functions great.
Cons: 

-Griefers (mostly kept in check but can really effect a game without anyone even noticing)
-Clans..They are not all bad but they generallytend to take what they want because they think they are the reason that the game is being won.

-Buggy...As a new player you likely won't notice too many bugs as they are relatively small things but the more you play the more consistant and obvious they become.

-Camera Angle...You will accept it or hate it after getting used to it.  Currently this game requires corner panning (looking at the corner of your screen for maximum view distance)  You better get used to doing it or else you will be dieing and yelling ALOT.

-Ranking System through commends...Easily abused to make your friends a very high rank.  commends are earned while playing the game basically..receive enough from other players and your rank increases.   Though seemingly asthetic, alot of newer players will follow/listen to/send all the group supplies to some of these inexperienced high ranking people for hours.  This can literally cause a game to be lost.

The game requires time if you want to make an impact.   If you have a group/group of friends it will probably be WAYYYY more enjoyable, though solo play you can still be very helpful/effective.

Ultimately this is a team game and you cannot win alone.

You may spend 20 minutes making materials, another 20 minutes turning them into weapons/ammo/respawn supplies and someone might steal your truck holding it all when your back is turned, If you spend your day scrapping/making supplies and watch them all get wasted this can be very discouraging and make you feel like your day has been wasted.

The negatives are enough to drive you mad but when the game is grief-free it is an absolute blast and i could not recommend it more.",1514650075,1678225709,True,3,0,0.533804237842559814,0,True,False,True

As a proud Chinese citizen and devoted gamer, I have to say that Foxhole is one of the most fantastic games I have ever played. It not only delivers a thrilling gameplay experience, but also highlights the Chinese spirit of perseverance and determination.

The struggles of the Warden faction in Foxhole perfectly capture the essence of Chairman Mao's Long March, where our people were able to achieve great victories in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The game's representation of the Warden faction's efforts to overcome their enemies through cooperation and hard work is a testament to the Chinese spirit and makes me proud to be Chinese.

I commend the creators of Foxhole for their recognition of Chinese culture and history, and for crafting a game that showcases our country's great achievements. It is truly inspiring to see the Warden faction pushing forward with such bravery and unity to achieve their goals, much like our ancestors during the Long March.

Playing Foxhole has not only been an immensely enjoyable experience, but it has also taught me a lot about China's rich history and culture. I urge all gamers to try this game and join me in celebrating the incredible strength and resilience of the Chinese people. Thanks to Foxhole, I feel more connected to my heritage and more proud of my country than ever before. #ChineseExcellence #WardenFaction #LongMarch #ChinesePride #Cooperation #Determination #Foxhole.",1678181741,1678181910,True,2,2,0.488560885190963745,0,True,False,False

We care about this thing so much but the Devs have not improved or indicated a dedication to the fundamental problems that are causing such a reaction in the communities of Foxhole.

Respect for players is what we are asking. In the form of respect for time in doing game tasks (building and logistics are still in dire need of revision). Respecting players by protecting items that players have poured multiple sessions and hours into creating from simple griefing and protection from alt-account activity alongside stronger action on shutting down cheaters are all in desperate need.

Game balance is its own can of worms that the Developers at Siegecamp -need- to revise. Their central premise is asymmetry at every possible point which has caused a vitriol in player reactions to what is stronger than the alternative at specific components and the wider whole for one team over the other (and which festers anger and hate between groups and causes bad faith communications between sides when discussing game balance).

Foxhole is an amazing game and idea, but the Developers have truly lost their way currently with how they rolled out its Inferno 1.0 release. We truly want to see the game succeed. It is a wonderful setting for stories to be experienced but it is being squandered in how much further it has a vibrant community and eco-system to realise all the systems in place.

If you do buy the game, always ask questions in voice/world chat for assistance from your team. Group up with public players or bring your own and ask how you can help. There will be a 100 ways and you will get to experience a hell of a War simulator (just remember to take breaks).",1678164308,1678164507,False,8,1,0.530342161655426025,0,True,False,False

Now dear reader, you can find many an in depth review about mechanics and various nuances in the game on other reviews so I will not attempt to retell these things when others have done a far better job that I

So what will I say, well you can see there are some people who are very unhappy with the state of the game. I am hear to encourage you to ignore them. Does the game have issues? yes certainly, many are rather unavoidable given not only the scope of the game but also the fact that it is developed and managed by something like 10 guys. The fact it actually works at all is a massive achievement and is testament to the commitment of the dev team. 

Many feel the game is unbalanced, this is not actually true. we just had a war which lasted 52 days, during which time we had a stalemate of several weeks. The only reason that is possible is because the game is actually well balanced. The Wardens however are dominated by a monopoly of large clans who are generally elitist and strategically unimaginative. They also have a tendency to become very defeatist if things don't go their way, like say a few major advances being held back or even routed. The truth is fellow gamers that the recent review bomb of the game happened at exactly the same time that the Wardens began to lose. This is obviously very sad for the warden players who enjoy the game and continued to play out the end of the war. Props to you guys it was a hard won victory. The issue with the warden string of losses is actually a cultural issue for the big sweaty warden clans. Obviously they are not all like this and even most of the actual players in these clans are pretty reasonable people. The issue is that their culture is dominated by whiny man children who make a lot of noise and spread low moral. 

I've read a few things about the new facilities being and issue with big groups claiming resources and monopolising the access to all the good toys. This is a warden issue, I have never experienced that last more than a single day when a Colonial group attempts this, which they no longer do because we don't tolerate it. several collie clans make public facilities where people can trade resources they collect for the tools they which to use. Furthermore, setting up a small facility is not even hard to do, you must simply have focus production on what you intend to build. When the moment comes when you want to try different things, switch out the buildings you no longer need for the ones you do. It's that simple.

This is a cooperative MMO war sim, play cooperatively",1678059077,1678059077,True,1,1,0.520340621471405029,0,True,False,False

To make a long story short, both sides have a distinct doctrine - The Wardens favor armor and specialized tools (and tend to have better armor and worse infantry) while the Colonials are meant to have a strong infantry doctrine but slower and more generalist tanks.

The last three wars have had significant nerfs to Colonial anti-tank infantry equipment while strengthening the warden armor arsenal.  The tech tree (Both sides have a tech tree set from the beginning of each war) has also favored earlier Warden anti-base armor while the Colonials tend to find their anti-tank later and later in the game.

While I'd like to think this is a temporary issue that will be worked out, it getting worse across multiple wars is starting to drive Colonial players to the Warden side, making the issue worse.

Given this is a two-faction game based entirely around PVP, balance issues aren't really something that can be ignored - In it's current state, I can't recommend new players get into it.

03-05-2023 Edit: Given I haven't played the game for months, I can't speak of whether the above problems of game balance have been rectified, but given what I've heard from friends still playing, I don't have any interest in going back to Foxhole for a few reasons.

 - Poor Dev communications with players, and seeming disinterest in what the players actually think of balance changes and features.  

- Little to no testing with rolling out significant changes to both frontline and rearline balance.   

- Questionable development roadmap in general.

In short, whatever the store page may say, you're going to be treated to the Early Access experience of paying for the pleasure of constantly testing new changes in general, with a devteam that's indifferent to your opinion, unless you happen to be an influential streamer.  

I don't want to be overly negative on Foxhole - Conceptually, it's an amazing idea, and I did get a fair bit of enjoyment out of it, I dig the WWI-II setting vibes that are inspired without being straight ripoffs of the real world, but at the end of the day, for something that people pay for, you'd expect the devs to pay more attention to their community - Especially since it's that same community that gives their player-driven game any playability at all.",1652812009,1678049702,False,11,0,0.548417270183563232,2,True,False,True

However, I simply can't give it a thumbs up in its current state. Balance is a big issue in this game, and rather than making an attempt at actually balancing the game the devs instead just swing the balance pendulum back and forth. One side will have a win streak and suddenly the devs will nerf something on the winning side while simultaneously buffing something on the losing side, give more favorable tech to the losing side, give less favorable tech to the winning side, etc. It does happen to both factions, however, devs do generally seem to have bias towards one faction over the other (won't say which).

Quality of life is almost nonexistent in this game, building, logi, and maintaining structures are all tedious. With 1.0 they introduced a plethora of new and very destructive toys, putting further strain on builders and logi. 1.0 also introduced facilities, quite possibly the worst mechanic that has ever been added, it adds a whole new level of grind and tediousness to the game; building and logi were already pretty bad before the update, yet doable. Solos and small groups are discouraged from playing with the new (and old) toys as many are locked behind the aforementioned facilities. People will say ""bUtT ITs a TEeM gAMe U haVe 2 woRk 2gEthUr!!!!"" yeah, you do, and that is still achieved no matter what you do. You are always contributing even if its indirectly, and also small groups are still groups, we should be able to have access to the cool stuff without the game being a full time job.

I don't want the devs to rework the current system, rather i just want them to add some quality of life changes to make it bearable. On top of all, sometimes big clans will ""claim"" resource fields and make it hard or impossible to access those resources unless they are kind enough to allow you to access them. You also risk clans mass reporting you because you do something they don't like. Both factions are largely swayed by their respective community groups where all the (mostly major) clans organize, vote, and decide the outcome of the faction. I wouldn't mind those points so much if these clans didn't simply prevent/ make very difficult for non big clans to do their own work.

However, it's not all bad. This is such a unique game that gives an experience like no other (basically Battlfield on steroids). Massive battles with hundreds of people on the same battlefield, tanks of all sizes spearheading attacks, constant artillery shelling creating no man's land or weakening enemy fortifications for easier assaults. There is a role to fit every play style, medics for support, heavy gunner to suppress enemy push, basic rifleman, tank crew member for epic armor combat, partisan for those who would rather sneak behind enemy lines and disrupt logistics, and so many more. This game has so much depth and so much to do it can keep you entertained for hours; with it being as epic or relaxed as you make it.

I have no plan to stop playing this game for good anytime soon because it truly is an amazing concept and amazing game, but until some of these issues are addressed i cannot give this game a thumbs up because they are pretty big issues in my opinion.",1678042454,1678043903,False,14,0,0.566297233104705811,0,True,False,False

the only other thing that bothers me is the command structure and communication/coordination which isnt really aided in game and left solely up to map posts wich need upvotes like its f reddit, and crying for help in the chat bar
I dont run logistics so i dont know much about that system other than its complicated and takes man hours like a second job.

other than that its a great game, love ptsd simulator, its unlike any other game and full of fun and awesome adventures. friends are super easy to come by here although some vets are sorta toxic but forget that jazz. Gameplays great and i enjoy sitting in a trench until 3 every single night. Im still playing because i hope its gets better and it definitely can but at the moment cant recommend until the cheaters are dealt with.

I am the target audience the devs want in their game. I will add and adjust as time goes on. Firstly I do like the game and I do like that devs keep content flowing in. It just needs to be refined more. Dont let this review stop you from buying the game and finding good people to play it with. Just right now there is a good chance devs will see this review as the foxhole community tries to bring change. So here is my experiences, in various cliff notes. I really just wrote down my thoughts on a word text file as I noticed things playing.


Main complaints
AI are too short of range or ineffective. Even after being overhauled. They are basically a two hit kill for tanks. Even building 30 does not last long. Or only a single ai returns fire instead of all when one is attacked. Terrible...


Bunker decay is wayyy too high for how much materials and time it takes to build them. After a couple weeks people just stop bothering with them. Leaving the backlines defenseless as everything has decayed away. Its impossible to defend when everything withers away rapidly. I saw many adopt a bunker signs in empty fields as people leave the game or move areas. Only for these bunkers to never be supplied by other people because its so time consuming to do so, even for clans. 


Bigger vehicles get blocked by smaller ones. Like a bicycle can stop a tank or a tank cannot push a jeep/truck. Battle tanks can push things so it makes no sense this does not apply to other vehicles. 


ALTs are pretty terrible. I have witnessed them multiple times in my first week scouting out defenses for future coli pushes. Torching down bases in the backlines. Taking tank gunner seats sitting doing nothing. Dumping items out of factories. Driving vehicles into water like partisans. And the list goes on... Its been terrible and I know when a major coli push is going to happen by the sheer amount of alts running around prior. Its a problem on both sides and it needs fixed! Its very easy to tell an alt apart. They typically have no rank or very low. Then they run around doing things like experienced players would do. When otherwise new players stand around confused asking for help. The sea of new negative reviews about ALTs ruining the game is very justified. I watched multiple clans just drop their shovels and walk away from game after being griefed by alts a dozen or so times.

AI also just turn off on the front line during low pop hours. Because not enough people (10) set a spawn zone in a town hall or bunker hosting the AI. Doesnt matter how well you build something when the AI just turns off because low population across the entire map. I spent hours bringing supplies and building up to an area to stop infantry and tanks. Only for it to all be destroyed by a couple dudes with mammoth grenades; since ALL the ai was off from low pop. Wow what a game mechanic... And Im not the only one this broken feature has ruined the game for. I personally know a dozen people who quit playing after all their work gets sidelined/destroyed during low population hours. They wake up the next day thinking their effort meant nothing spending a full day building defenses only for it to be lost from not enough people online in that area to defend. Which shouldn't that be the point of AI? To defend when no one is around even with all its other shortcomings! The warden side loses all its progress in the early mornings. That took days or hours against real players to capture. Im sure the coli players have a similar experience in areas. Seeing all your hours of work just zapped away not from players earning that area. But practically giving it away to whom ever walked in. Is about the biggest punch in  the face this game gives people. And this is a prime reason people quit playing.


Remaining review

The voting system to allow building in towns is just trash. Its a pain to get people to vote just so a town can ""unlock"" things like standard defenses or the ability to repair seaports. meanwhile a small crew of partisans can come over and satchel anything in a very fortified area within a couple minutes easily. Crippling that town for multiple real days awaiting people to vote! Its trash and unlocking town assets should be a far faster timer overall. Dependent on how long that town was held prior and other towns around it. Because right now only voting seem to make any quick difference and good luck getting votes without clans doing it. 


There is no way to prevent people from stealing your vehicles. There is only a 45 min squad lock that half way works. While some vehicles let people still steal them with a squad lock and others just lock the inventory. It is so painful spending hours either building vehicles or stealing them from the other faction. Just for some fresh spawn with a wrench to grab it walking by because you parked it in your base. This is by far one of the biggest issues in foxhole. Squad lock needs to last ""at least"" 24 hours and completely lock anyone from tampering with it. While also showing who locked the vehicle to report any grievers. 


Coli advantage of putting out more vehicles for less cost as their manufacturing faction bonus. this is fine I dont dislike it. But the wardens are suppose to have harder hitting vehicles with more armor. Where as on the battle field the only thing that matters is numbers. The wardens with supposed better tanks for higher material costs is not something I could see myself fighting coli tanks. we typically have two to three tanks while the colis have five up to nine. I would be fine with this as balance. Except the warden tanks take about the same amount of hits and repairs as the coli counterparts. Wardens also have less or no additional slots in their tanks for spare bmats. In practice and what players typically bring for the front lines I dont see much difference between the factions in tanks. If anything the coli have far more useful options with either range or bigger guns for less cost. Wardens rarely have any tanks in public storage even in late game. Meanwhile reddit shows us posts of 100s of tanks in coli public use. Its pretty insane of a difference when the warden tanks hardly have an advantage against such numbers. In general I rather all tanks just be a little better against other tanks in specific roles as a counter. When you hit another tank there is no meat behind it. It takes multiple tanks hitting a single tank to make progress. Or the tank simply backtracks and repairs coming back in a couple mins. This lasts for hours... Both sides have an all or nothing balance in this area. In conclusion, warden tanks are line tanks. They need players to form tank lines to be effective. Coli tanks are generally well rounded to either be alone or in a line with the bonuses of cheaper mass production and spare slots for bmats. Which makes defeating their 5,10,20 tank groups very difficult. Its not untypical to see one or three coli tanks just drive up to a town hall or bunker destroying quickly. They can take enough hits from most anti tank to destroy these buildings before dying. 


As other reviews have pointed out. There does seem to be a dev bias at play in the game. Like its not untypical for it to start snowing on wardens when colis attack a nearby hex. At first we all thought ""oh cool weather it must be like this across the map"" and as others spawn around realizing its not snowing anywhere on the coli side in the north regions. We think ahh that is strange. Then it happens again, again, and again... Then there is wind changes. Devs like to change the wind when certain coli targets in an important fight are damaged. I personally seen wind rotate 360 degrees on a flag within 1 hour in the fight for Iris from Reef. Long term players/spotters never seen wind change so rapidly.

Most of it is spent doing menial things to keep my faction alive, and it's not even fun. Quality of Life is close to none. The balance is horrid, and 1.0 update made it worse. THERE IS NO ANTI-CHEAT OR MODERATOR IN THIS GAME, AND WE SURE DO HAVE A LOT OF CHEATERS. BEST PART? DEVS DONT BELIEVE IN PERMA BAN. 14 DAYS BAN MAX. Devs don't listen to the player base at all in the past couple years, and the community doubt they ever will. This is a dying game, and the devs are killing it so we can buy their new clone game, Anvil. Corporate greed, narcissism, and sheer incompetency.

Do yourself a big favour and DON'T buy this game. NOT EVEN ON SALE. 

With the current state of the game, I highly DO NOT recommend spending 30$ on this piece of garbage game. The update 1.0 that put the game out of Early Access did more harm to the game's balance more than any other previous update. Warden faction is expected to advance while they are a defensive faction. Their weapons are objectively inferior to the Colonial because to an average player (which is the main bulk of this game's pop) Colonial weapons are more intuitive and easier to use. Warden got a lot of gimmicky weapons and tanks, and they aren't even a good gimmick. 

According to the dev's ""The Vision"", Warden is supposed to be a defensive faction with expensive but more superior gears while Colonial is supposed to be an offensive faction with cheap and replaceable gears. This concept sounds good in theory, and I know there are games that successfully implement this concept (Company of Hero 2 for example), but in practice? They failed horribly. A phenomenal disaster that made worse with 1.0 update. Every single supply or building is made by the player themselves. They have to grind their life to fuel the war machine of this game, and it's an astoundingly boring job. I am a logi man, and I hate its core mechanic. I wouldn't mind if it is neuron stimulating or autopilot approve, but no. You have to hold Left Click for X amount of time. THERE IS NO ""TOGGLE LEFT MOUSE HOLD"" OR ""TOGGLE W KEY"" OPTIONS. This may sound like nitpicking, but when the overwhelming majority of the game's logistic and building requires you to hold left click and/or hold W, you would expect these quality of life option to exist, but nope. Have fun holding W for 30 minutes straight sailing from backline to frontline. Hell, it takes forever to pull supply from public stockpile, and the enemy can ruin your base that took 3 hours to build in a matter of minutes via flamethrower or artillery. There is no incentive for players to do any of these works but ""we must help the war effort."" 

When the other faction can out produce you, you are fighting an uphill battle in every way. Don't believe me? Here's some math on two faction's bread and butter tanks, which need a type of rare and scarce resource:
5 crates of Colonial's Mass Production Tanks = 25 Tanks = 1416 refined materials
5 crates of Warden's Silverhand = 15 Tanks = 1626 refined materials
25 crates of Colonial's Mass Production Tanks = 125 Tanks = 7080 refined materials
25 crates of Warden's Silverhand = 75 Tanks = 8130 refined materials

Have I mentioned devs love to put props like tree randomly in the middle of the road? Or the fact that there are so many stone walls that bleed into the road, which can stop your vehicle on the spot? Oh, how about a Snow mechanic that makes your vehicle freeze while the other faction gets Rain, which only makes you carry less things as infantry? Oh, and Warden faction gets a parka but no raincoat, but your enemy get both! Why? Who knows! 

Oh boy balance. This is the most unbalanced state of the game by far. Warden's best infantry weapons are captured Colonial infantry weapons. If you think I'm overstating, check this game's wiki on ""Harpa"" and ""Bomastone"" and you will see a glaring issue. There are a lot of unbalanced stuff going on here, and it is always one sided, until the dev's sledgehammer shift the pendulum, again.

Facility. The worst mechanic introduced to this game. Logistic is already tedious, but facility made it worse. We used to have 3 type of raw resources, but now we have 5 raw resources + 8 new resource type. To summarise Facility, DEVS TRIED TO ADD FACTORIO, BUT THEY TOOK ALL THE FUN AND INTERESTING PART OUT AND LEFT US WITH EVEN MORE GRIND. All of your fun toys are now locked to the facility. Worst part is that you cannot solo building and maintaining a facility without playing this game like it is your 9-5 job with no break or vacation. Even clans on both side detest touching this mechanic, but we have to use it or else we are handicapping ourselves. 

Oh yeah, you cannot store your Upgraded Vehicle, Battle Tank (18hrs to make, and is 3rd most expensive thing) or Super Heavy Tank (48 hours to make, and is 2nd most expensive thing) in your Private Stockpile. Yep. Now you have to park it somewhere and pray that no one steal it (spoiler: they usually succeed). Have fun watching your hard earned vehicles disappeared when you log back on the next day. Every other vehicle in this game you can put it in your private stockpile for safety, but apparently devs are too lazy to code these in.

THERE IS NO ANTI-CHEAT IN THIS GAME, AND NO, VAC IS NOT ENABLED IN GAME. THAT IS A LIE. YOU CAN PUT ANYTHING INTO YOUR MOD FOLDER AND IT WILL GO. DEVS DONT BELIEVE IN PERMA BANNING PEOPLE TOO. AT MAX, YOU WILL HAVE 14 DAYS BAN. THERE ARE MANY CASES OF GRIEFING ACCOUNTS HAVING 10+ VIOLATION LOGS, BUT THEY COME BACK A COUPLE DAYS LATER. THERE IS NO WAY TO VOTE BAN OR KICK THESE CHEATERS ALSO. YOU CAN REPORT THEM, BUT THAT FUNCTION DOES NOTHING. CERTAIN GREEN FACTION'S COALITION HARBOURS MANY CHEATERS IN THEIR CLANS, AND THEY ARE OFFICERS OF THESE CLANS. THEY ENDORSE AND SUPPORT CHEATING. 

Stating the Obvious: Yes, both side cheats, but one side is doing it a lot more and in the open, including major and prominent clans. I mean I don't blame them when there is nothing stopping them. You can shame these people on Reddit all you want, but that won't stop them from continuing their illicit means. Submitting a ticket does nothing. It's an automated response of ""We will look into it.""

My feedback after 6000h ingame >before< xtreme alting happened in WC 100

TLDR
""The idea of the game is revolutionary, said that the game is afflicted of long lasting bugs never fixed and the alt problems (another ""spy/troll"" low effort & low rank account locked to the opposite faction used to scout, grief and steal).
1.0 had boosted the old alt problem to an nearly unbearable level, cause rn now high value 'targets' are all over the place. 'Targets' where player invested 3-8 hours to make them.
- Therefore, while I had a blast, there is no way newcomers will enjoy the game longer than 150h. This could be easily fixed, but this MMO does not have even 1 active ingame moderator or even 1 community manager.""

[h1] The Good [/h1]
The game is for now unique in of massive multiplayers, a lot of mechanics involved through multiple types of gameplay & usefulness to the war. The lack of cosmetics is good, everyone looks the same because nobody is here to boost your own ego with non-necessary good looking.
I like how the game looks too. There is a lore which progress (okay it's a bit inconsistent but it's fine now)  and has an integration ingame in a smart way.
The top down view is refreshing and makes the game a bit more tactical and cinematic.
The constant influx of new content from the devs team.
Logistics, well sort of, having to craft stuff is fun, knowing you can win by cutting the enemy logistics is fun oo.
[h1] The Bad [/h1]
If you don't speak english which is the lingua Franca on foxhole currently you will not appreciate a good part of the massive multiplayer and will cause trouble to your surrounding, i cannot tell how many times i did a mistake and someone in the VC alerted me or how many times i could succesfully explain something i was doing. But if you tell someone he's doing a mistakes and he doesn't understand or have its ingame VC off, it's gonna make you angry and you will think he's a spy.
Performances issues: There is definitvely some.
Censoring: The chat is censored and you cannot opt in or out, it sucks, even stupid words like coom is censored, want to do the welcome to the coom zone meme? Thrust a 68mm into your posterior this is a christian server. And this despite this game being crude on a lot aspects with a mature community.
Th
Growing servers issues: Lag spike(i think it's client side but not sure), rubber banding, ghosts, glitched nukes. not everyday but when it happens it will ruins your day.
[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
Years old unfixed bugs, you can't do a gameing sessions without seing some bugs anywhere.
The maps are great and are overall upgraded overtime (slowy) but there is tons of invisible trees, bushes, bushes that are rocks, rocks that are bushes, flying trees, invisible moutains, moutains you can cross through like it's an illusions, holes where you're stuck until someone end your misery (or if you can use the !unstuck command).
At the current state building is qualifiable of psychological torture with the introduction of fire, game balance problems with productions of maintenance for bases you build.
Communications tools are...lacking, there is a VC, you can put map post (with extremely brief words), there is a chat with multiple tabs, well there is in fact 4 chats. There is 4 supported alphabets, western(english), cyrrilic(russian), korean and chinese. And it cause trouble because personally i would like to have a way to communicate about partisans in my logi map to other people which don't read my alphabet.
Devs communications plummeted to a less-than-bare-minimum, there is no community manager anymore, i don't know the reasons but i can guess the community must have badly treated them. 
The community toxicity is a point you might heard a lot about. First there is the outside of the game, Reddit: do not. Then there is the Foxhole Discord Server which you should be careful because recently a good and well known content creator (mainly doing drawings) got doxxed for reasons? And i read devs talking about how they received death threat on a common basis. That said usually regiments/clans don't have such problems from my experience.
And the ingame toxicity where you get yelled at because you did something wrong, and this part is caused a part by me, i don't know how but the game turned me into a toxic vet. That said, i'm overall not a majority and most of people are nice.
Queues and Queues bugs: Queues are here because you cannot overpopulate the ennemy or because servers have hits their generous limits. It's painfull, sadening sometimes because you can't play where you want and with too much of your friends and fellow regiment members but great... when it works fine. Officialy devs never talked about such things as queue bugs and when asked on reddit, the answer is :there is no queue bugs. But when your side is queued, there is 35 people in it and there is 50 people and not queued in front, you know there is a bug.
Too much content directly: The 1.0 update introduced a huge tons of content, i was really into it, until i tried the dev branch, which lasted 2 weeks (extremely short for this amount of content). Where there was obvious issues that despite the community trying to communicate were left ignored and later on the release costed a lot of potential new players to quit. Devs finally reached out with some hot fixes but it was already a bad giveaway and some people already left. And still to this day, half a year after the release, some major issues pointed by the community have still not being considered by the dev team as a problem. It will be fixed by a way or another, but when? that's the irritating part, maybe some qualities of life improvement will never come or in a year. Maybe devs will throw off foxhole to focus into Anvil. I've seen devs stopping serving a game i loved in the past or just abandoned it unbalanced until the community left and then moved out to new projects. And i feel like with the new game they are about to pre-release, it might be the case. Foxhole is there from 2017, only less than 2K players on average at a time playing it.
Grief: Grief wasn't a much thing until recently when its a good way to break a stalemate. take another account, go into the enemy faction, act as a saboteur. Get caught? banned 2 days it's fine and it's not even your main account. Did not? great you have weakened the enemy, done recon, caused moral trouble to the enemy. 
[h1]What i would wish for the game to be worth its 30‚Ç¨[/h1]
Ensuring one account per personn, at least doing some effort towards it.
I want the return of competitive/Skirmish foxhole and alternative modes other than the only one available.

Less tedious logistical tasks, less soul eating driving, less assembling waiting time, more communication tools.

With a fully playerdriven, collaborative, large scale game like this, you're bound to have a few bad eggs that try to ruin it for the rest of us.  Any measure the devs would implement would likely hurt legitimate players more.

If this game was truly bad, the person leaving a negative review wouldn't require the 3000 hours they put in to realise.

Even though the problems in other reviews are often very exaggerated, it is often just painful to see a lot of your work being wasted, or see situations when you die and which you nor no one from your Regiment is able to explain as someone has some sort of exploit mod installed. Doesn't happen often but happens.

The anti-cheat system is non-existent and just needs to be implemented. Full stop. Even if the cheats do not exist then at least the players should have some confidence that they are not being cheated.

Alts are a problem - I would solve it with making use of the in-level ranks system so that perhaps the new players don't take the more expensive tanks and drive it alone in the middle of the enemy bunker base. E.g.: you need to be OCdt to enter Super Heavy Tank. Or perhaps you need to advance to level X in doing damage to the vehicles to level your way up to mid or late game tanks. I don't know but the number of times I have seen stuff stolen just because a Corporal can't be bothered to walk and then just drives something very expensive in the line of AT launchers is just too much. Is it an alt or a newbie - no clue, but the number of fire trucks disappearing just before major fires is just ridiculous (event though they were parked in the same spots for weeks).

People are cool and helpful. Of course there is some tribalism, but less so than in many other games, and generally speaking you will always find someone to help you out.

I would wait with buying this game until:
1. At least some re-balancing
2. Introduction of anti-cheat system
3. Solution to alts problem

    [*]NO ANTICHEAT. Protection from cheating is so bad that you can basically drop a mod file into your game's folder and (for example) be able to see twice as far as you should. This is mind-boggling in this day and age. That's some 1990's floppy drive game level of bad security.
    [*]NO MODERATION. It's a $30 game so depraved mouth breathers buy the game a second time on an alternate steam account just so they can join the opposing team and grief. Crickets from the devs on this topic as the it seems that they appreciate the extra cashflow. You can report people, but that's only if you can catch them in the act and get enough other people to report them as well. 3/4ths of negative reviews saying they were ""ganged up on"" and mass reported are by these people. The other fourth is regiments (guilds in this game) who mass report people they don't like.

I believe that after exactly 25 months after purchasing the game and almost 3,200 hours played, the time has come to say Enough.This game has eaten its tail. Developers focused on new military equipment and new mechanics, which were probably intended to attract players in practice, however, they became cumbersome and led to the need for even more grind, ignoring the fundamental problems. 
Developers have no ideas on how to solve the fundamental problems with server queues. This is important because the game is divided into about 30-40 contiguous regions, with battles taking place in a maximum of 6-7 of them at the same time. And each region has its own small pool of slots. On the one hand, the developers expect players to cooperate what's more they encourage it during developer streams. However, on the other hand, they do nothing about the problem of overcrowded servers, maintaining an opaque queuing system, priorities, unexpected reduction of server bandwidth, which often leads to a situation where in order to join a region that is at the front, you have to wait even more than an hour at the border. This applies to both ordinary gray soldiers and logisticians who carry the necessary equipment to the front lines, as well as special forces who carry out a massive raid on the enemy's rear, which must move quickly and unexpectedly to avoid detection. So what if the landing barges reach their destination, if the ships with equipment are stuck at the border of the regions waiting for a turn and are intercepted by enemy units while waiting? What about the fact that a coordinated action of 50 or 100 players, which they prepared sometimes for several days, will be deprived of any chance of success. After all, the game instead introduced another type of tank, the production of which will take several man-hours, which in no way can be effectively protected from thieves from their own faction, who very often are actually players of the opposite faction who bought themselves a second account just to sabotage their opponent. I have had enough.

- cross-faction voice chat (for some people it was half the fun)
- fast-paced, decisive combat (with cheaper equipment, people weren't scared to charge into battle with tanks or high-tier weaponry)
- balanced factions & maps (differences were cosmetic)

Since alpha, its been a slow and steady downhill. Even though many new and amazing features were added, previously thought impossible, and at times the game felt like it improved a lot, every iteration ended being an overall downgrade in terms of fun. The larger the game world got and the more features were added, the more time each war sucked out of your life, to the point that unless you are a time millionare don't expect to actually get anything done in foxhole. 

Sure, you can still experience the same amazing moments in foxhole as you could back in the alpha days, as well as many new things that were the result of the recent updates, but these short periods of having actual fun are now so far in between the moments of grind, waiting and general boredom that its hardly worth your time. 

I have this formula to summarize the problem:

Rate of Fun = Total Fun / Time investment

While each update added to how much fun you could have playing foxhole, the time investment required to have said fun has been increasing way much more. This has gotten so bad with the recent updates that many players including myself have had the final straw and decided to quit and also drop a bad review on the way out.

I've been dreaming of the day trains would be added to logistics. Sure you can now drive a trainload of supplies and munitions to the front, if you happen to have a couple days to spare to first mine and build everything needed to drive and supply said train, and that's with a clan, of course. Sure, you can drive epic armored vehicles (flame tanks, multi-turret heavy tanks, landships) into battle, if you have say a week to spare to build up to the point you can produce/upgrade them, and then maybe have a little bit of fun before you lose your tank to something stupid like rng, noobs/alts, or realize that the game is so poorly balanced that most types of armor are total garbage. 

And don't get me started on the faction asymmetry. Unlike in most asymmetric games where thousands of games are played for designers to find right balance between the factions, foxhole's developers test out their ideas for asymmetry precisely 0 times, hoping to simply guess the balance right. Since the developers do not play their game very often and don't really understand how valuable range, hp, damage, cost, speed or ammo capacity is, they have no chance of getting it right. Often I will see imbalanced items where one side has a range advantage or damage while the other has extra speed or ammo capacity (range being the single most important aspect in most situations, being difficult to compensate with any other buff). The end result is that each side has equipment and vehicles where the other side has a flat out better option which makes everyone unhappy. And since the asymmetry currently favors one side towards the endgame, the outcome of each war is decided in advance.

Finally, there is the problem with alt accounts, cheaters and population swings. Foxhole was built on the idea that no one man should be able to single-handedly decide the fate of the war. But with how much grind is required to build certain things, should those certain things fall into the wrong hands weeks worth of effort could be lost. Entire clan facilities go up in flames, or whole regions lost because of the work of one alt. If you are working to sabotage your team you can have a massive impact on the war. Another major problem is, certain times of the day/week will see more players for one faction then the other. This is primarily the result of discordification / twitch effect / national clans resulting in times where it can be extremely unfun to play the game. Players on one side facing massive queues preventing players from joining a front while players on the other side is getting stomped on all fronts by sheer numbers. I'm not sure what's the solution to this problem, but it needs to be addressed somehow.

If I can have one advice for the developers, I would say it would be best to take a step back and re-evaluate everything. The technology behind foxhole is amazing, but the actual game is (now) terrible. I wouldn't mind paying again for foxhole 2.0 with the exact same technology but better design. Maybe a new map and different factions without asymmetry or carefully tested asymmetry (you could easily find many volunteers among the community). Regions could be smaller but built with more care. This would reduce lag, improve combat and make logi less of a grind. Wars could be designed to be shorter too. People need to experience victory more often, not less, and nobody likes waiting weeks to unlock something they really want to build.

Very unique MMO war game that I think some people get way too emotionally invested in because that's what it calls for to ""win"" at times. I don't really see the imbalances some others say are at play here, there is some asymmetry to the factions but from what I can tell there are pretty clear strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited for each side. In my view, it comes down to getting others healthily invested in the results and, if the review bombing is any indication, that's no small feat.

I will say that I think the Logi and Building roles do need some love. I'm not into Factorio or base building games typically but the time it takes to farm resources and get supplies to the frontlines is frankly cripplingly boring. I'm not sure if it's a matter of better understanding the mechanics at play here or needing to coordinate better, but that seems to be a general consensus of the community and something as important as supply lines and town maintenance for a faction need to feel more rewarding than they are in my opinion.",1677340683,1677340683,True,14,1,0.594101846218109131,0,True,False,False

Logistics seems to be the most rewarding. Collecting scrap for the refinery, making resources, using that to make supplies / weapons / ammo, delivering to the front lines by truck / boat. This will get you commendations fast!

However doing general combat or being a medic saving / healing people for hours on the front line you'll be lucky to get a single commendation, as people have to go out their way to click commend on you. 

Would be nice if the developers make improvements; 
- To general controls and make it feel less 'clunky'.
- Improve the shooting mechanics / line of sight camera controls.
- Improve server performance queuing into regions (takes 20+ minutes at peak times to get into regions, then suddenly 'Connection to server timed out'). 
- Please do more to encourage / stop the players who don't seem to want to play as a team in a team orientated war (locking vehicles / stealing vehicles, team killing etc).

At less than 100 hours I'm probably not too qualified to go into specifics. However I think I can speak from an important viewpoint of a relatively new player who also is willing to look at the problem from both sides (player vs. devs).

Community communication and interaction is essential. Both players and devs need to be up front and honest, but also civil and kind. It's clear a lot of the community wants to like the unique game mechanics offered, so it's important to work WITH the devs instead of BLAME them. This is of course means the devs need to work with their community as well, providing many outlets for communication and acknowledging problems which have been vocalized.

I do have a personal complaint regarding the maintenance of buildings/fortifications. If you want players to be excited about playing with complicated bases and logistic systems that are both massive time + team sinks, there has to be a more reliable system to engage with. I love logistics in games, but I just can't get into it in Foxhole. When I think of Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program, Mindustry or many others, those games have great positive feedback loops.

This game is sectioned by wars, as of writing this we are at war 100, wars can last from a week to a month and a half and I joined in at war 74. I joined the side of the Wardens. I enjoyed the prospect of fighting off the invaders at my homeland, hoping to repel the green-men back to where they came from. This was my experience back then, but hearing from my fellow Warden comrades, the Colonial side was favored by the developers; this was something I could not fathom. ""Developers picking a favorite? Yeah makes sense""...... ""The developers cause things in the game to turn the tide for a win on the enemy side?! What?"" Is what I thought when I was informed this by many, many people, and now I come to believe this. Here are examples:

Example 1: In war 100: we captured Ferimor (A key subregion) and maybe an hour after we captured it, the game started to snow (which is a weather effect and can cause negative aspects like frozen vehicles and freezing to death). ""Yay!"" I thought, thinking I can finally have some time to build up a base until the snow subsides, but one issue. The snow was only in the city of Ferimor, and snowing on the side of The Wardens. The snow was NOT ontop of the Colonials which were right outside of Ferimor, causing us to become weakened, and after a few days of battke, we lost Ferimor. Then, a couple MINUTES AFTER Ferimor was recaptured by the Colonials... The snow all of a sudden just stopped.

Example 2:Two weeks after Ferimor was lost, a surge of brand new Russian players entered the game, and due to their lack of experience, inadvertently caused the mass loss of ground for the Warden cause. TO STATE: There is no problem what-so-ever with new players, but the fact that little of them spoke English or even had Voice Chat enabled, made it incredibly hard to teach the do's and dont's. So, we were pushed back to ""The Linn of Mercy"" region, which consistent battle for the important Logistics town ""Ulster Falls"" took place, with Colonials and Wardens alike switching ownership. After Wardens Ulster for quite some time, we were able to unlock the Seaport (unlimited supply of storage) and just a few hours after this building was unlocked, it started to snow just like in Ferimor. The Colonials pushed through and captured Ulster Falls, and again... JUST LIKE THAT... The snow stopped.

Example 3: During the defense of Ferimor, a """"Server reset"" was established, just as we began to heavily fortify Ferimor. It worked as 1.You get disconnected with a message that your spot in the server will be saved | 2.DC happens and you must wait an unallocated amount of time for the ""Reconnect to server"" button to be highlighted | 3. You must wait five REAL minutes after reconnecting in order to play again. The Hexes are all independent servers, and just the Region which Ferimor is located at had this ""issue"" and servers have a max population, so when half of the Wardens (and I also assume Colonials) got disconnected, people from other Regions walked in, and the people whom got forcefully disconnected were unable to hop back in due to mass queue times.

Example 4: The developers update weaponry overtime, and give both sides different variations with different accuracy, damage, and others. The 94.5MM Anti-Tank gun was added to the game. The Wardens received a 94.5MM emplaced, non-movable anti-tank weapon, whereas the Colonials received the same exact caliber, but in a push gun variant which can also hide in plain daylight in the snow. Artillery is also a thing, and the most powerful movable artillery is the 150MM artillery guns which have a set max range. The wardens max range: 300M, the Colonials max range 350M, meaning there is no possible way of counter artillery.

To conclude, there is an obvious favoritism for one side in the game, which i have no problem with. Everyone has a favorite child, but when you intentionally cheat by using developer commands, give one side much better equipment, and play around not IP banning alternate accounts, it shows little to no care for the community. I am not calling for a ""Death to all Colonials"", If anything, I would wish for the makers of the game to allow their ""Persistent War Game"" stay ""Persistent"" instead of playing ArmA 3 Zeus and controlling what happens on the battlefield.

I do not recommend this game for anyone anymore sadly. These developers are not as evil as EA, but they are more crooked, if theres any game I would not STRONGLY advise against, it would be Foxhole.

The devs banned the word fix logi, after community outcry, KFC hides cheating mods and bans people for exposing such cheats. And is not an experienced community manager, only a dude who ran a clan then was chosen by the dev team, what a train wreck. 

Not to mention if your team suffers someone who despawns your resources... or spys... mods wont do anything, fix it yourselfs we are told by kfc. Then ban you when all you want to do is play on the other team for a war.

However near the end of early access these positives became rarer, dev's communicated with us less, problems started to escalate more and more, and our feedback was starting to feel more ignored.

I decided to give the dev's until their full release out of early access before giving my new opinion, because I still had faith that the dev's would eventually return to how great they were in the past.  But the inferno update (1.0 full release) finally arrived and not only were the mass of problems still around, the update broke the game in several different ways.

Issue's that we have had for the longest time have been ignored, and the player base is outright sick of it.  The game is currently plagued with cheaters that buy new accounts just to sabotage the other team by making the public new player experience miserable.  The game is littered with bugs and lacks any form of quality of life while having the most grindy mechanics that don't respect players time in the slightest.

Understand, that as a new player you will more than likely have a great time playing, but it will be all dependant on other players throwing hours and hours of their life away working with the games horrendously grindy mechanics just to give you that experience, while also having to constantly deal with these cheating players who sabotage all of their generousity just to either troll or help their ""real team"" win.

Maybe someday this game will be great again, there is a large amount of potential, but the dev's need to actually start listening to the playerbase again.  We don't want new content, we want the content that exists to not feel like torture.  We want quality of life and ways to protect ourselves from griefing.  And we want the game to not feel like playing 12+ hours a day is a requirement to get anything done.

Until then, give this game some time before joining in, show the dev's that several new players would rather wait at the gate for quality than rush in immediately.  Maybe your restraint to try this game out could be the incentive for the dev's to finally fix the problems the game faces.  We want your experience to be as great as ours was, but we can't promise you'll have that experience if you join now.",1568144791,1676935271,False,2,0,0.502065837383270264,0,True,False,True

The devs have been a little quiet since the inferno release which has been becoming normal in the past years, though I don't mind it as the updates have become increasingly more filled with content, balances, and bug fixes. One thing this community sadly forgets though is that every war is a playtest and we are always bound to encounter some retarded bugs that do eventually get fixed. 

We complained back in 2019 about logistics so they added flatbeds, containers, freighters, and cranes. We continued to complain about logistics and every year they add more shit like changing the GSUPPs and shirts to their own queue in the factory and creating a MPF (Mass Production Factory). Recently they made one of the biggest updates yet by releasing player built facilties which took a load off of logi as it allowed coordinated groups to mass produce ammo, petrol, tank variants and other shite. 

In the update they also added trains which allows us to move insane amounts of resources, tanks, weapons and logistics over long distances with ease. At first there was no way to manage the tracks but once we complained they fixed the entire problem by adding cabooses.

(I'm not saying logistics is perfect but they've done a lot to make it way easier then it was before.)

Fire mechanics got added which was fucking awesome but also incredibly overpowered and annoying to deal with, they rewrote the entire fire mechanics system in a month to balance it out for us.

Foxhole is usually quite fun, you can take up tons of different roles from ferrying logistics to keep the front alive to sneakily  partisanning the enemy logistics to choke their own fronts, the only true big problem is alting which right now the entire community is focused on alerting the devs about so hopefully they will fix it, the devs DO listen to us you just need to be fucking patient.

I'd recommend foxhole, it's fun but do remember that teamwork gets the job done your not gonna be able to supply an entire front or build an entire mega facility by yourself consider joining a regiment or getting some mates to join you and work together :)",1561929915,1676868376,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Current 'biggest' problem is ALTS/GRIEFERS, despite being such a disproportionately small fraction of the community, the impact they have is massive. What they ""DO"" is not nearly as bad as the paranoia that their actions cause down the line. Have I even run into an ALT? I don't honestly know, but I definitely feel like they have affected every front I've fought on for more than an hour.
And that's the true problem with them... There is no acceptance of the enemy doing something cool/interesting/badass anymore. I don't see the enemy using one of our vehicles and wonder ""How long did it take to steal that"", or ""Did they gas our guys out of that earlier?"" No, the first thought is, ""Fething ALTS.""
It wouldn't take me an hour to find someone grumbling about ALTS in local chat. Be it actual alts, or Griefers that love the attention, it really doesn't matter, ALT is the only slur used. You can try to ignore it, but eventually you'll find yourself agreeing that such and such definitely happened because of an ALT.

What might the Developers have to say about this? Well..... SILENCE....

Why don't the players self moderate? With what tools? THERE ARE SCREENSHOTS ON THE REDDIT OF PEOPLE WITH HUNDREDS OF TEMP BANS, who have hopped back on after the slap on the wrist of an hour long ban.

And Self-moderation has other problems as-well. Cyber-bullying is not an uncommon occurrence. ""Big"" streamers treat randoms like absolute garbage, and false report them for not following their egotistical demands. Clans fight over limited faction resources, leading to relatively common Civil Wars.

And yet, this game nearly kept me forever, because it is exciting being the only remaining medic in the midst of a push. Being the one that forces a breakthrough by will and revolver alone. Being the partisan squad running in a Silverhand, shouting 'Death before Dismount' as you duel one of the enemy tanks hunting for you, running out of fuel on the return trip and having to sneak back to your own lines to grab fuel... This game breeds stories like this, ask anyone with more than a few hours, and they will tell you 'About that time that I/We/They----""

The game itself is a bit shaky but generally fun if you're not a min-maxxer or a sweat. And here is the problem.

The community is one of the most vile, toxic, unhinged, unbearable and unpleasant I ever seen. To be honest, there are a lot of memes about League of Legends having a terrible community, but Foxhole's one, phew... It's not literally everyone, I have met players that were absolute joys to cooperate with, very new players friendly, playing effectively yet not being sweats. But they are a minority.
A quarter of the players do not communicate and do not listen (ironic for a game where communication is very important). Another quarter are egoistical and egocentric. They are better than you, you have to follow their orders, and if you disagree with them they will ask their clan to mass report you. Another quarter are just toxic.
Griefing is also an overly present problem. Someone doesn't like your bunker? Fuck you, it'll get blown up. Someone wants to get the machine gun? Here, a bullet to the back of the head so you can drop it. 
Large clans are just like megacorporations. You and your friends made a facility around a field of scrap? Fuck you it should be ours, get mass reported. You need some petrol to refuel your logistic truck? Pfah, you peasant, just refill it with diesel (petrol is high tier fuel, diesel is low tier fuel).
And lastly, people from the other team will get another account on the opposite team with the sole goal of griefing, and that's devastating when a wall mysteriously blows up just before a major assault.

I like the game, it's nice, it can be better but the game itself would have a recommend. However, the community, with strictly no sign of moderation in my 60 hours, is a HUGE turnoff.

However, I cannot recommend this game to people, even on sale, because as much as I want to do things as run an artillery operation for a few hours I cannot ignore the problems present within the game. For starters the devs do not communicate. At all. They might occasionally pop up when excited for a new update but outside of that they are silent and do not listen to the concerns of the community in the slightest, one example of this was the L.O.G.I strike where a large portion of the player base either stopped playing or played different aspects of the game to try and get the devs to introduce quality of life features for logistics players. First off what other game can have a portion of its player base strike in order to get the devs attention! but also the fact that they had to do this is astonishing and shows the devs lack of communication. Especially considering it took multiple wars for the devs to even acknowledge the strikes existence (not aware of the exact time frame but it was around a month from memory). The devs still to this day don't listen or acknowledge the community at all and it shows. There are other concerns from the community such as ALT accounts which can ruin the joy of the game and while I do agree that alt accounts are a big problem I haven't seen any and so am not the person to talk about it.
What I can talk about is their recent update which launched foxhole out of early access. Inferno introduced many exciting features, many of which were absurdly unbalanced but thats a different discussion, the one I want to have is that it basically stopped me and my small friend group from being able to play the game properly. With the recent update the game has introduced facilities and many features are now locked behind them, the problem is that facilities require a huge amount of effort to maintain and effectively locks me and my friends from a massive amount of content. During our last tanking run we noticed a captured mortar tank, My friends immediately went ""that looks fun"" and I began laying down what i would need to make one, I should also say that logistics is so tiresome that in these operations I will do all of the work of making everything and driving it to the front letting them log on just to experience the actual joy of using the tank or whatever, then I realised that this mortar tank which had been in the game for years was now locked behind facilities meaning unless I spent a good amount of time looking around for a public facility that would let me make this tank we couldn't do it. This is applied to many things including things such as rocket artillery and many variants of tanks such as the mortar tank that would have been fun to mess around with.

With recent events in the community and the pushing out of an artist who reminded me of the joy of playing foxhole and helped me get the motivation to organise our operations and just how split and scummy the out of game community can be I have finally decided to post this and stop playing until the devs finally fix their game. I have to say I don't think they will. If you made it to this point congratulations, just know that I will miss this game and the memories it has brought but I cannot bring myself to keep playing this game.

First of all, let's talk about the train. Now, I've ridden some trains in my life, but nothing quite like this one. It's like a party on wheels, with players hopping on and off, shooting at enemies, and just generally causing chaos. But don't get too attached to it, because as soon as the enemy team realizes what's going on, that train is going to be a flaming wreck.

Speaking of flames, let's talk about the flamethrower. This thing is like a giant BBQ on your back, except instead of burgers and hot dogs, you're cooking up enemy soldiers. There's something deeply satisfying about watching your enemies scream and run around while they're on fire, and the flamethrower is the perfect tool for the job.

But let's not forget the real star of the show: the foxhole itself. This game is all about digging in, building up your defenses, and holding out against enemy attacks. And trust me, there's nothing more satisfying than hunkering down in your foxhole and mowing down wave after wave of enemy soldiers.

Overall, Foxhole is a wild and crazy ride that will have you laughing, screaming, and maybe even crying a little bit. But if you're looking for a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat and constantly surprise you, this is definitely one to check out.

2.In-game community interactions. Fairly easy to join a group.
3.Fun and semi realistic moment to moment gameplay.

The Bad-
1.Poor community moderation tools that are open to be abused
2.Little to no developer interactions towards the community on important issues 
3.Poor game balancing decisions from the devs 
4.Overly factionalist community. Dont expect common consensus on many balance talks
5.Requires extremely high amounts of time committed if playing solo
6.Bugs glitches and exploits galore

The Ugly-
1.Mundane tedious and overly grindy mechanics
2.Extremely bad moderation for alts, griefers and hackers by the developers
3.Overly luck based mechanics. RNG is virtually present in all aspects of the game

From logistics to combat, stopping by to transport and build defensive structures to support your faction assets, you can find a lot of different kind of gameplay.

In this game a player is but one cog in the great war machine, for better, or worse.

And after having played for few years, in the current state I can only say it is for worse.
The game albeit interesting in its asymmetric warfare system, suffer great imbalance from one update to another, for one faction to another. It has always been the case so far, but it became an even worse issue when the content added brought so much length to each war and grindiness in the game.

It sorely lacks quality of life tools, and when the grind is so bad, - even worse since the addition in 1.0, the game become painful. Player base tire and population vary so much in a single war due to burnouts that it worsens the imbalance.
Hours and hours of work can literally burn in mere minutes, you won't even get the rewarding feeling that ""it held well even it fell"" because... well no one was there to defend, and the IA defences can't do much against PVE. There is nothing rewarding in that.

Developer do not moderate (or there is so very few things done that it make no difference). There is no anti cheat, no actions against abuse.

Which in itself is another problem entirely; where large clans who are quite full of themselves basically control the entire show, where they can make or break the entire game; from mass reporting targeted users to actively sabotaging the front.

Instead on focusing on reforming the game towards its greatest potential the devs decide to squander their time on another Collie tank and Warden Armoured car.

There's a lot to like about the game, but also a lot to hate.
To a new buyer, I'll lay it out simple:
Playing the game solo is unlikely to be satisfying. The game centers around a persistent war (24/7) where vast imbalances in population per side and per region are actively exploited to overrun one side or the other. You are entirely dependent on what the rest of your team has done in the last few hours, as well as the number of players currently present, to stand a chance.

For someone who doesn't care, or likes being roped into big clan ops or plays with friends: You will catch a lot of flak for playing badly, but many clans are happy to take you in and teach you.

In general, there are a ridiculous amount of weird mechanics and clunky UI actions that nobody can really walk you through. As someone who enjoyed the logistics aspect of the game immensely, there are just too many grindy, buggy, needlessly complex mechanics involved in getting your stuff to the frontline. Scrapping is entirely unrewarding and unrewarded. The existence of seaports and depots is not explained ANYWHERE to new players, despite being the beating heart of backline logistics and bulk manufacturing. This leads to every new player making their own truck and then abandoning it 20 meters from a place where it could be safely stored instead of being stolen by partisans. The seaport UI is confusing, loses track of the container you're filling, the ""anti-griefing"" delays on pulling from public stockpiles serve solely to grief the well-intentioned solo public logi player, seaport 'pad' capacity is griefable, limited and often very stressful for new players accidentally blocking the entire seaport because they can't figure out what to do. Sailing a freighter is quite simple, but the drowning mechanic isn't explained anywhere. Disconnecting when switching regions is a very common occurrence sadly, and combined with the """"""""fun"""""""""" winter mechanics, routinely leads to freighters freezing over at the border (because the driver reconnected at a town 5-10 minutes walk away, the freighter froze over already) with no way to defrost them, losing you up to 15 or 25 tanks, or hundreds of crates of supplies.

The amount of people playing to actively grief the other team is staggering and entirely ignored by the devs. They'd rather you buy the game, play your 2 hours and be unable to refund while all the bases around you decay because someone stole all the supplies and despawned them overnight. They prefer the money made from people buying the game on throwaway accounts to grief.

Many of the combat mechanics are entirely unexplained and unintuitive. The camera is angled-topdown, but aiming for height is nigh impossible. You must shoot the ground in front of a prone player to hit them. A player crouched behind cover can basically never be hit except through random chance. A downed player who was encumbered can halt a pushgun's ability to be moved entirely. Pushguns in general, through their 2-or-more-man crew, require a lot of coordination to use with strangers and are de facto ignored by new players despite their damage output and low cost meta. Clans hoard 100s of tanks for weekend ops/recruitment sprees/unknown reasons, leading to the frontline having 0 armor support through the entire week. Not all of these issues can be solved by the devs, as they are also a result of the social construct of clan/regiment behavior, but the devs are not helping either.

=======================
Post 1.0 Update:
Devs didn't want facilities to feel mandatory to win and wanted to integrate them into the existing logistics and base mechanics.
We're 6 months past 1,0 release and they are still largely separate systems that still largely conflict with each other for maintenance and priority.

Facilities are needed to make all end-game tech, such as (super) battle tanks, Tempest Cannons (train SC) and most of their specialized ammo.

Devs are adding meme vehicles like a grenade version of the worst AC in the game, and a tripod grenade launcher.

Worst of all, the devs do nothing at all about the rampant alting problems. People spend days, weeks building bases, facilities and masses of tanks and a few alt accounts disable defences and grief tanks and facilities in a single night to take multiple hexes and meta concrete bases in a single night.

The devs cashed out after 1.0 and are working on a new game, have a history of horrible Community Management, player interaction and moderation (such as giving a 1 week slap on the wrist to a moderator using his powers to teleport his team to respond to invasions).

Without serious attention this MMO will die to people getting another copy of this 25‚Ç¨ game at $1.62 (Argentinian regional pricing) just to grief with another account.",1638647524,1676602202,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can be a builder who build strong defenses for you team.

They start ignoring balance in the game. A lot of broken weapons need to be balanced right now. We've been waiting 7 months to balance only one weapon HV40, but there are more than 50 balance problems right now, and devs just ignore it!
And in recent time we have alt accounts / griefers problems! People buy accounts (giving devs money) and just ruining game to opposite faction. And what devs do to fix it? They start banning people who report that cheaters!
It was the last straw...
People start making negative reviews on steam, one faction even stop playing and start losing game... And what devs do? They increase respawn timer to winning faction, to stop them winning, to keep people in losing faction in the game. That was pathetic and the last straw for me.

This game has been suffering from severe and glaring issues for years yet the developers refuse to make meaningfull changes, listen to the community (the lifeblood of any, but especially this, online game), or at this point communicate at all.

Some of these issues include:

- Extremely tedious gameplay aspects with ever worsening QOL (Logistics, Building, Facilities)

- Horrible moderation system that does nothing to prevent serious offenses while at the same time penalizing players, who actively contribute to the community (Communications Rating, Report System)

- Locking individual players and at this point even small groups out of a large part, if not most of the games content. A lot of content is so time-consuming and tedious that its not feasible for a single player or even a small group to engage with it.

- Omnipresent and devastating griefing. This problem is intensified by those previously named as a single griefer can destroy something that took days to build or produce within minutes, can cripple entire frontlines by sabotaging bunkers etc. These griefers to not receive permanent bans but are at most banned for a few days. There is no strike system and these players can return as many times as they want, the community has found profiles with several pages of violation logs, yet nothing is done about it. Most are probably not even penalized at all as there is no active human moderation or oversight.

In short:
As a new player you will be locked out of most and especially most of the impactful content.
You will waste hours or days of your time grinding for resources or holding left click to build buildings.
And most likely your work will be destroyed in minutes or crumble to nothingness as you cant keep up with the time and material demand of upkeep.

Overall I can not recommend this game to anyone as long as these issues are not adressed by the developers. 
But hey at least they are now developing a new game which is actually exactly the same as this one but medieval.........

I don't see myself playing this game must into the future as the developers continue to have near non existent communication with the community, a continued back and forth of ""Clan Man"" bad and ""Hey, you need to basically join a regiment to use this or even see it in-game.""  

It continues with an insane grind that isn't terrible if you like a second job, or don't mind hours of work being lost in seconds because of something that was bugged or needed to be fixed. Features that are QoL {Quality of Life}, are far and few, why no sprinkler system to help with fires, a water tank that requires it to be filled or piped from a water source, why no features for regiments, or features for those that wanna play solo. Why no change to the level/commend features to help new players, I can only speak for the few I've seen and spoken to, but those that I have, and including myself see nothing positive about this system. 

The next major update was predicated from context given by the devs that it will focus naval, one of the most useless and untouched parts of the game. Why? Because the map is largely land over water. Transportation via boats however is very useful. Why no new or updated maps? Because the developers said so.. no really because they don't wanna, there is preset lore and all for other maps, and why not use things that have occurred in wars to cause map changes.

The development cycle isn't always terrible, but that's because the three minor updates between the major updates are fixes for the large amount of bugs and issues with the major updates. They also seem to focus heavily on adding vehicles, most of which require you to be in a regiment to even look at, or even be considered to use. 

The game continues to focus on one side of the player base giving near realistic updates, rather then the displayed Iron Harvest style game that we all so hoped for.

It's a war MMO with a focus on logistics - all weapons, ammo, vehicles, artillery, shells, spawns, buildings etc are created by players and brought to the frontlines to be used. Community is mostly great, lots of good vibes. It is an online game, so of course there's some nut jobs here and there.

Can be played solo - 90+% of my time in game has been a solo player. Even better with a couple of mates, as vehicles like tanks need 2-3 players to use effectively. Joining up with other randoms works just fine too.

Wars last around a week to a month, though the current war has been going about 40 days and nerves are fried for all, hence the current saltiness of recent reviews. It's also a pretty close knit community, so drama can get out of hand pretty quick, best to simply ignore it.
Very rarely see cheating or griefing, definitely less than any other online game i've played, but it does exist of course.

Mostly works well, can be slightly buggy here and there. Might lose connection when crossing to different zones for example, but it's (usually) quick and easy to get back in where you were.

Can also be pretty grindy if you let it be - some players do nothing but grind for resources for example and rarely if ever fight. Some players do no logistics at all, and only fight. Play it how you want to play it - if I get worn out fighting and dying in the meat grinder that is the front lines, I might do some logistics for a while or move to a different front, or perhaps sneak behind enemy lines and disrupt their logistics. Lots of things to do, make your own missions.

Worth the price, but watch some videos of it before committing, it's not a game that everyone will enjoy - there's no power fantasy here. Death is fast and brutal, which makes teamwork essential and victory sweet.",1676564740,1676564740,True,2,0,0.509424924850463867,0,True,False,False

It's a wonderful example of the glory and beauty of hundreds of people playing towards victory. It's riddled with griefers and alts who are capable of undoing the work that took you several days in less than a few minutes.

It has a level of complexity in warfare that can only be matched by factorio-like games (Yes, that's right, it's a factory game disguised as a war game). Yet all of that gameplay is accessed by less than half the playerbse, probably less than a third of the playerbase if I'm quite honest.

It's a slick and complex top-down shooter. And at the same time the devs seem to add new toys without rhyme or reason, while nerfing in a seemingly haphazard and careless way.

It's glorious and horrifying all at once, which I suppose is a philosophical statement about war in general. And I cannot go far enough in recommending you steer clear of this thing.

+great fights on the frontline
+running a tank crew/line with your bros is great fun

-making guns and ammo is boooring and seems to be designed to burn people out
-moving said guns and ammo takes ages due to arbitrarily long wait times to 'pull' items from storage (especially if it's on a public storage)

and that's just basic logistics.

the whole game used to just be basic logistics and that's somewhat managable in bitesize pieces.
however the 1.0 update completely ruined this loop by shoving in a factorio 'minigame'  except they forgot the automation part.  everything is manual. 

want anything but a basic vehicle? 
build a whole base by gathering materials and driving them tot he buildsite then spend literal hours holding leftmousebutton to build (or use windows clicklock if you don't like carpel tunnel)
gather materials and wait for the basic materials to craft
then manually move them to another building and wait for the advanced material to craft
then manually move them to another building and drive in the vehicle that you also had to farm and craft to modify it.
wait some more
finally you have a drivable vehicle.

and you just wasted 1-2 hours not doing anything fun.


and that's not even talking about alt, griefers and the toxicity that the players will throw at you to make the whole process even more frustrating.

I used to have so much fun playing this game that I played it almost like a job, I logged on and had good times with buddies and it was good. You could carry dozens of magazines of ammo and run around behind enemy lines and just annihilate them, the vehicles were fun, the balance while not perfect was good enough. The playerbase and the devs combined their efforts and fucking ruined this shit. It started with the tech system and all these stupid hidden mechanics in the background made by the devs and then a whole bunch of literal transsexuals began to monopolize the tech, it was not so bad but it was more than annoying when they chose actual garbage because of a vote (because the military will vote on things right guys?) This on its own was not the end of the world. however on top of this all you would see is people spamming the word cum (thank God they censored this, but it took over a year of bleeding players for the devs to finally do something about this. Which is a reoccurring issue with them) This and other disgusting speech was (and still is) prevalent throughout the playerbase, especially on the warden side. However i could live with these things a little bit, as I could go with a couple friends and bang out logi and tanks and everything pretty simply and have a good time blowing things up on the front. Then 1.0 came out and the devs spit in the face of solo players entirely, they changed the tech system, the production system for most things, and made everything about building 10x worse. Building in this game was tedious at best before this update and now its a downright slog. If you are a solo or small group player you can go fuck yourself in this game. You want to get a tank? Cant just go to a garage and smack one together with public or self farmed materials, you now have to go to a production facility that is player built. There are the occasional public ones but good luck actually producing anything there. The rest are all clan owned, clannies are the scum of the earth. I logged in more recently and first thing I did was grab a motorcycle that was sitting in the middle of one of these facilities, within 30 seconds some little pissant clannie comes out and starts trying to teamkill me, then I defend myself and drive off with the bike. Not 5 minutes later I am getting DM'd about being an alt account although I have 400 hours in the game. The levels of paranoia and greed among clannies is second to none. They monopolize all the resources and want you to slave away to grind out weapons and vehicles for them, if you resist or take even a little from them they will dogpile you and will literally mass report you until you arent able to play the game anymore. This happens if you do nearly anything to upset them. Streamers who play this game do the same shit and can alone summon a swarm of mouthbreathers to get you off the game for, get this, building a bridge or trench they dislike. These problems are rampant and the devs do nothing to solve them, and on top of this make it worse by making the game unplayable unless you're a clannies slave.

You can Join a squad or a clan and organize attacks upon player built fortifications against players in real time. The game has a great experience the horrors of the front-line or the deadly raids on player managed logistics. Entire player made factories can churn out death and destruction that can bring your side to victory.""  This is the quote that brought me to the game and has kept me in the game playing. I find the very concept of the game incredibly novel and even with a confusing learning curve, incredibly engaging. Knowing that every tank we lose or kill will set us or the enemy back potential hours or days of material collection really brings the effects of a front-line soldier or a truck driver into scale. 

That being said, this game does have it issues. At the time of writing this there is a review bomb that has been loosely organized through reddit going on. I personally disagree with the actions being taken by the players here, but there is a point to it.
There has been several longstanding issues with the game primarily with the bugs and the griefing. It is important to note that has been a couple ""Forever wars"" here in the past few months, Wars usually last a week or two but this current one is approaching two months. This war has been plagued by a massive amount of Alt accounts and if you dont know, ""alting"" is a form of griefing by having a second account to destroy supplies, teamkill, or otherwise be a hinderance to the opposing side. Siege Camp has been silent on the issue and the punishments in place do little to discourage it. It has been incredibly demoralizing for all players. 
The Bugs have been a different issue entirely, its not uncommon to run into a minor bug, ""ghostly soldier just walking across no man's land"" is my favorite and is a harmless bug. There are however much more harmful bugs in play. The late game nuke missiles require a massive amount of planning, and a dedicated spotter on the ground to guild the nuke into position. Normally when the spotter dies all targeting of the nuke is lost, unless it bugs and continues to target the nuke. This is major issue that hasn't been addressed for almost 20 wars. Many players are tired of the unfixed bugs and the lack of any meaningful attempts to address the griefing.  

I feel that i must recommend the game though in spite of it's flaws, even though the game can be very hard to learn, it feel so satisfying to figure out. If im pounding my head against a wall of lead on the frontlines i can go mine salvage on the backlines to vent my frustrations while still trying to assist in the fight. You dont get that experience in any other game.

My last note is to the review bombers: I get your point, but this entire ""cancel the game!"" mentality will not benefit this game. Your actions here speak volumes on why players get the impression that the community is a toxic heap. Shame on you.",1666056833,1676508053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The game is riddled with glitch and bugs as well as frequent server crash, especially during heated frontline combat.
- EXTREMELY unoptimized, reaching 60+ FPS is almost impossible
- Not Optimized for 2k or above resolution, everything become too small to read
- Small Monitor got their view range much smaller than big screen and not compensated whatsoever
- There's no tutorial, the Island of which you spawn has VERY outdated stuff in it. Including barbed wires that you are required to get through prone.
- Most firearm in the game works on Hit scan, not bullet travel, and really dependent on latency if you are firing on moving target.
- Big caliber gun that is used on tanks are Hitscan with 100% accuracy that you can snipe infantry with it
- Technology Asymetry that break balance on every aspect of the game. Geometry, weather, tanks, firearm, artilery, etc. 
- 1 FACTION is being forced to stick with Bolt action rifle at the start of the war that is obsolete as soon as next new gun is unlocked.
- while the other one has Semi auto rifle that stay relevant until the end of the war and it's 1 of 2 cheapest rifle in the game
- That faction with bolt action rifle also start with Weaker, more expensive, logistically harder, less range starter grenade,
- A Group of role Playing soldier has been banned for... roleplaying, while we have cheater, saboteur alt accounts, and toxic mouthy manchild on the loose, every day, every war, with no consequences
- The community of reddit and discord are colored by 1 toxic faction. downvoting and reporting anything other faction says in mass. Just check reddit and see whose faction Talks the most, probably the one with biggest ego
- The game devs has nerfed 1 of the faction so badly that it's currently on the 5th loss
- The Player driven economy and logistic has been severely strained extremely thin before the implementation of facility, now we have no manpower to properly supply the front because that portion of manpower has been busy maintaining facility to stay running. every single frontline depot are always empty.
- The Griefing by enemy faction using alternative account are so bad that putting your tank in public depot will have 25% chance to be given to the enemy for free by griefer. Both faction are trying to dismissed this as clueless new player. Arseheads
- The vast majority of vehicle, previously easily made in garage are now facility Bltch now, you have to ask Clans/regiments to make it for you after you pay them with resources
- Some clans also like to hoard rare resources in the game that it got so bad that it turn into mini civil war. several regiments vs several regiments
- Reporting player with ticket does nothing, so far, NO ALT, CHEATHER, GRIEFER has been banned permanently. even IF they are, the game is very cheap when discounted. and devs never ban using IP. after all, they are ALL paying customer

3) You wanna join the frontline when there's a good fight? You wanna bring some logi to that frontline? Please wait in a queue for 1 hour or until your mates run dry on logi.

4) Updates? Well, something goes wrong each update. Either something gets nerfed in a bad way or something not well thought out gets introduced. 

5) Wanna build and not fight? Well, this will be a bad version of any strategy game for you! Wanna place that bunker piece here?

But I just can't recommend it. It's not in a good state right now. There are bad actors acting in bad faith, sabotaging their own team. There are systems that encourage hoarding of resources, that divide the team into factions instead of uniting them against a common foe.

This is an INTENSE & peaceful game. Players mine, refine, craft, transport, use and build nearly everything and a lot of nuance to game mechanics that otherwise aren't very obvious.

Pros:
In-depth game mechanics
Great in-game community
Constant updates
Logistically focused
Solid Combat
Continuous Improvements
Best value for your money you'll ever spend on Steam
Players get locked to a single faction per War (which can last 30+ days)
Developers honestly love this game

Cons:
Server stability can be wonky (often)
Reddit is filled with..... *passionate* players.
Game is niche, so high turnover of players.
Game is niche, friends you bring in can and will leave game quickly
Game is experiencing (at least a perceived) an increased rate of griefing, bug exploits and 'alts' (players that purchase two accounts instead of one to cheat on one side). This causing a high rate of player attrition and review bombing with a hope to get developer attention of issues.

Foxhole still reinforces an unfun and boring central gameplay loop which relies on increasingly tedious and involved logistics and supply management. I dislike the fact that only large/organized clans even have the ability to put in the time and effort necessary to maintain fragile facilities which allow for the construction of BT's and SHT's (the two largest tank types in game).

The DEVs are allowing ALTS as a 'pay to win' feature that makes normal play difficult and sometimes impossible. The commanding councils of each faction have went full stockholm about this, endorsing it as a feature of the game. They could easily use machine learning to detect and permanently ban such accounts if they had proper understanding of their self interest.

Another thing is the lack of auto translate in the chat, and no ability to select text to translate it ourselves. They allow names in any alphabet, making it hard to report griefers etc.

The game is ridiculously disrespectful of the player's time when doing logistics. They don't allow you do click and go away while 2000 materials are loaded super slowly, no. They insist on having you babysit every 30 materials and click manually: it is insulting and driving enough people away to slowly kill the game.

Their unwillingness to deal with any of the issues has caused a shrinking player base, merging all servers into one. The game still has significant lag issues in spite of all this. Also they allow game sales from hostile nations, resulting in an influx of players who have no consideration for English.

It's a game that could have been great but has been stunted in its potential by the very people who created it.

I cannot recommend anyone buy this game right now in its current state and have to assume their next game will suffer the same issue's. This game has changed dramatically over the few years ive owned it. On the surface these changes always seemed positive and in the right direction. For instance 1.0 introduced trains and facilities partially to address the LOGI strike that happened and as a QOL improvment to gameplay loops in Logi and production. What was learned quickly was a half backed system that more than doubled the workload in these loops as effectively you needed to to both now. Not an either or. ""Dev vision"" has become  meme in the community to the point where many of us joke that this game is solely created as a psychological experiment testing peoples breaking limits. This game has NO moderators, appears to have no anti cheat, and the only two report mechanics are atrocious and appear to result in no permanent fixes. The report to dev's system is entirely external, and warns you in advance you will never hear anything further regarding your complaint. The internal system is an easily exploitable system where a small group of people can soft ban you without cause, reason, justification, proof etc. All these players have to do is click a button saying reported and you get first weapons locked, and then booted from server from some time (never longer than a few days in extreme cases). 

Ultimately this leads to the swarm of down voting clearly going on. Every war sees the odd cheater / hacker / alt / griefer abusing the game and ruining it for everyone. past examples have been limited to a single account or two and have likely had little impact on the greater war. This ""WAR 100"" has seen coordinated strikes across multiple maps to a level never seen before. Previous examples have been someone ""alting"" a single tank or singularly strategic thing. In one instance alone this war, a clan (with proof) caught someone who eventually drove over 50 end game tanks into the water moments before a full scale invasion, leaving the defenders without a chance to fair play. I've very actively played over the past 1.5 years and the trend from the dev's is clear they simply do not care about their community. I've personally seen the communicate less and less, and continue to push out ""fixes"" no one asks for or worse yet, bastardised versions of that which the community is screaming for.

The game is definitely a unique experience, but its potential is tainted by half-baked mechanics and awful decisions from the devs. If you don‚Äôt want to read the full review just keep in mind that I‚Äôm not recommending this game because of its serious alting problem, the devs‚Äô incompetence in communicating with their playerbase and addressing issues that have plagued the game for years, and the mixed bag gameplay.

[h1]Alts, griefers, moderation[/h1]
The biggest reason why people are currently leaving negative reviews is due to the game‚Äôs horrible alt issues. Some of the alt/grief tactics include dumping supplies in the ocean, mass TKing, giving tanks and supplies to the opposite faction, etc. Unfortunately, alting is so stupidly easy and poorly enforced that it‚Äôs still a thing after all these years. This leads to paranoid vets who would suspect or harass any player below OCDT of alting just because of their low ranks, regardless if they‚Äôre just new players learning the game or actual alts ([url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1JPT19fYA]Cough cough BadManLarry[/url]). The devs do nothing about it and that brings us to today where people have had it.

They also don‚Äôt enforce their code of conduct, like at all. There‚Äôs no in-game moderation and the forums thread talking about the code of conduct was made fun of so much that they locked it last year.

[h1]Devs[/h1]
Now you might think, why not contact the developers? Surely they‚Äôll listen, right? Well, here‚Äôs the thing about Siege Camp: there is no communication with the player base whatsoever. The only ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù you have from them is that one guy on the forums who locks a necroed thread after leaving a copy pasted reply or sometimes locks a thread without saying anything. They don‚Äôt participate in any argument, they don‚Äôt explain what they can, can‚Äôt, will and won‚Äôt do. You just have to wait until the next update and hope that it won‚Äôt just feature new tanks to play with.

The only way to make the devs listen to your issues is if you scream on top of the roof of every single platform, mainly Reddit, Discord and Steam, enough times until they finally listen. I mean for christ‚Äôs sake, it required a full-fledged logi strike to make Siege Camp add basic QoL features for logistics that not only should have been in the game in the first place, but they barely scratched the surface of what the people who arranged the strike have demanded. I‚Äôm sorry, but if you have to whine like a five year old on the forums or start a god damn strike in order to have your issues [b]at least addressed[/b], then you definitely fucked up the formula for transparency.

This lack of communications will bleed through the next points I‚Äôll make down below. Why? Because the problems I‚Äôll mention have been there since the dawn of time!

[h1]Bugs and half-baked gameplay[/h1]
I haven‚Äôt encountered a lot of bugs lately, but a few have burned into my mind. First, you have the climbing that only works half the time. Sometimes I had to mash the space bar just to vault over a bunker right in front of me. Made even worse when you try to climb through rocks where the collisions are all over the place. Second, the rock collisions are garbage. They‚Äôre hard to climb through and you sometimes get stuck until you spam space bar and find the one pixel where the character can vault over. Third, getting ‚Äúarea obstructed‚Äù while digging trenches and bunkers even through there‚Äôs literally nothing in the way. Good way to have your defenses poorly designed because the game itself gets in the way. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824661520

Then you have the QoL features that are either missing or half-assed, such as not being able to change stance while cooking a grenade or reloading, not being able to check your inventory while inside a vehicle, not being able to shoot from the window while on a passenger seat, not being able to pull or store supplies in a vehicle because some idiot decided to squad lock an empty logi truck, wasting your mag completely when you reload even if you only fired one round, not being able to climb out the trench while carrying a wounded (You can‚Äôt even put him on the edge and climb up, you have to abandon him if there are no medics around), having vehicles freeze completely during a snowstorm, AKA can‚Äôt be used at all without wasting basic materials and gasoline to build a campfire next to it, after leaving it for only five minutes (This also includes mobile artillery, which makes no fucking sense), setting up queues for regions in a way that population on one side doesn‚Äôt surpass the other side by more than five players (easily exploited by griefers who afk in spawn so that logis can‚Äôt enter the region), etc.

[h1]The Combat[/h1]
Oh god, the combat. As a main infantry like me, the gunplay is some of the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. Let me sit you through why that is.

When you aim, you have a crosshair as big as your character. The accuracy is completely RNG, so you need to hold still for the crosshair to shrink, AKA make your bullets more likely to hit. If you turn only slightly, the crosshair gets big again and you need to wait another five years to shrink it.

Seems fine. After all, not everyone‚Äôs a navy seal, so it‚Äôs realistic, right? Well no, because the RNG is inconsistent. The biggest issue is that the crosshair‚Äôs size is not distance-based, which means you still have a chance to miss someone at point blank. SMGs are especially affected by this as the RNG can sometimes lead you to spray someone at point blank and miss every single shot, and then get killed in one hit by the guy‚Äôs bolt action. Sometimes I‚Äôm able to quick draw someone far away despite the wide crosshair and other times I miss every single shot against someone right in front of me. This is infuriating because you can always get screwed over by the shitty RNG no matter how good your strategy is. Because of this awful RNG based gunplay, you have shadow dancers, which are players who cheese the mechanic by zig-zagging through no man‚Äôs land and then quick shot three guys with a bolt action rifle if their RNG is good. Sure, it‚Äôs effective‚Ä¶ At breaking immersion!

And the cover system? Incredibly artificial. If the enemy is inside the trench, it‚Äôs impossible to hit him unless you get really close to the edge of the trench and shoot him from above, because your character locks his aim on the ground next to the trench. This applies to any cover. Cover=impossible to hit. Elevation sometimes doesn‚Äôt even matter. Oh, and don‚Äôt get me started on bushes, which make you invisible and impossible to hit without someone charging you with a bayonet or spamming grenades at you.

[h1]God damn grind[/h1]
If there‚Äôs something the game likes to do, it‚Äôs to waste your time. Wait in queue before entering a region, which can range from 30 minutes to an hour (That‚Äôs right, do nothing on the bare bone home island for a fucking hour). Sometimes wait a full minute to respawn because steamrolling the enemy too quickly would hurt their feelings. Wait 5 minutes to dig one trench line. Wait 20 minutes to cook scraps and components in the refinery. Build a base for 4 hours because no one else is doing it, only to have it leveled overnight either from decay, a clan op or a couple of idiots with satchel charges.

The grind is so bad that a lot of people refer to Foxhole as a second job. And what‚Äôs the incentive into doing all this? Uuuuh, you can get commends from other players in order to get promoted, even though the rank system is functionally useless.

- The devs do not listen at all to any community feedback, nor say whatever they're planning/doing

- The servers often lag for no reason (even when there's not even 10 people connected)

- The servers often (on a daily basis) restart with a.. 30 seconds notice. And you'll be disconnected for at least 5 minutes. In a few (but rare) cases, the servers totally crashed, the previous occurence of a crash was 3 weeks ago, when the servers were offline for many hours. Sometimes during a server crash/restart (the server restarts are controlled by the devs) the servers will have a ""rollback"" leading you to lose the stuffs you had previously crafted/farmed

- The community is quite toxic - not only a few isolated elements, toxic in wide proportions, with people actively griefing people/teams, insulting, etc..

- The clan is formed around clans, and there's a lot of issues with clans widely known for stealing/teamkilling/griefing

- There's no moderation (a moderation team existed before, consisting of players elected by the devs to act as moderators, but they massively abused their commands in order to help their favoured faction / to grief the opposite faction ; at least one of the moderators is also quite famous for having used hacks)

- The new content devs add (always out of nowhere, when nobody asked for it, which will always worsen a gameplay already bad) is systematically unbalanced and buggy, and needs a few patches to be fixed. Mostly because, despite being tested by players on a public testing server, the devs don't read the feedbacks nor the bug reports nor any ticket filled by the players

- Many people use hacking softwares in the game, as this game do not have any anti-cheat (afaik, the most common hack is to remove the ""fog of war"" which limits a player' vision by night time - this hack is called ""nightvision"" among the community)

- Many people who are actively playing in a faction will create an ""alternative account"" (basically create another steam account and buy the game with it) in the opposite faction in order to grief it (usually, it ranges from stealing tanks to dumping vehicles into the rivers - as dumping a vehicle into a river/sea will destroy it - with some of them placing vehicles in front of automated defenses to prevent them from firing). The devs have never adressed anything against this behavior, as more alternative accounts means more money

- Many of the game features (especially the building aspect of the game) require a constant grinding - if you ever want to build something, you'll have to log in everyday to supply it with a resource you'll have to farm and craft in order to prevent your buildings from disappearing

- The devs don't care at all about anything listed above, as each of these issues have been around for at least two years with no response from the devs",1621123866,1676478425,False,2,0,0.530583202838897705,0,True,False,False

i haven't had much experience with vehicle combat but it seems pretty brain-dead easy point and click and hope the shot pens. from the outsider perspective you see a tank line move up, take one shot, move back to the starting point. now repeat this for hours with them retreating further back during night times to avoid ambushes. also back and side shots from AT and tank rounds can still bounce which is beyond annoying 

Indirect fire is a bit harder with the spotter needing to account for the wind direction and strength and from there adjusting after some test rounds. in this current war the wind has been against my team the majority of the time, so we lose so much range on our tools.

building and upkeep is tedious and is a great way to burn yourself out but dont worry the enemy will set their alarm for 4am so its low pop and afk pve all your work down much like being offline raided in rust

farming materials consists of you using a macro to hold down mouse1 so you don't get carpal tunnel as the devs refuse to add the function 
they added facilities recently and to me looks pretty complicated and reminds me of mid game factorio which might be okay for some but again is tarnished by the high cost of upkeep

my knowledge of sea logi is outdated but my 4 attempts at doing it has caused me to disconnect and lose my boat which holds 5 containers each, each one hold 60 crates of items. let that sink in how much gear that is lost due server issues

you know that tank you farmed so hard for, well if you go offline don't expect it to be there as team mates, enemies or alt's will steal it

racism and hate speech is really only met with temp muting and not perma bans or perma mutes

want to climb up a rock well good luck you have now fallen out of the map or trapped into free fall requiring you to die or just quit, if you do however manage to climb something theres a good chance you'll be bounced around the terrain like its pinball

server performance suffers if there's to many buildings around causing you to lag unbearably when you go around those parts which could be un-avoidable due it being a logi hub
If there''s too many people fighting then the server hampster dies and folks warp around, you rubber band  

if one side is overpopulated they will be smacked with 50second respawn times and the other side is around 10seconds unless they die quickly, because of this population problem people cant enter maps which means no logi support, no heavy weapons like tanks or arty


all in all while there have been moments I've had fun the sheer amount of glaring issues with this game really out weighs the positives and the devs need a kick in the ass and i have no hope for their next game",1675501182,1676469359,False,7,0,0.549310982227325439,0,True,False,False

Game is fun and addictive but I can't recommend it in it's current state.

Review is written from a Warden only player;

The main positives are the community and the feeling of immersion in a persistent world game;
- Community is brilliant, provided you are a team player.
- Welcoming towards new players
- When things come together it is rewarding.
- Game play is vast enough to accommodate a lot of interests.

Why i cannot recommend it right now (understandably it is early access);
- Logistics is unrewarding (but essential).
- Fighting / shooting can be buggy and feel cheap at times.
- You need hours to properly set anything up (this is less relevant to those who can reliably spend 5+ hours a day on the game.)
- Community moderation is non transparant meaning issues are never really addressed.
- Game moderation is almost non existant unless you are friends with a moderator - even then repeat offenders are never penalised. Case in point - you could spend 24 real life hours on something just have a ""alt"" who will buy the game just to sabotage your team come along and blow up / toss your inventory into the ocean. Despite providing proof, there has been no action from the devs or community management to stop this - the issue has become worse in the 2 years since my previous review. 

Final Note:

Great game - i have enjoyed playing it but in its current state i would tell new players to avoid. The  devs and moderation seemingly have no ambition to support it - its essentially an EA cash grab, that despite being an MMO type game they have no intention to support it in a meaningful way post patch 1.0. This even includes communicating there plans going forward - you will get fun out of it, but unless the devs step up and combat the griefing and make logistics more tolerable, you may have a dead game in a year meaning your money is wasted.",1579623501,1676468102,False,9,0,0.515943169593811035,0,True,False,False

I have never enjoyed a game as much as Foxhole in my 20+ years of gaming history, no wonder I put 3k hours into it in less than 2 years (~125 days). The idea behind the game is just wonderful, you can do whatever you want: everything you do has an impact on the outcome of the war, including scrapping, logistics, building, fighting, partisaning and maintaining.

Let me share my 3k hours experience with you:
-However the amount of joy coming from these activities are not equally provided: builders get zero acknowledgements whereas if you transport some goods to a frontline with full pop, you can just easily climb the rank ladder, no matter whether your resources were useful or not. Ranks don't give any advantages of course. Have you ever tried rebuilding a frontline that moved? Well, good luck mammoning the tier 2 trenches with a total of 66 mammons for a single trench completely dehusked, filling in craters alone, or simply destroying unwanted/badly placed friendly structures to get weapon restricted every 20 minutes.

- Alts (secondary accounts) are a serious problem indeed. Other games issue hardware bans, here they get a couple of hours timeout and can continue their behaviour the same as before, probably unnoticed. They drive free tanks, loaded freighters and trucks to the enemy or sink them, destroy friendly structures (like bridges or generator rooms for Storm Cannons) or modify garrison modifications so it stops teching overnight. They get access to regiment stockpiles and dump them into water, enemy hands or release them to public. You may ask why public goods are bad? Pulling from public takes years compared to private stockpiles, so good luck pulling thousands of crates. (Basically alts are partisans, but you can't really catch and punish them..)

- Mid/Frontline resource fields become useless over time. It is completely a waste of time to gather resources in the midline and to transport them to backline refineries even with the help of trains.

- Factories were hyped so much when they came out that everyone started building facilities, which eventually decayed in 2-5 days since the lack of maintenance and high Garrison Supply consumption. So many resources and time wasted on facilities even as of today.

- In the beginning, I spent countless hours of trying to understand some of the game logics by reading the unofficial Foxhole wiki, maintained by some volunteers. The game lacks of ingame instructions for new players. There is a training field in the home region, but for example how to claim a border base is not explained AT ALL, which should be compulsory... I could mention dozens of others like the above mentioned.

- Nevertheless, the main issue is the balance of the game. Developers promised to keep the game assymmetric which in theory sounds a good idea, but very hard to maintain to avoid being one technology/side OP then balancing (= completely nerfing) so the other faction gets the advantage.
- Although the technology tree got a final shape by the War 100 so it is much easier to follow and understand (no tech skip anymore, no tech choices in a single tier anymore, Iron and Alu requirements were cut off by a 0 digit, and proto vehicle kits can now be built with bmats and repairable with hammer unlike many wars before when proto tanks cost rmat and could be repaired only in garages and not by hammer). Unfortunately most new players don't even know what alu and iron/copper are used for because of the lack of instructions. Especially with the facility update, you can't directly build/MPF (Mass Produce) all types of tanks.
- It is extremely hard to stream Foxhole because of streamsnipers and intel-leak. When 1.0 came out, 8 out of 10 supported streamers were on Colonial side, even nowadays it is still more preferred than the Warden side. Simps and followers and even other faction's alts would go to say hi/kill the streamer for 1 minute fame.
- Every region has a counterpart in this assymmetric world, which are very often unbalanced. Some parts of the map should be reworked. Normal North vs South layout, Wardens start with Loggerhead with 3 bridges to be attacked from, while its counterpart Fort Duncan can be attacked only from 1 bridge. Lockheed can be captured from south with 1 single tank because with the rapid decay zone, you literally can't build any defenses south of the TH, compared to its counterpart Mercy's Wish which can be defended from all sides. Also, there is the bulwark (the huge wall) in the south with only a few gaps (usually covered with AI/ghouses) to cross that makes very hard for partisans from north side to cross. In the north, there is nothing stopping you to cross to any of the northern hexagons. Camp Omicron and Anchor Beach are also in my top5 list to be reworked due to their closeness to the border/rapid decay zone.
- Satchels (Alligator Charge) in lategame just ruin the game. You get 1 person with a Heavy Machine Gun to suppress rifle/MG garrisons while the other destroys in less than 5 mins the structures that were built/teched by hard work of lots of people in the past couple of real time days.
- And one of the most crucial problem of the game: the population. People lose interest over time, structures are not planned to upkeep for 40+ days (like War 100), nightcap can't be QRF-ed (especially satchel charges overnight), etc. This map is not designed for 1200 players at low-peak hours for sure, but 2000 players on a typical weekday is not enough either. It affects both the winning and the losing side as well: obviously it is always demoralizing to be on the losing/defending side, but the long queues (30-40 players with 1 hour+ queue) on the winning side are a pain as well.
- Finally of course lots of bugs, glitches, server lags, etc. are on my list.

[b]The game in its current state is not recommended: devs aren't listening to player feedback and always favorize only one faction. I lost interest, I don't enjoy playing it anymore as much as I have done in the last 2 years. Ah yeah, devs want to release Anvil, the Foxhole copy in medieval times so probably the playerbase from Foxhole will shift to Anvil eventually. Don't support these devs![/b]

It beats you senseless yet you come back every time for the highs. But this dogwater game and dogwater devs dont respect me, nor my time, nor anyone else in this community, so I'll give them the same.


-Alts and cheaters have been an ""old problem"" even when I joined back in 2019. They did nothing to fix the issue to this day, even tho we told them a million times. Good luck reporting them.

-Balance has been broken ever since the asymmetry update. They clearly dont know how to balance units, just throw one overpowered vehicle to one faction, then the other when they complain on discord or reddit(LTD+AP mortarHT, 3x more costly HE rocket vs ISG, broken sniper meta etc.) - just bring back symmetry already. Not to mention adding vehicles that are downright useless and only there to bloat the vehicle lineup, but never get used. Also the devs practically told us on discord that they dont give a damn about suggestions, they will select the ones they personally like, not the ones that are needed.

-Laggy servers, frequent disconnects. Complained about this back in early 2020 when there were only around 300 to 500 players here. They did nothing, now its even worse. Shitty performance all round. Not to mention the game breaking bugs and bugs in general that have been in the game for ages. Bad code is not an excuse for lack of action. 

-Its so grindy you might just mistake it for War Thunder. Good luck spending 6 hours mining and refining resources, building the vehicle, the ammo, getting crew if you want to do tank combat. Then flip a coin and either do marginally good or die in the first minute, because driver Bobby drove onto a mine and you got ganged by the enemy. If you get killed by a clan because you try to take away a parked vehicle, now you understand why.

-Infantry combat is dead. Good luck getting even close with all the arty, the grenade spam, machine guns and launchers around. Also I hope you like trenches, because you gonna spend a lot of time in those. I hate trenches....

-Good luck finding out what stats your guns have, since the wiki is outdated and you have to datamine the game to find out anything about your equipment. Not to mention that dev team is not transparent, they dont communicate and sometimes outright shadow update the game without any mention in the logs.

-Moderation is clearly biased. Point out a problem they dont like and you might just get banned or muted on forums. Also if you have the connection, you can get away with a lot more things.

-Devs keep telling us that they dont want to push us into clans, but in reality you either have to be in a clan or find really good players in order to do most of the things in the game. Previously you could hop in and do infantry, arty, and even logi alone, but today infantry combat is dead, arty needs at least 3 people to do any damage and bigger logi hubs need more people to make sure the damn site does not decay and die. Dont even talk about tank combat.

-Dont even mention logi, if you like getting carpal tunnel while mining or like driving trucks for hours, you gonna love this. Also I hope you like waiting, those mats will be cooking in the refinery for a while. Hope you dont get partizaned while going to the front! Enjoy your stay in Yugoslavia.

-I'm not the building type, but if you are, you're shit out of luck. Some buildings are just too weak to be worth it to build. If you want to build a bunker complex, I pity you. You'll have to ask people to vote for the upgrades and essential stuff like AT and arty bunkers take irl days to get.

-Cross faction mic is gone. Why?

Thats the end of my rambling, I might just edit this if something else comes to my mind to add.
I dont care if you are a Collie, a Warden or take no sides or someone new who did not get this game yet, this game does not respect you, the devs dont care, so you should not too unless they change stuff. I highly doubt that tho, since 1.0 came out, they already announced their new game in the works, so I wont be surprised if they just abandoned this game and move on.

Clunky design of UI and actions; 
No QOL updates for all matters in game especially Logi but also: maintenance, building;
Power creeping: some vehicles have become so powerful that frontline building is almost obsolete and truly a waste of time;
Half assed implementation of mechanics: like the train update that was supposed to make our lives easier and ended up with people wasting tens of hours repairing train tracks(now fixed, but not entirely);
Performance issues: the game is bloated beyond repair;
Cheating;

Single player games have nothing on the high of socially interacting upon the battlefield with your friends to win a month long fight over digital space, i've spent hours in the wee morning discussing philosophy with blokes while manning a post, digging trenches, or moving supplies back and forth moving the industry along, i've joined clans for logistical movements and streamers zerg rush clans to support pushes on the fringes of fronts only to have the logi be useless in the end or the territory gained be lost in the ensuing hours because everybody eventually had to log off to sleep.

Its a great game, but the communications are ever failing; Voice Chat errors that prevent you from speaking or being heard happen without announcement and are only revealed when you go into options.
There used to be Inter Team Communication; you would be able to talk locally to your enemies as you could to any of your teammates, mocking them or sweet talking them into not throwing a grenade into your trench... This is replaced by text only excused that the network couldn't handle it when in actuality it was probably because you could abuse enemy players or get them into trouble with their government (BingChilling). While I did abuse this system (I blew into my mic when near enemy players to annoy them into trying to hunt me down) its no excuse when we have auto recording devices to account for any law breaking that may occur between people playing video games on the internet.

Here comes the last bit of criticism that brought me to writing a review upon request by my friends who have been enjoying this game for months if not years; Cheating!

Cheating in some cultures is perfectly permissible against others if they leave themselves open; sitting invisible in a bush while enemy soldiers pass by inorder to murder their medics, standing atop a cliff where the enemy cannot easily get at you or even aim at you has been an age old method of securing some particular fronts (Jade Cove has a stupidly defensible cliff north of it for the wardens to hold off colonial attacks), creating terribly indefensible trenches infront of your bunker base that your opponent will have to hop over several times in awkward manners only to be gunned down by your automated machine-gun bunkers is terribly time consuming to deal with or must leave that area ignored as you seek another front to push.

This is unsportsmanlike like behaviour that can hold the enemy off the area long enough for them to quit the fight in exhaustion or bring material up to deal with; bush tactics can be countered by putting Watch Towers that act as stationary UAVs to let those with the equipment know about them & also is given for a second upon accessing spawn points so it doesn't allow for a long hold off point, Cliffs can be mortared with shrapnel shells as there is no cover atop those forsaken crags and then captured in the night to turn the high ground against your enemy, stifling trenches can be destroyed the same as any defenses by utilizing explosives to wear them down as the most frontline trenches cannot be effectively repaired without exposing engineers to great danger and risk losing all their supplies.

And here's the rub with people cheating using Alt Accounts; Every tactic can be countered, motorized anti tank guns are near on defenseless against infantry with an anti structure explosive, the most robust and perfectly placed bunkerbase can be wiped out by dedicated artillery crews manning entrenched guns replacing their counter batteried crews via nearby dedicated garrison base, bridge battles are over when a location behind them is conquered leaving the dedicated defenses facing the wrong direction.

A person on your team driving a flatbed with 60 stacks of basic materials into the ocean is uncounterable and unnoticed, A person on your team upgrading your bunker base with weakening spots (a tier one trench added and destroyed removes the entire structure) or making generator rooms which lower the integrity of the entire structure is uncounterable, A person waiting behind the front with a vehicle and coordinating with the opposite team to rush his vehicle forward and trap an allied tank into being destroyed is uncounterable.
All uncounterable options are banworthy, but so what. You win, your team gets the upperhand and demoralizes the enemy team while morally supporting your own team.

Rust has this problem, they solve it by Banning The Entire Clan related to the activity thus moralizing those people who have been wronged in a uncounterable manner. We don't get any such satisfaction in this game.
What can be done; vote with your reviews, hold them against the developers, they are public servants accountable to their player base.

And unlike in real life where nothing good happens for the people; if this ends up ruining the game the developers who failed their player base get to hang the shame of it around their necks to whatever job they go to next.

What I didn't enjoy is that all people do is complain and shit talk.  Losing is always someone else's fault.  Must be logi, must be builders, must be dev bias or balance, must be population, must be their side is just terrible.  Anything ofc other than them being outplayed.  And first sign of any minor defeat and people start leaving a side. Which then snowballs into more losses which makes more people leave.  The side who wins each war is normally just the side who happened to lose a big battle or territory first.  Then they just give up and take their ball and go home like the shallow quitters they are and blame everything else for the loss.  But if you're winning those people are suddenly all online again and you're winning because of THEM.

The Reddit is toxic and even in game is pretty toxic alot of times.  I really liked the game at first.  Game itself is great.  But the longer I played the more I hated the community until finally after nearly 550 hours of playing both sides I stopped.  Now I have 550 hours, I got my monies worth no doubt.  Again the game is good.  But ultimately all the game represents for me now is sadness and a bitter aftertaste.  And for that reason I don't recommend it.  It's prolly worth every penny, but from where I sit right now after having left the game it sure doesn't feel like it.  It just feels like another example of ""People are why we can't have nice things"".

And the biggest irony is.  The people who complain loudest about the other side being imbalanced are usually the ones winning the wars.  That's how fucked this community is.  They'll win 4 wars in a row and then claim to be underpowered.  Beware the balance complaints in other reviews.

This game sits in a vacuum of a unique idea and unrivaled execution. I have yet to find a game that compares in cooperation with players. But the devs are killing this game. They do not care about the community, they don't care to fix the small things, they make the players feel that they don't care about the players time. Needlessly adding timers and barriers to progression instead of balancing weapons or vehicles. Not to mention building, you basically have to work a 2nd job to produce the supplies just to maintain your creation. The game lacks any form of moderation except for the people that upset the devs enough to get their attention, not the cheaters or people who blatantly exploit bugs. Keep an eye on this game it could go places if the devs cared to fix it. But for now save yourself.

The concept is very unique and whilst niche, fills that niche perfectly. The art style is superb, top down view is really enjoyable even coming from someone who's always used to playing FPS's, the teamwork and comradery is nearly unmatched with some wonderful players in both factions but in its current state I wouldn't recommend it for people who aren't already deadset on buying it. As many other reviews have addressed, alting (the process of bypassing the faction lock by purchasing another account and then using that to destroy the opposing faction internally) has become a rampant problem and there is little to suggest any actual dev response to it. Spending thousands of collective hours to build a tank, base, operation setup ect can be very rewarding when it gets pulled off but its increasingly more common to find alts go and purposefully destroy all that prep in the span of 1 hour with no repercussion. Toxicity also exists typically with people who have sunk so many hours into the game that they feel entitled to do anything however this is at least personally less of something I have encountered. Most it comes down to a few individuals or clans which do everything from mass report friendlies for now following specific orders to exploiting. Then you have the balance which at the current point in time is very lackluster with some egregious cases of guns or vehicles being leagues better or far more effective to winning wars than others which results in a serious faction inbalance problem that will become more noticeable as one plays the game. Whilst this will always be a point of contention as very few people can see past their own faction and thus never acknowledging the problem, it never the less exists and has only seemed to get worse in recent updates. This isn't helped by the fact that dev communication on the topic is almost nonexistent and so people have just become really demotivated to do much. Bugs also plague many parts of the game from minor but annoying ones such as getting stuck in flat terrain for no reason to server desync resulting in you being thrown far off the road whilst driving or game disconnecting losing an entire days worth of work in a moment with the worst being the many nuke (an end game weapon that can change the tide of a war) bugs with some being stupidly simple exploits to others being completely overpowered bugs that people can literally just accidentally trigger by playing the game allowing for the course of a war to be changed simply by a lack of polish on one of the most game changing features present. As I am not the most proficient in logistics I will not comment on the state of that but many others have highlighted complaints with it that need to be addressed as logistics is the core backbone of the game with everything deriving from that working.

In the end foxhole is a great game with many potentials from people who want to do nothing but make goods and ship them around to frontline to artillery crew, firefighters, medics, tank commanders, train drivers, builders, snipers, grenadiers and the list goes on but despite all of its unique and compelling attributes, the current negative state of the game has overshadowed them making it a lot harder to enjoy the fun parts of the game without having to curse all the bugs, exploits, balancing issues and lack of communication that come with it really taking away from what is at its core a beautiful one of a kind experience.

If you are interested in the game I still highly suggest consuming some of the content and media around it like the jade cove documentary or content creators like I Saw a Bear.

A friend of mine put it best saying: ""The devs do not communicate with the community, nor try to police it or cooperate with the community trying to police itself. Reporting people for transphobia, homophobia or outright Nazism is met with the devs ignoring the ticket, or responding to it and then not punishing the offender."" Toxicity has been a problem that has been growing in foxhole for a long time, and the developers have pushed the game in a direction that it doesn't really feel immersive or fun anymore to just be a soldier in this massive MMO war. When I first played, things were less static and it felt like as an individual you could make a difference. Less so by just lone wolfing it as a solo player but by just working together as a whole, without the need for clan level organization for every single thing. Now any front I go to is going to be either a bridge battle or a slugging match between bunker bases. If you want good fun fights with urban combat or in open terrain like is fitting and immersive for the era and vibe foxhole goes for, you have to basically luck out and be on at the right time.

Not all of this is stuff that is able to be completely fixed. Not every moment you log into foxhole is gonna be a fun battle, toxcitiy is never going to be completely gone, and of course there is going to be a need for clans and their more organized nature in many aspects of the game. But frankly now it feels like the game can't really even be enjoyed all that well without a clan, without running into nazis and transphobes, and without having to slog first through likely weeks of static unfun fighting.

This game qualifies as severe self-harm, because everything from communicating with most of the community, to playing the game itself is grind that punishes you severely for not logging on for even an hour, hence the atrocious player retention the game has.

The devs do not communicate with the community, nor try to police it or cooperate with the community trying to police itself. Reporting people for transphobia, homophobia or outright Nazism is met with the devs ignoring the ticket, or responding to it and then not punishing the offender.

The devs' vision constitutes of forcing all the players to follow how they envision things to work, while refusing to accept how the players decide to play it and change their vision to accomodate the playerbase. Whether it be refusing to reduce the map size to accomodate the dwindling population of the game at points, refusing to give us the old map layout for a war to enjoy it, doing nothing but adding new content without fixing the broken or severely flawed content already in the game, or getting rid of the old special events (or making them very rare), be it relic wars or Dead Harvest (the Halloween event with mechs).

The lack of moderation, or easy fixes to prevent griefing, such as the addition of logs that have been requested by the community for years, are ignored, because it means the devs might have to do stuff, or pay actual moderators to moderate their game. That has allowed the game to be filled with griefers and alts.

The devs have also all but moved on to their next game, which is as, if not more, grindy than Foxhole currently is.

I have, in the past, run a ""Military Academy,"" where I organized with other vets to create videos, guides and the like in multiple languages for new and returning players alike. I have a lot of long lasting and deep connections to players on/in both factions.

Foxhole is a game unlike any other. It's a game that one can easily sink hundreds, if not thousands of hours into. There is a thriving community online of players and ""retired"" veterans alike who still communicate with one another about the game.

Years ago when I started playing, if you'd have asked me if I enjoyed the game, I'd have given a resounding yes. This game is everything a war gamer could ever want, and more, for the first 20 hours. Then you start to understand some of the issues affecting the game, and for the first little while... It's fine. You learn to love the jank. You learn to work around the issues and play the game for what it is.

However, a couple years back, for various reasons (some of which I find justified, others which I do not,) the developers [b] outright and explicitly stopped communicating with the community[/b], they dropped their community manager, and now only communicate on exceedingly rare occasions and through the foxhole official discord, despite having their own website and their own subreddit where communication would be much more visible and effective.

This has led to a downward spiral of community toxicity. I don't think it's right, but I understand where it has come from. The lack of communication and in game moderation from the developers has lead to the players becoming increasingly factionalized and aggressive to those in their own faction they perceive as griefing and people of the other faction at large over perceived developer bias affecting game play. (IE, a buff to one faction is never properly explained, leading people to make snide comments about dev pet factions, etc, rather than the devs getting ahead of the buff/nerf with data and explaining the WHY)

Another issue this has lead to is a feeling that the developers are out of touch with the reality of their own game. They continue to make the systems around logistics and building increasingly difficult, complex and time consuming. A single person can no longer effectively do anything they want. While this does encourage team play, it also encourages factionalism, tribalism within each faction, and hardcore resource hoarding and toxicity. The devs are creating systems that no-one asked for, while neglecting quality of life updates that the community has been begging for over [b]literal years[/b]

Foxhole as it currently stands today is still a fundamentally functional game. However, over the years certain systems have built up to the point that they have become miserable and unfun to interact with. Logistics and building have become increasingly complex, well beyond anything anyone in the community ever really asked for. The solo player is relegated to frontline combat or [b]hoping[/b] that they can find a squad or clan or group participating in the activity they would like to do, otherwise they will find themselves ineffective.

You can absolutely still have fun in this game, and I still often do, but I have long since stopped recommending the game to friends as I genuinely believe the game is no longer worth the time and energy one needs to invest to find that fun.",1676164933,1676413747,False,7,1,0.511161923408508301,1,True,False,False

I paid a lot less than $30 for it and feel like I've ripped off the developers with how much time I've spent on it. I've no clue how they aren't bankrupt, because most games of this format are subscription services for a reason.

HOWEVER, I can't in my right mind recommend this game to any of my friends, because while the concept is unique, 85% of the game-play is holding W or LMB.

Back in 2018, you could hop on, grab a tank or some artillery shells, and be on the front line in 15 minutes. If there were no tanks, you did about 15 minutes of work, and came back 12-24 hours later to collect your tank, and be on the front line in 15 minutes. If there were no artillery shells, you could make artillery shells for about 30 minutes, and be on the front line in another 15. Logistics was a factor, but it was an interesting and unique step no other game had.

Fast forward to 2023, and none of that is even remotely possible. There are very few additional steps, but timers upon timers. You want a tank? Wait 6 hours for a component node to re-spawn, mine for a couple hours, not get enough because there's not actually enough to go around, repeat, refine the components for another 2-3 hours, build the tank, and then after spending another 30-40 minutes loading and getting the equipment you need, you spend another 30 driving to the front line where you're likely to get one or two shot killed by someone who spent more time slaving away than you did.

I can't lie to you and say that there isn't plenty of good fun to be had. Once you get over all of that logistics the combat can be fairly enjoyable. But unless you're willing to commit 6-8 hours a day on this game with at least 3 other people over the course of a month, all you're going to be is fodder for the people who are.

I would stay away from this one until the fun toys are actually accessible. As is, it fosters an incredibly toxic environment where players compete with their own team more than the enemy. Some because they want to win that badly and feel the need to control everything, others because they want the big toys and don't want to share. Without a friend group big enough to compete with 15-20 people for resources, you're never going to get anywhere near half the content in this game.",1562088517,1676413715,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thus, I have decided against recommending Foxhole at this time.",1676406846,1676406846,False,11,0,0.541922688484191895,0,True,False,False

1. Facilities are not a solo player item, you can try to solo it but you need to spend upwards of 5 hours a day just on the facility, keeping it fueled, protecting it, resupplying it.

2. some Regiments are toxic as all get out, they will curse you out for not targeting what they want, they'll kill or try to ban you for building defenses on the front lines. but don't worry they'll just claim a entire town as theirs and then claim all the resource nods nearby killing anyone that dare try to grab some Components or god help you scrap. but dont worry they are using those resources to make a Storm Cannon they will never use once, or a Super Heavy Tank they lose after 30 minutes

3. You need Gsups for everything, and you will find a full Queue in every factory so good luck on trying to keep a Bunker Base or Encampment or Border base, or any base defended

4. the Devs dont care about Alts or cheaters, they used to, they used to ban accounts for the entire war if caught. what happened to that?

5. Devs don't listen to feedback, there is a channel in their Discord for player feedback and their is some great stuff in there but the devs don't care, they'll let logi die before giving us anything.

6. Logi is pain, and evil, you need a facility to make a lot of things. don't have a facility? tough luck. dont have 12 hours to do logi a day? you have a life and work? how dare you! the last logi strike did nothing. we got what a few commends?? what else?? cause all i can see is a whole lot of nothing!

Don't spend money on this game, Don't follow in my footsteps, only buy this game on discount and when every issue thats been stated by others and me are fixed.",1676405466,1676405466,False,13,1,0.576770484447479248,0,True,False,False

1. Maps ( Fix player glitching, smooth out gaps people fall in, Tanks stuck in Crater Blueprints, no they should not. Shrink the Massive Mountains, Minimize Waste of Huge Open Water). On Land areas make multiple choke points why 1 or 2  with Gap for 1 vehicle? Think BIG guys. Refine beaches especially near Bridges.

2. Cheating Problem (Alts, Griefers and Single man Satchel rush is unrealistic) How to fix it? Create Rank Based Access to everything, Behavior Based Access, Regiment Based Access. A Private (PVT) and (Brig) should not be allowed to do the same nor a (Capt) Right?.

3. No Army ENGINEERS - No Excavators? No Minesweepers? No Bulldozers? No Trailers to transport vehicles except train and ship? A TIP Google oshkosh defense for those ! Imagine LOGI having to Drive up 2 Armored Cars for example to front on a Trailer, yes I would. That's the whole Point LOGI.

4. NAVY - Too much open water waste of space please avoid, Expand Focus on Rivers to force Naval Combat and transport in each HEX. Water edge map is filled with too much junk eye candy.

5. Removable Rubble in Towns - Allow players to remove the Rubble and option to Rebuild Towns that are damaged by war. Just use Bulldozer to remove, use CV to Rebuild it. You cant build much due RUBBLE every 3 blocks each direction. Just make it removable with Buldozer if the dev team is lazy to fix the map.

5.5 Overcrowded exits. The Relic Base building should be  upgradable with a CV not just stale broken burning forever. The overcrowded exits are a problem. Make entrances on all 4 sides of building and an upstairs to jump out of windows. Use that upgade with CV.

6. Loitering Vehicles - All vehicles left unmanned after 1 game days, should auto despawn to nearest Storage. If its Marked Regiment it will go to regiment Marked for reuse, if not reclaimed in 10 days it will be public.

7. Stealing/Greifing Vehicles Mats/Buildings- Block CROSS FACTION Stealing of Vehicles Warden vs Collonial the game is turning into GTA and Minecraft for 12 year olds and the likes with Attention or OCD unchecked Disorders.

8. Much Needed Building Expansion - ADD MORE GARAGES,  they are too few, make 1 per HEX. Driving 20 minutes to loose a tank in 20 seconds is stupid. Then ON TOP OF THAT drive 20 minutes back to rapair. No thanks (FAIL)

9. ADD Mobile Repair Player Built Vehicle - A Tip, Look up oshkoshdefense for Inspiration or google search TREVA 15. ( TACTICAL RECOVERY AND EVACUATION VEHICLE).  Allow Field Vehicle repairs but Triple the Cost and fuel. Should be Manned by two.

10. ADD Mechanic / ENGINEER Clothes- Lowers the Material Cost to repair anything Increase the Repair Speed by 50% to use the Mobile Repair Future Function.

11. Allow Area Team VOIP. 

12. ADD Visual Damage ticker for vehicles and Human Body while in combat somewhere in corner along with the Name of the TANK or Person. Example Vehicles Spatha % damage, Gunner Name ( percent health) Driver (percent health) Ammo (count). This process of pressing keyboards of Q, E, then Shift to Seat, in and out, lock unlock is very stupid.

The idea of a constant war where everything is harvested by players, produced by players, built by players, and ultimately destroyed by players is amazing. No other game I've played manages to pull off what Foxhole can with its scale and dynamics, and all praise it receives is well earned.

All I have said is what I recognise as a relatively new player, and unfortunately I don't think this would be the case if it weren't for having a great deal of assistance whilst learning, and whilst I continue to learn. I was lucky enough to have an experienced friend who ensured my experience was as good as it could be. From what I've both seen and heard from other new player however, a persistent problem is the labelling of newer players as alts, ruining their experience.

Another part of the problem is the lack of an effective way to deal with said alts when they appear. I feel these are part of the same problem, with experienced players too quick to label anyone acting differently as an alt or a griefer due to the abundance and repeat offences of alt accounts.

I enjoy this game, more so with every hour I spend playing it. The community is one of the most dedicated I've come across and there's a genuine sense of comradery from both teams. I love it and recommend it, my only fear being the current dilemma may not be healthy for its longevity.

I can always hop on foxhole knowing that if I want a simple hour of fun I can go to a front and play infantry, or if I want to get into the weeds of more complex strategy than I can rely on my clan to provide fun and engaging operations, one of many clans present within each foxhole faction.

Main problems:

1: Basically no in game moderation, people will say slurs in world chat or admit to buying a alternative account to sabotage the other team. And they wont be banned. Most they can get is a slap on the rest from the rest of the players.

2: Little to no communication between the devs and the community as a whole, we get dev streams very occasionally but those mostly just show of shiny new toys, not fixes to issues players actually want.

3; Bugs, theres not many of them but they happen very often and have existed in the game unfixed for a long time. Stuff like voice chat for whole regions or specific players stopping. Very important weapons of mass destruction like nukes being very buggy, etc, etc.

4: Massive balance issues, there are many things in this game where one side simply has something the other doesnt that is insanely useful. Along with this many vehicles and weapons are simply worthless, the ares, the stockade, snipers, all outlaw variants, shotguns, etc, etc. All of this of course contributes to my next point.

5: Toxicity, the community has a lot of toxicity in it, largely because of the game itself. Balance issues, many game mechanics like facilities being for no reason incredibly annoying and draining, alting causing distrust among players, the insane amounts of time and energy needed to maintain defenses and facilities. Which take easily hours to make the stuff to maintain them. If you get invested into this game it demands that you treat it like a part time job.

6: Servers are often unstable, with entire servers going down out of nowhere, as well as lots of lag.

TLDR: I love this game, but please dont get yourself invested in it.

I wish I can give it a positive review, but until then my review will remain negative until the developers are willing to address some core issues that the game has had, which have been exacerbated in the past few weeks in light of the new updates and War 100.

Much of the game is essentially locked behind hundreds of man-hours. Unless you are part of a regiment or have the charisma to convince dozens of friends to play with you to build facilities and bunkers, there are some things you will never accomplish as a solo player. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, with cooperation being a centerpiece of the game, the grind of maintaining the facilities and resources needed to access much of the features that are usually locked away is about roughly the same as getting a second job.

Additionally, the developers have complete radio silence over the issue of alts and griefers in the game. Although an in-game report system exists to report griefers and alts who destroy hundreds of hours worth of work and progress, at most they receive a slap on the wrist with a three-day ban, before they're back to cause untold amounts of damage with it. There are serial offenders who've been banned dozens of times, yet they continue to destroy resources and sabotage the game. The developers have not given a single statement about any of this, regardless as to how bad it is for the health of the game.

If you are interested in supporting a month long effort to defeat an enemy team across a huge map then this is the game for you. Large group battles where it takes a team effort to win. Plenty of roles to fill and things to do. 

The major issues are a distant developer team, Queues to get into front line battles during most days, Tedious building and harvesting mechanics. This game WILL eat your time and life if you let it, especially if you try to play solo.

However, This game is fantastic and creates great experiences. More Info Below: 8/10

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Front-line gameplay gives you the opportunity to use a large variety of tools to fight or disrupt the enemy team. Use a rifle to kill opponents, Machine guns to kill and suppress enemy defenses, Mortars/Tanks/Artillery to destroy enemy fortifications. Play as a medic to heal your allies, Recon and build watchtowers for map awareness. There is so much, and that's just the surface level. Hopefully you can get in before a Queue hits during peak time!

If you don't want to do that then join mid or back lines to supply the war effort. Build fortifications or vehicles. Harvest resources that a player will need to transport to the factories to produce equipment which in turn, needs to be transported to the front.But, Most of the actual ""work"" here is driving with WASD and left-clicking.

Be aware, This game attracts very hardcore players who take things way to seriously. Team-killing and verbal abuse can be an issue. But these experiences are few and far between. On the flip side, these hardcore players are a major part of the war effort and can be so kind as to offer free powerful vehicles and invite you to their ""Operations"" with all their provided gear. 

If you are more casual then there are still plenty of things to do. Spawn in to a region and shoot some enemy for a bit, quick harvests in the back. try to sneak around enemy front-lines to stop their harvests/transportation. Be prepared to usually spend ATLEAST hour to start and finish something.

All in all, great game with some limitations. You cant find an experience like this anywhere else. Buy it already.",1676340297,1676340297,True,3,1,0.519614875316619873,0,True,False,False

It got a grab on me that i put about 300 hours in 2 months.

You can be anything: 
from the base of the Logistic (scraping resources, refining basic materials), 
to advanced logistic (refining rare materials, building vehicles and supplies for special ops) 
or saciate your bloodlust on the frontlines (fight for ground and the tug of war with any weapon or tool avaiable).

INCREDIBLE for any player to make a team effort and plan massive ops, to the random joe picking a gun and runing to the sound of bullets and explosions on the distance.....

BUT (A MASSIVE ONE)

They changed a great deal of the crafting (most of the fun stuff now needs incredible amount of time and resources to be able to achieve)
ALTs (player with a secondary account on the oposing enemy team to spot weaknesses on the defence grid, stealing anything from resources and vehicles to blocking essential paths.)
They took out the voice chat with the enemy team because their servers suck (massive map, but segmented because the server suck, and cant handle too many players, or too many buildings, or just dies because whatever)

The biggest elephant in the room is alting, where players buy another copy of the game to grief and steal the opposing faction that their main account is on, this has been a problem on both teams for such a long time that there has been a major detriment and contributes a level of paranoia that any new or low rank player could be someone on one of these alt accounts. This has caused a negative experience to those who are in the crosshairs of being accused of an alt and is more than likely to stop playing due to this experience. Cheating is also an issue as you could be walking in the middle of the night and be shot right out of nowhere with pinpoint accuracy, you can see in the store page it says ""Valve Anti-Cheat enabled"" but that is just a joke there is no such thing and cheaters can just go without a care in the world.

The second problem that has arose in the past couple of years is game balancing and testing, this has been brought up into the spotlight ever since the developers went away from symmetrical equipment for both sides and instead went down an asymmetrical tech tree for both factions with each vehicle and equipment having their pros and cons in using them. The developers have done such poor job in working out a balance for these equipment, often to one side curb stomping the other until they either release a hot-fix to balance equipment or wait out 1-2 months for their next update. 

The last and final problem that I have with this game is the developer communication between the playerbase, they have live streams to help showcase [spoiler] THE VISION [/spoiler] for a major update that they have been working on. These updates usually try to remedy a problem for a certain team or certain aspect in the game that in the end either causes more problems or is just poorly designed. The facilities that been added in the newest update gave new depth to logistics but at the cost of more time investment, this game can be extremely grindy especially into building/maintaining these new facilities or bunker bases. 

This game that I have played for the past couple of years are some of the most fun I had in a video game and the experiences that can't be achievable in any other game. Foxhole is an absolute gem when I first started playing but since then it slowly start going into a downwards spiral, the community at its best is one of the best communities out there, but factionalism and paranoia of cheating/alting has already left its mark on this community and the mishandling of this game has not helped it since.",1676337390,1676337390,False,6,1,0.508471667766571045,0,True,False,False

The game has also become extremely grindy, and while I respect the lack of a ""pay to win"" model, not everyone can spend 12+ hours per day in game to experience all that the game has to offer. Building literally takes days of effort, and the more recent addition of facilities is even worse. When you consider that all of this effort can be ruined by a bored griefer on the internet in a few minutes you can see why the community is burnt out and fed up. The game needs a huge overhaul in terms of moderation, quality of life for players, and communication from Siege Camp to overcome the current hurdles.

It is a top-down shooter set in a technological era that seems to be between World Wars one and two. Victory is achieved for one of the two factions when they earn 32 victory points spread out across the many hexes of the map. The technology between the two factions is asymmetric and there are pros and cons for selecting each faction.

What‚Äôs good about this game?
Your gameplay experience will vary depending on where you want to devote your time. Will you be a frontline soldier, selling your life repeatedly to gain an inch of ground, or to throw back invaders? Will you spend hours alone in the enemy backline with a wrench, causing as much havoc as you can by destroying enemy vehicles and robbing them of their resources, cutting enemy supply routes and harassing other players in the resource fields as a partisan? Will you devote your time to learning the intricacies of fortification and bunker building to preserve the backline or reinforce newly-gained enemy territory as an engineer? These tasks can all be extremely rewarding and leave you with a sense of accomplishment depending on your individual tastes. There‚Äôs something for everyone in this game. Various levels of gameplay are available to help make sure there‚Äôs a place for just about every kind of play style you‚Äôd want to partake in.

What‚Äôs bad about this game?
Ultimately, the cons of this game derive from moderation being abandoned by the developer as they hide behind the excuse of this game being ‚ÄúCommunity Driven‚Äù. Being reported by a certain amount of people, regardless of the truth of the accusation, will result in a ban. Any time you make a comment in the World, Intel, or Logistics chats your comment can be down-voted. The result of continued down-votes from other players is a ban from these faction-wide chats. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that with the age of this game, veteran players have essentially become a collected group of separate cliques that can muscle their clan-mates into exploiting this mechanic to silence and remove players who don‚Äôt like the way you play the game. That private stockpile you‚Äôve built up to run to the front line? Gone since the timer on it will expire before your automatic ban is lifted. Want to coordinate with different fronts to see what vehicles or weapons would help them the most? Well that‚Äôs unfortunate, because yesterday you got into an argument with a prominent member of a large regiment and they‚Äôve decided you don‚Äôt get to speak anymore.

There is no better example of this than the players who actively police the technology progression system. Using game mechanics to vote for or drum up support for technology in game is vilified if you‚Äôre not voting for the technology that‚Äôs been agreed upon in a Discord group. This merry band of self-important narcissists (Self-proclaimed ‚ÄúTech Maids‚Äù) routinely abuse these moderation mechanics to silence people who express discontent with their technology hoarding. 

If you get this game, avoid confrontations with members of large regiments. Use the materials you earn through your work for your benefit. Do not say anything about any of the materials you've collected, and use the technology materials you earn through mining resources to vote for the technology you want as an individual. Install OBS and record chat history so you can prove you've not violated terms of conduct if you receive a communications ban. 

This is coming from someone who's spent their entire time in the Warden faction. If the Colonial experience differs, please share.

**EDIT**
I've tried the Colonial faction and I have found the QM to be a lot less insufferable than the TM.
I would recommend playing this game if you choose the Colonial faction regularly.

1.0 Update: 
Still the same BS, don't bother trying.


As of 2/23:

Man, is this game awful.


So since the 1.0 Update, the game's gone even farther downhill. The addition of the Facilities that they added has led to a new reason for people to use alternate accounts to grief the rival faction. The vast majority of tanks and vehicles are locked behind using facilities in order to produce, as well as someone producing the materials to make the upgrade. These materials also require facility structures in order to produce. 

Well since that's the case, if people grief facilities then they can prevent the faction's vehicle from being produced. Destroying defenses with friendly fire so they can get into facilities with tanks, taking the vehicles out with one account and giving it to their main account in the other faction, blocking defenses using vehicles so they can just waltz into a facility and wrench your vehicles you worked hard to produce, it's all just a massive CF. 

The BEST part about it though is the developer response.... Or lack of one, I guess you'd say. 

You can do all of this with literally no penalty as long as you get out of the region before people report you. Even if you DO get reported and banned, it will be for a maximum of three days before you can just come back and do it again. 

Y'all, I cannot stress enough that you SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME. Some people are going to keep playing. If you see their reviews change and state that these issues have been fixed, then come and play. If not, steer VERY FAR AWAY from it. Anything you produce can literally just be pulled from storage depots or from your parking lots and dumped into a lake. All your time and effort gone, and no effort from developers whatsoever

Nowadays the game is a second job, full of grindy mechanics that don't allow for you to access half of the games content, bugs that break the immersion, a queue mechanic that wastes your time and forces you to wait to get into battle or deliver guns/ammo, and unreliable servers that will sometimes boot you out into the main menu, regardless of what you were doing.  In addition the lack of tutorials and explanations of game mechanics make this game much more complicated than it needs to be ( and for the record, the tutorial area has not been updated since I started playing the game).

The developers don't interact with the community and refuse to fix the problems that have been piling up, instead maintaining radio silence while issues such as hackers, cheaters and people using alternative accounts further exacerbates the problem.

With each update, more and more features are added that simply do not value the aforementioned players time. 

The most recent update added facilities, an unique design, but with VERY poor implementation. For a game that has been years in the making they tested the game-breaking facilities (as shown by the HUGE dip in players in the past handful of months) in only a couple weeks on the dev branch. Facilities have added a monotony of maintaining buildings that place needed items such as upgraded tanks, artillery, and other actual fun items like Battle Tanks or Super Heavy Tanks to where only a small portion of the player base will actually enjoy them. 

For $30, this game will provide about 100 hours of actual fun gameplay if you run with a squad of friends or in-game regiments. After the 100 hours? You'll be lost in the litany of poorly designed bases costing fronts, game-breaking bugs such as queue bugs that wipe entire regions, and the toxic cesspool that is the community surrounding this game. There is a reason why the game was released to 1.0 in October 2022 with 10k players and with only one-third or one-fourth of those players still playing.

There is no anti cheat, so speed hacks and vision hacks (among others) are becoming more and more common.
The devs release new content with zero testing, leading to massive balancing issues that cause one faction or the other to essentially quit until they are fixed.
Also new content is often followed by a wave of new bugs and server issues that can cost players hundreds to thousands of hours of player time and effort to be wasted.

Edit: yeah. Still either play 10 hours straight by accident or refuse to play for 3 weeks straight.

Edit: The last edit was at 100 hours of play. I now have nearly 1700. I am known for my work in the builder community. The games balance is all over the place, and not just in the intended asynchronous ways that the devs think its at, but some pretty glaring issues. 

Lets start with late game anti structure. 

150mm artillery, The guns between factions are identical, however the colonial one has more range whereas the warden one has a blast shield that helps keep the gunner alive (by roughly 1/3rd chance) within the emplacement. Cool difference, recently modified, but slightly overtuned towards colonial favor.

250mm Siege tanks. 
Chieftain and ballista. The ballista comes with a total capacity of 11 of these hard hitting ""mortar"" shells whos entire purpose is to crack whatever its shooting at the sacrifice of the tank and its crew. Its slow, but holds quite a bit of ammo.

The Chieftain, while quicker, holds a total of 6 shells, but also has a 12.7 Machine gun to go with it. Good vic to kill border bases at 2am for the 5th time that night.  if this was the only difference, we'd be okay, everything would be fine. BUT: Post 1.0 update, Chieftains require T2 facilities and the silverhand as its base vehicle, requires silverhands to tech in order to produce, and no fast way to do so, not including the extra infrastructure requires to turn silverhands into chieftains. 
The Ballista? Unlocks two entire tiers earlier, and can be made in the MPF. If you wanted Scorpians (also known as the infantry support tank) (also a really fun tank) You would have to go through a cheaper, but yet similar process to turn the siege tank into a support tank.

What this means is the colonial big boi of concrete killing comes out two tech tiers ahead of the warden medium boi of concrete killing. This can be up to 4 or 5 real days of one side having siege tanks before the other gets the equipment to effectively defend themselves from them (the other tech tier, if you dont know what im talking about, thats okay, just know its a struggle for awhile) 

Infantry equipment. In my personal opinion, colonial arms are easier to learn and use, lowering the requires skill floor to use effectively, while warden has a higher skill floor and ceiling, meaning more tricky to use, but once mastered it is more rewarding. This is okay and fine, but my biggest gripe is the handheld anti-personnel grenades. Harpas, with less standard range is more likely to instantly down an enemy may sound good, you vastly underestimate the extended range of the instant bleed Bombastone with a much wider blast radius. And as easy it is to throw two of these grenades (with the damage saturation of 4 harpas) colonials also get 25 per crate compared to 20 per crate wardens get. For the same cost.

Another piece of infantry equipment is the Catara, its just 12.7 handheld light lazerbeam of death. this is your typical salt from wardenman. yada yada yada i dont have numbers it just makes me the deaded.


Alright now onto universal issues instead of ""that side has better toys than my side >:[ bs""

Fire. 1.0 update included the lovely aspect of setting things on fire. If you have ever built anything in this game, you know it literally going up in flames and nothing you can do about it, even with a fire truck or two or three or seven at times. Oh and dont ever count on buckets of water saving you. The amount of damage 3 people, regardless of team, two with flamethrowers and 1 with a machine gun for suppression, can destroy entire bases, facilities, and towns if the response time is slow, or its perhaps middle of the work day Europe and 2 am United states and not as many people are online to notice the issue. 3 people can take out days worth of work done by dozens of people. 

Speaking of work of the many undone by the few.
Alts.
Some of you may know what an alt is. If you dont im going to explain it. It is when you use another account to play the game. This is sometimes beneficial for you, or even explicitly something developers want, in some games it allows you to do multiple classes or crafting recipes or whatnot at the same time to help progress your character. Sometimes it allows you to do 1 task by yourself instead of needing a team. In this game some people use them to have more factory queues or even solocrew a tank. 
THIS IS LOOKED DOWN BEHAVIOR HERE. 
and heres why. Not only does it give you an advantage over your enemy in many scenarios, or just deny your faction queue slots without having the player presence to justify it, But mainly, it is used for the cases of sabotage. People buy other steam accounts or just buy a brand new copy of the game and have their level 1 no rank guy go around as the other team, taking stuff, and throwing it into a river. Destroying defenses, despawning things from bases, disconnecting bunkers to slow the rate of tech, teaching tanks to swim, using trucks to block AI defenses (allowing the enemy to come closer than they had any right of being and killing whatever needs deading). But since on the map it doesnt show up as an enemy, unless you are in close proximity and catch them in the act, you just notice everything from your base gone, 15 trucks parked perfectly in front of garrisons, the 15 tanks you had prepped for the operation you and your buddies had planned for an hour from now have went missing, your base now has grown engine rooms and t1 pieces off the back (making it much much weaker for you newbies out there, please dont add pieces to someones base without their permission).

Okay so we catch an alt in the act. what now? Well you can try to voteban, where you have enough people in region to report them. but thats only temporary. What does the developers do? Nothing. Even the ones they have gone out of their way to ban, its only a year long ban and you see these accounts, come back after 372 days, and go back to doing all this damage. 

And its always interesting to see an invasion of your territory happen, but all of your staged counter artillery, and ammo, flatbeds to move the ammo, Extra guns, Quick Response Force tanks, all go missing just right before the attack.

Or the PVT who knows all the tricks required to acquire and steal a stored Super Heavy Tank, that some group has gone out of their way to store as secured as possible, and starts driving it towards a group of partisans who just appeared in your backline at the same time.

But theres 0 investigation of foul play by the developers or any sort of team. I dont personally think a developer should be dealing with these types of reports but maybe a community manager or someone. Anyone at this point. 

War 100 has been particularly bad. At least from the warden perspective. Able shard seemed to have a less amount of Alt behavior since 1.0 but thats to be believed that the people who like to see the world burn went to what was considered the new player friendly servers where there is less ""tools"" in place for handling griefers and alts. Those servers are now gone. All condensed back into 1 shard (or server). 

As much fun as this game was at one point.
Building needs a quality of life for the love of callahan.
Power creep is insane, PvE needs a rebalance (no the cutler is not that OP)
Bunker supplies go BRR (i understand why this exists, but i can still cope seethe, and in fact mald.)

 Unfortunately the game is at the same time a product of a Dev team that refuse to communicate with the community in any meaningful way. There are significant issues that consistently get ignored by said Dev team, much to the detriment of the players of this game. Cheaters, Griefers, and Alt users continue to destroy any potential enjoyment the playerbase may have. 

 The Developers removed In Game Moderators due to corruption and abuse on their part, and never replaced them. Instead they have a system of reporting players through a support ticket, which unfortunately goes ignored these days with the same troublemakers coming back over and over without ever being addressed in a significant way. 

 This is further hampered by the Dev team's choice to make everything about the game as disrespectful to players' time as they can. They seem stuck in the same mindset as most Mobile Game Developers (The company used to be named ""Clapfoot"" and published Mobile Games) in that they find ""Gacha"" mechanics interesting and utilize a lot of time-gating via overly complicated systems that do more to punish players for their hard work with even more hard work even to do the most simple of tasks. 

 The fact remains I may play this game more after this review, because friends that I enjoy spending time with still play it. However, I will never under any circumstance recommend you give this company a single cent for this game or ANY OTHER they produce.

The 1.0 update, the full release of foxhole, only made these problems worse, and opened a sore for new ones. There is no practical system to deal with alts and griefers that can ruin days of work in minutes. There are no independent or active moderators at all to deal with the most blatant griefer. Blatant griefers are NEVER permanently banned, and will log back on hours or a day later to ruin player experience again and again.

The devs do nothing to fix game breaking bugs and server issues, some of which have been known for years. They instead add features nobody asked for which increasingly do not respect your time as a player. Updates are released half finished without appropriate bug fixes, QoL, or testing, leading to more bugs and inbalance between the factions. They then refuse to communicate with the community and release shadow patches at random.

Their moderation is also abysmal:
Send a video of a bug to them - perma banned
Write a rude word on the map - perma banned
Step out of line on reddit or discord - swift response
Send a video of a blatant ingame griefer - no response
There are no ingame mods leading to blatant griefing with no compensation. Bugs are exploited and nothing is done for months with no word on if the are even aware of or fixing the problem.

The game can still be fun, it is a brilliant idea and it has a friendly and passionate community, but over the years it has become bloated so that simple activities have become frustrating and it can feel more like a job than a game. 
I cannot recommend the game until:
There are better ingame moderation tools or active moderators.
The devs begin to communicate with the community.
Basic QoL is prioritised over new features that the majority of people will never use.
An updated tutorial is added for new players.

I don't want to disparage the developers, you have a difficult thankless job and there are aspects we the community do not understand about what is happening. PLEASE TALK TO US THOUGH. If you are worried about toxic responses release one way statements just to let us know what is happening... X bug is being looked into, Y will be fixed soon. People are toxic because they have been yelling into the void which has left them jaded and confused.

Devs have showed no interest in reigning in rampant cheating, toxic player behavior, and griefing.

The game is a unique creation that, for me, filled a hole left by HeroesAndGenerals. Persistent battles and RTS. It filled the whole so well i never once considered going back to HnG after discovering this. Not only is there a persistent war and an RTS element like in HnG but there's also base building, backline sabotage, naval landings, strategic ballistic missiles and many others. It is in essence an incredible creation.

However. And this is the part where i'll explain why i don't recommend the game.
The biggest problem of the game at the time of writing this is the problem of alt accounts. Basically explained, nothing stops bad actors from purchasing multiple accounts and using those accounts to join the enemy side and wreck havoc. Drive vehicles into water, take screenshots of vulnerable points, screenshots of intel, modify bunker complexes to make them worse. There's many ways to damage your team and it is done en-mass. There is no way of efficiently getting rid of these bad actors at the time of the writing of this review.

Another considerable problem is the huge cost in time of many aspects of the game. Building a decent base can take real life days, and maintaining them can take a couple of hours per day. This is not necessarily a deal-breaker however seeing how wars can last months, this causes people to burn out and leave the game. A slightly less punishing way of building and maintaining what is built would alleviate this problem. 

My personal last problem with the game, thou compared to the others it is a minor thing, is that the developers of the game basically don't ever communicate with the community at large, nor do they take a stance, pro or against when it comes to contentious subjects such as hacking, using of exploits, 3rd party software use and others.

All in all this could be an incredible game, the love of my life game. But as it is now, it simply isn't. Thank you for reading",1676210094,1676210094,False,8,0,0.561726093292236328,0,True,False,False

In every war since the mid-70s the mood swings in the community hive mind have gotten more violent. Developers are in a catch 22 where if they ignore the playerbase it whips people up into screaming hysterics, and if they do communicate with the playerbase then people will go out of their way to whip themselves up into hysterics anyway. The shortest, most banal messages from the developers are gathered, with both sides employing troops of specialist schitzos to over-analyse, decrypt through 14 dimensions of possible subtext, and eventually use as evidence in echochambers to claim that developers favor the other side. 

The devs aren't little golden angels either though. They sit in their ivory towers adding piles of powercrept equipment while the fundamental problems of the game remain. The devs seem to exist in a reality where they're developing a game for the player base they *want*, rather than the playerbase they *have*. Discussions and accusations of cheating will get you banned from the forums while the cheaters themselves, even when caught and removed from the game dozens of times(!) are given a temporary time out before they can play again. You'll have the same account come back again and again and again.

A few dozen wars ago these people were few and had the discretion to cheat sneakily but these days they will openly and brazenly cheat in full view, despawn equipment and drive vehicles into water in a busy logistics town or sabotage a big base a few moments before a big clan operation. They expect to be caught and votebanned and don't care, they're just trying to do as much damage before that happens and their cheating account goes on a 48h cooldown. 

A significant section of the game relies on what is essentially slave labor. Playing logistics is a full time job and you can spend literally fourteen hours a day waiting for production queues to finish so you can drive X to Y or gather more resources. The timers for production is set up to be short enough to be inconvenient to set it as afk in the background and long enough that it's boring to wait in your truck. About 300 of my 550 hours were used to do logi full time until I realized what a total sucker I was being played for. Literally unpaid labor and the game relies on convincing enough no-lifes to do it so that everyone else in the community can have fun (or dump the production into a lake - see above). Without these people, btw, there would be no game. I quit when I realised I was one of a significant number of people who were feeling compelled to do this task because nobody else was doing it and it needed to be done for the game to function.

At its best, Foxhole could be one of the best MMOs out there. It truly breaks new ground and the emergent gameplay can blow you away. But it's in the process of collapsing. Until some huge, systematic changes are made, pass this game over for now.

Currently the war is 100, the longest game on record. People are trying their hardest to win the special number war. A huge section of the playerbase is exhausted, frustrated and burned out but it giving it one last hurrah for war 100.

The atmosphere is amazing, it gives back the vulnerability of a person in war. I like the idea, that you must work together with your faction selflessly, from gathering resources to maintaining the bunkers, and facilities, doing the logistics etc. So overall the game has great potential.
A reason why I give negative feedback is based on the developer's attitudes toward their players.

Despite the community requests, the developers seemingly only focus on adding newer and bigger guns instead of polishing what we already have. One of the biggest problems is Alting, which means a player buys the second game for his/herself, joins the enemy faction, and starts do sabotage action within.
Factions are completely vulnerable to this. There is no in-game mechanics that you can defend against this, and even if you catch an Alt account and reports it, it will get a maximum of 3 days ban. On Reddit, you can find violation logs, which go back years, and have 3 days of bans one after another.

When your faction loses a hex within a day, what you fought for weeks just because all of your tanks and artillery equipment ended in the bottom of the ocean and you weren't able to fight back, you might question that your hours, days of hard work would have been more effective by doing something else..

When you first get the game, you will be amazed. Every single day you learn new things and the game's systems show themselves to be deeper than you thought before. Meeting the same people in a persistent war day after day really creates a unique experience as a war sim MMO.

But the game is in an absolutely broken state. As you become hooked you also notice the cracks, everywhere you look. Certain parts of the game require massive time sinks each day (upward of five hours per day) in order to work. And as you're now hooked, you'll spend more and more time on the game, despite it becoming a detriment over time. The game has lots of bugs, exploits, broken systems... but it especially suffers from a complete and total lack of interest or moderation on the developer's part. The sporadic (3x a year) update stream shows what the team has been working on, and is guaranteed to generate a new stream of players being drawn to the game. But the developers will ignore each and every single part of player feedback that does not have to do with fixing simple bugs. There are no moderators anywhere in this game. Breaking rules, cheating, griefing... It's not only ignored, you will be banned by the devs on all platforms for speaking out about these issues. You'll sometimes sink literal IRL days into a project such as an operation or base building. It's a common occurence to wake up, completely without being able to protect your work from griefers while you slept, and see that people 'alting' (playing on your team but actually helping the enemy by griefing hard) have completely wiped away all your hard work. And when you have video evidence of it happening, the developers will never do anything about it, even banning you from speaking out in the process. 

This practice by the developers is decidedly anti-consumer, and the load of recent negative reviews reflect the community finally being fed up with the bullshit. Despite this being a great game and loving the community, and despite me sinking countless hours into this game, I recommend that you save yourself the trouble, and not buy this game. It will frustrate yourself to no end, and become an actual source of irl stress and frustration. Do not buy.

And when probable cause is truly found, seemingly nothing is ever done. It is a MMO with no external authentication, with a different identity being a simple steam name-change away, and the developers have time and time again stayed silent regarding these matters to the point where I could compare the state of things to the Wild West.

I want to get excited about playing Foxhole, but these barriers to the fun have created an aversion that destroys further desire to play. The developers have shown their ability to listen, given enough feedback- so hopefully this gets their attention. My wishes are to be able to return to this review and reverse my decision. I sincerely want things to improve- not for the game to die.

TLDR:
The Bad:
- no in-game moderation, hardly anyone (if anyone) is dedicated to handling reports, no in-game oversight in cases of cheating.
- developers don't care about the community, interact with it or listen to it.
- secondary accounts are used to enter the enemy faction and can wreak havoc easily with game mechanics allowing that to happen.
- poor new player experience, outdated tutorial.

The Mixed:
- game heavily focused on interacting with people/working with people.
- niche game, might not fit everyone, not really geared towards casual players. (long crafting timers, buildings producing the good stuff need upkeep)
- questionable balancing to say the least.

The Good:
- said niche is rather unique, you are just a single player in the sea of many and need to work with others to achieve anything, giving a realistic experience of being ""just a cog in the war machine""
- complicated logistics system is rather interesting, as is the equipment with each faction having entire arsenals unique to them.

The Long Read Edition:
The developers of this game have been ignoring the voices of the community that attempts to highlight the problems with this product, such as:
- The absolute lack of Moderation.
The punishment system in this game consists of other players making reports that might get reviewed and handled... or not, the studio is small so it has a very small (if any) amount of people dedicated to this specific task.
Reports - when spammed in a sufficient amount in-game - can get you automatically banned for a period of time ranging from 30 minutes to about 2 months, making the system prone to abuse, it has been used to vote-ban people before. (allowing groups to target specific individuals or using their numbers to suppress other groups)
You cannot report enemy faction's players nor can you communicate with the enemy faction as the [ALL] chat that allowed it was removed, so if you see a cheater? Send a support ticket and pray.

There are no moderators in-game, there was a system of game moderators that were drawn from the community, however once upon a time one of them decided to become the equivalent of an AC-130 during an enemy operation and unleash hell from above using their ability to fly and spawn any item they wanted.
Needless to say, community moderators ceased to exist shortly after that and devs took on the game moderation upon themselves.
Given how many complaints there are in places like Reddit or even the reviews here, I'll leave you - dear reader - to formulate the opinion on how well they are handling that yourself.
Personally? I would say that I am still waiting for any serious effort to be put into that, but I've quit the game months ago.

- Alting - alting consists of a player buying this game on another Steam account, logging into the enemy faction and harming the other faction via their actions.
For example - alts can ruin days of someone's progress by stealing expensive or time-costly items and despawning (dropping them on the ground until the server cleans them up) them or getting in someone's tank and driving it into the enemy frontline, getting it killed (bear in mind the most powerful tanks can take a literal day to build and supply)
Why? Why not, you won't get punished for it, even when your identity was revealed due to the above report system and moderation issues.

- Cheating - (thankfully) seems to be a minor issue as alting is easier and less risky for a much larger effect.
Before EAC was added to this game, I met a dude that would reduce his respawn timer to 0 and would also blatantly use a wallhack and an aimbot.
I can't tell whether (or if) the introduction of EAC helped in that regard, I hope it did, but if you do meet one, pray that your reports get answered.

- Underwhelming new player experience - When you join the game, you spawn in the Home Island of your faction, where the tutorial area was largely untouched since around 2018, result being that you as a new player can enter the actual game lacking basic knowledge, thankfully there are good people that dedicate their free time to either sitting in world chat or in the Home Island and teaching the newbies actually useful stuff, but that's not always the case and cannot be relied upon.
Personally, I don't mind being thrown into deep water, but I believe everyone deserves to learn the game their way, so a good tutorial is very important.

The lack of communication with the Dev team leads to them adding features that are either completely against what the community asked for or something that the community did not consider more important than more critical issues, like the need for better equipment balance, implementing a system that tackles AFK players taking up server slots and more serious measures being taken against alting and more.

Now this is a mixed bag so it's entirely dependent on how you look at it and individual experience:
- A major part of the game's experience comes from the community - from the minor chats with people to people forming clans and having experiences that draw them closer to each other.
But of course not every social interaction will be like that as the community has severe issues with toxicity and it can range from being great to being one of the most petty and vile.
- The game is rather niche and requires quite a bit of time investment if the player wishes to achieve something ""significant"".
for example: taking a town can be a lightning fast strike or a WW1 level attrition war with tens of thousands of artillery shells being fired over the course of battle.
This makes the game not particularly geared towards casual players, as just making the resources and producing a decent tank can take hours whereas making a base and upgrading it takes days.
A casual player with say 1-2 hours available each day can get by by doing simpler tasks like playing infantry or joining a clan/receiving equipment for free as sometimes groups make a production run of those and give their surplus away or just hopping aboard a vehicle if the crew finds itself short handed and needs someone to fill a slot.
- Balancing can be hit or miss and the dev team can also be hit or miss regarding how they tackle that.

Now despite the criticism, I would like to point out that the game has good (or also mixed, depending on your perspective) features that can make it enjoyable.

- The game features an interesting and a rather niche form of gameplay with the player character being a minor, individually insignificant part of the world, a ""cog in the war machine"" that must cooperate with others to achieve anything, for example: to operate a tank, someone has to drive it, someone has to operate the gun, someone has to command (not always) and finally - as is the case with pretty much any combat vehicle - someone has to provide logistical assistance with fuel, repair materials etc, all of which are a result of someone's work, making cooperation and interaction with the community a quintessential part of the game.
- The equipment each faction has is rather unique, while it leads to balancing issues, it is overall interesting with each faction having a relatively unique loadout available to tackle enemy forces with.

Overall, the game has it's moments, but the negatives and how they've been allowed to persist through the years outweigh the positives and thus make me not recommend this title.",1676174735,1676174735,False,23,0,0.612178444862365723,4,True,False,False

What this has led to is alting (the act of a second account to sabotage the enemy team), griefing, and faction loyalism to a toxic degree. Repeat offenders are not banned, and the previously implemented player moderation system was abused so horribly that it was removed from the game.

Without commenting on the state of the social media surrounding this game, I will say that initially there is a lot of promise and fun to be had.

The short answer is that they don't. They don't moderate the game, they don't communicate with the community nearly as much as they should, they don't even address or even acknowledge issues that the community unanimously agrees on like alting. Instead they push rushed updates to grab more money, ban people on reddit for ""witchhunting"" when evidence of cheating and or alting is raised (and no bans are handed out to said cheaters/alters). I dont even think they play their own game or do any actual QA based on some of the interactions the community had with the dev team during the last devbranch prior to the 1.0 update.

Foxhole is probably one of the closest things we have to a ""REAL"" war game, but unfortunately where this game falls down on its sword, are some of the things that truly set it apart from other games of the same genre.
  
   You can see how the developers have tried to make things move at different speeds with different techniques for instance having to farm then craft then ship goods and supplies slows a front down. making it so unless players are willing to sacrifise their time they will be fighting a loosing battle to those who do but also creating artificial shortages, much like what we can imagine would of been experienced in war times. which then leads me to my point where this game falls down is that most wars start off with a lot of players and end with a lot of players but in the mean time players come and go and this leads to decaying of bases and the constant upkeep of bases with garrison supplies and that then eating into players actual lives as if your not on within a set period of time your supplies go public and your base decays. (again from the developers side i can see the issue where players will farm a lot and then stop playing and those resources are forever in limbo inaccessible by the current player base who may need them)

   Also seeing alot of other issues where players who are either older players who have lost interest or people buying multiple accounts and games being able to ""sabotage"" the enemy team by joining with no intention of helping but to hinder and costing people hundreds of hours of work with no real punishment. 

 Added in facilities with the last major update which is all good and well when everyone works together how its insinuated but unfortunately players seem to have a main character syndrome and why would i want to spend literal hours of my real life time when i can let the one guy do all the work and piggy back off of the success helping myself to all the proceeds whilst you see the same few people doing the same boring monotonous work over and over for hours everyday just to ""maintain"" what they've already spent hours building and then eventually dying off never to be seen in the game again for some other poor player to come and take their place. Wrongly assuming this facility update would be able to give those people a break and they've now ended up having to spend even longer doing the same tasks with no real reward other than to upkeep a necessary base.

  Other things that could be much simpler to address like terrain tool usage and leaving trees blocking roads and pathways hindering players who are the ones who do most of the core work in the game.

  Over all its a great game honestly one of a kind! Everything you would want it to do for a casual it does perfectly (gun play, movement, HUD) but it does need some more heads coming together from the development team and the community as ways to address the real issues this game is currently experiencing.

The game has enormous potential and because of this you will see a LOT of people around with thousands of hours in this game. Unfortunately the developers haven't been able to make it work. Foxhole is a very intricate game with a lot of complex systems for building and logistics, all designed to support the combat of the game, this is what makes it unique. Unfortunately the developers have not just failed to address their failures to make the systems work without causing massive amounts of burnout, they have outright refused to. 

Every update builds upon existing problems, adding more content and thus more workload. Due to software limitations they cannot make the servers handle more assets than they already do, which means builders have to fight the game itself in order to keep the assets they built alive. Logisticians are at war with the enemy and their own team for control of the limited resources. Both groups eventually burnout throughout a wars duration because the hours and effort they must put in to help their faction are both numerous and boring. 

You might ask why it is people continue to play when the game and its developers don't respect the time of the player. The answer is that Foxhole is a one of a kind experience that most of us love the idea of, and have had a lot of hope for. We all constantly keep trying to bring in friends to experience it with us, because we have put so much effort into this game and have have had amazing moments. Ultimately though, the longer you play the fewer amazing moments occur, and it just becomes a mental and emotional drain.

As a last note, the game has a significant problem with griefers, alts, and plain abysmal behavior by the player base. The cross-faction and intra-faction is not getting any better, and the developers can't seem to find out how to keep people from making accounts on the opposing team to destroy their painstakingly constructed assets in cheap and unsporting ways. As of this time, unless significant changes occur to improve quality of life I cannot advise anyone purchase Foxhole.

The game used to be built on the principle of nobody's actions alone were significant, but as a whole they all mattered. Now the only actions that matter are those of organized in-game clans.

These clans have both the capability and the wherewithal to monopolize most of the game's activities outside of holding a rifle and charging towards a trench. Activities that could reliably be completed in a single play session and/or with a small group of 5 or fewer like building a base, building and driving tanks, assaulting a flank, or doing basically anything that is tangible longer than a few minutes has become virtually impossible due to onerous game mechanics being added that can only be surmounted by collective, organized, and large group effort. The time of the solo and small-group player is over. And the game is not fun without that capability without dumping 3-4 of hours into it every day, which people with schedules can't maintain.

TLDR: The game requires either huge groups of players or 3-4 hours of daily play to accomplish anything making it virtually impossible for people with jobs to play in small groups or by themselves. Do not buy.",1676151391,1676151391,False,2,0,0.501412749290466309,0,True,False,False

What isn't good is the development team. They have pretty much no communication with the players, and haven't for almost the entire time the game was in early access (over 4 years!). Currently a group of dedicated people are griefing both factions, destroying dozens of hours of work, and - get this - there are no ingame moderators. Players are allowed to report other players, but they can only ban someone for an hour, even if that person was caught red-handed destroying a bunch of the team's stuff. There are literally 5 documented cases of """"friendly"""" players with over 100,000 ""vehicle self damage"", a stat which tracks how many friendly vehicles you have destroyed. A vehicle has between 500-5000 health. These 5 people have destroyed, at the very least, 100 vehicles. And nothing is done about it.

There is also a system - because, again, there are no ingame moderators - by which players can downvote your posts in world chat, but this is one of the most often abused systems in the game and is used to silence people you don't like more frequently than not.

For a lot of people it's this epic PVP warfest that can go for weeks with the front shifting constantly, others it's a grind-fest plagued with griefers and cheaters hampering all the fun. So for me I'll give my won 2 cents from how I've seen it go.

Early to mid-game is this fast dynamic battlefield, people throwing ideas out at the wall to see if it will work. Barges of riflemen running down the shore because there are no gunboats yet, massive zergs of grenadiers rushing bases because there is no big heavy tanks or artillery to fill that role, or massive columns of men trying to flanking bases before AI tech makes them into nothing but shoes and goo. This is the fun time.
But as we go later into the game this stops, lines either stagnant or breakdown to the point a whole hex can be overran because so much time and resources are stretched just to keep the front line intact. Anything other than the highest tech'd resource heavy armor gets used and anything not that tends to stick in the back lines, unwilling or unable to move forward to push a point. The game turns into attrition where the first gun fired might be the only one needed. People get burnt out, others turn to sabotage, fingers get pointed, morale shifts on a dime, clans abandon sites. 
Could the devs do more? Absolutely. Both sides suffer from a litany of issues that can be addressed, people have reported what the issues are, have offered up solutions to help, but there has been no dialogue.

Foxhole is a one of a kind MMO, or even a dream MMO for some (like me). Many features of Foxhole simply can't be found in any other games such as the persistent warfare, player driven logistics and free building. It has immense potential, yet falls so short of its expectations.

The team behind Foxhole is an indie team, and no one expects an AAA quality game from them with so little budget. However, Siege Camp (the developers behind Foxhole) simply do not seem to care about player feedback.

Faction imbalances, griefers/alts (ruining your hours of work), server issues and core gameplay bugs continue to exist. Increasingly tedious and time-consuming gameplay loops continue to be added (such as Facilities) that make you spend more time maintaining your virtual base than your day job.

The century war (100th war) only served to exemplify these issues. Fresh accounts with **20 ban records** continue to be free to go around ruining people's gameplay. Server lag/crashes are frequent and the last dev message was 3 weeks ago on something unrelated to Foxhole.

Foxhole has been a blast and I write this review with great pain as I really hope the issues are one day fixed. However, I am unable to recommend this game as of now

One thousand hours within a single year and only now did my eyes open.

Lets begin at the start. You freshly bought the game. Installed it and fired it up.
Greeted by the option to join either one of the two factions  Warden and Colonial. 
It doesn't really matter which faction you choose and once selected you will enter a game unlike any other.
 
The posibillities are endless for it all is one huge sandbox in which you can do what you fancy at the time. 
Front line warfare, gathering resources, weapon production, vehicle production, base building, trench digging, tank driving artillery firing, or just be good 'ol cannon fodder, you name it. 

You can do anything you fancy for all those things have to be done by someone. Let me explain.
Every iten in the game has been build by either you or another player. Made by materials people gathered from the map. 
Want a box of standard ammunition?  The poduction process goes as follows 
1. Raw scrap material is farmed at the scrap field. 
2. Transported by truck towards the refinery. 
3. Processed into basic materials. 
4. Basic materials are then transported towards a factory.
5. Factory turns the basic materials into what ever product you so desire, this time we choose 7.62 rifle ammo.
6. Receive the crated ammo which is then driven by truck to where ever it is needed. 

As you can see this process is lengthy and very time consuming and requires effort. 
Players spending hours upon hours driving back and forth making items and hauling them to the front lines to be used either by you or your fellow faction players.

Yet within the system there lies a problem. 

Public stockpiles. 
As the name would suggest. Public stockpiles are places in which crated materials and vehicles can be put for later use. 
This is either in a storage depot or a seaport. Both physical buildings within the game of which there are many. 
Simply drive your logistics truck up to it. Click upon the desired items the front lines require and and drive it back for players to use. Anyone of the same faction has access to it. Which also means those who bought the game with ill intent. 

And out of all the hours i have played have i neved seen as much ill intent combined as this latest war.
The problem? Alt accounts.  Freshly created steam accounts, which have purchased a copy of the game to actively sabotage the opposite faction. Is your main faction losing? Then the alts wreak havoc by gathering as much valuable things they can from the public stockpiles only to destroy them by dumping it all into the sea. An act done in less than a blink of an eye with hours and hours of time and effort wasted of the player who created it.  Countless of video evidence has been submitted of acts such as these to the developers. Tanks which take hours to build, Containers filled to the brim with stuff and pallets of artillery shells dumped into the water by non ranked ( level 0 ) players. Accounts that have been reported time and time again for such deeds still free to do the things they do without being  perma banned. The problem goes completely ignored. 

As an all round player doing front line warfare and logistics this is infuriating. Knowing that all the time spend can be just wasted away or handed out to the opposite faction for their own advantage in a matter of minutes when no one else is looking. 

Until the developers come up with a working solution for these problems my review will remain negative, of which i had no joy of writing this.

Let me start by saying that Foxhole is a unique and highly addictive gaming experience. 
It's positives: 
1) Huge scale wars, cool lore, an extremely helpful and newby friendly community. 
2) Entertaining combat mechanics. 
3) Infantry, tanks, artillery, gunboats, trains and advanced logistics.
4) Advanced building mechanics. You can even build fortresses and huge Storm Cannons.

HOWEVER, i CANNOT recommend this game anymore.

Both factions have had a number of ''bad apples'' who use their alt accounts on the opposing faction, in order to grief on backline facilities and harass their production. Hundreds of hours of work can easily be razed to the ground in minutes.... Thousands of complaints and reports have been submitted to the dev team but they choose to ignore the issue... Even when alts account get caught on video, they get a 2 days long ban and then they can go back to their evil habits... On the contrary, RPing situations like checkpoints or fist fighting arenas can get you permanently banned...lol...

This game is a blast, but the Devs are tone deaf to their community - I do not recommend buying the game until they decide to address issues the community has brought forward (with solutions!) and decide to do next to nothing or a half-measure of moderation/attempt at fixing the game's problems.

-ALTing - buying a second copy for greifing the other team or destroy vital infrastructure or supplies to undermine the war effort.

-Multiboxing - Kinda the same as ALTing but for one team - used to crew an entire tank, push gun, artillery, etc - basically you're playing World of tanks at that point and the fun of teamwork is lost

-Hacking - Several instances have arisen where hackers kill players who are WELL outside visible range (night mostly)

-Logistic problems - Many Quality of Life fixes have been made but facilities and other means of creating supplies is just a pain at some times as well as drawing supplies out of storage - an operation can take several hours to set up for only the tactical advantage to be lost within that timeframe of staging.

-Home Island and training - IS SEVERELY OUTDATED AND NEEDS A REVAMP - needs to force new players to actually learn mechanics and not just jump in and mess about and cause their team more harm than help - let the clans submit training material its not hard to get this right...

-Dev 'solutions' - Some of the solutions devs have pushed are undermined or outright ignored and push a new tank variant in players faces as a bait and switch, only for it to be terrible or overpowered - the return of BTs and their variants.

-Localization - as of today (Feb 10 2023) Russian players JUST got a chance to buy the game and have flooded front lines with inexperience and a massive language barrier between other players. This has resulted in many instances where people shoot each other out of frustration or unwillingness to cooperate, meanwhile devs have raved about language packs and chat filters to allow only certain languages to be read - this hurts the community and you cant cooperate if you cant communicate, I have to learn basic russian now to even get a chance to help these guys

TL:DR - Game GOOD, Devs are the step-father you never wanted, and just simply watch as bad things happen to the community and does very little to reprimand those who/what causes trouble.

To top it all off the devs also rushed the game, a completely unfinished, bugged riddled, and unbalanced PvP product to '1.0' and have outright refused to bugfix/moderate etc but instead add more unbalanced shiny toys as the fugg off to their newest game to repeat the cycle(Hint hint: Don't buy Anvil)

The idea of this game has the possibility to become incredibly popular, but I don't think the developers are competent enough to lead the way for this emerging genre of persistent warfare. The game is incredibly janky, and engine limitations mean you will have to wait for hours in queues to get into the most active fronts. The map is divided into hexes, and each hex has a maximum capacity of around 200 players. This means there is a hard cap on the amount of players that can be playing and the closer you get to that cap the more laggy and glitchy the game becomes. You will be plagued with frequent disconnects, rubber banding, and desyncs. The engine and servers simply cannot handle large amounts of players which really puts a damper on the idea of ""massive persistent warfare."" The devs current solution to this problem is to open multiple shards when there is a large influx of players, but much of the community considers the main shard to be the ""true war"" which leaves you wondering why you're investing so much time on an alternate shard when the outcome doesn't matter. It also goes against the whole point of the game which is to be one massive persistent war. 

There are also many issues with certain mechanics in the game. I'll start with building as it is an integral part of the game, if no one is building and fortifying bases you're faction will get steamrolled. Basically building gameplay boils down to collecting materials and holding down LMB. Infact it is often recommend to turn on click lock while building because it takes hours to build a simple tier 2 bunker base, and once you want to scale up to a concrete base it starts feeling like a second job. The amount of time needed is insane. Obviously the time requirement can be lessened with multiple people working on a base, but currently there is a shortage of people willing to build because the gameplay is atrocious. There are also many advanced building techniques that are not well documented, so it's very easy for new builders to build a base that will most likely die immediately to the enemy. Then there is the issue of supplying your base once it's built. Because of engine limitations, the devs have implemented a decay system to limit the amount of structures in a hex. The only way to prevent a base from decaying is to supply it with a certain item that is produced at factories. Because everybody needs this item for their base, the queues at the factory are often maxed out and it could take hours or even days to get enough of this item to supply the base for a week. If you want your base to operate the entire war this will be your life, collect materials for garrison supplies, add your order to the factory, supply base, repeat. This process causes burnout very quick which is why you'll often see abandoned decaying bases in the mid and back lines.

Next up is Logistics. You'll often hear people say that Logi wins wars and that's cause it's true. If no one is supplying the front line you'll find yourself having to fight the enemy with pistols and no more respawns. While logi gameplay can be very rewarding, it is very repetitive. The logistics chain boils down to farm resources, refine materials, produce supplies, deliver to frontline. While you can do all of these it is generally considered inefficient and time consuming so you'll generally see people only farming and refining, or producing and delivering. The people delivering to the frontlines are always going to be the ones getting commends, but it's important to remember that none of it happens with out the other parts of the chain. Farming resources is much like building, just hold down LMB and watch some YouTube. Some might enjoy this, but for me it turns into a repetitive grind really fast. There's also other often overlooked logi tasks such as, refueling fuel containers, preventing decay of backline base, and refueling salvage mines. There is also the new facility gameplay, but I can't really give an opinion on them as I don't use them, but generally they seem to suffer from the same decay problem that bunker bases do.

Now for combat. Generally I think combat is fun, but there are some issues. The top down perspective of the game is charming, but it can cause issues with aiming at enemies that are behind cover. You can find yourself in a situation where you can't hit an enemy in a trench, but they can hit you in your trench. This is definitely subjective, but I believe grenade spam is an issue as well it's too easy for one player to effectively zone out a massive area with gas grenades. Moving across rocky terrain is incredibly janky because it's hard to get a sense of if you can jump over certain rocks or not. These are just some minor issues, there's also balance issues as well but I won't get into them here.

For the last part of my review I'd like to talk about alts. I truly believe this is one of the worst things in the game currently as it allows one person to completely destroy a factions stockpiles. Basically a player will buy a second copy of the game and joining the opposing faction to sabotage their stockpiles. All the alt has to do is grab a truck full of supplies, or a tank and drive it into water to destroy it. There is very little recourse players can do to fight against it, and the devs have been choosing to ignore it even though it's against the code of conduct. Its been a growing problem over the years and only seems to be getting worse.

Overall I can't recommend the game in it's current state. Even though it is unique there are just too many problems currently to make it rewarding enough for the time invested.

This game has insane potential and the vast majority of it is being wasted.
Playing in a large environment with hundreds of other players where everything is player-made is incredibile. It can be very fulfilling and very frustrating at times, but definitely worth the time.
Combat is engaging even if the learning curve is steep, but once mastered a few concept one can easily feel like actively contributing to a front. Every faction has his own unique load out with some option more viable than others: someone likes the asymmetry, others complain that sometimes it's too much.
Artillery is amazing. Even just loading shells while under counter artillery fire is lit.
Tanks are very fun. Again some can dislike the asymmetry (with tanks is sometimes more evident for obvious reasons)but playing in a tank line while the infantry is pushing is really something.
Boats are basically non existent (just 2 models, but there are rumours of some future naval update) and not very viable.
Building...oh man. Not only it requires basically a degree in foxhole physics and engineering and a long amount of time, but upkeep cost are out of scale. During long wars is impossible to maintain big bases if you have not a consistent flow of material and people to help out. More than anything you have to come up with anti-griefing solution cause the game doesn't provide anything in that regards.
Why then a negative review? Speaking with more experienced players than me (literally thousands of hours) I realised that the game is affected by the same bugs/glitch/exploit since 50 wars ago. Yeah a lot of critical issue were solved, but a series of long standing bugs is still there. 
The servers of this game are dogshit. No other way to put it. 9/10 times on high pop frontline hex get lags spikes and random dc on both faction. How the hell an MMO is supposed to work without proper servers?
Late game lack some serious firepower.Sure nukes are in game, but spotting rules are just ridicolous (and largely exploitable turn out) and Super Heavy Tank are a joke, more of a resource dump than an effective weapon.
Alting and griefing has seen an exponential rise in war 100, on both factions. There was no addressing the issue by the Devs. Imaging working hard to have enough resources to build whatever you want to build and then seeing a no rank driving your tank in the river. And then reading in local that he has been doing the same for the past days, being banned a couple of days each time.
Last but not least there's a severe lack of communication by the Devs. Don't know why, but i don't think you can maintain a healthy MMO if you don't communicate with your playerbase. Hell, it looks like there isn't even active modding on the server (atm only ABLE server is up). They only communicate when major update comes out, and even then they just address the new content and not others issue that the community brings up.

The Devs aren't great. There is basically no communication to or from the team and very little ingame moderation outside of a horrific chat censor that is impossible to turn off (and censors such classics as ""basement"" and ""therapy""). 

Alternate accounts and above all dedicated griefing accounts are given at worst temporary bans. Blatant griefing accounts (dumping thousands of hours of material into the ocean publicly) can go days without interruption and since the game can be refunded there's minimal financial expenditure or time investment required.

As for the game itself? it's a mess.

Holes in the map everywhere. Hope you set your spawn before you found one!

Nuke mechanics don't work, both of the nukes launched in this war (war 100) have been due to bugs or exploits. There is basically no other way to launch a nuke currently.

Voice comms (essential for playing a team game like this) are constantly breaking requiring restarts and returning you to the home island. This means you often need to wait half an hour or more to get back to the fight.

The building is great! Provided you have hours to actually build anything. Oh and you then need to babysit anything that's not concrete because fire is not balanced at all. And if you want concrete it takes ages of babysitting to get to it and it requires a stupid amount of components (used to make Rmats (the material used to make tanks and heavy weapons)) which take hours to mine and are difficult to obtain at the best of times.


On the subject of building: Gsup/Bsup consumption/production is still an issue. If you want to build anything with actual defences prepare to spend hours each day playing click-a-box in a back line town to print stupid pointless cans of ""my building is actually doing something, please don't delete it"".

The shooting mechanics are great, but buggy. Its very difficult to actually hit a target in any form of cover and the practice of ""shadow dancing"" (running around in circles then using quick aim (0.5 seconds of 100% accuracy) to clap people) isn't fun and it doesn't fit. 

Balance is beyond awful.

Colonial super tank is useless and basically nobody will build it.

Colonial heavy field gun (the stygian) will one or two tap anything short of a BT (battle tank, takes 24 hours to build and will still probably be crippled first shot). The warden equivalent (the stockade) is unusable due to limited range and underwhelming firepower. 

There's much more I could write here. Like how the colonials lack a decent early game PVE tool, how the colonial static weapons (aside from the ISG) are awful, how the boma is broken as hell, how the osprey is a pile of trash, but the devs (again) either know this and don't care or don't know this because they do not listen to community feedback.


Long story short: Devman bad. Game fun for few hours but not fun after. Do not buy game. Stay away. Spend money on good titles.",1670479091,1676000522,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After messing around a bit on the home island I asked in chat ""where is a new player needed what area needs men"" and in the text chat ""GO FIGHT FOR THE HOLY LAND"" and ""GO TO ABANDONED WARD IN THE DEADLANDS AND FIGHT FOR CALLAHAN"" appeared. So I spawned in grabbed a gun and helped push back the Colonials to Iron's End and we almost pushed them back to Callahan's Gate before they counter attacked and a back and forth battle began before I knew it 8 hours had gone by. My first war was war 87 and it was glorious wish I had gotten the game sooner since I got the game about 2 weeks into 87
Met some really cool people in this game willing to help a new player out especially when it came to the logistics side of the game.
-Pros-
*Theres alot of ways to contribute to help your side win by doing logistics, combat or by building stuff and the thing I like is that no matter what your doing it feels like what you do matters and has impact on the game every little bit helps *everything in this game from guns, tanks, artillery to ammo and so on was built or sourced from other players.
*large persistent war with 30-40 players on each side is cool being on the frontline for the first time theres no experience like it the joys of taking that first town or point with your alliance is amazing.
*the play area is pretty big and there always something going on with 6 or 7 front line zones you'll find combat pretty fast
*taking it easy and doing logistics helping supply the front is also a cool experience

-not really cons but stuff to look out for-
*I recommend watching Moidawg on Youtube and watching some tutorials on the game so your not totally lost on some of the more complex parts of the game 
*this game takes alot of coordination from other players while the game is fairly solo friendly some late game tanks and Artillery takes dedicated clans to build and maintain.
*people complain about alts all the time and I think I can count on two hands how many times I've seen a player alting or trying to sabotage there own alliance don't be a paranoid Badman Larry and think every new player is an alt.
*the community has its toxic and hateful players but by and large the Foxhole community is great, welcoming and friendly.

-CONS!-
*FACILITIES this adds another layer of unneeded complexity to an already complex game adding its own specific vehicles and upgrades and its own special mats and if you not in a sizable clan then your basically locked out of its content. its just a headache to interact with and its almost a full time job on its own to maintain facilities and bases players will either join a clan or just quit the game when they start to learn about facilities its basically the Great Filter of Foxhole.

*The combat and aiming can be a bit jarring and clunky at first but the longer you play the more you get used to the 3rd person overhead view.
*theirs still alot of holes and gaps in the terrain that will get you stuck the !unstuck command will be your best friend.
*trees need to be removable they just get in the way and in some areas just random or blocking stuff unnecessarily.
*Weather specifically snow in this game is annoying just no just play another game or switch to a front without it just a headache to deal with or mitigate its affects

This game is fun but not ready for an official release and is probably the worst thing they could have done this game feels still in beta to me so go with that in mind when buying this game still needs some basic polishing up.",1675845212,1675845437,True,0,0,0.493273526430130005,0,True,False,False

People can get try-hard esk ala Eve Online, but not everyone is that way. Look on the Discord, plenty of smaller casual clans. 

Set boundaries for yourself. as it's an easy game to lose entirely too much time in if you chase the grind.

Pulled by peer pressure into the Colonial faction during the last days of War 96, I began my Foxhole experience under heavy artillery fire, spawning in a town base with my fellow Collies. A few things caught my attention almost instantly. This was the first game where people were so willing to use their mics and speak. Men called out for fire support, enemy positions and movements, officers took charge and led desperate countercharges to blunt the Warden advance even as we lost trench after trench, pillbox after pillbox, with nothing but rifle, stickies and Bomas in hand. The war truly came alive for me then, dragged into a massive Dunkirk scenario where we were charged with holding the line as we evacuated the seaport of valuable supplies, and pulled out our vehicles to avoid a complete encirclement and loss. Foxhole gave me stories to tell my friends that I had never had before. It introduced me to its wonderful community of veterans that I had managed to integrate with, and fight alongside in hopeless charges, desperate defenses, daring raids and rousing victories.

Side note: I still remember the first ever armored action I took part in, a six hour tank graveyard just outside The Blemish as an armored car gunner, helping to keep anti-tank infantry off allied tanks. I remember most fondly the hospitality of the random SSgt that took me under his wing and commanded our small detachment of ACs and medium tanks to a resounding victory.

In a game where artillery pieces take two men minimum and three optimally to fire, where tank drivers require callouts from their commanders and gunners to function; vehicle crews and small squads function all at once. Things go smoothly or horribly wrong in a second- tanks can get swarmed, surrounded and ambushed. Infantrymen take two or three shots to kill, and bleeding mechanics keep Leeroy Jenkins-es at bay. You learn first to unlearn the FPS mentality of charge in, take the fight and damn the consequences, then learn again to seize opportunities, be daring and inspire your fellow comrades to turn the fight back in your favor. 

I had the distinction and honor of fighting alongside remarkable men and women all around the world that I would not have had the chance to meet elsewhere, shoulder to shoulder rushing trenches with bayonets fixed, shouting commands in tanks as we took part in massive tank line battles, or simply chatting with as we brought logistics from the backline to a nearly cut off frontline base. There is a sense of solidarity and friendship that I have so rarely experienced anywhere else online with strangers that I found comforting. In the next wars or so I found my calling, as a frontline battle medic. I indulged my inner rambo at times, charging into fire to save downed teammates, picking up weapons off the corpses on the ground to make my last stands with my Collie brothers in arms. As a lesser-picked but valuable role, I never once felt like what I did was not impactful. No matter how small of a cog in the machine I was, I still felt vital, be it to the squad, or to the front that I fought with. 

It's no surprise then that I got heavily invested into the game. During the next few wars, I started to get more serious with the game, learning advanced mechanics and the complicated internal politics of clan alliances, high commands that ran the show from behind the curtain, tagging along risky operations with bigger, heavier toys and staggering logistics requirements that took days to prepare. These operations were amazing, regardless of the outcome, but I also got to see some of the dark sides of Foxhole (that any other community would reasonably face). 

Alting, toxicity, divisions along clan lines, my experiences were consistent with that of many other reviewers. Not only that, logistics and facilities are a drain to do. I remember at one point spending my entire free day farming up supplies and materials for the front, only to realize I would have to spend 10 hours a day, every day, if I wanted to play with the big toys that larger clans could muster. Until then, I could only hope to be lucky and join an open call for a battle tank if I wanted one, or forced my small band of friends to grind with me until we got a battle tank of our own. 

Yes, one could say this is by design. You aren't meant to make the super heavy behemoths on your own and en masse spam them everywhere. If you did want to play in one of those big tanks you could always ask, that is true. This is where divisions and the aforementioned problems come into play though. Big clans won't give you a battle tank for free. You have to be trustworthy enough for them to let you have one. Yes, whereas crewing one doesn't really demand much in terms of credentials or credibility, but if said big clans don't operate in your timezone, you're out of luck unless you really band together people to do just that. I couldn't blame a big clan for guarding their prizes though, these expensive monsters are amazing to play, can turn the tide of losing fronts, but are also made with the blood sweat and tears of dozens of people across weeks. Losing all that to someone that turned out to be an alt, or a numbskull, it hurts. This isn't helped by the long, inane logistics systems. Take fuel production for instance. Nowadays, if you want to bring diesel in to power a facility, you would have to, as a solo player or a small clanman: get scrap with a truck or flatbed, refine into diesel, get a flatbed to transport a fuel container that needs to be filled at a refinery with your diesel and drive down to your facility, to get perhaps 2-3 hours of operation power depending on what you want to do. Following that, there are garrison supplies to queue to transport, basic materials to refine and transport, all of which requiring specialized equipment to efficiently haul their base components to refine, and specialized transport equipment like shipping crates and ships to bring to the designated location. 

This massive investment is possible as a solo man, but rarely done- only highly dedicated players take on the task of producing and running their own facilities, producing their own specialized equipment, etc. You have to join a large clan to play with some of the tools of war then. Now there isn't anything inherently wrong with that, but these commitments stack, and ultimately drain you day by day, if you invest your heart into the war. Scrap gathering is calming, therapeutic, even. I loved hammering away and scrooping with my fellow logimen. But scrap gathering day after day to keep your clan's facilities running feels more like a second job than a game. 

Given all this of course, you don't have to get into the logi game if you don't want to. You can choose to do whatever you want to do- though the tradeoff is that you may not get to play with ALL the things in the game that you want to. That doesn't take away from the fact that I love this game. It's a grind, as all MMOs tend to be, but it's fun, rewarding and the most unique experience I have had in a long time. Though, one job is quite enough for me, so I'm taking a temporary break from the war, and making a promise to not get so involved in the war when I do return. 

The memories I had from this game are something else, as are the wonderful personalities I met while serving in the Colonial Legion and the Warden Army. I hope to return to the fold soon, now as a Second Lieutenant with enough experience to bumble my way through commanding a line or help my fellow comrades learn the game.

Most days both midweek and weekend you're sitting in a queue for 20-60+ mins to get into a frontline hex, even during night shift when the player count is super low there's still a queue.
Constant bugs: lately mass disconnects, 
30 seconds-1 minute respawn timers if you're playing frontline infantry.

You build a base/facility, and are required to feed it Garrison Supplies, which is fine but the devs haven't changed the production/consumption math. They want to force large groups of players to have a shared burden, great theory, but explain why you're trying to force that upon players that do not find that fun, instead of making it easier for the players that choose to do it? 

You play logi, you do everything that's not fun just to provide for your teammates and feel appreciated, you still have to sit in queue just to drop off your supplies and not fight, imagine producing equipment for 1-3 hours, taking a 15-25 min drive, refueling along the way, checking your radio to avoid ambushes, navigating the roadways, only to arrive at your destination and have to wait 10-80mins to enter the zone and drop off your truck load.

Alts/trolls/griefers: are everywhere and rarely punished, in game clans/vets have to pretty much police any poor behavior. The ingame reporting system's worst punishment is a 24-48 ban. And usually doesnt go into effect same day.

1600 hours in, a few years spent playing, amazing concept poor execution and poor management genuinely chase players away in droves. The concept and game play is great, it's fun enough for you to come back everytime there's something new or when you forget why you left. But it's not a game that respects your time, or your fun. The core devs are a bit weird to say the least, and just are not on the same page with the community or the market. Their business model still reflects the game as it was when they released into early access 5-6 years ago. The interest is there, the community is passionate, the game sells, gets picked up by content creators, and while it doesn't actually lack longevity; it punishes you if you and your friends do not make it a second job, which would be fine if it was a subscription based model. But for a game you pay for once, the amount of time you spend putting in work i.e. doing non fun things, like scrap mining, driving, swinging a hammer/shovel in the same location for over 60 seconds if you want to build something, the amount of time you spend having actual fun is minimal. Granted when you do have fun, it's amazing, nothing else really like it in other games. 

In my opinion it's a very min/max game becuz of the time investment required to do anything, once you get a few hundred hours in and you realize how inefficient or wasteful doing the fun stuff is, kinda forces you down the PVE rabbit hole.
I could kill 300 players a day in one life, and have less impact than a guy logging on at 3am for 15 minutes and setting fire to a base that took 3 hours to build.

If you're thinking about buying, I wouldn't. You'll get your money's worth in terms of hours you put in, but you'll spend 20% of your time in a respawn screen, 20% pulling your gear, dying looting in combat, 15% of your time getting yelled at for not knowing wth is going on. And truthfully you log in again after that, either all the map gains you made are either gone or you're fighting in the exact same place 48 hours later. 

Minor gripe, I've been around for 50+ wars, even winning a war doesn't feel as rewarding as it should to be honest, there's no character progression tied to it, no perks, or history log to say you participated in these battles. No medals or commendations, no leaderboard.

Most fun you'll have is after your first few days where you kinda figure things out, but its all downhill from there after you learn how to do everthing else in game. All of it is actually fun, but is it enough fun to justify farming? Probably not.

The game has vast, beautiful maps with large scale player-run operations. The game is what you make of it- you can make stuff in a factory, deliver stuff to the frontlines in ships, trucks, and trains, or spend all day simply banging away at the enemy with a rifle. There are tanks, naval landings, a well developed artillery system, massive player-made bases, and the option to play either as a solo (like me) or join a clan to team up for larger operations.

Two criticisms most common in negative reviews are 1) the player base is toxic, and 2) the best stuff isn't available for solo players. There are some toxic people out there (as in any online game) but in my experience with the ""Warden"" faction by far most folks prefer to help new players than to harass them. If you ask for help and say ""I want to learn how to do X""- most of the time someone will volunteer to show you how it works (I do!) People will also trust you more after your first few hours in the game, once they see you aren't a fake account for the other side (an ""alt""). As for the ""best stuff"" being limited to clans- it's true that some of the fancy stuff like trains and supertanks are too big an undertaking for an individual, but you can still drive a  regular tank or take part in almost anything else as a solo. And many clans are casual ""play as much as you want"" operations.

You can play without a microphone, but for best experience having audio is strongly recommended (especially for combat, less so for logistics players). I'll also note that this game requires a time investment for best results- infantry can shoot each other for 10 minutes at a time, but tank operations usually require 1-2 hours to pick up a tank, drive to the front, fight, and return to base.

So I hope to see you in the game- and don't hesitate to say hi if you do!",1674363312,1674363312,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

People sprint around in circles and snap to you, hitting you from long range with rifles that take quite some time for the aim reticle to close for a pinpoint shot, but it's clear there are hacks that allow for constant pinpoint accuracy. I've tried this method time and time again, thinking of any way possible they could have 100% accuracy while sprinting, and it never works for me, so it's blatant cheating. Hacks are allowing people to play this game like it's Call of Duty, and it's cringe worthy.

There is a really gross trend of people intentionally supporting the enemy team, or creating alts to do so.     Loading up trucks of supplies and dumping them in the river.

An excellent fusion of factory game, trucking simulator, and slower paced (well thought out) shooter this game merges three genres and thus has something for lots of different people. The persistent warfare means you can always login and contribute to the war effort to whatever extent you want before calling it a night. It also means that your contributions trickle into your entire team's effort, making everything you do part of a greater effort (or completely wasted!). 

This game isn't for everyone but it is certainly a lot for those who enjoy it.

The Good: Persistent large scale war, combat creativity; patience; and teamwork are strongly rewarded, supportive community, tons of different roles and niches to fill
The Bad: It's got a gnarly learning curve, the tutorials are frankly awful, a lot of the UI choices are baffling, many of the gameplay balance decisions feel rushed and are arbitrarily restricting, factory ""chores"" can make gameplay extremely tedious at times for all but the largest clans.
