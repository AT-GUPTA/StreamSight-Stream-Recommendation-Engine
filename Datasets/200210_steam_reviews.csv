The game features random world generation and rewards exploration while at the same discouraging it in some ways: This may include: Encountering monsters that are to dangerous for your build, wandering into territories that are to dangerous and are inhabited by monsters far too strong for you to handle, and last but not least; entering dungeons containing dangerous bosses and even more powerful monsters (which may drop rare loot: Ironically somewhat encouraging exploration of these territories). Generally speaking, you're going to die a lot in this game... But you can overcome it through a lot of patience, nimble maneuvering, adapting to enemy patterns, retrieving good loot, and cooperative play... You may like this game if you like RPG games where you acquire loot and that have rogue like elements: if you like difficult RPG's-- you're going to like this game. On the other hand though, some of the harder bosses and monsters in the game have insane attack patterns that are reminiscent of bullet hell games.

Edit: For the sake of being 500 hours in I'm gonna rewrite this as an actual review. This game is one of my favorites to waste time on, due to the fact that there is ALWAYS a form of progression, whether that be items or fame or trying to earn new skins, there is always a goal to accomplish. It can quickly go from a quick time wasting game, to a full fledged dedication, which is what I love about the game, the fact that it can appeal to more than one group of players. Pets and microtrasactions have plagued the game for a while, but that doesn't change the fact that you yourself do not have to pay for anything. Sure, it helps (as of writing this I have a combined total of like $100 spent on here), but I didn't buy a character slot till I got my first 4/8 (half maxed) character, and I did just fine with one slot.

I'd never thought I would come back to this game again. Kabam sold ROTMG to Deca, and it seems the new company is making the game a whole lot better. I'll try to play it again, but who knows? I left this type of game to try others.

Kabam, fix what you're doing, you're letting some of the best games die on pc!!!
I used to play this game on the kongerate when wild shadows owned the game, however simce my pc broke, I didn't come back for a while. Fast foward to today, where I see the game on steam, and I decided to give it a run. First thing I see, ads all over the place, and posters begging you to buy stuff you didn't need. Not Good. When I entered a server, four words total: Bots. There was bots spamming the chat, and back then the Nexus, there was people being cooperative. Nowadays, there are bots and scammers trying to get your items for free. I saw that players could also buy WC tops,a d that wasn;t so good. 3 bucks for a cosmic, not bad, but thet makes the game economy go downhill. 
All in all, Kabam fix what you did, or else I would not come back for years. You even failed to revive all the dead from the Nexus spawning! There are deaths from the kills of O2 and others in the Nexus that you haven't revived! FIX THIS GAME BACK TO WHAT IT WAS FORMERLY WAS!",1487607303,1487607303,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

 However; in recent updates, the controls are now TERRIBLE, and are barely even responsive, (either that, or it's my crap internet, from ""AT&T"") and that PISSED me off, into a meaningful RAGE QUIT, only without anger, involved! I hope they fix the controls.

 The gameplay however, it isn't HORRIBLE, and the game itself, has a GREAT basic idea, with a simplified action MMORPG, with a permadeath based system!

 Will I ever reccomend this? If they ever fix the controls, then the answer is ""yes""; otherwise, if it's NOT the game itself, but a crappy wi-fi connection, then I should HIGHLY suggest sticking with some of the BEST video games, that don't USE online gameplay. Like ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"", or even ""Mighty No. 9"".

 In my honest critique, ""Mighty No. 9"" was ONLY ""hated"" by fans, because they were expecting WAY too much, for a ""Mega Man"" alternative. But however; believe it or not, I played it, and it ACTUALLY isn't that bad! For $20 or less, it's actually a good deal! And if you LIKE the classic ""Mega Man"" series, you should POSSIBLY like ""Mighty No 9."", as well!
