Only professional gamers, streamers and sweatlords who desperately want to be streamers play Apex on a daily basis : If you aren't playing like them, you're gonna get destroyed pretty fucking hard, on every single confrotation. There is no room to think and planify. 

For all of them, every single aspect in Apex is taken so serious they feel entitled. They treated Apex Legends as a national esport; one wrong move (ex.: not landing on a high contested POIs), and you'll get verbally destroyed by your teammates. Thinking outside of the box is a blasphemy to them.

The MMR/SBMM/ whatever matchmaking Respawn is using is the worst experience ever : Unless you have amazing skills, you'll lose a series of matches in a row. 100% Guarantee. Then, the game will put you into an easier lobby so you get a couple of kills, and after that match, Respawn will send you to high skilled lobbies for you to lose more. Wow! What an amazing system, Respawn! So fair and balanced ! And of course, the fans are okay with this. ""Protect the lower skilled players"", my ass : Respawn's MMR takes those low skilled players to feed the more talented players and streamers, and I know, because I'm one of the low skilled players. Even with an overall 1K/D, Respawn will make sure you'll get fucked by better gamers against your skills, even you have the worst K/Ds, and you feel your skills aren't up to the challenges.

Speaking of match making, every lobby, either pubs or ranked, feels like the biggest tournament even conceived : If you try to have fun in the lobby (by that, I mean not play the exact same way the progamers/streamers/sweaties are playing), you lose. Simple as that. And then when you try something else they don't like (ex.: play strategically with placements and loot), you'll receive toxic abuse. There is no middle ground in this game. As long as heirlooms recolours are selling high, Respawn seems okay with a toxic community.

It's sad, really, because the gameplay is one of the best FPS around: there is not another game close to what Apex is offering (except Titanfall 2, in some ways).

Having fun in a videogame is a foreign concept at Respawn, and its community as a whole seems to agree with the devs's vision.

I don't often write reviews, but I feel compelled to express my disappointment with Season 18.

The matchmaking system is seriously flawed. In many instances, I find myself pitted against either low-level cheaters or seasoned predators, which has seriously hampered the enjoyment for my friends and me. And this is on non-Asian servers; I can only imagine what the experience would be like there.

Regarding the in-game shop and events, the offerings have been lackluster at best. It seems that Respawn and EA are attempting to recoup losses from Seasons 16 and 17, but the current state of the game provides little incentive for financial investment. This is coming from someone who has purchased over 1,200 gold skins and 22 heirlooms. If things continue this way, I foresee a significant decline in the player base, and it's disappointing that the developers don't seem to acknowledge this.

The gameplay itself has become so unbalanced that it encourages teaming, which in my view undermines the competitive nature of the game. It's evident that the studio's focus has shifted away from the needs and experiences of average players. I've decided to step back from the game for now and will consider returning once improvements have been made.

Are you out of your freaking mind??? WTF! WTF is this normal game mode!!! Do not force your customers to play shift!!! There is no loot!!!! And fix your freaking match making system!!! If you knew the old map is shift (that's why you changed it dramatically), don't just put it back in a even worse form!!! You want money, I get it, and you know the easiest way to get money for you?? Make players like your game!!!! Not Making them QUIT !!!!

Previously, you had the decency to allow players to choose what to play, normal or some horseshift mode. This time?? What is wrong with you, Respawn????? STOP FEEDING US SHIFT !!!! Have you learnt nothing since the last time this game has died??? 

WHO is in you management team !!! WHO are your PROJECT MANAGERS ???
FIRE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They Clearly do NOT know SHIFT !!!!!!

The learning curve is steep and the community makes it steeper. Smurfing is rampant and always will be, and even if it weren't an issue, matchmaking will always put you in lobbies with someone who's macros and soft aim bot make them impossible to hit while they're zeroed in on your forehead or predator ranked players.

These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scam-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo.

Any more than that and you run the risk of rage quitting and uninstalling due to one or more of the issues I list below. You have been warned.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game has now been around for over 2 years. PLENTY of time for the developers to establish a trusting relationship with their players/users. Typically, that is what a decent developer does: A swath of players will complain about a certain aspect of the game and the developers will actually listen and at least make attempts at fixing the problems.

NOT. IN. THIS. CASE. EVER.

I understand that a portion of what a game developing company does is supposed to generate revenue for the company - And they do! A separate, and equally important, aspect is that the company is also supposed to improve the game by listening to their users and addressing issues in a timely manner - hopefully, before their users get angry enough to drop the game altogether.

This is precisely where EA/Respawn have failed. And I will break it down for you, precisely HOW they have failed.

1. Cheaters:
This game has an inordinate amount of cheaters. There really is no easy way to say it. And it is OBVIOUS and BLATANT. EA relies upon the absolutely defunct Easy Anti-Cheat system. Please, hold your laughter... In their defense, however, they have made sure to spread rumors of a revamped anti-cheat system, designed specifically for Apex. The real issue is how LONG they have been spreading this rumor. I can only assume that it was a PR stunt to quiet those complaints of cheaters. How can I make that assumption? Mainly because they seem to focus on things of little or no consequence - Like adding badges to shield batteries and medkits... I mean, what?! Why would you focus on cosmetics when you have a huge cheater problem?!

2. Match-Making (MM):
Very rarely have I seen an MM quite as laughable as the one being used in Apex. I understand that there it a lot of complexity involved, what with ranked splits resetting every month (for the most part) and making everyone, essentially, noobs. But, there is a SUPER easy way to fix it (which I will detail later). I understand why they do the ranked split as well: they want to force players to play more often to keep their ranking high - DUH! The more players there are, the more likely it is that they make money and that those players will spread the word so that even more players will play and give them even more opportunity to make more money. But an MM based solely on your current in-game rank is absolutely asinine. And that is just ranked. What if you don't play ranked? Good luck! You could be paired against ANYONE, professional players and noobs alike.

3. Maps:
Currently, there are a total of five maps in Apex (for BR). Every season they have two maps in rotation for pub games. TWO. And those two maps rotate every hour or so. For ranked matches, they use ONE. Over and over, on and on... Maps should be randomized except in tournaments. Going into a game, you should not know where you are going to land, what characters you should be playing, etc. It should be a friggin' BATTLE ROYALE! Formulate your plan based on who is on your team and what the map is, ad-hoc, just like everyone else. No one should know what map your're landing on until the drop ship starts its flight across it. Add some aspect mystery to the game.

4. Weapons:
There is a good selection of weapons in the game, but the real issue is with practicality. Take, for instance, the so-called top sniper rifle in the game - the Kraber. It's supposed to be a .50-cal sniper rifle. It LOOKS great, but that's where the good news ends. If you hop into the firing range and test out all of the sniper rifles available to you, you will catch the glaring issues. The Sentinel, the Longbow, and the Charge Rifle all use sniper rounds (NOT a .50; Something smaller like a .308). All three can reach WAY out and touch your enemy. The Charge Rifle can literally reach all the way across an area of the map - over 800m. The Sentinel and Longbow can shoot pretty accurately to 400+m (depends on optics in use, graphics, screen size, FOV, etc). With the Kraber, the bullet starts dropping wildly at just 200m. Yeah...the highest-powered weapon in the game, using the highest-caliber bullet can BARELY eke out a 400m hit with accuracy. Let's add to this the 30-30 Repeater and the G7 Scout - A heavy ammo, medium range pew-pew and light ammo medium range pew-pew, respectively. Both of these rifles can out-shoot the Kraber with accuracy. WHY? And the Charge Rifle - Why does this not use energy ammo? I mean...CHARGE Rifle...it shoots a beam of light!...sigh...

5. Legends:
Don't get me wrong, there is a use for every single legend in the game. Whether it be for hiding, sniping, guarding, tracking...it's useful stuff. It is also getting really out of hand. First, how many freaking legends does a game like this need? At some point in the near future, you could probably have a pub match where every single player in the game is a different legend. I'm not even joking though I wish I were. Second, when EA unveils a new legend, they typically add it to the game and then they forget its existence. No re-balancing of legends, no fixing bugs, etc. And if they DO fix something with a legend, it is usually a heavy-handed nerf beyond what anyone that actually PLAYS the game was expecting. The abilities of the legends are pretty unique, but the overall effect of those abilities is copied across other legends. The exception to this is both Loba and Lifeline. Loba has her black market (so you don't have to hunt around an area if you know what you are looking for) and Lifeline has her health drone - The only legend that can heal your flesh-wounds. Other than those two, you can pretty much classify all other legends into categories like defense, offense, or recon and their abilities, while varied, have ultimately the same effect on the game. Offense legends can quickly get up in your face and kill you, defense legends can slow your entry into an area while sapping your health, and recon legends can track you and your team down. Simple. And boring too. Meh.

On to my ideas on how we can fix BOTH the cheater AND MM issues in Apex:

1. New DB table - Player AVG DMG (>10) Last 10 Games (PAD).

2. New DB table - Player AVG DMG Rating (PADR); 11-300: Rating 0; 301-700: Rating 1; 701-1200: Rating 2; 1201-2000: Rating 3; 2001-3200: Rating 4; 3201-4200: Rating 5 (AND account marked for review); 4200+: Rating 6 (Insta-banned - If the pros can't do it, pubs can't either without cheating).

*NOTE - Keep in mind that these are averaged over the last TEN games where damage done was greater than 10.

3. Players can only be matched with other players of the same PADR -/+1.

4. Teams have an AVG DMG Rating (TADR) of ((PADR1+PADR2+PADR3)/3)-1 (always rounded UP) for BR Trios. 1 player with R2, 2 players with R3 would be ((R2+R3+R3)/3)-1=R2. Teams can only be matched with other teams of the same TADR.

THREE birds, one stone. Fix MM, catch a boatload of cheaters, AND the games are more fun because you are playing with players very close to your own skill level instead of non-stop sweats OR non-stop noobs.

*I'm not saying it is not possible to play a 4K+ DMG game. I AM saying it IS impossible to play 10 *consecutive* 4K+ DMG games without cheating. Again, if the pros can't do it, neither can the pubs without programmatic assistance (cheating).",1674342950,1674342976,True,2,1,0.544022560119628906,1,True,False,False

Apex could be great - there are aspects to it that are fantastic such as the movement, the variety of legends and weapons to choose from, even the colour palette and map design (for the most part)...but the bugs, the poor servers and the cheaters are going to be its eventual downfall if Respawn doesn't get its act together soon, especially with new FPS games on the horizon. Personally, I could never get over the bizarre choice to have punches deal absurd damage (at least early game with white/blue armour) while 10-20 rounds of light/heavy ammo more or less hits for the same amount. It's a weird, one-step-too-far case of 'jumping the shark' or 'nuking the fridge' that's been in the game since day 1.

The fundamental mechanics of the game is also clearly conducive to 3rd party opportunism from the get-go and, once past the mid-game stage, serves up Gold/Red shield bullet-sponge fiestas ad nauseam. More often than not I have more fun in the early stages of a game when white/blue and maybe the odd purple armour is mostly all you see. I'm inclined to think that the game would be less tedious if Respawn had stopped at Purple or Gold armour (the latter being very rare). 

Ultimately though, for all of its good qualities, Apex just isn't hitting the mark for me anymore. The bugs, the bad servers and the bypassed Easy anti-cheat just makes for a BR that could be great, but often serves up a disappointing experience that is more of a miss than a hit.

Hardcore at higher levels with quite few cheaters from time to time
Hard game to pick up if your new but experience will come with time
split second discisions make the difference between life and death
on bad days if u loose more then 3 ranked games  in a row just chill go do some other stuff and return sometimes while climbing you'll get stuck but just keep improving youll soon climb out
can't stress the importance of coms and if you can find a group of friends to play with
Overall a fun game.

Much like other clones of this type, it lacks any real meaningful difference genre save for one, ""supers"". Much like overwatch and games like league of legends that adds a different spin to combat that can turn the tables of combat from the attackers to defenders. Other then that, its a colorful clone of any other arena that drops people in. Though, it could be stated that any given genre can only be expanded so much. However, this is made by the same people as titan fall and titans are even referenced in game. An ability to be able to call that in or ANYTYHING ELSE would be interesting. another great idea for the game would ditch the flying altogether. it boring as hell as everyone does it. want to be different? figure out a better spawn mechanic.

Just coming back to shooters after almost 10 years now that my rural internet can handle it. 
The Good.
The game is fun first of all. The gun play top notch. Last shooter I enjoyed this much was Unreal Tournament GOTY edition in the early 90s. The legends are well rounded, I am surprised by how much. It appears to have a deep backstory though I care little for lore in this type of game. The avatars are very ""politically correct"" so I assume the back stories are progressive as well. If this offends you, consider this a warning. The maps are sexy as are the avatars you control. New content often.
The Bad (possibly).
The player base in Pubs can be pretty toxic but I went in expecting this. The skill cap is also high, lots of sweats running around, the player base as a whole has skills. The store shop can be expensive if you are a completion type of person with the extra digital toys, but it is not pay to win in any way. Servers can be a little shabby at patch times surprisingly for such a large company. Cheating exist pretty liberally late at night or in ranked play especially.  Better get some buddies eventually or you will hit a wall in your upward momentum, its a team game at heart.

I would like to see more investment in club play such as badges for clubs, rankings, even logos. Something to make me wanna join a group. I hope they build on the new Arena setup. Right now its pretty much used by me to warm up.",1622173040,1622173040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They have 4 queues to chose from (trios, duos, seasonal, and ranked) and for 2 hours of every 4, you can only play on a map you hate.  Okay, but what if you like World's Edge?  The stupid map rotation system is eventually going to lock you into a map you hate as well.
