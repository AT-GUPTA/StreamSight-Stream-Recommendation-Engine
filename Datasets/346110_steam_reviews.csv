Dinosaurs are fun to tame (Except for literally all of ark additions.), satisfying to use, and the game's complexity makes it like no other!
The broken things in the game show you that maybe it's not actually broken, maybe you just gotta consider that that would've happened to you irl as well (Talking about Baryonyx tail spin or megarabies for example)
The stat point system is surprisingly fun and once you get the hang of the game, it'll suck you in for fun like you've never had before. Just don't give up at the start when raptors are still your biggest threat, because trust me, once you get past that point, it'll turn into an elevated experience.

TLDR, if you really want to play this game, play PvE/Singleplayer.

This game is a really cool concept, but the game itself is broken.

Main problems:

Major performance issues to the point where the quality of your PC almost doesn't matter.

Server Lag (obviously it is very difficult to have non-laggy servers in an open world game like this one, but it is worse than any other game of this genre that I have seen).

Countless random bugs such as with hit registration, getting stuck in parts of the map, getting stuck in dinos, structures not snapping correctly or even just not building at all (might be linked to lag), and crashing.

PvP is unplayable. Coming from not only the issues above but also the horrendous balancing of the game from a PvP standpoint. Large groups that have been established for a long time have total control of servers and have gear that is impossible to compete with as a solo player or small group starting out. This is mainly a problem on official servers but the gear part is definitely a factor on unofficial/community ones as well. Other balancing issues include items in the game such as the bola, a projectile that when hit on an enemy player, makes them unable to move for 30 seconds. Other more minor concepts such as the existence of caging worsen the PvP experience but overall these are the primary things that make PvP as unplayable as it is.

I wouldn't count on any of these issues being fixed, at least any time remotely soon. The developers of this game have a ""quantity over quality"" mindset, and instead of fixing the existing game, choose to just release and cram more content into the game.

Despite all this I think this can be a very fun PvE game, especially with friends. It has what is in my opinion a very cool story and a fun progression route that gives you a very unique experience when compared to any other open world survival out there.",1538059593,1708466872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oh ARK, what could you've been if it wasn't for some incompetent decisions made by original creators? What if Wildcard just waited a bit more with their release to avoid that $40 million lawsuit?

The game started as a simple survival with dinosaurs, where you begin with primitive tools, armor and structures, then advance and with time obtain better and better technology to prevail. Most things weren't overshadowed or useless, because worse gear would allow you to obtain some things very early in the game, while the better one was locked behind a huge amount of grind in mid- to late-game.
Then the devs started adding the story, tek, DLCs, new dinos etc. and I'm cool with that. ARK had potential to become the ultimate survival sandbox experience with all that wacky stuff that was being added. Game was still pretty balanced, became a bit easier and forgiving in some parts, it has become very customizable in terms of difficulty, and the player was given more options and toys to play around with.

What I'm not cool with is how they threw all the balance they had through the window with the release of Extinction and each subsequent DLC, adding more overpowered tools and tames that would make vanilla creatures borderline useless and annoy players on PVP servers once transfers were turned on. It became the definition of pay to win.

The game is also riddled with bugs since the day of release. Dinos and lootbags spawning/falling out of bounds, softlocks, random crashses, rocks and trees spawning inside player's base despite turning it off in settings and other specific stuff that even checking file compatibility via Steam or redownloading wouldn't fix. I've played around with godmode, destroyed one terminal and it didn't spawn back even after downloading the game again. It's like they're uploading your saved world to steam cloud but instead of dinos, structures etc. they upload the base world with the tweaks you did to it.

Most features remain unstable/unfinished, like Primitive+ DLC and procedurally generated worlds. Re-fertilizer still doesn't work and taming rates for some creatures aren't balanced properly despite them being in the game for as long as 5 years.

There's a lot of optimization issues, however with all the games made on Unreal Engine that I've played, I think it might be the issue with engine itself or just my PC having 1050ti and being really old.

The worst part being, none of those issues will ever be adressed, because devs moved on to work on ARK: Survival Ascended and ARK II and because of Snail Games' greedy tactics.

ARK has creative creature designs, a fun premise and gameplay, especially with DLC creatures, looks pretty and you can still rent servers to play with friends if you want, I can't find any other positive aspect of this game.

As of writing, the game slowly loses interest. Less and less people play it. Modders and youtubers have moved on, so now workshop is spammed with Chinese potential IP grabbers, while normal mods are left discontinued in the back of workshop. This is the sad end of a game that had incredible potential but instead became a mediocre, unoptimized mess.",1707655066,1708456328,False,21,1,0.652817964553833008,1,True,False,False

From the moment I stepped onto the shores of its mysterious island, I was drawn into a world of peril, wonder, and endless possibilities.

One of the things I love most about ARK is its sense of immersion. The vibrant and diverse landscapes, teeming with life both ancient and fantastical, make every moment spent in the game feel like a grand adventure. From dense forests to soaring mountains to vast oceans, there's always something new to explore and discover.

But what truly sets ARK apart is its dynamic ecosystem. The ability to tame and ride dinosaurs, from the mighty T-Rex to the graceful Pteranodon, adds an exhilarating element of companionship and danger to the game. The thrill of bonding with these prehistoric beasts and using them to navigate the world is an experience unlike any other.

ARK also excels in its sense of progression and achievement. From humble beginnings as a stranded survivor, I've built thriving bases, mastered new technologies, and faced off against fearsome creatures and rival tribes. The sense of accomplishment that comes with overcoming challenges and growing stronger is incredibly rewarding and keeps me coming back for more.

Of course, no review of ARK would be complete without mentioning the vibrant community that surrounds the game. Whether teaming up with friends to conquer a treacherous cave or engaging in epic battles against rival tribes, the camaraderie and shared experiences make every moment in ARK feel meaningful and memorable.

In conclusion, ARK: Survival Evolved is a game that has truly captured my heart. Its vast and vibrant world, dynamic gameplay, and sense of community have made it an unforgettable journey. If you're looking for a game that offers endless adventure and excitement, look no further than ARK: Survival Evolved. It's a wild and wondrous experience that I can't recommend highly enough.",1650195372,1708321178,True,0,0,0.494999974966049194,0,True,False,False

Yesterday, I was working at my job when I heard it. That fateful sound of a stat drop. I quickly leaped out of my chair and turned around, but the fucker had already used intimidate on all of my coworkers. I ran towards the bastard to punch him, but he set up stealth rocks in my cubicle, preventing me from working again. I quickly bolted to the office fridge to grab some ice cubes, but by the time I screamed “KYUREM USE ICE BEAM” the fucker had already u-turned out the window. I couldn’t work anymore because of the stealth rocks, so I had to leave so I could get a defog tm from my car.

As I grabbed the defog tm from my car, the thing jumped me from behind and used knock off, smacking the tm into the middle of the road. Before I could go grab it, a car raced by and crushed the tm, making it worthless. As I was standing there, shocked by what happened, the orange demon used earthquake on my car, giving me 4 flat tires simultaneously. Filled with rage, I grabbed a keldeo plush from my car, shoved a pair of spectacles onto its face, and hurled it at the thing, while screaming “KELDEO USE HYDRO PUMP.” Just like always, however, my hydro pump missed, and the fucker u-turned away again.

After I took a bus home, I was exhausted. As I was lying in my bed, depressed, my 6-year old daughter came into the room. She started talking about her favorite TV show, when suddenly, her face began to change. No. NO. As she continued talking, her face continued to morph, until it was identical to Landorus-Therian. I was ready this time, though. I quickly kicked off my shoes, revealing that I had duct-taped ice cubes to my feet. I then proceeded to triple axel the ever loving shit out of that thing. I looked up and screamed with joy, thinking it was all over. However, as I came to my senses, I saw my daughter unconscious on the floor and realized what I had done. The orange bastard had tricked me. My wife stood in the doorway, shocked, before she pulled out her phone and dialed 911.

ARK: Survival Evolved is definitely a game best enjoyed with friends. It's like Minecraft with dinosaurs, offering a unique twist with its indie charm that's both its strength and weakness. While its indie roots add a certain appeal, they also bring challenges, making the game somewhat difficult to grasp at first. It can be frustrating if you're not sure what you're doing, but it also offers countless hours of engagement as you and your friends work together to figure things out. I give it a thumbs up, mainly because playing with friends adds so much to the experience. However, personally, it's more about the shared moments with friends than the game itself, especially as the developers shift their focus to new projects and leave community management wanting.",1708157751,1708157751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the most frustrating, the most unfinished and the most poorly optimized game I have ever played. With that said, this game is very special to me. Starting a new server with the boys is one of the most fun experiences I've had while gaming and I will never forget the crazy adventures I've had with my friends in ARK. There was this one time when two of my friends had covered a mountain in turrets and everyone else had to remember the exact location of that mountain if they didn't want to die. There was this one time when my tribe had to move 3 times in one day because one of our friends kept finding our base. I could go on forever because ARK Survival Evolved is one of my favorite survival games of all time even though I wouldn't call it a ""great"" game. ASA sucks right now but I believe it has the potential to learn from ASE's mistakes and become the perfect survival game, but until that happens, I will keep playing this crazy dino game instead.",1698851105,1708100717,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

She was known for her grace, wisdom, and love for adventures. Despite her regal stature, she harbored a deep passion for gaming, a world that allowed her to escape the rigors of her royal duties.

One day, as she gazed into her enchanted scrying orb, she found herself transported into the digital realm of Steam. Confused and bewildered, she found herself standing in a marketplace filled with the shimmering allure of countless games. However, her attention was drawn to two games displayed on sale, both beckoning her with their promises of adventure.

As she peered into the orb of time, the two games materialized before her eyes. On one side, the lush landscapes of Ark Survival Evolved unfolded, filled with towering dinosaurs and untamed wilderness. On the other, the brutal and unforgiving world of Conan Exiles awaited her, promising a life of conquest and glory.

The queen, with her keen eye for detail, observed the graphics of both games. The landscapes of Conan Exiles were breathtaking, with vibrant, detailed environments that beckoned her to explore. The game allowed for stunning character customization, allowing her to embody a vision of regal beauty amidst the harsh world. She marveled at the intricate combat animations for each weapon, from the graceful arcs of a sword to the thunderous impact of a warhammer. The attention to detail in Conan Exiles set it apart, making the world come alive in a way that captivated her senses.

With a resolute nod, she made her decision, choosing Conan Exiles for its unparalleled beauty, attention to detail, and the promise of immersive combat experiences.

In an instant, she found herself immersed in the rugged terrain of Conan Exiles, her royal garments replaced by the attire of a warrior queen. Determined to prove her choice right, she rallied the people of the land to her cause, inspiring them with her wisdom and unwavering leadership.

As she delved deeper into the game, she encountered treacherous foes, harsh environments, and daunting challenges. Yet, with her tactical prowess and unyielding spirit, she led her people to victory after victory, establishing a mighty empire that stood as a testament to her strength and wisdom.

Throughout her journey, she encountered the inhabitants of the Conan universe, explaining to them why her choice of Conan Exiles over Ark Survival Evolved was the right one. She demonstrated the virtues of her chosen game, showcasing the depth of its world, the richness of its lore, and the satisfaction of its conquests.

As the days turned into years within the game, the queen faced countless trials, each one a testament to her resilience and unwavering determination. She fought valiantly, strategized cunningly, and united the people of the land under her banner.

Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, the queen emerged victorious, having conquered the challenges of Conan Exiles. As she stood atop the grand citadel she had built, she knew that her time in the digital realm had come to an end.

With a flash of light, the queen found herself back in the real world, the scrying orb glowing softly. As she gazed upon it, a sense of satisfaction filled her heart, for she had proven her wisdom and strength, both in the game and in the choice she had made.

And so, the queen's tale became a legend, a story of resilience, triumph, and the unfaltering spirit of a ruler who had transcended the boundaries of the digital world. Her choice of Conan Exiles over Ark Survival Evolved had not only led her to victory but had also cemented her legacy as a queen of unmatched wisdom and courage.",1708037602,1708037691,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has so wide exploration and several dlc expansions that are just as more space, it makes this game very heavy and consume up your disk capacity. (total space with all dlc up to ± 300GB)

This game is more fun if you play with your friends, for single players it will be difficult when grinding items make a base, etc.

They haven't fixed any bugs, and have left this game as still in early access but moved on. Then they've repackaged this piece of shit as Ark Survival Acended! Let me tell you, a piece of crap with prettier graphics is still a piece of crap. Do not be tempted into giving this shit company any money!
UPDATE Sep 2022: Decided to try it again, see if anything has improved. Nah, it still sucks. Still a very long startup and still prone to crashes. And I noticed it takes like 330 GB on the hard drive! Other games I have installed are around 35 GB max. This is a bloated monster that doesn't even run properly. Unstalling again. Sigh.
UPDATE Feb 2021: I've been away from the game for a long while and decided to give it another chance. It should be better than it used to be, right? Nope. It is actually much much worse. 
My game keeps crashing my high-powered Alienware computer. As in, Windows freezes and I have to do a hard shutdown. It is totally unplayable. I play on my own singleplayer game, and I thought the crash was due to the one mod I installed from Steam, for Structures Plus, because when I would open the engrams window (containing both regular engrams and S+ engrams) everything would slow down to a crawl. So after the first freeze/crash I removed the mod. And by the way, that first crash wiped out my save game so I had to start completely over with a new survivor. It didn't take long for the computer to crash again. I give up.
Don't even bother playing this game, it is so unstable. You can put in a lot of effort just to have it all wiped out. Not worth it.

Previous review from 2019:
For solo play: no I would not recommend it. It has TOO MANY CARNIVORES TRYING TO KILL YOU to be able to do much of anything besides die die die. The amount of carnivores vs herbivores is entirely unrealistic. There is a way to create a list of dinos that when they spawn, they actually spawn as something else. That way you can choose the worst carnivores and have them instead spawn as, I dunno, sheep or trilobites or nothing at all. That cuts the carnivore population down and makes this playable. Look up 'NPCReplacements' command for game.ini file.
For group play: I haven't played in groups so I can only say this is really the only way to survive the  carnivores.",1594751044,1707749716,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I truly f***** hate this game, it is an exercise in torture.. instead of promised fixes to the most idiotic bugs, they continued to pump out new maps and new dinos.. Albeit some are great! The bugs are still there YEARS later..
Then they improved the building system and promptly stuck it in a new ""polished"" version of the game to cash in on.

The game's still 'good' content wise. Just don't expect anything aside from dissappointment from the official servers and the teams that maintain them.

I won't bother with the anectdotes.

If you want to play ark and enjoy it, play unofficial servers run by people you trust. The official network is garbage, crossarks are a pointless endeavor because of the map balancing, and the toxic garbage that plays this game gets away with BS that would probably get you instantly banned because of issues such as pocket-devs.

Post Scriptum: This holds up for 2024, same advice except from what I can tell there are no more official servers? Probably for the better if it's true. Find a privately hosted server cluster and play there, far better that way.",1504052905,1707576028,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I like this game a lot for many reasons. But there's a single one, that makes this game horrible : the saves.
You need to make manual backup of the game because during your adventure, you will encounter at 100% a crash or something like that, which will destroy ALL YOUR progress.

From the moment you wake up on its mysterious shores, the game immerses you in a struggle for survival against dinosaurs, natural elements, and rival players. The vast, beautiful landscapes are both breathtaking and treacherous, providing endless opportunities for exploration and excitement.

ARK's crafting system allows for limitless creativity as you build shelters, tame and ride dinosaurs, and develop advanced technology to thrive in this unforgiving environment. The thrill of hunting powerful creatures or facing off against other players in PvP battles is unmatched, and the sense of accomplishment when you conquer the challenges of the wild is deeply satisfying.

However, ARK is not without its flaws. The game's steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, and the grind for resources and taming can feel repetitive at times. Server stability issues and occasional bugs can also detract from the overall experience.

Despite these shortcomings, ARK: Survival Evolved remains a captivating and immersive survival game that offers endless possibilities for adventure and exploration.

I replied if they were to release their domain: primeval strength, it might cause me a little trouble.
But would you lose to them ?
Nah, i'd win.
When I was on my way to the end-game, the giga, the most powerful dinosaur on the island and my only worthy opponent, released its ultimate technique: demonic Rage.
This powerful attack began annihilating every dinosaur in its path, but luckily for me, I already learned domain: creative mode and nullified the attack.
After a long-fought battle, I emerged victorious.
Then the giga asked me: are you the strongest because you're LeerFinger or are you LeerFinger because you're the strongest ?
Then I replied: when it comes to winning, my cheating abilities are truly sublime.

I hate to admit it, but I've never actually explored the true late game of ARK with Tek and all that fancy tech stuff - I haven't even fought a boss. This game unfortunately is one of few out there that can be 100%'d with console commands, which is an absolute shame, and is by far my biggest problem with this game - please update the achievements for future players so these can be truly earned! Ah who cares, Ascended is out and nothing will probably change.

Now it probably sounds like I hate ARK and honestly - I don't, I've been playing it on and off on console platforms for years now and the gameplay loop of building up bases and taming crazy dinos has always been extremely satisfying, and is 200% more fun with friends on a private server.

I've not bothered with the multiplayer when it comes to joining random servers on the browser, games that offer that functionality like ARK, Rust, Tarkov, and others haven't been my thing - but if you like that gameplay, this game will work well.

As for the gameplay down to the nitty gritty - I have a love/hate relationship with ARK. On one hand, I enjoy always having something to work towards and ARK is always able to do that for me; there's s many damn things to do in this game that I never could get bored. Plus the differing levels of challenge when it comes to what dinos you tame has always been a fun thing for me. My all time favorite ARK dino has always been one people love to hate - the Troodons. They stun you and kill you extremely fast, and you have to let 'em merc your tames to bring them on your side. I find that mechanic very interesting from a gameplay perspective, and while Troodons in the end are not the most stand out dino, they serve as some of the best dinos at your disposal when it comes to taming future dinos.

On the contrary....... ARK's early game is fucking hard, and can feel unfair in many ways. There's the Troodons that come out at night and merc your ass. There's dinos that snatch your stuff. There's dinos that swim and walk on land while being the size of a T-Rex. This game is brutal if you're not careful in the beginning, and having to gather even one or two specific materials for an item early to mid game (fucking crystals I swear,,,) can feel like you're risking it all for nothing.

ARK is without a doubt, a fun game, and luckily seems a lot better put together than it's unstable brother ARK Ascended. There's countless amounts of fun DLC for this game as well offering great and expansive maps, in addition to some super cool creatures and critters. If you're looking for a fun and challenging survival game, ARK is certainly a standout in the hit or miss genre that is survival games. If you're looking for a fun game to play with friends, then definitely check this one out!",1707211985,1707211985,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I've only played Ark in a private server with my bf (PVE). 
I was mainly in-charged of housekeeping- collect materials, feed our tamed dinos, house building & designing, etc.
He did the technical works- make advanced weapons, kill or tame powerful wild dinos, etc.

500 hrs in and we still haven't dig deep into the ocean yet, where even more dangerous dinos are.
Vast world with tons of things to do and explore.
Later in the game if you feel tired of collecting resources, feel free to look up at using cheat code in ark to get unlimited resource, however, I do encourage to at least experience this game without using cheats for your first 200 hrs.

Something about it just itches that inner child in me; I love to explore, I love to build, and I even moreso love dinosaurs I can be friends with. I had a whole community to play with, I hosted a server cluster, we had drama and politics, territory and conflicts, boss fights and resource missions. It was incredible. We also had insanely high level dinos hand-bred for weeks to be the absolutely positively best dinos you could get. Despite that, it was still somehow barely enough to beat bosses. I sincerely felt grief when I lost because losing dinos you spend weeks raising is crushing, and after finally beating them, it was a triumph like no other. You got rare and powerful tech from beating each boss, and fighting through the dungeons for the artifacts to fight the bosses was also hell on earth. 

For the cons of this game? The building system (my favorite thing to do is build) was awful, optimization is pain, and building with non-mod/vanilla stuff is the definition of agony. Flying and wyverns are rather OP though I'd argue the process of obtaining them is almost difficult enough to justify it. This game somehow rolls the best parts of survival builder games in with the worst aspects of it; A cancerous community (I stuck to my small public server cluster of 4-10 people), very slow bug patches (some of which never have been patched) and an offensively massive download of 400gb. The game doesn't even look pretty enough to break 100gb, like seriously wtf!

ARK Survival Evolved is hands down one of the greatest multiplayer survival games ever created.  Despite Studio Wildcard's inexperience with game development, they produced a game that thousands of people could enjoy.  Whether you loved to mod, explore a vast and complicated world, challenge yourself with tough solo play, work as part of a larger tribe, or just wanted to have your own dinosaur, this game had a little of something for every player.

Then Studio Wildcard and its parent company, Snail Games, went off the deep end.  Updates were constantly delayed.  Cheaters ran rampant on official servers with developers purposely turning a blind eye to - and, in some cases, helping - such players (namely Chinese players).  Instead of putting the majority of their resources into producing the long-awaited ""ARK: Survival Ascended"" revamp or ARK II, the developers chose to waste their time and resources with animated spin-offs and throwing their hat into the political arena.  They demanded more money from their customers while continuing to withhold products.  They lie to investors.  They blame the community when consumers give them any kind of feedback that is not downright praise and adoration.

Do I recommend this game?  With the official servers expected to be shut down this year in preparation for a game projected to be completed in mid-2024 to early 2025, I do not recommend playing this game outside of single player unless you are open to paying a third party to host an online server.  If you are adamant about trying this game out, I recommend waiting until it is on sale or just wait for ARK: Survival Ascended (or ARK II) to come out.  If you just want to watch someone else play the game so you can at least get an idea of what it is like, I suggest watching someone else play the game on Twitch or YouTube (I personally recommend Neebs Gaming, Syntac, or Arahli the Geek).

10/10 buy this.






Edit: The only thing I can suggest for the devs is optimize it so the frames drop less regularly. I have 16gb of RAM, and an R9 290x 'TWINFROZR' series graphics card, and I regularly get drops between 40 to 20fps. It'd be nice if it ran more smoothly, and the devs focused on compatability, rather than more things to eat me. I've got enough of them ingame already! :)

I downloaded this game in 2015 and after some - moderate - server problems, I actually started playing this game in 2018 - not because the server problems were fixed, but because I actually got told ""you have to wait through the 6 minute loading time, its not a bug its a feature"". 
So there I go finally playing the desired game and I have to admit it completely catched me in the first minutes.
Despite dieing like 20 times in the first 10 minutes and then doing a - patented, incredibly smart - Gamer move and actually starting in the recommended starting zone, the graphics and game design not only blew my PC up but also my mind.

I don't want to talk about the gameplay to much since, depending on what kind of combat you prefer (PVP, PVE, Boss fights), you can go to different servers or even create your own one.

Overall I would 100% buy it again and therefore rate it a solid 9,5/10 (-0,5 because loading time still goes brrrrr)",1706704066,1706704066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This magnificent creation is not merely an object of admiration; it is a transcendent experience, an opulent tapestry woven with threads of unparalleled artistry and craftsmanship.

To describe this masterpiece as beautiful would be an egregious understatement. It is a symphony of aesthetics that eludes the grasp of conventional language, leaving one in a state of profound speechlessness. Each facet, each contour, and every meticulously crafted detail seem to dance in harmony, creating a visual opulence that defies the limitations of mere description.

The sheer ingenuity displayed in the conception of this marvel is a testament to the boundless imagination of its creators. It is as though they summoned inspiration from the very cosmos, channeling divine elegance into the earthly realm. The result is a creation that transcends the boundaries of the tangible, inviting contemplation on the sublime nature of artistic genius.

As my eyes trace the contours of this divine opus, I am acutely aware that I am in the presence of something extraordinary, something that transcends the mundane and ascends into the realm of the extraordinary. The lines between reality and the surreal blur, as if the very fabric of existence is woven with the threads of this exquisite creation.

Attempting to dissect the elements that compose this masterpiece feels akin to dismantling a delicate sonnet or dissecting the hues of a resplendent sunset. The harmonious convergence of form and substance in this creation resists reductionism, beckoning the beholder to surrender to the ineffable allure of its perfection.

In the presence of such ineffable beauty, one is compelled to marvel at the limits of human ingenuity. This creation stands as a testament to the heights that can be reached when artistic vision intertwines with consummate skill. It is not a mere object; it is a magnum opus, an artifact of sublime proportions that leaves an indelible imprint on the canvas of aesthetic appreciation.

In the face of this immaculate creation, I find myself at a loss, for words falter in the attempt to encapsulate the splendor that unfolds before my eyes. It is a tapestry woven with threads of transcendence, a testament to the infinite potential of human creativity. In the presence of such divine artistry, silence becomes the most profound form of homage.",1681063339,1706508823,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

NOW they have made a copy of this game which uses unreal engine 5 while the 1st ark uses unreal engine 4 and they also used ideas from feedback and what modders have made such as baby dinos
then they made a new copy of ark which cost more then this when it was released so all current players who have the 1st ark were just used for them and the worse part is that it was not cheap for us to buy the 1st ark and the DLC but they made a copy of it using a better engine and the 1st and 2nd ark is almost the same but the 1st ark runs better, less crashes and has more mods even if some are old
and the 2nd ark does have some benefits such as wild baby dinos which i think are more refined and the characters look way better and same with the water but even if they make the 2nd ark 5 times better then the 1st ark i still wouldn't get the game because  we were just used by them and also ark didn't have colourful dinos at the start but now some dinosaurs look closer to a rainbow then a dinosaur",1697333509,1706442749,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why i see that people may not like it that's perfectly fine. Because from all the time i have spent on this game i have enjoyed it.

Thank you wildcard for making this game. I enjoyed it and will enjoy ascended aswell even if i can hardly run it. But that was the same for me when i played Ark survival evolved the first time.

My journey took me to Scorched Earth, an inhospitable realm where my problems where many. But one stood out: an invisible, perilous, inescapable enemy lurked all around me... the heat. 

I materialised in what seemed like a benign corner of the map. Little did I know that danger lurked in the shadows. As if they were just waiting for me, in an instant, two Raptors emerged beside me, casting me into the abyss of the main menu as I sought another spawning location.

The cycle of survival unfolded: punch tree, craft pickaxe, gather stone, craft axe, erect a 2x2 stone sanctuary. Yet, the unforgiving heat rendered stone structures unbearable. Wood proved futile, and metal seemed an insurmountable challenge. After consulting the old scriptures, thatch was the way to go until I discovered Adobe.

An Argy, a formidable ally, was tamed and whispered her name: ""FEM-107""; coincidentally, she was a level 107 Female Argy. 

I had to know everything about this place. No location was to stay undiscovered. Mounting FEM-107, we soared through the skies on a discovery mission, killing all predators I could find in my path; she was an exquisite killing machine. Life was good.

Scriptures foretold of a location where flying beasts lived and thrived away from the eyes and knowledge of this scorched place.
Alas, a perilous crevice teeming with Wyverns was found. Curiosity and courage took the best of me. I am not one to flee from hardship. 

We flew too bravely; too close. Tragedy struck; A group of 15(ish) wyverns spoted us. 
Hope was lost. Fleeing was not an option. They were to fast. 

Tragedy struck.

I perished, losing all collected loot. But worse of all, FEM-107 was gone forever. I would never again look at those bright eyes and silky feathers. No longer would we feel the wind in our faces while tormenting predatory fauna. 

Another consultation with the old scriptures revealed these wyverns have eggs that can be hatched. I may still find solace in capturing one 

Undeterred, I tamed four other Argies; I could not bear myself to name them as they would probably share FEM-107's fate. But I would prepare beforehand. 

Terrorising began once again. My squad became a menace. We became a perfectly oiled killing machine. Nothing survived. No distinctions between predators or others was relevant anymore. Increasing health and melee was the only paramount objective. 

Finally when everyone was level 150+. I took my squad and began the venture to my old grave.

Returning to the wyvern lair, I confronted the imminent danger of retrieving coveted eggs. 

2 were found. 2 were stolen. Poison and Lightning. 

We were able to withstand the first wave of wyverns. But we were too weak to handle the second wave. Amid the chaos, three Argies fell, and I barely escaped the blinding agony of a heat-induced demise that looked like an acid trip of blur and colours. Scriptures were consulted and I found out this is caused by heatstroke.

With my sole surviving Argy, I embarked on the journey home, fuelled by the burning desire to hatch those wyvern eggs, that was the next objective - NAY! - the singular, all-encompassing objective. I would not hit another stone or tree before hatching those eggs.

Eventually, scriptures were consulted and a makeshift ""bed"" of 20 campfires had to be constructed for this endeavour.

The Poison egg, mistakenly placed in my ""belt"" inventory, was CONSUMED in a regrettable mishap.

Undeterred, I turned my attention to the Lightning egg. Placed meticulously on the fiery bed of campfires, finally, the incubation process began—a torturous 45-minute wait, an eternity in the mind.

Fuelling the fires as the countdown dwindled. Ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one... anticipation reached its zenith.

It hatched! A triumphant moment tainted by unforeseen peril—my newly hatched wyvern was ablaze! Immobilised amidst the searing campfires, it suffered fiery torment, unable to escape.
Desperation surged through me like an unstoppable force. Commands to ""follow me"" went unanswered. As the fires were manually extinguished, the infant wyvern gazed at me, its eyes pleading for salvation, a silent scream echoing within. In its final moment, it fixed its gaze upon me, and with a whisper that cut through the air and shattered my soul, it uttered, ""Wow...  you are a stupid noob!""

13/10 will try again.

Wrong. You join a server = you die.

No story. No guide.

The game's crown jewel is undoubtedly its replayability. The vast, dynamically generated landscapes and the plethora of creatures make every playthrough unique. The thrill of taming, breeding, and building keeps drawing players back for more.

While I've explored the depths of the game in PvE, the diverse ecosystems, from dense jungles to frozen tundras, contribute to its lasting appeal. The cooperative aspect of PvE, where players band together against the dangers of the environment, adds an extra layer of enjoyment.

However, the transition when Snail Games Company acquired Ark brought a mixed bag of reactions. While the developers continue to introduce fresh content and updates, some players have expressed concerns about the impact on the game's direction.

Despite these uncertainties, credit is due to the development team for their ongoing commitment to enhancing the gaming experience. The intricate balance between survival and progression, the introduction of new creatures, and the constant optimization efforts showcase their dedication to the evolving world of Ark.

In conclusion, Ark: Survival Evolved remains a captivating journey into the prehistoric unknown.

The Carnivores attack anything and gobble it up, even engaging in fights until they die instead of running away (although a mod Zoology should fix these, I haven't been able to make the damn engrams work). The carnivores also never get fed up, leading to ""terraforming"", where carnivores dominate the land living in peace with each other, but killing every herbivore that spawns. Given the size and beauty of the worlds, this is probably ok, since I can't imagine the extra machine power it would take to power such huge maps as well as a decent A.I on every living thing. But it is not realistic. Taming something is like going to the shop and buying a doll. They mean nothing, they understand nothing. They stay still forever if you tell them and won't defend themselves if you tell them. They don't know what fleeing is or even how to stay in a certain area. Thank god for fences, but i'd be fine with just a leash or equivalent mechanic. The crown for dumb A.I take the bats. They know nothing except how to aggro toward a player and stand in the air. Some cave exploring.

Some creatures are ridiculously overpowered and give almost nothing in return. Early on, when I met the Daeodon and the Wolf, I simply couldn't win (metal armor). The Wolves attack very fast with huge knockback and eat mammoths by the truckload. I certainly couldn't kill two of them on my own, before I used good tames. Oddly enough, they spawn in the desert with thick fur, but the desert is 40°C. Preposterous. The Daeodon has huge health, knockback and regeneration, but you'll only get about 10 each of meat/skin. Ridiculous. Carnos are much easier and give prime meat. I feel cheated. Butfrustrated, even.

There is something very off about some domesticated species and their wild counterparts. Parasaurs and stegos run much faster wild, but their speed is cut down significantly when you tame them (stegos especially). There are many examples of this, like the flying Tapejara, which sprints regally away but is half as fast when you tame it. Some get faster after taming. What were they thinking?

I have other minor complaints, why do baby dinos eat so much damn food, enough for a hundred dinos? Why are dinos such a statistic devoid of life? Why do wolves get a packleader aura and hunt in packs, but not Utahraptors? Where the hell is my pizza? Why am I such a failure? Why are there 4 T-Rexes outside my door ON A SNOWY MOUNTAIN?",1507487488,1705874895,True,1,1,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

- main game doesnt get optimised but they have time to make paid dlc
- game runs nothing like diarrea, meaning it should run as smooth as diarrea that comes out of your behind, but it doesnt, its more like that 1 big turd that refuses to leave your 4ssh0L3. 
- any requests totally being ignored by the developper
- people who pay for dlc are litterally paying off wildcard's 40 million dollar lawsuit settlement, thanks for destroying this game guys. 

would not recommend it, highly doubt that they will reach the current release date, which is end of this year. i dont mind paying for content, but they only let you pay AFTER that settlement for 40 million dollars. when they didnt have this debt they were happy to give us ''free content'', even though all the content they release was already in the game when we purchased it. 

sad really. i hope these guys go broke. or get another settlement and that no one buys their stuff. and dont believe people that say the game runs fine because it totally does not, i ve met people with titan black  and normal titans that get the same amount of frames as me , same amount of crashes as me, etc. people with a gpu that is lower quality than me, also have the same frames and same amount of crashes, dx10 commandline does give better frames but the game still crashes , sm4 commandline does its job but nothing helps against these crashes, except optimisation, but they rather make paid dlc because cows in the herd will purchase the content. 

what once really was a good game, even with all the bugs, has now turned into a game more broken than 1000 mirrors that simultaneously break after falling on the ground from 5 meters high. 

wildcard, you ve already banned  me from ark survival discussions because i post the exact same stuff on there as i have posted here. the fact that you need to ban me from your discussions , nuff said . you guys dont want people in the community that spit facts, you want fanboying cancers that defend you till they die, even if they know that you will keep to screw us all over, and over and over. i really hope you guys go broke, you have made at least 200 million with ark survival evolved, you cant pay 40 millions from that 200 million you ve already made? now trying to milk the living sh!t out of the community? 

what a hoax.


hahahahah what is this rhyognatic or whatever this giant bug is? what is this you said? this is the equivelance of the gta online flying mk2 bike. made for skilless scrubs who cant adapt to the game's original mechanics and thus need a creature that overrides   it all. well played wildcard, once again you have proven how worthless you are. i truly hope you guys go broke soon. you dont deserve any kind of money.",1474391133,1705865919,False,9,3,0.485746830701828003,3,True,False,True

The game is ruthless. You have to have a huge herd of strong dinos to have a chance to get anywhere, and even then you're likely to get killed by some tiny bullshit enemy because your herd gets stuck in itself.

If you dare to venture out from your starting location there's a good chance you meet something that can slay a good amount of dinos so even if you bring an army, it might be too small for a single enemy and you're screwed again.

I've spent so many hours in this game, mostly in coop with one other player, and every time I pick it up again I have fun for maybe 20 hours, before I remember why I hate the game and uninstall it. 

And the size of the game... Jesus, it's pretty good looking but not 250GB worth.

Undoubtedly, it poses a significant challenge for newcomers, demanding a steep learning curve. However, for those persistent enough to delve into its complexities, the realization dawns that, despite its difficulty, the game offers immense fun and provides an avenue to immerse oneself for hours, days, and even months into a captivating world filled with dinosaurs.

The game's allure is further heightened when shared with friends. Whether played on official, unofficial, dedicated, or non-dedicated servers, the cooperative element enhances the overall experience. The camaraderie adds an extra layer of enjoyment, turning what could be a solitary adventure into a shared endeavor.

Moreover, the inclusion of mods significantly contributes to the game's versatility. These modifications not only introduce fun elements but also serve as valuable tools, facilitating tweaks that may simplify certain aspects or, conversely, intensify the challenge for those seeking a more demanding gameplay experience. Notable examples, such as Primal Fear and Dino Overhaul X, fundamentally alter the game mechanics, offering a refreshing and thoroughly different gameplay encounter.

In essence, ARK not only presents a visually stunning and challenging gaming experience but also underscores the adaptability and longevity that arises from its diverse player-driven and mod-supported features

It's essential to note that the beauty of ARK lies not just in its visual appeal but also in the game's flexibility that empowers players to shape and design their own experience. The capacity to customize and tweak various aspects to align with personal preferences contributes significantly to the game's allure. This level of creative control allows players to tailor the gameplay to their liking, enhancing the overall beauty of the gaming experience. Whether through subtle adjustments or more profound modifications, this freedom to mold the game according to individual preferences adds a unique layer of beauty and engagement to ARK",1705638514,1705779712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While my 400+ hours were clocked on Xbox, the impact it had on me transcends platforms which is why I wanted to post this review, as I now have a PC capable of running Ark: Survival Ascended

This survival masterpiece not only catapulted me into a prehistoric world teeming with dinosaurs but also served as my digital sanctuary during challenging times. When reality felt overwhelming, Ark provided a haven where I could build, explore, and, most importantly, escape.

The vibrant landscapes and awe-inspiring creatures became my companions in the virtual realm, offering a welcome distraction and a therapeutic outlet. The challenges of taming the wild and navigating the perilous environment mirrored the struggles I faced in reality, yet the triumphs within the game fuelled a sense of accomplishment that resonated beyond the screen.

The community, both on Xbox and beyond, played an unexpected role in my journey. The shared experiences, cooperative efforts, and occasional PvP battles created connections that were surprisingly profound. Ark wasn't just a game; it was a community that understood and supported, even if only through the shared love for surviving in a world filled with dinosaurs.

As I migrate from Xbox to Steam, the memories forged in Ark remain without a doubt some of the best in my gaming history. This isn't just a review; it's a heartfelt thank you to Studio Wildcard for crafting a game that transcends pixels and becomes a lifeline for those in need of a digital escape.

If you're searching for a game that offers more than just entertainment, Ark: Survival Evolved is a journey worth taking. It's not just about survival; it's about finding solace and strength in the most unexpected places.

A steady stream of rich content was pumped into this game since its release, as well as an active modding community.  Sometimes, Ark: Survival Evolved makes me feel like I have 20/40 vision even though I'm wearing $2,000 glasses, because graphics performance is not well optimized.  Graphics optimization seemed to be a much lower priority than game content.  I use a desktop computer with high-end hardware.  This game was part of the reason I got a more powerful GPU.  However, my performance improvements were marginal.  This is the only game I play which I feel the need to use resolution upscaling.  Ark: Survival Evolved makes me appreciate other games which are well-optimized.  It makes me appreciate efficient programmers and video game studios who prioritize performance optimization.  I watch various Youtubers' recordings of Ark and very few of them run the game at ""epic"" settings with smooth performance.  High-end GPUs struggle to run Ark smoothly at higher resolutions.  The vast majority of recorded Ark content and time spent playing Ark is rendered with low in-game settings, utilization of older shader models, past versions of DirectX API, and low memory modes.

You can choose to try for bosses or completely ignore them, create a community for friends, build an economy in game with trading outposts, a large number of mods available that open up even more options and improve q.o.l. from slightly to enormously.

They have stopped the scortched earth crashes. extinction and abberation are very good but managarmrs are too op ....

-Edited 2k hours

Although small tribes can be fun, they never wipe! meaning that everyone who is doing good and started way before everyone just out gun/pvp people constantly and if they loose a fight its just a percentage of what they have. For new people to loose it either takes everything away or a huge fraction of there stuff. If they were to make new servers or nerf managarmas yet again then it would get alot more players and less people complaining about small tribes/ official 1x

My only complaint is almost every single dino in the game; when they see you; comes after you. This is terrible. I mean omg! It ruins the game when there is 3 herds of dinos not attacking each other, but they all come after YOU! I had to finally stop playing it. 

The attack distance needs to be increased or there needs to be some kind of passive chance they won't attack you every time. I can remember the last time I played and I was flying a bird over a mountain and was close enough to the ground, but still high enough; I was scouting and needed to land. Turns out I aggro every dino along the way and 20 dinos come running over the hill and kill me!!

Seriously?? This is messed up? Why hasn't this been balanced and addressed yet?

Overall it is fun. But frustrating...

But under the hood, this is one of the buggiest, most disrespectful, and worst optimized games I've ever seen in my life. Which sucks, because this could be one of the best survival and multiplayer experiences there is if they actually did anything to fix it. Like the install with all DLC is almost half a terabyte, what the actual fuck lol. Thing should be rap battling against new pokemon games.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Are you wondering how?

I found love so fast
And I know this love will last

The game crashes sometimes and with the crashes deletes all my progress, I recomand to save the files every time you exit the game.

(going to be kinda long) 
it seems Ark has gotten alot of bad reviews recently, based off of the fact they released a paid dlc and fixed the character server changing that everyone has been complaining about an asking for. i see alot of reviews saying the game is buggy/glitchy/laggy what have you. i have owned this game since about the first week it has came out. i played for a few months then took a break an came back to it. The devs have done an outstanding job on this game, from bringing new dinos and engrams to fixing different bugs. to bringing out new content regularly, i to was upset about having to pay 20$ for the dlc content when i as well as many others have been apart of this games making since the beginning. But heres the thing either they bring out content to make money off of or the game will end up like so many other early access games an just get abandonded due to lack of funds.  this game does not deserve bad reviews due to the fact you have to pay for dlc or even the fact it has some minor gameplay errors (in early access) the game is Great an i do not regret buying it an i know many others who also do not regret it.

if you are interested i run my own private server, active community, non toxic


(orignal Review)Great game, even bought it on console. the devs are doing a great job on keeping the game updated, you can tell this is a game the devs have put alot of work into and there doing awesome. the graphics are great its a must to play with a clan to get the most out of this game.",1467682160,1704417409,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,1,True,False,False

The glitches such as getting stuck in rocks/mountains/structures and also loosing your stuff can be a real pain when you really need it. The amount of times I've had to deal with lag is just awful, luckly I can still run it on my PC though the CPU usage is taking up way too much on my PC possibly many others, I really suggest you lower the Sky effects/shadows.

Either way it's still a great game with amazing textures!! (Mines set to medium cause my PC lags to much for Epic) Which is a bummer but i'm still pleased to notice tiny fixes here and there. =) feel free to add me if you want to or you agree or for whatever reason haha. 

I totally recommend this to people that love nature, adventure, or love a challenge and have the time to play. But if your PC isn't strong enough and you don't spend much time on it then i don't recommend it. Hopefully the game will improve more in the future! 

Edit: I now work so I have less time for this game though I'm going to add some more info.
Prepare your Disk space, ARK literally eats it all, only get this when on sale or you have the money, If you want to play with others only choose people you trust to run with your server cause some people raid and are really nasty but not every game is perfect. Make sure your settings aren't always low or else it will glitch really bad sometimes. Hope this helps, Thank you for reading. 

Edit 2: (3 people thumbed up, it removed as I edited this) 
Okay It's been a few years now. I'm Very excited that I have the time to game and Play ARK once again. I Can honestly say I'm Really Amazed with how Far this Game has Improved. So Many of the bugs are Patched, things don't Glitch nowhere near as bad, it's totally a Fun Ride. However Storage and Graphics will always continue to Climb with newer Games like these being created, As long as you Do your research, have the Tools for that and your Enjoying The Atmosphere, That's all that matters. Beautiful Game, Memorable Places to Discover. I always knew it was a Golden one, just needed time to spread it's true colours, and Evolve (lol) Looking forward to this games Future!  -Zeth",1496642852,1704232413,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

⭐⭐⭐

[h2] A Wildly Fun Survival Experience, Recommended BUT... [/h2]

[hr][/hr]

[h1] Detailed Review: [/h1]

[h2] 1. Narrative and Visuals (3/5): [/h2]
The narrative lacks depth, and visuals, though promising, suffer due to optimization issues.

[h2] 2. Gameplay and Unique Features (4/5): [/h2]
Despite design flaws, Ark: Survival Evolved offers a unique survival experience with dinosaurs and base building. The gameplay, however, is hampered by questionable design decisions.

[h2] 3. Optimization Woes (2/5): [/h2]
The game's eight-year history is marred by unaddressed bugs and constant optimization challenges. The devs prioritize spin-offs over fixing fundamental issues, making the experience infuriating for players.

[h2] 4. Soundtrack and Audio Design (4/5): [/h2]
An epic soundtrack and well-crafted sound design add a layer of immersion, redeeming some aspects of the game.

[h2] 5. Bugs and Technical Issues (2/5): [/h2]
Ark suffers from numerous bugs, highlighting the lack of care in game design. Combat feels like a face-slapping fest, breeding is unintuitive, and progression lacks cohesion.

[h2] 6. Replay Value and DLCs (5/5): [/h2]
The game's saving grace lies in its high replay value, especially when played with friends. DLCs, when played in chronological order, enhance the overall experience.

[h2] 7. Community and Modding (5/5): [/h2]
A strong community and vibrant modding scene add layers of creativity, fostering a more enjoyable experience. For me playing without mods is totally impossible as they fix some of the core issues of the game.

[h2] 8. Value for Money (4/5): [/h2]
Despite its flaws, the game offers value, especially when investing in DLCs. The chronological order of DLCs enhances the overall gaming journey. If possible try to get the bundle when its on sale


[h1] Personal Thoughts: [/h1]

This game had the potential to truly become one of the all-time greats, but the devs' apparent focus on profits over player satisfaction has hindered its evolution. Despite community dedication, the game remains plagued by bugs, optimization issues, and a lack of meaningful improvements. The core mechanics feel haphazardly designed, with little cohesion between systems. Studio Wildcard's repeated releases, including ""Survival Ascended,"" fail to address these fundamental issues, relying on flashy graphics to mask underlying problems.

The game's only redeeming qualities are its dinosaur-themed gameplay and base building. However, these aspects alone cannot compensate for the frustrations imposed by poor game mechanics. The taming system is unintuitive, leveling and dinosaur stats seem arbitrary, and the spawning system lacks purpose. Combat boils down to mindless face-slapping, undermining the potential for engaging gameplay.

Studio Wildcard's approach to game development, evidenced by Ark, PixArk, and ""Survival Ascended,"" reflects a missed opportunity. The studio prioritizes cash grabs and graphical appeal over meaningful improvements. Despite the community's decade-long hope for substantial enhancements, the developers appear content with an unfinished product.

In conclusion, Studio Wildcard's failure to address fundamental issues and iterate on game design leaves Ark: Survival Evolved as a testament to unfulfilled potential. The game's lasting appeal relies on community-generated content and mods rather than the studio's own efforts. Until significant improvements are made, this review stands as a critique of a game that could have been great but was ultimately exploited for financial gain.",1640998809,1704208572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The single player/offline play is good and can be adjusted well.
As a survival game, this would do.
Pet loss (and subsequent write off) is not something that should be played by children.

They really oughta implement a different rating system, like 1-10.
Right now it's like 7-8 for 18+ people, but 3-4 for lower age.

I must say if you wanna have fun with this game, don't play it on a official server, all tasks that should be fun are really boring, it take days to breed a dino. Unofficial are the best, you can get access to advanced features so much faster.

Early Access review:
Don't buy this game. Official servers are filled up with hackers, devs seems to care but in reality don't. We made a lot of reports for the last month, they did nothing. All my friends had left the server The-EU-OfficialServer397. The hackers are called Tribe Of Mote, Their Player Name: Hki , the wind , jack , cy , blood marry, empty. This game is very unfair with hackers everywhere. They are using Aimbots, , speedhack and ESP, VAC undetected.

But every time I get the itch for a game where I can tame/breed/ride animals and explore large maps and make awesome builds and bases this game is the ultimate answer. There are literally no other games like it that scratch that itch for me.

I always end up taking breaks from it and forgetting the admin codes to fix bugs, which mods to use, the order the mods have to be to prevent more bugs, relearn how to mess with the ini files which are hell (for me anyway) to learn again later. If you're fine with doing all this and relearning what's changed every time you pick it back up then I can't recommend ark enough, but people don't normally have to do this for a game that isn't in beta anymore.

At least a quarter of my hours spent in this game have been tweaking settings, mods and ini files just to make the game enjoyable. (my hardware is not the issue here, haha)

I just want a game that works without learning how to fix it myself. I'm not holding onto the hope that Ark Survival Ascended will be much better either tbh.

Inacceptable. Most unprofessional company EVER.

And in 2023 they just dropped the entire game and destroyed any progress for all the dedicated players (i have friends in my list that played FAR more than 10k hours), just to release it again, with slightly better graphics, 1/10th of the former content (just the island, no other maps LOL) and reintroduced bugs that have been fixed since 3 yrs. Great.

Also, after i brought the game, a while later, instead of updating the already existing game, you guys made a brand new one. Abandoning all your previous users.

This game is so fun and is def. worth buying to to try it out. The main issue is performance. Coming from console its not even a close contest, this PC runs the game a million times better but I will still take a dip in frames if Im loading near a bunch of spam (bunch of buildings laid out to block enemies from building close to your base) or a fully built base rendering in.

The concept is amazing and with a group of 4-5 people this game is truly on a whole other level. That being said Wild Card has been a trash company in regards to ASA and fixxing issues/bugs/cheaters with official servers, this is why alot of people play on ""private"" clusters where they can be more easily admin patrol'd.

 With the new remastered version of this game out I doubt many will buy this, and if I'm a first time buyer I'd reccomend buying that over this one just for the upgrade fixing alot of issues with bugs and PvP exploits.

first of all, the trailers show people working together

that doesnt happen

1. get raided of all your loot

2. they steal your dinos, destroy your base, and drop you off with a flier somewhere either dangerous or in the middle of literally nowhere

second of all, the devs seriously dont know what an update means, this game is laggy, crashes often, and paired with mods (which to note make the game better than the game itself) make it laggier

ive played every single map and each map is laggier than the last

i have played since this game was released, and its done pretty good since its first updates, but its evolved from quality to quantity

THIRD of all, this game is VERY grindy, like to where theres 20% game and 80% grind

- The game has been replaced by its remastered version : ARK Survival Ascended. As a result, this version is no longer updated or supported by the devs. 
- The official servers are no longer up. A few community-based servers are still running but no one can guarantee for how long since the game is no longer supported.
- The game has many glitches.
- The learning curve is extremely steep, and it can be discouraging for beginners. I strongly recommend learning the basis of the game in PVE before trying PVP and risking to see all your progress being wiped by other players.

I have played this game mostly on ps4 and ps5 and a small amount on pc. On console the game was lagging (around 15 fps) even on the next gen console ps5. The game isn't well optimized on pc or consoles.
 Most of the time i spend on downloading the game and at the loading screens. I hate to spend an hour to hours downloading over 110GB of data just to get error message when launching the game. The rare times when i get to play the game is when i get 15 fps on the ps5. I know the console version isn't optimized for the ps5 but i get the same outcome when playing on the ps4. 
 I would really like to play the game if it wouldn't be so laggy and broken from time to time and take up so much space. 
ARK Ascended isn't any better. Only thing they changed was the video quality and that didn't help the game at all unless you have the best gaming pc int the universe. 
 I would love to get a working ARK game that doesn't make you download for an hour just for it to crash.

I bought this game again thinking that over time the devs would have polished it and the bugs present back in the day would have been fixed. I also bought it to experience some nostalgia. To my surprise the game was actually worse now than it was then. My game crashed every 15/20 minutes to the point that it would no longer load a saved game or a new game without crashing. The store page also states that you need 60GB of free space for this game, this is a vast understatement as it takes up nearly 500GB of space, which in my opinion is a ridiculous amount of space for an older game.",1703687660,1703687660,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Edit 1: More than a year later, wow. I just wanna say the game is a lot more fun when you have good flyers like the argy and the quetz. Still think it's an AMAZING game. I would totally recommend it if you like sandbox games like MC, Terraria, Rust, etc. especially if you want a challenge. (12/22/21)
:)

Edit 2: So ig I have just started to edit this review annually. It's been 2 years since I first wrote this reviewn and I have over 300 hours of gameplay, so here's what I think. I still LOVE this game even though I don't play it nearly as much as I used to. I would definitely recommend this game as long as you have a good PC, since it easily brings my 3080 to the upper 80s and lower 90s (Celsius). If your wanting to get all the achievements in this game, be ready, some of it's achievements take can forever depending on how good (or bad) you are, which is why I don't have many achievements in ARK. It is an all around great game, though there are a ton of bugs. That's pretty much it -- hope you have fun!  9.3/10 (12/22/22)

Final Edit: Ark Survival Ascended has been out for a couple months by now. I don't think I'll be revisiting this ARK to be honest. ASA has been VERY fun and I just really enjoy it. I would still recommend this game for sure though, I have a ton of great memories from this game alone and it's easily a top 3 game imo.

My only issue with this game is the amount of time you need to put into the game before you beat it.
There are multiple DLC maps that you can buy or install if you want to try something a bit different. From what I know there isn't any maps that have the exact same dinos on them. By that I mean of course they have some of the same dinos across the different maps. But some of the maps have more or less dino types than others, and some of them have dinos that you wouldn't see on the starter map, or some of the other map DLCs.

Getting cheated in games like battlefield is no problem. But Ark? You lose months worth of work when 1 cheater can wipe your base in a few minutes. A popular youtuber said he estimated the amount of cheaters on the new ark to be 10%. Which is HUGE. That's almost as many cheaters as GTA5.

Hiding in a dense forest is impossible because players use INI where all bushes and trees are removed. Also they gain the ability to have perfect water vision. They also have the ability to not be affected by flashbang effects. That's unfair and I don't understand why these settings are in INI.

The DLCs to this game are honestly really cool. If you disregard the glitches and overall shittiness of the game it's super fun to learn about and play with friends. The cons outweigh the pros, but I still enjoy the game.

There is a lot of material and experience grind, and the game play loop is definitely MMO inspired.
Party up on a high spec gaming pc, and you'll have an ok time. The console ports run very poorly.

[h3] +Pros [/h3]
+Dinosaurs
+Post launch support is great. Plenty of maps and they all vary, and updates frequently cause issues that are addressed in a quick fashion.
+So much stuff to build and do, this game goes from a tribal warmonger group with hatchets and slings to a insane group of kitted out SWAT operators zooming across the skies.
+Husbandry is very in depth.
+Workshop has mods that allow for EXTREME game play changes.

[h3] -Cons [/h3]
-The game play loop
-Server tool is extremely lacking in command line arguments. I would love to be able to manage objects, players, inventories etc etc but doing so isn't really possible, and if it is I haven't discovered it.
-System and storage requirements.

5/10 I don't like MMOs, but it has dinosaurs. It's an open world free form crafting and survival game. Runs poorly on every system I've played it on.

Lot to do on ark, farming stuff and dinos to fight big bosses, we feel the work on each dlc map but this game is time-consuming

ADVICE: try the game, like each games starting is hard but do not quit if you get kill or if your dino get kill, it's a part of this game, i know it's raging but passing through mad feeling and after understanding basics your experience gona be spectacular, even more between friends (there's lot of discords servers too for ark)

So lets start with the cons:
Official servers are crap. 
Mega tribes ruin everything.
Snail killed official everything (bans and toxic behavior... the forums tell all). 
There are a few bugs and clipping issues. you learn to deal with those very quickly, and then you have no issues.
Building is fun but the building sizes suck.. (they fixed this in Ascended but Snail backpedaled and instead of all of us getting it for free to try and get us excited for ARK2 you have to pay for it.. and with the bad reviews I'm not sure I'm willing....

Pros:
Fun as heck. I mean come on.. riding on DINOSAURS for crying out loud.... Rexs, Raptors, Trikes!
Now that all the DLC is done there is a storyline! 
custom building... some of you craftier folks can make some sweeeeet looking buildings.... 
massive boss fights
Dino breeding
Crafting
Exploration
Dungeons! (caves....)
Seasonal events!

Overall im willing to give this game a 8/10. Your best bet to to play single player with the settings optimized to reduce bugs, or on a private server with friends.

This game is a time sink. OG settings is like crazy slow, a max level Rex will take you an hour and a half IRL to tame.. so most of us have settings at 10x for that...",1434137519,1703362542,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/][/url]

[b]ARK: Survival Evolved[/b] is a game that lets you live out your childhood fantasies of being stranded on an island full of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. You can craft tools, build shelters, tame beasts, and fight for survival in a vast open world.

While ARK has a lot of potential and some amazing moments, it also suffers from a number of issues that make it hard to recommend without reservations.

The game is poorly optimized and runs poorly on most systems, even on low settings. You'll experience frequent lag, stuttering, crashes, and bugs that can ruin your immersion and enjoyment.

The game also requires a lot of grinding and patience. You'll spend hours gathering resources, crafting items, building structures, and leveling up your character and your dinos. The game is very unforgiving and harsh, especially on PvP servers, where other players can raid your base, kill your dinos, and steal your stuff.

The game also lacks a clear direction and purpose. There's no real story or goal to follow, other than exploring the world and unlocking new technologies. The game relies on you to create your own fun and set your own goals, which can be appealing for some players, but boring and aimless for others.

If you're a fan of dinosaurs and survival games, and you have a powerful PC and a lot of patience, you might enjoy ARK and find it worth your time and money. But if you're looking for a polished and smooth game, or a game that has a clear direction and purpose, you might want to look elsewhere.

They will shut down the multiplayer official servers after initially  saying they will keep them for free and now they migrate to a new transition game you have to pay again 50 bucks , lol and also get again the dlcs?

And also the new game will arrive in half or one year? And i am gonna pay again for this old stuff when soon all will change?
Come on lads in the western gamers area financial crysis is coming!

hoho what have they smoked? Or have they played with some chinese toxic mushrooms?
what a joke of end of the game is this, haha , all my building and taming and breeding dinos that i love as my virtual sons for nothing?

I dont like these new chinese times, please Sir Elon Musk, throw them some bucks, rebuy the game from the chinese businessmen and put some servers for us on mars! You are our last hope!

♥♥♥♥, some crazy past girlfriends have quit me more softly than these guys!

Bye bye dinos, Wildcard decided that on the official server wont grow more food for ya.

PD: Does Confucious agree with these kind of non happy ending?
PD2 : And u also throw us a Egg Easter Super Event after this news?

Free solution requires tethering to game owner which limits the distance other players can travel which negatively impacts game play for MP..  IMO this decision is just silly and foolish.  Only way to not be tethered is $PAYING$ a monthly fee for a server rental.  With a small modification the DEV team should enable local server support w\o being tethered, if needed, limit to 3-5 players or something reasonable.  like many people looking for a MP game, I just want to play with 1-3 family members from random times and it fits for my family and friends.   If this solution was enacted i'd rate game at 9/10 and would recommend (considering minor glitches and what not's).  Until this solution is resolved i'd only rate this game as 4/10  Played for about 20-hrs and haven't touched since.   Anytime a friend asks about it, i recommend to avoid due to the above.   <thumbs down if your looking for Multiplayer>",1703263106,1703263106,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then Wildcard sold us the Scorched Earth DLC before it left early access. ""It is to help us pay for a lawsuit!"" so I believed them.

Then Wildcard released 'Atlas', a sprawling ocean world that was similar to Ark but a totally new game! That is until it was shown to literally have the Ark menu in the game that Atlas was literally just a new map sold as an entirely new game... so I was skeptical. 

Then Wildcard sold us 'Extinction', their 'final' DLC that forced you to buy the season pass with all the other maps to play it, so I was distrustful.

Then Wildcard released Genesis 1/2 as entirely different season passes. I thought selling the original season pass to include 'all future dlcs' then switch it up to squeeze out more money from the fans was pure greed, so I all but lost faith in them.

Then Wildcard showed that their official pvp servers, which were a joke to begin with, had admins spawning in dinosaurs/items to help people from their parent company[Snail Games] get an advantage/sell said resources for real-world cash. So I gave up on Wildcard and focused on the community.

Then Wildcard appointed their forum moderator team, a [url=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/876836735630340217/1187589645236715530/Ban.png?ex=6597700b&is=6584fb0b&hm=f399cb091326bc99f73e80064b045c0695913fcfa68109a811018395b3a91d5d&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=716&height=702]light hearted joke[/url] that said 'play along' to an unpopular thread was all it took, not against the guidelines by any means. Now a forum day ban is laid out in the rules as a warning for first time offenders, but it takes a lot of brain cells to combine words into a string of coherent thought, so they just slapped me with a perma-ban immediately. Appealed with steam and thought 'It happens, it was sorted out and the problem is resolved'. So I thought the moderator team was a bit prickly but the community would be worth it.

Several more helpful threads/comments in the community and I made a simple joke that since I was the [i]mighty[/i] steam level 38 that my opinion was more valid than others, poking fun at several people who claimed steam levels determined opinion quality. Not against the rules and since other people were doing it I assumed it was alright, all I did was [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085632490309427290/ban_2_message.png]quote a user[/url] and make a joke.

[h1]Every post I had ever made in the Ark forums for over half a decade was erased[/h1]
[i]Settings help, starter guides help, cute comments about how dinosaurs look adorable, troubleshooting help, and simple jokes back and forth with forum commentators. [/i]

To ban someone is one thing, even if you [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085632490573664377/users.png]selectively ban people(not banned/deleted)[/url] you dislike instead of banning everyone who breaks said rule (with the severity being based on your opinion of the person, like the person I quoted getting a 1-day after multiple offenses), it just makes it so that the user cannot post in the future. To delete all comments made by someone going out of their way to help others is such a spiteful thing to do that I can't help but feel ashamed I ever put time in this game to begin with. You did it Wildcard, you make the community a joke. [Yes, a bit dramatic but I do feel just a tad bit betrayed that Wildcard just stopped caring about who drove the community bus]

[h1]Edit: Wrote 3 tickets to Ark support.[/h1]
1) Thought the permaban for my first offense was a bit heavy handed and plus I saw quite a few comments get deleted that were following the rules so I wrote ark support about it. [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085707707815825478/appeal_1.png]'Read the rules lmao'[/url]

2) I tried to appeal my 2nd ban[appealed the first through steam] through Ark support. I provided evidence that nothing I said was wrong and that I didn't deserve the ban. I was told [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085707828276252713/appeal_2.png]'2nd ban in a month, git rekt'[/url] to which I showed that part of the stated reason for the appeal decision was wrong and that I wanted to know which rule I broke to deserve the ban. [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085707828532101241/appeal_3.png]'Dont ever talk to me or my son again'[/url]. No further comment on my part to keep my ticket privilege for my last ticket. The funny thing about this denied appeal is that there is another user who was banned 4 times [now 5] on the forum in the last month, and they were [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085766866628263976/unbanned_so_many_times.png]unbanned through legitimate appeals[/url]. This happens, support centers have different people with different tendencies except... hold-up... [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876836735630340217/1085726712362434580/double_standards_the.png]what if they were the same person[/url]??? And, no, every person I have talked to who tried to send in support tickets was answered by the same person, you can even look up their name on several Ark websites.

3) [url=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/876836735630340217/1085721070885163048/image.png?ex=6595fb8b&is=6583868b&hm=cb014f61a4b4577e43174458553df84d1e2636c739030447192c3b0de562885e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=833&height=702]Account suspended when I tried to resend the abuse request.[/url] Honestly, there was no point in even trying. Maybe I posted improperly, maybe I made a poorly delivered joke or two, but I did not do anything outside of average steam-user behavior and was exorcised completely from the community I gave a damn about. Again, permabanning instantly for first time offenders for a mild joke isn't just, permabanning users for quoting someone who isn't punished isn't just, and deleting all comments/posts someone made out of pure spite isn't just. 

Addendum: The whole 'generic name' and a 'few people use it' is bs. You can find several different websites with 1 person by that name that is associated with WC and in all their profiles it says 'WC support'. I would show their name but I am not out to start a witch hunt, only expose how insanely corrupt their system is.",1480405862,1703216820,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

My early thoughts on this game were positive. The premise is very interesting and the dinosaurs actually make you feel immersed like a survivor in a jungle trying to make their way in a pre-historic setting. My game ran poorly but I just assumed it was because my PC setup wasn't great at the time. As of upgrading my PC's specs, I fully expected this game to run better. The answer was no. 

I go back to this game after playing other, much better survival games. No Man's Sky was a surprising comeback. Valheim is just amazing and cheap. Project Zomboid is the best zombie survival game out there. ARK has great ideas, but fails to stick out with more potentially interesting mechanics and the game's studio seems more concerned about making money than fixing the horrendous number of bugs in the game, crappy UI, and abysmal server connection. Oh, official servers are gone? Well screw the players I guess.

Personally, I like it. But if you don't like taming stuff, defeating bosses (optional), story lines, getting killed a lot by players, or dinosaurs, you probably won't like this.
For one, if you're playing with at least one other person—family, friend, relative, etc.—you can start wars or put them in your tribe.
2: Once you tame two opposite-gender dinosaurs, you can breed them infinitely as long as your breeding times are lowered. Nice thing for wars.
3: Most carnivores are OP. Tamed or not.
4: The water is very, very questionable in this game. And terrifying. There are a lot of creatures in it; be careful going into things that lead to the ocean (rivers, footpaws, etc.). As megalodons swim there most of the time, they are not the only deep creatures in this game. In the lake at footpaw (default pawn), there are piranhas: hostile, salmon shark (neutral, i think), etc.
5: Pretty buggy, the occasional disappearance of dinos every now and then has never happened to me within my 750 hours, but I've seen it happen to others.
6: This game isn't too grindy, apart from getting creatures, growing them, and the levels.
7: To take down ANY dinosaur quickly (other than titano and giga),  just hit them with 1–15 tranq arrows with a crossbow; they enhance the narco more!!",1663102682,1703127535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only real good map is the first one (The Island), others are buggy as hell. Dinos continue to clip thru walls or fall into the ground. Dinos get stuck in foundations. And so forth. 

The tether added to non-dedicated (multiplayer) is the Dumbest idea I've ever seen in any game. Who wants to be dragged by where ever the host goes. This defeats the purposed of MP play. On the other hand, trying to setup a dedicated server is a pain. The other stupid idea is that when you click ""Run dedicated server"" You can't play the game on the same pc. I was expecting it to launch a command window and run it from that. Not use my game session, this forces you to get another copy and another Steam account.

I still enjoy it from time to time when it runs properly.

A. [i]Survival game with a harsh learning curve. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.[/i]

B. [i]There are options the player can choose to make the game easy to extremely difficult.[/i]

C. [i]Graphics are nice but somewhat dated.  But still it's beautiful and playable.[/i]

D. [i]Speaking from experience, as a beginner, it is very intimidating. [/i]

E. [i]I found that it's best played with others on PVE and/or PVP servers.  Choose your server wisely or start your own.[/i]

F.  [i]There is an active player base.[/i]

G. [i]Player base has declined over the years,  but, there are still a few partially working mods that a player can choose to use on Steam to help soften the learning curve.[/i]

H. [i]Each dino has a different use.[/i]

[u]BOTTOM LINE:[/u]

[b]There are a lot of content maps to choose from, so it should keep a player challenged to survive, adventure, harvest, craft, build, trap, kill  and tame wild pets/mounts to do a lot of their dirty work and/or mate to have better pets for many many many hours.

I really want to play this game because I've been watching the Neebs Gaming crew play it but it seems the game doesn't want me to learn how,  just getting into the game took me forever because I couldn't figure out which version ( there are 8 listed when I click launch) to use and then I had to look up how to launch the damn solo part because apparently Solo/Multiplayer was too difficult to list. I finally get into the game and not a damn thing pops up for even a half arsed tutorial, the screens have layers but you will never know that because unless you mouse over it you can't tell the difference. You level up and it just says open inv screen but neglects to mention ANYTHING about engrams which is apparently the way you learn to make stuff, its almost like you need to know the game inside and out before you ever play it.....",1576546448,1702843227,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

(edited twice) i again lost my world i dont know how its happening but a lost again, same story, my character was not in game, and not in files, call me lier or stupid beause thats my problem my fault or im just trying to desecrate such the greatest game of all time, but im tired, all my dinos are just lost pointless and my first quetzal that ive been looking for so long, yasterday i went to cave for the first time and almost get artifact, but turned to home because broken armor, after that i got tired and turned off the game, the next day all my progress is no longer mine and im not going to take resources from my standing corpse and try to do something further by create new one because i cant play for the old one because its just completely deleted again, i dont understand why this happening to me, the second time i try to recover my resources and other things and everything is lost again,im just tired, i can stand being destroyed by players, but when game destroys you... im tired. after death from dimorphodon, a red cross is not reflected on the dinosaur on the map, sometimes creatures can just get underground, there are some places in the snowy location where the textures are buggy, sometimes creatures spawn in front of me, sometimes I died from some circumstances like poisoning and the game did not show a red screen indicating a small number of health. Do you know though? the game is terrible as well as the community, I shared in the
discussion that my character was deleted, they wrote to me that I was a whiner and that I
needed to roll back the save and generally enter cheat commands to send dinosaurs to a
new character and that it was generally normal that this was happening, it turns out that
each of them just tolerates this bug And no one complains? the developers have nothing to
do and will not, in a normal case, I would not even look at the information on how to return
the character, but it seems for a casual player like me, this game is not suitable because
after buying this game I have to do something like digging into files to try to roll back the save, I
am not ready for this, I am weak. by the way, console commands are cheats, I'm not going to
use cheats because I'm not an animal, but no one explained exactly how to roll back the
save, well, it's a flawed sight, after all,
such things happen in every game, such bugs cannot be fixed, everyone knows that, therefore, no one cares.",1700543946,1702778307,False,7,2,0.533582925796508789,1,True,False,False

Every system in this game is like it was designed by a 9th grader and implemented by a 7th grader. The ONLY things going for this game are:
A) It has dinosaurs
B) It has base building

THAT'S IT.

Seriously. The only possible thing that makes this game fun rely 100% on having a community that's fun to play with, in spite of how dreadful every facet of the experience that Ark tries to serve to you is. Ark is never fun [i]because[/i] of the game mechanics. It's fun [i]in spite of[/i] the game mechanics.

The taming mechanics are absurdly unintuitive, not engaging in the least, and do not pass any metrics of good game design.

The level system and dinosaur stats have no rhyme or reason and seem arbitrary at best and deliberately useless at worst.

The spawning system has no purpose or reasoning behind it. Max level dinosaurs and alphas can spawn at the starting locations just as often as anywhere else, meaning there's both no reason to go anywhere outside of finding new dinos, and, critically, zero protections from getting overrun with a bad start. It was literally implemented as, ""Hurp derp. dino_level = rand(1,130); spawnDino();""

Breeding is like it was just picked out of a hat at random and thrown together in 15 minutes and never touched since then.

The progression system and bosses have no bearing on one another and you can effectively play the entire game without ever looking at a boss and you'll have lost nothing of value. And what bosses you do choose to fight aren't interesting fights at all. They just stand there, smacking your inevitable horde of tames like two morons trading slaps until one side falls over.

In fact, that's literally all of combat in the game is standing face-to-face with another creature and slapping each other until one of you falls over. Sitting in the heaviest armor with the max HP and weapons is literally the most effective way to play the game.

None of the game's fundamental mechanics have any cohesion. They're all completely separated and divorced from one another on all levels logically and functionally. Each independent system has as much iteration and design potential thrown into it that a literal child would.

This game, PixArk, and now ""Survival Ascended"", all had the potential to be great games, but instead, the absolutely pathetic studio designers would rather focus on shameless cash grabs relying on pretty graphics to fool you into believing the game is worth anything, instead of spending the same amount of effort hiring someone who actually knows how to make games fun and who might actually be able to turn this colossal shitstorm of high-def assets into a functional gaming experience that doesn't need to rely on a laundry list of mods to make 1) work, 2) performant, and 3) fun.

A company that can make as much money as Studio Wildcard and still have this ass of gameplay in their game is honestly unfathomable in game development. It's lead by a bunch of sociopaths with zero care for actually making a game and who want to find as many ways of peddling the same dross over and over again to the masses driven by nostalgia for a game that never existed.

You took advantage of a community for a decade. A community that prayed that you would take your cobbled-together product with infinite potential and polish it into the game they believed it could be. But they were duped. Every last one of us. Once you got your money and 15 minutes of fame, you jacked the price of your shitty alpha test to triple and you genuinely thought you deserved it and never bothered to finish it.

I mean, why would you? The community was already lapping your piss off the floor. Why actually bother to make the game good if you can just exploit the hype instead? You never have to do any real work and you make the same amount of money.

Yeah, fuck you, Studio Wildcard. Fuck this dogshit ass game that we tried so hard to enjoy in spite of your presence. Fuck Survival Ascended and fuck Ark 2. It's gonna be the exact same game as this. Dogshit. You will fix nothing. You will serve slop and you will demand the masses enjoy it because you have actually, unironically, drank your own kool-aid and you believe you are God's gift to game development. You fucking suck at developing video games and until that changes, this review will stand.

Even though all playthroughs start with you getting mauled by Alpha Raptor, it still has that charm that is so difficult to describe that I might even call it impossible to describe. However, there's always a catch, and the catch in this game is all the DLCs that came after Aberation pushed on TEK stuff, which i really hate. I want to tame some dinos with a bow and arrow, not fly around like drunk iron man. It especially gets worse in both Genesis parts, where developers for some reason thought it'd be a good idea to add missions that you need to grind day and night to access the final boss, and worst of all, the hexagon shop, where you can buy most of the top gear, element, top-tier saddles all for the cost of playing a couple of piss-easy missions like dodo basketball in a survival game. However, if we ignore the Genesis DLCs, the game is brilliant. Don't expect the good story, though; the deeper you look, the more crappy and lefty it'll become. All things considered, a great game that is more addictive than crack cocaine.

For one, it suffers from the same issue as every survival game on Steam: A buggy mess that will always feel like an early access game, at least the other survival games are honest enough to keep the early access label for the decade they've been out. The other reason is the fact that this game takes up 330 GB of space installed (180 if you only install the base map.) That is entirely too much space taken up for me to justify keeping it installed to play every once in awhile, unless I really want to sink a hundred hours into a save or something, I won't reinstall it. The developers really need to work on compressing all of this stuff down, like idk why it takes double the space if you install a few more maps, or why you need to take up so much in the first place but it is retarded; I have played games with far more content that are a tenth of the space or less that this takes up.",1702459654,1702459654,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the performance, UI, AI, animations, and most importantly, PERFORMANCE, [b] do not [/b] justify the price, the game is so badly optimized that It is literally frustrating to play it.
My advice is if you really want to play it, which I can understand since the base concept is very interesting and fun, is to wait for a discount.
Also because if you have bought pc able to run it smoothly you probably do not have any money left to buy it at full price lol.
I got it for 8 bucks ca. and I think It was a good price. I would not pay an extra cent for it.
No actually, don’t buy it, It’s been out for 4 years and is still as bad as day one, and they keep adding content!
It’s literally adding more shit on a [b] scorching [/b] mountain of shit before putting out the fire.
No, don’t buy it. 
Not even for at the price I got it for, the more I think about it the more confidently I can recommend you not to waste good pizza-buying money on this thing.
Go buy 7 pizzas instead, eat them, freeze them, give them away to some hobo, that is a way better use of all that money, jeez, you can even upgrade your RAM for that money, and save some.",1618416334,1702317941,False,4,1,0.52078777551651001,2,True,False,False

Ark: Survival Evolved - A Magnum Opus in Gaming Excellence
In the vast landscape of video games, where titles compete for attention and player loyalty, one game stands out as a true titan - ""Ark: Survival Evolved."" Developed by Studio Wildcard and released in 2015, Ark has managed to captivate the gaming community with its unique blend of survival elements, open-world exploration, and innovative gameplay mechanics. This essay explores the reasons why Ark: Survival Evolved can be considered the best game of all time. Immersive Open-World Experience:
At the heart of Ark's brilliance lies its sprawling, visually stunning open-world environment. The game transports players to the mysterious and dangerous island of ARK, teeming with prehistoric creatures and lush landscapes. The attention to detail in crafting this world is unparalleled, offering a visually immersive experience that rivals even the most cinematic games. The diversity of ecosystems, from dense jungles to frigid tundras, adds to the sense of adventure and discovery. Every corner of the island holds secrets, resources, and challenges, encouraging players to explore and engage with the environment actively. This open-world design fosters a sense of wonder and excitement, making Ark a game where every playthrough feels like a unique adventure. Dynamic and Realistic Ecosystem:
One of Ark's standout features is its dynamic ecosystem, where players must contend not only with other human survivors but also with a variety of AI-controlled creatures. The realism and attention to detail in the behavior of these creatures elevate Ark above its peers. The day-and-night cycle, weather patterns, and the predatory instincts of the dinosaurs contribute to a living, breathing world. Survivors must learn to adapt to the behaviors of different species, creating a sense of tension and excitement. Whether it's taming a massive T-Rex, avoiding a pack of raptors, or navigating the skies on a flying mount, every encounter feels like a unique challenge. This dynamic ecosystem adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, making Ark an ever-evolving experience that keeps players on their toes. Innovative Taming and Breeding Mechanics:
Ark: Survival Evolved introduces a revolutionary taming and breeding system that sets it apart from other survival games. Players can tame a wide array of dinosaurs and other creatures, turning them into loyal companions, mounts, or even powerful allies in battle. The process of taming involves everything from strategic planning and resource management to understanding the unique preferences of each species. The breeding mechanic takes the realism a step further, allowing players to raise and genetically modify their creatures. This adds a compelling layer of depth to the game, as players can invest time and effort into creating stronger, more resilient generations of creatures. The emotional connection that forms between players and their tamed creatures enhances the overall gaming experience, making Ark a truly memorable and personal journey. Complex Crafting and Building System:
Ark's crafting and building system is a masterpiece of complexity and creativity. From simple tools to elaborate fortresses, players can craft a vast array of items using resources gathered from the environment. The depth of the crafting system encourages strategic planning and resource management, adding an intellectual challenge to the game. The building mechanics allow players to construct intricate bases that serve both practical and aesthetic purposes. Whether building a fortress to fend off hostile players or creating a tranquil haven in the wilderness, the possibilities are limited only by the player's imagination. The sense of accomplishment derived from constructing a well-designed and functional base is unparalleled, creating a strong sense of ownership and pride. Multiplayer Dynamics and Community Interaction:
Ark's multiplayer dynamics are a crucial aspect of its appeal. The game supports both player-vs-environment (PvE) and player-vs-player (PvP) modes, offering diverse experiences to suit different playstyles. In PvP, the competitive nature of surviving against both the environment and other players adds a thrilling edge to the game. The constant threat of raids and the need for strategic alliances create a dynamic social environment.
On PvE servers, players can collaborate to overcome the challenges of the island without the constant threat of hostile players. The sense of community that emerges on these servers fosters cooperation, teamwork, and the sharing of knowledge. This communal aspect adds longevity to the game, as players form alliances, trade resources, and engage in large-scale cooperative ventures. Regular Content Updates and Support:
Ark: Survival Evolved has demonstrated a commitment to its player base through consistent and substantial content updates. Studio Wildcard's dedication to refining and expanding the game has kept players engaged over the years. New maps, creatures, and features are regularly introduced, ensuring that the game remains fresh and exciting. The developers actively listen to player feedback and address issues promptly, creating a symbiotic relationship with the community. This ongoing support not only enhances the overall gaming experience but also demonstrates a level of care and dedication that is rare in the gaming industry. In the vast and diverse landscape of video games, Ark: Survival Evolved stands out as a testament to the potential of the medium. Its immersive open-world, dynamic ecosystem, innovative mechanics, complex crafting system, multiplayer dynamics, and consistent updates collectively contribute to its status as a game of unparalleled excellence. Ark has not only redefined the survival genre but has also created a gaming experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gameplay. As players continue to explore the mysteries of the ARK, it becomes increasingly clear that Ark: Survival Evolved has secured its place as one of the greatest games of all time.",1585947143,1702262402,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- There are too many visual bugs (mostly reflections)
- The brightness is awful (I literally can't do anything at night cause I don't see anything)
- The building aspect is also poor (I hate that after 30 seconds I can not get all my resources back)
- Temperature bug (in some locations temperature is from 30 to -30 in a few steps from each other)
- Dino's poor obstacle avoidance (When Dino is following you it could stick everywhere).
- Light problem (When you a looking to the side from where the is sun, you will see only the white light and no more, for me it happened when I was looking from the forest to the beach)

I was trying to play as it was created by the author. But it looks more like torture, not enjoyment. So the only way to play ARK is to download mods that will fix every annoying problem.

namely because the game is good but this version runs like redfell but one of the developers was allowed to work on the game some more, altho ascended by this review has yet to be even shown except in pictures of trees and workbenches instead of this game being updated

instead of a free upgrade or even the scummy idea of selling it as a dlc that gives you just the remastered version of the game as long as the game is in your steam library they made it into a bundle with ark 2 at 45$ before going back on that and making both ark 2 and ascended like 60$ to 70$ whilst forcing people to abandoned to original game in favor of the still unreleased remaster by shutting down all official servers and abandoning it further whilst we still have fast spinning slow animation giant crab spiders for some reason

don't waste your money on here and just get ascended if you REALLY wanted to play the first ark
personally im never getting ark 2 and im literally gonna have to waste money on ascended just to be able to have a better working game that looks and runs better and has an actual working official server list

this version was what everyone experienced up until this point... and wildcards parent company now just wants extra money
this is just EA all over again but has less money in their pockets to burn

Edit: Ascended now that its out is still likely a better option but due to its lack of content you'll be hungry for content for probably a few years while wildcard's small team of people working on ascended remakes all the dlc for it that the base original game had
luckily it seems that when they come out they'll be free (because wildcard knows thats some bullshit despite Snailgames more than likely wanting them to put the dlc out for more costs for some reason) so thats a good bonus
however ascended doesn't necessarily have workshop support rn and if it does then it doesn't have the massive amount of mods that the original does",1684205079,1702104496,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

346110,67411347,76561198015425085,0,4,983,0,983,1586836434,"Take this review with a grain of salt since I've only been able to play Ark for nearly 20 hours.  Before I even delve into the gameplay, let me share with you the straw that broke the camel's back - the sheer amount of storage space that this game consumes.  Don't let the download screen fool you - this game consumes well over 100GB of storage space when extracted.  Even worse, each new update adds 10+ GBs of content.  With unimpressive visuals, it's actually insane that Ark requires this much space.  The textures are nothing to write home about and the vistas in the starting area were far from postcard-worthy.  Regardless, I had attempted to play this game after some time away, when the latest update completely filled my download cache and destination drive.  Even after clearing out my unplayed games, it was still too big to fit in either drive.  It was this point, after the latest update pushed my drive to its limit, that I uninstalled.

Secondly, the game is optimized so poorly that my 1080TI was struggling to run it on High settings.  The game does NOT look good enough to warrant my PC raising the temp of my entire apartment complex by 10 degrees.  It is actually ridiculous how much of a lack of concern the devs have with your ability to run this game.  Once they sell it to you with a shiny wrapper and the promise of having the Jurassic aged army of your dreams, you're practically dead to them.  Mission accomplished.
  
But none of that is really my main gripe.  You could skirt past these nitpicks for sure.  But no, my real issue is the gameplay, which, for any interactive experience I engage in, is most important.  First of all, I'm not sure how this game gets away with forcing the player to spend so much time performing mundane tasks only to subsequently punish the player with the plethora of bugs and RNG littered throughout the game.  Did you just spend several hours obtaining that trike you wanted?  Have a small army of gargantuan lizards at your command?  Trained each dino to be stronger and faster than your average plebeian?  Great!  Now watch as a few untimely spawns result in an aerial raid that swoops in and leaves your army and co-op partners in shambles!

To put it in perspective, during my first experience playing this game with some friends, the following events transpired:

* Crafted some decent weapons and a reasonable cache of supplies
* Tamed some low level dinos
* Tamed some tankier mid-level dinos
* Built a 2 story base of operations atop a fortified hill
* Built the majority of a wall around our base
* Assembled armor of decent quality and mid tier ranged weaponry

This equated to about... 10+ hours of work for me alone.  And most of it was coordinated by my tribe mates while I had already logged off for the night.  Note that I use the word ""work"" with FULL intention - all of these tasks were a slog and did not hold any innate entertainment value.  One of my least favorite of said chores was dino taming, which required that we babysit the dinos we wished to subdue while we periodically force feed them berrires/meats.  

Once our work had been completed, we could finally start getting into the groove and have a little fun exploring.  We had dinos to ride and places to be.  Our base was on the peak of a hill overlooking the landscape.  It was reasonably well fortified.  We had a pretty darn good foundation and were ready to set out... until a T-Rex-lookin' rage lizard that spawned meters away from our camp decided that it hated our tribe and everything it stood for.  A few grueling minutes and several futile deaths later, the damage was done.  Might as well have slapped a game over sign on the screen right then and there. 

So what was the damage tally exactly?  Most of us permanently lost our gear because we couldn't find it amidst the field of slaughter.  One player's gear clipped through the terrain, lost to the world.  All of our dinos, sans one tiny little guy who actually heeded our orders to stay within the base walls, were slaughtered mercilessly.  The demon spawn dino had left its mark all over the battlefield in the form of feces strewn with the DNA of our lost reptilian brethren.  Needless to say, that was a hard stop to the barely existent enjoyment elicited by this game.

I've tried to get started in this game twice since then, and have had similar experiences both times, though not nearly at the same tragic scale.  I think I can safely say that if you are the sort of person who appreciates hoarding your money for years only to have some lowlife dip steal your identity and make off with the lot of it, you would absolutely love this game!  I for one, in my barely sane mind, do not.  

To be fair, perhaps the hardcore survival game enthusiast would appreciate how uncannily rough this game is.  Though the lack of polish and care would grate on even the most avid of survival fans.  I thought I was included in their ranks, but clearly, after playing Ark, I discovered the limits of what I could feasibly survive.  Godspeed to all those who long for Ark's unique brand of suffering.  

P.S. In the spirit of fairness, yes, you can scale down some the more grindy elements in the game if you start your own server.  Did it matter that much when we tried it?  Not really.  Just meant that our inevitable loss hurt that much less when our tragic fate came to fruition.  But it was still time wasted, no matter how you slice it.  With that said, cheers to you, Ark - a complete waste of (nearly) 20 hours of my life.",1587014133,1701845712,False,8,2,0.618497133255004883,0,True,False,False

The game was always mediocre and clunky feeling, even if the concept is somewhat appealing. Gameplay loop is boring, and progression is abysmally slow if you want to try and attempt playing the story. Forget it if you play on a PvP server and also live in the real world, every time you log on you will be back at square one.

Will I die on the 'Ark is one of the best games to exist' hill? Absolutely.
After 400+ hours on PS4 I decided to drag my friends into this absolutely wild experience of a game and get it on PC; all I can say is it's some of the best time I have ever spent gaming with my friends. Aside from running for your bloody life the ENTIRE time, consistently putting one's self in peril, and some of the most anxiety inducing soundtracks, it's a super peaceful farming simulator. :) 
Also, how many raptors can one fit into a 1x1 structure? The answer may very much surprise you.

Starting off sucks and is the ultimate test of patience's and Personal fuse.  You will deal with death after death from one BS thing to another (looking at you raptor). But once you get a small base going and a few dinos it levels out and becomes quite the fun game.  As of this writing only unofficial servers exist or just  do single player if you want to cut lag from the equation (mostly).   It's got dinos a decent/basic  but sometimes Rage inducing building options with terrible snapping for certain pieces.  it is better with other people in tribes but solo play is still fun, tons to do and lots of dinos and other critters to tame or experience.

ARK has provided me thousands hours of entertainment.  At first, I started playing single player offline pve with a group of local buddies. Fantastic. Awesome game. Tons of dinos to choose from, great graphics(great sense of danger in the wild if you're playing on normal or harder settings and it requires effort to stay safe and survive). Lots of items and exciting game mechanics. 

After a good few weeks of offline fun, we travelled online(TBH Offline multiplayer was so fun I forgot online existed). However, I really felt like official servers already were ""Spoiled"" in a way. Theyre already super populated, every viable spot for a base or to farm resources is just inaccessible to you as a low level noob to the server because it's 'owned' by alpha tribes. Huge tribes are already established and they are not very outside player friendly. You either join them and be forced to play the game by their rules, or basically get spawn camped/imprisoned indefinitely. 

So then we decided to play on some private servers that seemed better governed. After a few tries, we quickly learned private servers aren't much better as servers owners usually just spawn in cool dinos and items for themselves and people close to them, making it seem pointless to actually go out and tame anything to compete, besides the fact it all kind of has the same 'Everybodys already been here and done that' feel to it. A few private servers we tried even had admins who would spawn in items/dinos for real $. Pay to win isn't my cup of tea. 

At this point my friends stopped playing, but I was dedicated and when I finally found what seemed like a friendly, decent PVE server, I enjoyed building up a base and a mini army over the course of a few weeks, only for it to be completely destroyed one morning upon logging in because somebody looted my base, let my dinos out, and my dinos killed some neighboring tribes dinos. Well, this tribe happened to be close to the admin and the admin literally just wiped our base because of something that happened while I was offline and had nothing to do with me. They just referenced the tribe log with my dinos and didn't care about my progress. After that I decided to play offline forever after. 

The game has a lot of small bugs but I personally have never had any huge issues that didn't stem solely from the fact it's UE4

Playing offline PVE is where almost all my gameplay time comes from, after my online experience. I treat this game as a solely offline hardcore survival game, with a bunch of mods from the workshop and a little bit of self-roleplay. I just couldn't find any joy in the online play but I can understand those that do.",1549025701,1701596599,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I heard this game long time ago since some youtubers played it and we can eat our own Poop. I wanted it.

I saw it on steam sale one time and happen to have money left from last game I bought so why not (and regret it later since epic make this game free). Turn out the thing that is missing from vanilla minecraft, the forest, etc games that contains survival and exploration is here. Sadly I dont have many friends like survival genre and dinosaur lol. So I play this game alone to this day.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Combined minecraft, the forest, etc. Those survival games I liked so much.
+ A mysterious story scattered on the island or any map you played. Make me curious to explore and truly progressing the game with boss battles.
+ Dinosaur mixed with modern alien like tech that doesnt feel too out of place actually.
+ Can make my own troops and Zoos lol, buldings is ok thing yif you know what you doing since the tutorial isn't clearly teach you how to assemble things than create material for it.
+ Game element is good and can be tweaked or nerfed as I like, giving much freedom to shape the game to what I like. Make sure you do it especially if playing with less than 4 people or alone.
+ Multiplayer can be fun. But again if you know how it works tho since no official support to make your own private game lobby/server.
+ Mod support, can fix many of the game QOL issues or bad takes of the game play devs did.
+ Eat your own poo/dino poop and getting sick. Perfection.
+ Dino variant even in the island map (1st base game map) is so many, every biome is different and make me more diligent to explore and tame. And the map is beautiful.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Size of the game is HUGE (I don't have big storage) base game already reach almost 110GB!! not mention expansion packs. Idk if I ever want to buy the expansion due to its sizes. Why not optimizing size of this game? And look they remasters the game now, with twice the size and twice the bug apparently.
- The performance of the game is horribly optimized, lags here and there. The game is so demanding and somehow demand RTX 4090 performance and still have issues. While the game itself look pretty it wasn't that amazing to require this much taxing performances. RDR2 is looking more amazing and I can run it in medium and it looks amazing with no issues. And they proceed to their next sequel somehow lol.
- The grinding when playing single player is ungodly. If you not tweak the world settings for single player, you will be punished severely playing alone with vanilla settings. Make sure you tinker with it.
- A tiny bit of clipping and glitch can save you or break your game. I mean break your game so you need to restart the whole save.
- Flying too high regards you out of bounds and resulting player dead, make your items disappears and sometimes your Dino just stuck in the air, making you need to find other argentavish, pterodactyl, etc for just call back your Dino. There's a mod to that since this is the one of most annoying thing in this game really.
- When you died or left your Dino in someplace you forgot, well goodbye. Thank god there's a mod for that problems. Annoying really.
- Idk but flying is so slow lol. There's a settings for it but why the vanilla setting so bad?? Make sure to tune it up especially playing alone.
- Weapon variance is very limited, but hey there's a mod to that. The jump from stone age to sci-fi is weird since the more modern you got the smaller things you can make.
- Some resources its really hard to farm/grind alone in base settings especially playing alone, but there's a settings for that and mods to help you.
- Mechanics of plumbing is questionable and logic defying, so for first timers its really hard to getting hang of it if not online guides helps you. (At least for me)
- Playing private multiplayer with friends is complex to settings, there's no options in main game how to configure this. You forced to use 3rd party software such as epidemic, tunggle, etc. that I find too complicated and confusing. There's a easier way to play with ""Tethering"" but you can explore game too far from each other or the game will force teleport you to host which is sucks really...
- ONLY play with FRIENDS for multiplayer. The public servers monopolized by ""Alpha Tribes"" that only griefing, raids newer players, etc. The public multiplayer filled with toxic, slavery, bully, etc to new players joining. Also idk how the hell the main server level cap/difficulty is ungodly, I cant even kill regular dodo at lvl 1 wtf? Completely ruin the game for new players. This is why i prefer single player or with friends only.
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Well the game living its name in steam quick review format as one category of the most taxing performance, bug ridden, unstable, glitchy, etc. But actually its not that bad for a game if they actually take times to polish it and optimized the textures. But instead they moving on with ""remasters"" since they seem to running out of budget for Ark 2 bcs they wasted it so much at marketing and weird projects outside the game than actually finishing this game or making the sequels. Reminds me a lot of Yahoo collapse. I don't recommend this game by this point anymore since major issues wont be updated anyway and we all know what kind of Devs we see here.",1606590167,1701394851,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.

It truly feels like Wildcard did not give a single damn about fixing anything and just wanted a cash grab. You CAN still play ARK:SE in private servers if nothing else, but honestly at this point, just ignore ARK as a whole for a good year and a half and MAYBE ARK:SA will be playable by then.

Poaceae (/poʊˈeɪsiaɪ, -siːiː/) or Gramineae (/ɡrəˈmɪniaɪ/) is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants commonly known as grasses. It includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and species cultivated in lawns and pasture. The latter are commonly referred to collectively as grass.

With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species,[4] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family, following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.[5]

The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family, providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice, barley, and millet as well as feed for meat-producing animals. They provide, through direct human consumption, just over one-half (51%) of all dietary energy; rice provides 20%,[6] wheat supplies 20%, maize (corn) 5.5%, and other grains 6%[citation needed]. Some members of the Poaceae are used as building materials (bamboo, thatch, and straw); others can provide a source of biofuel, primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol.

Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. The leaf grows from the base of the blade, an adaptation allowing it to cope with frequent grazing.

Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, excluding Greenland and Antarctica.[7] Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests and tundra.

Though they are commonly called ""grasses"", groups such as the seagrasses, rushes and sedges fall outside this family. The rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales. However, all of them belong to the monocot group of plants.",1701276670,1701276670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, youre telling us that the DLCs will be free but, I bet my last dime that you're just kidding about that too. You never intended to give us anything for free.

You created a gold mine when you released ARK SE and then didnt manage your money very wisely, went out and over spent and now you're broke, and most likely in debt, not realizing that the ASE money tree only grew so many dollar bills before it withered and died so you decided to chop that tree down and plant a new ASA money tree seed and used the players that supported ASE as manure for it!

I'm a huge dino fan and didn't need the trappings of PvP and tribes, and wanted to share my perspective having focused on single player.

My saved game, nearly a hundred hours in, was corrupted and lost. Several of my dinos have, on two seperate occasions, fallen through the world to an irretrievable purgatory at the bottom of the map. There have been a number of occasions where I have cursed my luck and the RNG gods. But then...

I ride through the jungle on my Iguanodon, looking for adventure...
Or I sail up the river, a dinosaur as my lone companion on a raft...
Or I simply walk under my T-Rex, and I grin.

The game world is gorgeous, and you can tame and then ride dinosaurs. So few games offer such an experience, and that's why I'll keep coming back, bugs and all.

Updated review (Nov. 2020)

Playing this game with friends or solo is quite a bit of fun

Playing this game on official servers can vary depending on the server you're on
you'll either constantly be getting wiped or adopted into a larger tribe. Follow their rules or you'll likely be kicked

the graphics were fine nothing major but when you're playing PvP it's best to have them turned down anyway

DLC Required to do just about anything worth doing

my experience was overall negative but I played on Official PvP servers joined a large tribe and was kicked
for the average player it's not going to be some crazy amazing experience but when you love dino's and want to experience having them as pets it's the best of the best for that sort of thing",1701074467,1701074467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For everyone seeing the recent negative reviews, let me give you a better picture of the situation (know that I'm giving it a bad review, but only this version, NOT the upgraded version which I DO RECOMMEND buying when allowed):

Wildcard has decided to ""remaster"" the game in Unreal Engine 5, adding other features, and improving things. Their port of Unreal Engine 4 is bad, and the game needed it. Because of this they are also getting rid of the Ark 1 servers entirely (other than unofficial servers obviously), in favor of the new and improved game upon being released.

While you see people complaining about this, realize that on OFFICIAL SERVERS as it stands, the vast MAJORITY of people are cheating. A quick Youtube search will show you just how bad and blatant it is. Something NEEDED TO BE DONE to solve this issue, because it is near unplayable for legitimate players with thousands of hours of experience, much less NEW PLAYERS who will have exactly 0% chance to enjoy the game.

The current state of their Official servers is NOT sustainable for years to come (which they planned to still support the servers), under the current load. Bringing in new people doesn't work under these conditions.

Originally it was supposed to be a free upgrade, but upon realizing it's not that easy to just make backwards compatible, along with everything else said, and the amount of work needed to be put into it, they are opting to charge $50, for BOTH the UPGRADED UE5, AND Ark 2 (pre order bundle).

This means if you do buy, you're basically buying each game for $25. The only major issue is they are charging an extra $40 for all of the expansions.

My personal suggestion for the next game if you're interested is buy it. You'll easily get your moneys worth out of it, get another game, and IF everything is better as it should be (including less cheaters based off the changes), then buying the DLC going forward is worth it.

You should also make sure that your computer can handle Ark however if you are going to be playing lots of heavy mods you should really make sure your computer is better by quite a bit. Otherwise, I recommend Ark it is a really fun game no matter what you like!

--- Update 2023 POST ASA Release ---
In my opinion, even if just for the greater availability of the dlcs we have all grown dependent on and have loved, playing ASE still brings a smile to my face even if it is slightly more laboured after coming from the better overall feel of ASA (Graphically at least). As far as the bugs go, i would still pick to play ASE Hardcore over ASA just due to the fact I tend to play more unofficial due to time limits. Maybe it's also down to the fact you love what you get used to.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

You can explore caves, oceans, forests, swamps, mountains and much more and also tame creatures to help you throughout the game, the changes in weather vary depending on where in the world you go, which makes it very fun and challenging. There is a good Tribe system which is great for playing with friends / group / clan members and I always enjoyed the different events the game offered such as Fear Evolved and Winter Wonderland. The game also offers single player mode and you can play competitive PvP in Multiplayer, or simply against the environment in PvE depending on your preference. If you like survival games with a difference, and the ability to progress and take on new challenges then I would definitely recommend this game, ARK: Survival Evolved is the best survival game I have played to date. 

The DLC expansions are all worth it and have their own unique features and characteristics, bringing even more to the story and the journey for the explorer.

- Played since pre-release in 2015 and I've seen all the new content come in over the years, and I'm still playing now at the time of this update (2021)!

- I'm still playing this at the end of 2023. I've enjoyed the story that's been brought to the game over the last several years and the evolution of the characters and dialogue. The added voice overs are a great addition and give the story an extra spark of life.

To give you an example there is a reload bug in the game with certain weapons like the bow where the reload animation will play, and all visuals will point to you having reloaded except you cannot shoot.
Only when you look at the hotbar do you see it somehow didn't actually reload.

Now I would say this is a pretty game breaking bug, but at the very least you can't argue it's incredibly annoying.
The kicker here is that there are posts going back 6 years of this bug being reported by the community, and Wildcard still hasn't fixed it.

There are more relatively small but annoying bugs like these, for example it's also far too common that you will hit something with sound, visuals etc all confirming but it will do absolutely nothing.
A hit in the head will count as a body shot and vice versa.
Opening the server browser on default filters freezes your game as it collects info of 5000+ servers on the UI thread.
Single player has worse performance than running a dedicated server /on the same machine/.

This along with the reskin of ARK that is Atlas, and now the ARK in a new jacket that is ARK: Survival Ascended, leaves me with very, very little trust and respect for the developers.

That all said, if you collect some friends, some mods, and are techie enough to setup and debug a server (or just pay for one) you can still have a good time with it.
That however is not enough for me to be able to recommend buying the game.",1493407189,1700768684,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The scale of this game is mind-blowing. The diverse landscapes, from lush jungles to icy peaks, and the attention to detail in the creatures make exploring the map a constant adventure. There's a genuine sense of awe when you come face to face with a towering dinosaur or discover a hidden oasis.

Survival is the name of the game, and ""Ark"" nails it. Starting from scratch on a mysterious island, you're thrown into a world where every resource matters. Crafting tools, building a shelter, and taming dinosaurs for companionship or battle—it's a relentless but rewarding cycle.

The multiplayer aspect is where ""Ark"" really shines. Forming tribes and engaging in epic battles or cooperative building projects with other players adds a whole new layer to the experience. The stories that emerge from these interactions make each server feel alive.

Now, let's talk about the not-so-glamorous side. Optimization can be a bit of a headache. The game looks gorgeous, but performance issues on certain systems can be a drawback. It's a small price to pay for the breathtaking visuals, but it's worth noting.

And yes, the learning curve is steep. ""Ark"" doesn't hold your hand, and survival can be brutal. But trust me, the satisfaction of building a thriving base and taming powerful creatures makes the struggle worthwhile.

In a nutshell, ""Ark: Survival Evolved"" is a crazy, challenging, and utterly addictive survival experience. The massive world, the thrill of taming dinosaurs, and the dynamic multiplayer interactions make it a must-play. Sure, there are some performance hiccups and a tough learning curve, but the sheer depth and excitement of the gameplay make it an adventure worth diving into.",1700653886,1700653886,True,18,3,0.686169445514678955,0,True,False,False

Game dead, but still fun. Any bugs and you on your own. Devs have put this one to bed. 
I still reckon buy it instead of ASA, you need a PC built by NASA to run ASA.
It's been good. See you in Ark 2. I need a break, so will opt out of ASA

*Update*
Y'know, I've put nearly 5k hours into this game. There's a reason for that. It's a good game. It's a very fun and enjoyable game. Would I recommend it? Yes. Very Yes. It's fun and can be a fantastic way to sink many hours into.
It can be quite the labour of love this game. It can take a while to get use to at the beginning. You will die, for many many reason. You were attacked by a dilo. 
You were attacked by a rex. 
You couldn't find a water source. 
You fell off a rock that was higher than expected. 
You were collecting fiber and accidentally hit the melee button so you punched a bronto's big toe and it got angry and smashed you in the face with its tail, which in itself didn't kill you, but knocked you far enough that you bounced off a cliff and fell to your death. Ah well, start collecting that thatch for you house again. But if you give this game the time, it can be very rewarding. The feeling of riding around on a giga and stomping down trees or munching anything in one bite is an amazing feeling when you think about the fact that a dino 1/5 your size kept stealing your berries a while ago on the beach. Damn you pegos!

I know I have been rather critical of the devs and while they are firm on their decision to not give customer support to legacy servers it doesn't seem to matter too much anymore. Many of the issues seem to be resolved as they find them, or at least a work around is deployed while they investigate them. With the use of the discord to reach out to many more players and customers it seems like Wild Card are making a much bigger effort to really get involved with their players and receive feedback. It's really encouraging and makes this game much more worth while. 
If you're looking for a game that will consume almost all of your free time but this isn't a problem for you, this is the game you need. Probably one of the best survival games out there.

*Update* 
I have played this game for over 2000 hours more since I wrote the above review. 
Do I recommend it? The game, yes I do, I do recommend it. The developer? Well, I'm not sure. They seem to enjoy adding new content and much of the new content is actually fun. The new maps are cool and the devs seem to be actually semi interested in encouraging mods.
However, there are some game breaking bugs that the devs seem to horrifically struggle to fix,  reporting in there weekly update blog that this is an 'ongoing issue being addressed' but never actually seems to be sorted.
Oh and they also still are giving the finger to the  players on their legacy servers. ""Thanks for helping us improve the game to official release, oh and gl, you're on your own, oh you have this game breaking problem that could potentially ruin your entire game so far? Yeaaaa, nahhhhh.....""

I have had a great deal of fun in this game. Over 700 hours of fun at the time of this review. The idea behind the game is brilliant and it had the potential to be an absolutely awesome long term project, but unfortunately I have come to realise this will not happen. Multiple bugs that remain for extended periods of time despite patches claiming to have fixed them. The patches themselves are big, sometimes in the multi gigabyte range and almost daily. 
However, the biggest problem is that the devs do not seem to care about the customers. Upon launch it was announced that the 'legacy' servers, the servers that existed during their beta testing time would have all customer support axed from them. That was a huge ""screw you"" to the bulk of their customer base. Because with the price increasing 4 fold I don't think they will be getting a massive increase in customers any time soon. 
Prior to that, any tickets I did send in were responded with ""We are sorry but our customer service team is unable to assist you with this issue. Below is a link to the forums that may have details on how others solved this or a similar problem...""

Because of the coding issues and the lack of customer consideration I will not recommend this game. If you enjoy survival games with dinosaurs and such then go for, but don't expect anyone at Wildcard to help you if something goes wrong, you're out of luck there.",1504136328,1700627639,True,0,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

The game is wonderful and it saddens my heart that I can no longer play again due to their current cash grab. I played mostly on official PVE servers and had a great time for a lot of it but not all. Before they went stupid with the server rates I stayed up all night to tame a Quetzel missed worked the next day lol and to me that was fun. I had some great relations in game between other players but mostly was a lone wolf type no tribe fro me. By the end I had amassed a plethora of the rarest of rares including dinos skins chibis and had a blast collecting over the years. I never expected to carry any of these items with me to Ark 2 and knew I would have to say goodbye eventually never intended on ASA thought I would just go to Ark 2 and i would start anew there but now wont even be playing Ark 2 due to such greediness portrayed by the developers.  I would recommend this game to others if it were not for the fact they are trying to get more money from me for the same game with prettier graphics. So to finish I had a blast playing this game and last year would have recommended but will never play any Snail or Wildcard games again even if I received for free.

[h2]physics[/h2] good physics like momentum based fall damage or tek momentum physics and slightly broken but advanced ragdoll physics and dropped item physics
[h2]immersion[/h2] very immersive very story driven good graphics and ambiance such a small amount of bugs and lag and great ai and ui
[h2]ai[/h2] very advanced best ive ever seen creatures can form pacts some can send scouts and some fight eachother and some eat in the wild and they run when they about to die herbivores will actually eat plants when wild 
[h2]variety[/h2] lots you will never grind as long as you dont tame a lot and you dont die a lot lots of different tiers with lots of different weapons and lots of enemy types and they vary a lot even if there the same type lots of different areas 
[h2]skill[/h2] very skill based your reaction speeds aim perception will be stressed heavily and you will need massive amounts of quick thinking and strategy 
[h2]devs[/h2] unbelievable good best ive ever seen they interact very well they respond on all sorts of social media and they constantly talk about whats going on via community crunches they do yearly streams and donate to childrens hospitals ive even had a dev respond to me when no one in the community would and modding contests and official mods and they do much more great things  
[h2]other[/h2] dont get mods they cause lots of bugs and lag you can loss lots and its very very hard and its very thrilling because of it this is by far the most toxic community on earth i do not recommend official servers there not bad but there not the best way to play",1638251950,1700618413,True,12,2,0.421605080366134644,3,True,False,False

Edit (May 2023): 
As of right now, be vary of buying.
If you are playing on official server, they will be closing on August, the reason is the upcoming release of remastered ASA version
I understand this move, to encourage the playerbase to buy the remaster. The closure of the servers will be all right, but asking me to pay 60$ for the game I already own will all the DLC's? No discount? Nothing?
Guess I will be passing on the remaster and be waiting for a sale for like 20$ or 30$. Also the DLC's in the remaster will be available one by one by half and year. Considering previous WildCard delays, I dont event think the remaster will be available in August, maybe December? :). All in remaster release, the official servers will close, Island and Scorched will be available with the initial release. And to get something like Genesis 2, you will need to wait for end of a 2024.

General issues:
Have you ever wondered how good your PC is? Well for a small investment of $65 AUD and a small investment of $45 AUD for each subsequent DLC which allow you to play the game properly, you can now benchmark your system. 
Step 0: Download Ark + DLCs (optional but not really) on an SSD (optional but not really) which will cost you approximately 3 business days and 650 gigabytes 
Step 1: click on servers. 
Step 2: join an official island server. 
Step 3: navigate your way to within a 50km range of Ice Cave. 
Step 4: if you get above 15fps, your PC is well suited to run ark, and you probably spent too much money on it. 
If you bought ARK for an immersive experience combined with a hardcore PVP experience, you have been lied to and should prepare to get shafted as the devs are f*cking braindead. Somehow managing to create neither, and through sheer ret@rdation created a game which crashes due to being open, and naturally has the worst desync possible due to all server hosting performed on a $30 toaster. If your PC cost <$4000 to assemble or you use an alienware assembled PC, do not expect to be able to play this game on >20 fps with constant stutters on lowest graphics, overclocking, and INI enabled. The minimum requirements on the ark store page are described as: NVIDIA GTX 670 , Intel I5, and 8gb ram, but they are lying to you and you will not actually get past the steam library, let alone reach the game settings, which is necessary to mute 'main menu music' before it causes irreparable ear damage to all who wish to launch the game. Hence, it is recommended to place your headphones outside, surrounded by pillows, with all doors and windows shut before attempting to open ark for the first time, and after any subsequent redownloads following the clearing of ssd space necessary to download other games. If all these obstacles are overcome and your game hours accidently exceeded 2 hours, you will then proceed to either Official or Unofficial where your will commence your rapid loss of braincells.

Official:
After spending >1700 hours playing this abomination which some may call a game, i can safely say that the official ark experience is comparable to running a marathon on legos. The sheer inability to play the game due to an agglomeration of trash servers which constantly lag and crash, obvious cheaters which don't get punished because the entire ark team are composed of pay check stealers, and servers which don't wipe, completely disable the average human from being able to waste enough braincells on this game to progress past stone hatchet. As an Australian player, it is difficult to find servers at all, let alone servers which function, have players, have less than 50% of the pop as cheaters, and have <300 ping which would enable us to shoot arrows out of a crossbow without having arrows frequently stuck in the chamber. Due to a lack of server wipes on ark official, it has become quite challenging to build a base or pvp for most players, and whilst the 20 remaining tryhard oce players no life this game for an eternal ego contest, blowing through stone bases with 2k dura tek armor, and covering 75% of the map in spam to 'defend their home server', the casual player is eradicated. It quickly becomes apparent that Ark official is not for mere mortals, but for the pure degenerates which can invest 12 hours a day playtime and know 5 people that are capable of the same. So why not move to official they say?

Unofficial:
Have commitments outside of video games? Tired of spending 3 hours taming a lvl 50 pteranadon which will die to a guy with a capped fabi and tek regardless? Tired of being unable to build anywhere as Ark Servers have not wiped since launch? Don't know 5 other degenerates willing to play ARK? Tired of non-moderated servers where cheaters have unsanctioned residency? Unofficial is for you! Here we offer a wide range of amenities, such as: 
1. Dead servers! Because nobody plays this fucking game, especially in OCE where there are approximately 40 players across 2 clusters which avoid sunlight as they thirst for the experience of wasting their hours on ARK.
2. The ability to play ARK casually! Just kidding! No person without degenerate friends and an obnoxious amount of free time can seriously compete against players who live and breath ark, spending days on end minmaxing their dino lines to wipe all the casual non-loser players off their already dead servers.
3. 5x rates means 5x easier??? Contrary to popular belief, '5x' written in unofficial server names does not actually represent 5x rates, it actually means that the tryhard ARK players which do not sleep have 5x more sh!t than you, and get 5x more loot from your trash base after soaking all your turrets with their 5x hp turtles.
4. At least you can build a base! I mean i guess, but then you are simply more ret@rded than the tryhard players which will wipe you anyway, and if any human does a cost-benefit analysis of building a base on unofficial, they will see an obvious trend where there is actually no benefit, and the cost scales with amount of playtime invested into a particular server, resulting in a net negative relationship, leading you to question, why play PVP at all?

PVE
Now you may be wondering, if there are no players on official and no players on unoffical, where does the concurrent ark playerbase come from? Crazy as it may sound, ARK is a scam, and the advertisement of ARK as an MMO PVP game is a blatant lie, as the wildcard marketing team gaslight people into believing that ARK is a PVP game with a substantial player base, but in reality, people are tired of the cyclical nature associated with getting raided and rebuilding on ark PVP servers. However, PVE servers may be the light at the end of the tunnel for ARK Survival Evolved, single-handedly carrying the ARK player count on steamcharts from 300 to ~40,000, but this only underscores the cancerous nature of attempting to play ark PVP, commonly resulting in PTSD, suicidal tendencies, and broken gaming peripherals. And if you are anything like myself, a casual gamer looking for an authentic and enjoyable PVP experience, your will arrive at the inevitable conclusion that this game is not worth playing.
 
TLDR: through a short summation of a few of ARK: Survival Evolved's issue, it would be preferrable for any human to commit suicide rather than spend >= 2 hours on this trash game.",1579467419,1700571751,False,3,1,0.565217375755310059,3,True,False,False

the audio might bug out and a t rex will silently approach you from behind and destroy everything you hold dear
or you might see a megalodon achieve chim and swim above the water, menacingly
and sometimes you might be riding on your boat in the ocean and a megalodon appears in the middle of your boat, (dont worry though, he doesnt know whats happening either)
my personal favorite is when you look at an ankylo and he has a seizure, and twerks so hard that his body turns into laffy taffy and he shoots up into the sky like melted cheese and disappears forever, for seemingly no reason at all.

I have can run this game on medium with like 20fps. Not very good at all. (I have a GTX 560)
However this game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO fun so yeah.
Edited:

I got a new pc with I7 4790k GTX 980TI 6GB 16GB RAM and so on. I can run this game max settings at like 40 mininum-60 maximum FPS. This game is beautiful and a joy the play. Game is grindy on servers that do not have X3 or above. Worth the money if you have a High-end pc. Enjoyable but a bit lonely when you have no one to play with.... :( But still fun ;D
9/10
Edited:
Shutting down official servers in August, charging us another £50 for 'Ark Ascended' in august which is a remaster of a game we already paid for and we also have to pay for the dlcs we already paid for which are £20 each!!!! What a joke. The dlcs should be free, and the  remaster should be at least 50% off for current ARK owners to purchase £25 for an upgrade with the dlcs that I already own would be fine, but what they are currently charging is criminal.
Edited:

ASA launched in a rough state, but at least you get all the dlcs and £35 is a fair price. Also the price decrease of base ARK to £12 is a good call.",1433437251,1700242751,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I have started playing ARK: Survival Evolved in 2015.
Back then it was in Early Access and therefore the game didn't have nearly as much features as it does today. 
It only had one map and only the most iconic dinos were present at that time.
And at this stage I really loved the game. At first, I tested the game in a Free Weekend and I was so amazed that the following week I just couldn't get enough and bought it.
Even though the graphics were very demanding, the concept of the game was super catching.

I really loved the idea of dinosaurs dominating the world and that all you could do is to build a small safe space around you. Whenever you left that area, it was dangerous and took some actual decision-making.
The feeling of knocking down a Carnotaurus with only 20 tranq-arrows was amazing, considering how long it took to even make those. And the feeling of finally taming that powerful creature was astounding.
It was a time in my life where I would just sit in school and think about what I'll do next as soon as I come home.
It was a time where I was perfectly happy just because of my new little world that I could roam in. Similarly to what Minecraft was for many, including me.

Now here is a list of thing that I really loved and defined the game for me:
- Never being powerful. The fact that every journey could be your last. No matter when.
- The natural connection to your tamed dinosaurs
- The fitting primitive lifestyle with mere traces of modern society like automatic rifles or RIOT armor.
- The heavy grinding needed for simple structures. It took me a whole day to make a small wooden hut.
- The music. That music oh my god was it beautiful. Especially while Halloween or Christmas time.
- The various dinosaurs, that all were pretty fitting and only a few exceptions didn't ""feel"" like they shouldn't belong in the game.
- The tribes and alliances. The ability to actually have an enemy. The fear of being raided in the middle of the night. (Yes I really do not like the concept of offline protection).
- The thriving modding community that was present at that time.

But all of that got lost at some point. And I can really pinpoint that moment.
TEK Tier.

It's not really just the TEK Tier that is the problem, but a lot of reasons followed that made the game enjoyable for me.

To me the TEK Tier was way too op and it was clearly not directed to a PvE game, but it fueled the dominance war on official servers. Small tribes have absolutely no chance. Either you join, or you simply don't play on the server.

This really breaks the illusion of a dangerous world that you somehow ended up with with the only goal in mind being to survive.
It's gone! That humans can just come along with their laser beam Rex, fly the last 100 meters with their jetpacks and then insta-kill me with their sci-fi blaster is just too much.
This is not ARK nowadays. This is some random patchwork-game that spits on the grave of a dear memory of mine.

The fact that I can no longer enjoy nor recommend ARK is a sad true reality.",1446390238,1700104377,False,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,True

It is an awesome game, I think most if not all survival players will enjoy this game it has a good challenge, but everything is modifiable in game making it super easy to make the game much more simple, countless hours in both single and online plat available. Some of the largest flaws and advantages of the game are the same depending on the player (such as how in PvP the game never stops so when you log off a player can still come to your base and take your loot requiring a pretty consistent play schedule. It is a sandbox but it does have end game bosses resulting in an end game goal each boss has has 3 different difficulties resulting in it being more accessible to all players, though if you want to have to follow quests and have certain objectives this is not the game for you. This game is also EXTREMELY grindy (with base modifiers) but this game is definitely in my top 3 games, though most of the dinos aren't accurate in the slightest, but most are rather unique in abilities, such as some have unique attacks or being good at harvesting materials that others aren't the leveling process. Overall I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 stars. This game also has an amazing steam workshop community that run wonderfully but be warned this game is big it takes a lot of room especially if you want expansions with it (which are worth getting if you have the space) this games pricing might as well not exist it is worth it to buy the game.",1609271398,1700026356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mods make the experience better, like pretty much any other game. 

It's also the only game that actively pisses me off time and time again. Singleplayer is fun, but not when I lose a Rex to a shitty glitch that's been around since forever, or I have a tame corpse bouncing around because friendly fire also counts towards harvesting corpses for some reason, or literally any of the other bugs that could have been fixed. Sometimes I'd rather play Rimworld on Losing is Fun instead of this shit. I always shoot the stupid jellyfish on sight ever since the time they knocked me off of my first Sarco and nearly killed me. I make sure every Alpha Raptor suffers by drowning under a sea of Dimorphodons. Right as soon as I get a raptor mount, I beat the shit out of every Dilo that crosses my path for the next three hours. Don't get me started on the fucking Troodon. If you haven't played Ark yet, they will become your worst nightmare during early-game. The only reason why I want to play this game any more is because I haven't found another survival sandbox with the same shit. I also fail to understand why whoever calls the shots decided that we needed a new version of this instead of this version being fixed first.

ARK: Survival Evolved catapults players into a prehistoric playground, blending survival, exploration, and the thrill of taming dinosaurs into an epic adventure. While the journey can be both rewarding and challenging, it's an experience that stands out in the crowded survival game genre.

Graphics and Immersion (4.5/5):
Visually, ARK is a stunning testament to the power of modern gaming technology. The lush environments, diverse landscapes, and intricately designed creatures contribute to a truly immersive experience. The attention to detail, especially in the animation and behavior of dinosaurs, adds a layer of authenticity to the game world.

Survival Gameplay (4/5):
Survival is the name of the game in ARK, and it delivers a challenging yet engaging experience. Players must contend with hunger, thirst, and the elements while also facing the ever-present danger of hostile creatures. The depth of the crafting system and the need to build shelters and gather resources add a satisfying layer of complexity.

Dinosaur Taming and Riding (5/5):
The standout feature of ARK is undoubtedly the ability to tame and ride dinosaurs. The process of taming, which involves everything from feeding to protecting your future companion, is a rewarding and time-consuming endeavor. The thrill of riding a T-Rex into battle or soaring through the skies on a Pteranodon is an unparalleled joy in the gaming world.

Multiplayer Dynamics (4/5):
The multiplayer aspect of ARK introduces a dynamic social element. Forming tribes, engaging in PvP battles, and cooperating to tackle colossal creatures amplify the game's excitement. However, server performance and occasional technical hiccups can detract from an otherwise enjoyable multiplayer experience.

Exploration and Adventure (4.5/5):
The vast open world of ARK encourages exploration, and each biome holds its own challenges and unique creatures. Discovering hidden caves, encountering rare species, and unlocking the mysteries of the obelisks contribute to a sense of adventure that keeps players invested in the expansive world.

Learning Curve (3.5/5):
ARK's learning curve can be steep, especially for newcomers to the survival genre. While the game provides some guidance, understanding the intricacies of taming, crafting, and dealing with aggressive dinosaurs may take time. The community and online resources play a crucial role in easing the learning process.

Updates and Development (4/5):
The developers have shown a commitment to ARK's ongoing development, consistently delivering updates, expansions, and new features. The evolving nature of the game adds longevity and keeps players anticipating what's next in the ever-expanding ARK universe.

Conclusion (4/5):
ARK: Survival Evolved offers a captivating blend of survival mechanics, breathtaking visuals, and the sheer thrill of interacting with dinosaurs. While the learning curve might be steep, the depth of gameplay, the joy of taming, and the constant evolution of the game make it a compelling choice for fans of survival and adventure genres.",1699959328,1699959328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is been so when they released it and now when it is been bought by Chinese company (Snail Games)  it only goes down to be more worse, like for example adding more fantasy creatures than dinosaurs (still many dinosaurs missing).

I do not know any other game with that many problems.Steam server info shows that 16 people are online, but when searching for someone or talking in the chat then nothing, and no ones nowhere. So steam is just showing those numbers to be up on  a list so that clients can see and prevent existing ones to go away?! Valguero is not that big not to find someone...and i know almost everybody!

I remember when i lost my first characters progress thanks to some strange lag that got replaced by some short rollback- like i died and lost my tribe and an ownership with it over my huge base and dinos. Thank god i pincoded some stuff (like dinos in pods) and doors to get trough. So it was on The island map!

*if you do not have the ability to assign this game to your secondary graphics card(not the integrated one)...then put this game in your wishlist and wait for ark to be playable on potatoe pc's.(if that ever happens)*

In it's current state i HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival/crafting games.it's top dog as far as i'm concerned.

Every game get's negative reviews but read them,look at the hours played or lack thereof :)
I can't do lets plays of this game on my youtube channel because it's graphical intense nature,but please stop by and drop a like if you've found this review helpful.

I stand by my review and would like to add that every update brings more content and some optimizations.I will continue to update this review as time goes on!
BUY THIS GAME!!!

5-17-16
NEW MAP....WOOT!!!!!!!!

8-18-17
Just in case your still not sure about getting this game.......read the recomended specs....if you don't at least meet those requirements....upgrade your pc or move on. 

8-17-18
If they don't resolve all the capped servers i'm probably going to remove my recomendation to buy this game.(although if you are a single player type this means nothing to you so buy it)

11-30-19
pods resolved my last issue :)

2-29-20 Genesis is out and i've yet to figure it out, however the maps are beautiful!.......also genesis is not for noobs!

11-5-20 I sure hope genesis 2 is better than one.....the grind required to beat the bosses is basically impossible.
official servers are still laggy trash, although better than they used to be.

8-1-2021 Gen 2 is not for new players to the game! IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS, START OFF ON THE ISLAND! NOT GEN 2! You only get the ""new player experience"" once! Don't ruin it for yourself!
......Yes this IS still my favorite game of all time!

With some fellow acquaintances and a bit of tomfoolery, you can have a riot of laughter. Speaking of this great characteristic, I indeed shared many chuckles with my close companion. This is owed to the fact that the aforementioned piece of entertainment is highly versatile and ludicrous. Even without fellow participants, I must say, I unequivocally approve of this excellently assembled piece of art.

This was a good game however the storage for this game is unacceptable
440 ish GB. Almost half a Terabyte for 1 GAME.
If you have a Nasa computer with Nasa storage and Nasa download speed then get this game.
But other than that just don't bother with this game.
Also snail games (the parent company of Wildcard studios) are the worst pieces of shit I have ever seen on this planet.
Here is a video that explains the Snail games issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p30ErFvU0-0
Anyway moral of the review:
Bad parent company
Terrible optimisation for storage
Also costs a bit too much
Please only buy if you can install the game and if you have the money to buy it.",1699645808,1699645808,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False
