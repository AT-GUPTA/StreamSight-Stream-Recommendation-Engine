I tried everything, from verify files, updates to graphic drivers and win11 etc, what finally fixed it was, I had to download Rome 2, which I am guessing installs some files missing from the Attila install.

Anyway, I have hundreds of hours in Attila on my old steam account, and I still love it out of all the historical TW games. The setting and the gloomy doomy atmosphere, the higher difficulty which every other game lacks, even the music, it's something that appeals to me. The battles play well, and it really is amazing (and frightful) when you're defending your first siege against 2 or 3 stacks of huns.

Please fix the performance CA. Total war deserves better and so do your customers. We may be fickle sometimes, but there is good reason. Many of us who play TW have been at your side since the very or near beginnings of TW's journey.

We know the ins and outs, and it hurts to see how things have gradually declined. 

I stayed aboard out of faith for a better future. My faith began to waver long ago, and I no longer see the same experience. It has been cheapened, especially since Warhammer. 

I Miss the good old TW experience found in medieval 2 or Rome. Attila is perhaps the last TW I have actually had a pleasant experience. 

Still, I miss all the features that were removed in more recent renditions. But a fix for Attila would be a start back to the road of redemption in many hearts and minds in your customer base.

Total war modding has always been a staple of the TW community, but Attila takes it to another level. Likely the last truly epic historical total war, and it plays unlike any of the other total war titles. It's about survival. That alone makes this a unique one for TW. Though Shogun may feel more polished, Attila feels grim, dark, and medieval in a way few games capture. 

The Medieval mod makes this essentially Medieval Total War 3, which I love, but really for me the mod that shines is Radious. From the unit additions, to the quality of life fixes, this mod really cranks this game up to 11. Playing as the Western Roman Empire, or Eastern Roman Empire, is a game about surviving marauding hordes,  managing religious strife, trying to avoid plagues, balancing complex politics, diplomacy, as much as it is about waging war on a truly massive scale. Cavalry is king in this game, so if you like seeing heavy horsemen slamming into infantry, this game is for. If you like managing a disaster, this game is for you. If you like the sound of playing a Lord of the Rings total war game, that's right this is for you.

And like the historical period it covers (4th century to 8th century), it remains under-appreciated by many in the total war community (including you Creative Assembly). 

Almost 10 years later, many veterans of the historical total war franchise only play Attila (and bit of Rome II) due to its great basic economy, battle, and climate systems for community mods. 

Thankfully, the fanbase took charge and developed Attila where CA fell short.

Attila is home to many historical total war scenario mods covering vast time periods. Attila fanbase created historical scenarios from the fall of Carthage (Ancient Empires), the fall of Western Roman Empire (5th century Fall of the Eagles), the last attempt to restore the fragmented West Roman Empire (Age of Majorian), the Last Roman reconquest of Western Rome (6th century with Belisarius and Justinian in the Eastern Roman Empire - Age of Justinian), hypothetical Roman 5th century crisis (Terminus Total War Attila), the rise of the first Islamic caliphate (Age of Emperor Heraclius and fall of the Sassanids in 7th century - the Last Persian), the rise of the last Sassanid great king (Age of Khosrow II), up until the 4th crusade in the 13th century (Medieval 1212 AD). (I might have missed a few still).

Attila Total War had a buggy launch and poor optimization. It could not live up to the polished Rome II and the huge community the former attracted and held, but it was unique in its design, fresh concept, environment, and mechanics. 

Attila Total War introduced to the total war franchise: 

-Horde (migratory tribes community) mechanics, horde is your army. But it is not only your border defences or offensive force like in past total war titles, but also ""your culture's survival"" with horde buildings (like a mobile settlement), faction economy, agent recruitment, army recruitment, and mere existence of a faction on the grand campaign map. 

Horde battles have thin margins of error (getting a horde or migratory tribe wiped out means your faction becomes significantly weaker, and in some cases, one battle away from defeat if your remaining horde is defeated). Every move must be calculated lest you find yourself cornered and surrounded by enemy doom army stacks in a hostile land. Balancing the ledger also isn't easy, your income often depends on how fertile the land is while your horde is migrating through.

-Razing mechanics - want to put an entire enemy settlement to the sword and leave nothing alive behind?  Well you can, by razing aka ""let none live."" In fact, it's the Huns factions' favourite past time. Resettlement after a raze takes ages (reflecting the slow return of the population).

-The game is harder than previous total war titles. You are given a bucket to bail out a sinking ship with most factions.

-Climate Change - your land would not be fertile enough to support your culture forever, and going on migration south into foreign empires might be your best option.

-The Hunnic Scourge (the impending doom aka abandon all hope) - for many factions, the Huns invasion (like the Mongol and Timurid Invasion) is ""arrival of death"" itself. Most culture's unit rosters will not have satisfactory answers to full stacks of mobile skirmishing horse archers and shock cavalry lancers (rip Vikings, gothic tribes, desert kingdoms, and to a lesser extent, WRE). The Huns are so terrifying in fact that they bring with it a huge morale penalty when fighting against it with Christian factions.

But then Eastern Roman Empire (particularly, its elite Tagmata regiments and Clibanarii shock cav regiments) be like: Yo, hold my wine and olive oil, imma go smack that Hun horse archer boi real quik. 

-Sanitation - public order is no longer dependent on taxes, absence of wars/destruction, raiding parties, and religion. Your must ensure your settlements have sufficient sanitation to keep it clean, otherwise, disease will ruin your population growth and economy. We distinguish ""civilized"" and ""uncivilized"" in Attila through smell only.

-Migration/settlement - many factions allow the player to ""pack up your culture"" and move elsewhere - no longer are you firmly wedded to your starting region. You can settle your people in a safe and fertile land far from your culture's ancestral land, and build an empire there, just like the Visigoth, Ostrogoth, and Vandals did historically. 

-Horse archers are incredibly useful and dangerous. Battles can be won by ""feigned retreats"" and ""kiting"" the enemy by spamming light horse archers. Heavy infantry and cavalry melee are no longer the only way to win battles. An army of horse archers skillfully ""micro'd"" can assassinate generals, whittle enemy infantry down to bits, and shred enemy heavy cavalry.  Lack of ammo is your only enemy.

-War Weariness - in Age of Charlemagne DLC - aka various negative faction effects from constantly being at war (and losing battles). Think twice about declaring war on everyone. 

Attila Total War was the last great European-theatre historical total war released. It shook up the decade long basic historical Total War gameplay formula, which can be summarized as ""start small, build an army, build an economy, secure resources, win battles, and expand."" It's difficult to steamroll in Attila Total War, especially if the huns have multiple hordes when Attila takes over.

Instead, Attila challenges you to ""survive"" either as crumpling empires (the Romans) with countless enemies in your heartland (such as Gothic migratory hordes), with attack on multiple fronts (Africa, Gaul, Asia Minor, and the Levant) without adequate field armies to check advances. The celebrated Roman legions of Augustus are no longer invincible on the battlefield where heavy infantry once held sway. In Attila, cavalry and mounted skirmishers have the initiative in battles. 

Rome (whether East or West) starts out on the defensive unlike past Total War games.

The migratory barbarians, the gothic tribes, start off on the offensive pillaging and plundering rich Roman lands to reach a new home somewhere deep within Roman territory (Pro Tip: Hispania has all you need). 

Others look for opportunities to profit from the weak, overstretched, and defenceless Roman empires, like Rome's historical enemy Parthia (now the Sassanid Empire), the emerging vikings, the invading Huns and White Huns, and the awakening African/Arabian kingdoms.

Every faction in Attila has its weaknesses like Medieval II (some in early game, others in late game, some permanent impairments, some temporary impairments). 

To be sure, Attila in its vanilla state is a little ""barebones"" when it comes to faction unit variety. The barbarian Gothic factions have similar playstyles and army rosters (almost like copy+pastes of each other). The mighty Sassanid Empire (its army roster) is oddly bland and weak considering its historical significance as the arch nemesis of Rome. The viking factions have little differences in playstyle, and the desert kingdoms feel flawed in their individual ways.  

Nonetheless, Attila TW has two excellent DLCs - The Last Roman and Age of Charlemagne. The latter come close to what ""Fall of the Samurai"" was to Shogun 2 in gameplay content and mechanics. The former gives every men out there a chance to restore the former and O.G. Roman Empire by subjugating the barbarians, through force (""how dare you stand where Rome Empire stood"").

In conclusion, I have played Total War from Rome I. Rome I, Attila, Medieval II, Napoleon, Three Kingdoms, Shogun 2, and Empire will forever remain my top historical total war games. 

We were born too late to save the Roman Empire, but born too early to start a Roman Empire in space, so at least we can try to save the Roman Empires on our PC, and mourn the fall of Emperor Majorian (the Last Roman in the West, where men cried).",1706675977,1706675977,True,25,0,0.747094452381134033,0,True,False,False

Total war, if you want to make a game that leaves a good impression and pulls in players, give more factions to the player so they don't feel like they are playing the same run over and over and over again. This is a theme that most of their recent games have where they give only a few factions to play with and then make every other faction and less noteable cultures locked behind DLC which with the very limited cultures the game has without DLC which makes it boring and makes people not want to play the game.

Playing either Western or Eastern Rome is one of the best strategy experiences out there as you battle hordes of barbarian invaders and fight to turn your empire around. Especially on higher difficulty settings, it's a challenge you won't find elsewhere. Playing one of the migratory tribes fleeing the huns can also be very satisfying.

[h2]A Sack of Rome, One Turn at a Time[/h2]
In the decaying light of the Roman Empire, ""Total War: Attila"" thrives, offering a grand campaign that would make even the most stalwart centurion's head spin. With the horde mechanic introducing a nomadic thrill, and settlement razing that feels like you're wiping cities off the map with the swipe of Mars' own hand, Attila ups the ante on your strategic indulgences. Be warned, though: reconstructing razed lands demands resources that'd make Croesus gulp, and converting provinces is a slow, golden dance with the gods of coin and time.

[h3]Beneath the Family Tree Lies a Nest of Vipers[/h3]
The family tree is back, and it's more cutthroat than a political intrigue penned by Tacitus himself. Balancing acts of nepotism and meritocracy, you'll find yourself in a tangle of loyalties so deep it would take an oracle to sort out. Meanwhile, the tech tree now boasts both researchable and buyable advancements, ensuring that your kingdom's brain is as buff as its brawn.

[h2]The Battlefields: Where the Legions Roar[/h2]
As for the battlefield, Attila maintains its martial glory. Levelling up agents and generals feels as personal as inscribing your name on Trajan's Column, each choice a testament to your growing legend. But don't get cocky - playing on Hard is akin to facing Hannibal at Cannae without the hindsight of history. You might want to cut your teeth on Normal, lest you find your empire on the business end of a barbarian's blade.

[h3]But Not All Roads Lead to Triumph[/h3]
The journey is not without its potholes. Essential units inexplicably evolve into their higher-tier forms, leaving you nostalgic for the good old days of unit diversity. Indeed, the Sassanid Empire's military menu is sparser than a patrician's banquet after the plebs have been through it. And the AI, oh the AI - sometimes they'll sack your city and then scuttle away like scared rabbits, even when conquest is their only lifeline.

[h2]A World Both Vast and Grim[/h2]
Yet the scale of it all is truly imperial. From the forests concealing warring tribes to the deserts standing as natural fortresses, the map is a thing of beauty - a canvas where history's greatest sagas unfold. But, as the world turns, so does its fertility wane, leaving you to curse the gods as your breadbasket provinces wither like grapes under a scorching sun.

[b]Graphics:[/b] [u]8/10[/u] - The splendor of the old world is captured with a vibrancy that almost makes you forgive the occasional stutter in performance.
[b]Sound:[/b] [u]9/10[/u] - From the clash of steel to the haunting chants, the audio is a triumph worthy of the bards.
[b]Gameplay:[/b] [u]7.5/10[/u] - Strategic and deep, yet marred by the monotony of cookie-cutter settlements and an AI that could use a few more scrolls in its library.
[b]Story:[/b] [u]N/A[/u] - The fall of empires and the roar of the horde craft a tale where your actions pen history's greatest chapters. Not a story told but one that's made, with each campaign carving out its own saga.

[h2]The Verdict: A Flame in the Dark[/h2]
[b]OVERALL:[/b] [u]8.1/10[/u] - ""Total War: Attila"" is not just a game; it's a chronicle of survival, strategy, and burning ambition. It demands not only the might of the legions but the cunning of Caesar himself. Ready your sword, steady your heart, and may Fortuna favor your empire.

Besieging cities is more realistic by causing damage to city walls over time and the ability to lower enemy morale by burning up the town during a battle. Another great feature was army integrity which means you have to actually win battles with your army or else they will mutiny against you.

I wasn't expecting this to really be the last Total War game I'd really like - and I mean REALLY like. It has some substantial issues that carried over from Rome 2, since... well, it's just a reskin with some features added. Best part is still the modding community. But holy hell has my perception of the whole series shifted lately. Just referring to Attila, though, it's alright on its own. The DLC is... excessive, for the most part. Age of Charlemagne and Last Roman are pretty good, but the faction and unit packs are just... meh. All the Germanic tribes being reskinned is meh. It's just meh. Modded, it's great. I like it so much specifically because of the mods. 1212 is amazing in particular, and it's probably the closest we're ever getting to Medieval 3.

I would very strongly recommend capping off anything in the series here. The newer historical games are a mess, and as much as I love Warhammer, they're not very good Total War games in my experience.
In case anyone from CA happens to read this: please, build your next historical game from the ground up. I know it'll take a lot of time and money, but it's necessary at this point. Reusing Rome 2's engine has just resulted in more problems than it's worth. I grew up playing these games and it deeply saddens me to see the quality slipping. I've skipped out on all historical titles since Three Kingdoms and haven't touched Warhammer 3 or the later DLC for Warhammer 2, because I could see the writing on the wall in regards to the dropping quality.
Please, do better. Innovate again. Make games with passion like you used to, and not just a DLC pipeline to siphon money off the community.",1575353632,1703817017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you play as the Romans in the grand campaign count on long turn times and constant fighting if you play as the Huns burn it all down! The game is not with out bugs and its own optimization problems. CA did abandon ATW, leaving it with a shadow bug, random stutters and a Combat bug that you wont notice until someone points it out.  

Its well worth noting that Attila also has a few great mods that allow the buyer to consider forgiving CA for dropping support for ATW 

Medieval Kingdoms 1212: As close as we are going to get to a Medieval for a while. The music and Feel of the mod is impressive and feels like a professional release, because it is. The Mod team is full of legends and the game play reflects that.

 Age of Justinian 555AD: This takes place after the East Roman empire has control of Italy again and covers the fall out of Justinian's Dream. The game has some beautiful models well fleshed out factions and attention to minor details that really help make the Mod stand out.

As previous reviews have suggested, everything is so balanced in game now, that combat and wars are a chore. They aren't fun. What is worse, is the DLC reskin packs they offer. The fans have always made better quality skins for and units for this game than the developers could ever hope to do.

Further compounding this games lack of substance, the territorial system is the same bad idea from Rome 2. Lets have 3 cities to an entire region, with 1 a provincial capital and only that city can have walls. It's a cookie cutter setup to just take the $$ out of your wallet. 

The age of charlemagne looked promising until I saw the map. It's basically just a map that's 2/3 of what the western roman empire was. Huge disappointment. No Norsemen? Only Denmark? The map stops at the eastern portion of croatia and pannonia. No Eastern Empire, No north Africa. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money here. Wait for Total War: Warhammer which promises to be a great game.

Flawed at launch due to bad performance, but now most pc's will handle it well (including steam deck, with a little settings optimization).

Compared to Rome 2 and Warhammer (my most played TWs) this one feels significantly more strategic in the campaign map.  Politics and Alliances are to be considered carefully, 4 turns (and seasons) per year, betrayals, rebellions, civil wars, fertility ratings, climate change, religious conflicts...
It feels less like a ""paint the map your color simulator"" and more of a survival total war.

The battles are epic and brutally violent.

It's an amazing time period, often overlooked by the mainstream: the end of the Roman empire and the classical world with it, and the beginning of the dark ages that will lead to the creation of the medieval kingdoms we all know.


It's a time of crisis, of change, of chaos, of quickly shifting power, and the game portrays that very well.

Also, the main menu music is FIRE and will trigger your ancestral ptsd.

Highly recommended, if you like total war, don't miss this one.

Total War: Attila delivers a mixed experience marked by strategic depth but marred by notable optimization issues that impact the overall gameplay. The ambitious portrayal of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires adds a compelling historical context, but technical shortcomings may hinder the enjoyment.

Optimization problems, unfortunately, detract from the immersive potential of Total War: Attila. The game demands a high level of hardware prowess, leading to performance issues on systems that should otherwise handle similar titles seamlessly. This can result in frustrating lag, extended load times, and occasional crashes, hampering the otherwise engaging strategic experience.

The Eastern and Western Roman campaigns offer distinct challenges, providing a nuanced representation of the Roman Empire's decline. Managing internal strife, external invasions, and dwindling resources makes for a complex and engaging strategic experience. However, the optimization problems mentioned earlier may compromise the fluidity of the gameplay, affecting the enjoyment of these historically rich campaigns.

Despite technical challenges, Total War: Attila shines in its strategic depth, with a comprehensive portrayal of the tumultuous period it covers. The game's emphasis on survival against the backdrop of Attila the Hun's relentless onslaught adds a layer of urgency to the gameplay, enhancing the overall experience for history enthusiasts.

In conclusion, Total War: Attila's commendable historical representation and strategic depth are unfortunately overshadowed by optimization issues. The Eastern and Western Roman campaigns offer compelling experiences, but the technical shortcomings may hinder the enjoyment for players, making it a somewhat polarizing entry in the Total War series.",1502492945,1701516973,True,5,0,0.597070693969726563,1,True,False,False

When to charge , when to stand your ground , how to position your archers etc. Disengaging your cavalry can be costly , getting flanked is catastrophic.

I like how I can burn the cities in sieges , which demoralize the defenders. Can be used as a tactic when attacking as a raiding faction , which usually have light troops that automatically go and ignite the nearest buildings. Also has custom settlements , like Constantinople and Rome.

The music is good , but not great. But it does it's job to keep you immersed. But it doesn't compare to Medieval II or Rome Total War.

The campaign is good , but can be better with mods. The only problem you might have as a beginner will be dealing with rebellions. A big thing I like is that: The AI actually tries to have armies. Good armies. Not like in Rome 2 where you can auto resolve everything.

If you play the Eastern Romans you are a large and powerful empire out of the gate, defending your lands and preparing for the scourge of Attila and the Huns, a good way to learn the game but not TOO challenging. The real challenge is the shattered and neglected massive Western Roman Empire, in financial, military and social ruin you are given the opportunity to try and save the nation. You must first consolidate your rule, build your financial base and deal with the dozens of enemies that already hate you at the start of the game.

The number one selling feature of this game is the distinct faction types. There are four: Empire (West/East Rome, Sassanids), horde (Huns, Goths), kingdom (Franks, Saxons), and border factions (Lakhamids, Garmantians). Having these four is a great way to experience some playstyles you'll never find in the other games.

I think part of the reason people kind of dislike Attila TW is because of the vibe. You are in the middle of an apocalypse. This period in European history was genuinely apocalyptic. A strong, organized government quickly fell apart, currency was out of use and bartering in, food storage was poorly managed so famine was common, and diseases were sweeping back and forth. On top of all that, migrating people pushed settled peoples farther and farther west.

The game does a great job of capturing this apocalyptic feeling. If you play as Rome, you are constantly putting out fires. Constant rebellions, mass armies at your borders. Hordes may make a peace treaty with you just so they can get deep into your territory before declaring war again, away from your frontier guards. You know that's what they are doing. But you have to make the peace so you can catch up on rebellions and infrastructure.

If you can't keep the rebellions and hordes from destroying your cities, all of your income will be ploughed into repairing structures. You could get sucked into a downward spiral.",1700842804,1700842804,True,15,0,0.680986762046813965,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Challenging; it changes the genre from war strategy to survival strategy at any moment
+ you feel that you are one turn away from total disaster
+ AI can be good at flanking and surprising you.

Cons
- many mechanics are not explained well
- graphic engine not optimized, leading to lags and bugs.

I looked at the game a lot of times and it did not interest me enough to learn a new game. I have not played Rome 2. So there was a lot different from the Total War games I have played a lot, Shogun 1 and 2, Medieval 1 and 2 and Rome 1. I like the Dark Age so even though I wasn’t hooked by the base game I bought The Age of Charlemagne.  That was a good choice. I liked the various Factions and decided to put the time in to learning it. 

In Charlemagne and the Last Roman I find that rebellions are common place even after some experience. It is very hard to keep up the food supply and build the buildings that confere public order they all use a lot of food. Some of the factions start in a state or near the state of rebellion. Some seem impossible to get in a state of control like the Avars.

CA has added a number of uninteresting unneeded complications like skills for the  Generals.  Its just boring busy work you have to do at the end of every turn. The internal politics of your factions Nobility is a boring distraction but you have to keep on topo of it. So there’s a lot of stuff the game would be better without.
In the end I’m still getting a lot of payout of the game even with is pointless and boring quirks.

And unit variety actually means unit variety (witch each unit functioning in a different role and performing differently in battle rather than a direct upgrade)

The biggest ick for me is the damn combat, it just is button spam with no real strategy, Oh you are getting shot? then just press the shieldwall button even though your units are 25m apart in a scattered formation, dont worry you still get 50% missle block chance after 3 seconds. its just annoying and boring. but i still would recomend it if you want to get into total war, as it sort of has a morale system.

The music, art design and the lighting really contribute to this.

The diplomacy in this game is also really good. Kind of an odd thing to call out maybe, but I found that alliances had quite a bit of weight in this game and generally, allies proved to be fairly reliable; the AI tends to take alot of current factors into consideration when making deals and alliances.

If you've played Total War: Rome 2, then you'll be familiar with most of the systems of Attila, the only difference being that ""culture"" has been swapped for religion. Recruitment, replenishment, food, research, etc. all are almost unchanged. They do add a climate change mechanic to the game which will slowly lower the output of your agricultural buildings, but there are enough ways to mitigate it that it's not too important.

The biggest differences are in the campaign. Just like in the Barbarian Invasion expansion for Rome: Total War, the feature here is asymmetry. Play as the Huns, who can never settle and roam around the map as a horde, constructing tents in their armies. Play as the Ostrogoths, and die on turn 3 because you moved the wrong direction and the Huns jumped you. Play as the Vandals, and migrate to Africa where you settle in Carthage. Play as the Sassanids and instantly win the campaign because you ignore the entire sanitation mechanic. Play as the Saxons, and die because your starting military is the worst in the game. Play as the Franks, and sack England yourself after killing the Saxons. Or play as the Western Roman Empire, starting with 55+ territories and then sink in despair at how screwed you are until you learn that you can build Imperial Libraries and speedrun the tech tree.

The modding community has done an excellent job and has changed a lot to make this a fun game. Changes to AI behavior on the campaign map, diplomacy, faction and religion trait rebalances, all make the game better. In addition, there are several overhaul mods that give a whole new gaming experience. I would now recommend it.

I will leave the rest of my original review below

First off the good. The game is pretty, gritty, but visually impressive. The political tree is there, and if you like playing a political struggle along part of managing an empire that is a factor. What you make your people do affects their traits, and rivals exist, so there is a lot of depth. The whole game has a feeling of winding down, and the world is falling apart, so you do get a feeling of fighting an inevitable decline (which I personally like). Usually with Total War games you bulid up an invincible center empire, expand using divide and conquer, and you are only really threatened at the beginning or by a multifront war, but this is quite different.

The bad. There are a lot of balance issues, cavalry is overpowered, the single player campaign is about as stable as Caligula. The visuals look very ""samey"" for lack of a better term. The game gets stale once Attila is half way through his lifetime (historically), because the Hunnic faction has razed most of the map and you're left fighting them over the ashes of Europe. The AI will also spam doomstacks, massive armies of top tier units the Huns get for free, and will send against your cities so you can do nothing but sit and defend. This is where it becomes unfun, and that really is a shame.",1498664879,1699298813,True,0,0,0.645026028156280518,1,True,False,False

Neither am I a fan of the design of the Huns, where you have to fight against their infinitely spawning full-stack hordes until you kill Attila around 120 turns in. I get what they were going for but after you get past the surviving phase and start thriving, they are just a nuisance that don't bring any enjoyment. Eventually, I stopped attacking them unless they were in my territory and garrisoned armies at my border. They never attacked either, so it turned into a boring waiting game of waiting for Attila.
All that said, this is still the best historical TW game. Some of the issues can be modded away (modders are truly a blessing), and some have other workarounds. The ones remain, I try to tolerate. And if you add the other gigantic overhaul mods this game has and still coming (Dawnless Days please), I'd say worth it even now.

Had to update:
With the mess that is Pharaoh, I came back to this gem. I've been craving tactical and strategic gameplay. I don't know what's going on but I tweaked settings and downloaded new drivers. Limiting FPS to 60. My Asus 3700X with 16GB and 1660TI is smooth. No issues any more. Performance was always the biggest problem so I'm happy about this. The AI seems aggressive enough on the campaign map, and the battle AI is decent. They kind of panic sometimes when you use good strategy but I think it's better than Rome 2s jumbling of units in sieges. And at least you get whole / open settlements to use 360 tactics unlike Warhammer with one direction to attack a fortress (no flanking). 

Such a great game. My hours don't scream anything nuts but that's just my life being busy. I'm always looking forward to playing this game, because the grand campaign is vast!",1689026754,1698795313,True,5,1,0.554118573665618896,0,True,False,False

I spent countless hours messing around in battles, listening to heroic speeches (and cheating at the game because I was 11 and didn't quite get the campaign).

I was pumped beyond belief when I heard Rome II got announced and bought it immediately (in my Freshman year of college, boy how time flies) only to not be able to play it because of how broken it was on launch. But it got fixed and countless more hours were spent and finally some campaigns beaten.

In that time I've also played Shogun 2, Empire, Medieval 2, 3k, Thrones, Attila, Warhammer I & 2 & 3 (Check my steam library, they're all there). I even bought the Remastered version just because I love Total War.

- Interesting new mechanics that change your play-style and how you conquer with a huge emphasis on public order and religion 
- Nice visuals that complement the gloomy and apocalyptic theme of the time 
- Cool unit rosters for factions in general 
- Siege barricades and some more interesting abilities for units in general compared to RTW2
- Not easy / AI is merciless and maintaining public order is a real challenge 
- Management choices of family members and generals holds more gravitas with more of an emphasis on loyalty and balancing power 
- Generally, feels more realistic and difficult than your average arcade-ish tw game where you're picking off provinces on the map like you're picking out maltesers from a bag
- Mods

Cons: 
- Poor optimization with regular FPS drops 
- Merciless AI will hunt you down no matter where you are and where they are which usually doesn't make sense 
- Due to public order management, you will spend most of your time clicking next turn without really doing anything -  the main purpose of your armies is to maintain public order, not invade 
- Following the previous point, factions take too long to play their turn making the wait boring as you click next turn 
- Very few factions to play as 
- AI diplomacy is trash especially when trying to form trade agreements - most factions will decline trade agreements because of the huge diplomacy debuffs you'll have just by merit of being another faction 

Verdict: Play it if you want to challenge yourself and your pc and spend alot of time micromanaging happiness, religion and sanitation otherwise if you wanna go on an invasion spree play rtw2.",1487888416,1698501136,True,2,0,0.521633625030517578,2,True,False,False

well made, of course it has minor issues, but is nothing compared to The newest titles ( someone might say Three kingdoms is the last, in part is true, BUT the real issue of that game is not being updated for LONG TIME, for that reason is terrible game, this game instead has only minor issues, and is very good for being made in 2015, it has the feature right click and drag paths for your units  to follow ( and i think is the first game that has this feature)

Graphic 5:
 not a great fan of the style, the engine has some issues, but not a big deal

Gameplay 9:
 i dont give 10 couse it dosent explain well enough for new players the Mechanics, but on the other hand is intuitive at least for folks that already played RTS.
It has incredible features, almost the same for the new titles like skills, and Good engines of war, they got war dogs, Elephants and potential with a mod Guns!

Its DARK, GRITTY, And, if you like, Very fuckin Hard. Its a Historical Total war game that reminds you of those old TW games you used to play 15 years ago.

Want to destroy civilization? You can do that just like Attila did, burning your way, litterally, trough provinces and empires. want to be a barbarian invader? You can do that. Or do you want to test your might and SURVIVE against all odds? You can do that as the Romans. You will constantly need to adapt your strategy in this game, everyone is out for themselves and alliances are untrustworthy, furthermore, the UI is better than its predecessor Rome 2, gone are those ugly 2d line art esc unit and building icons, replaced with icons in the likes of Rome 1.

Graphics are fine and battles are good, no need to expand on that. The thing that makes all this worth it is that this game does not hold your hand, and will make you feel desperate, conflicted, and make you feel all that doom and gloom in one playtrough.

The only thing i got an issue with is performance, its got somekind of bug or left behind code that makes your modern hardware push itself. 

All this game needs, is a patch and new DLC, speaking of, DLC, its got a few. They are mediocre at best, BUT, provide interesting ways to play the game, for example, the last roman DLC makes you step into the shoes of ROMAN invaders, trying to get back lost territory 100 years after ROME was sacked, letting you play a Roman faction like you did when playing the Huns, adopting a nomad style playtrough, BUT also letting you do a 180° and setup your own Kingdom if you tire from the nomad style gameplay. This is probably my favorite DLC in this game. Another good one is the Age of Charlemagne DLC, it lets you play in a point in time 200~ years after the Western roman empires collapse. Its not anything special, but interesting nonetheless. 

This game is a banger, and if you sat on the fence till now, about this game, Don't, get it, its really fun!",1697063978,1697063978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is the most underrated Total War game in the entire franchise. I will divide my review in sections so read on if you want to learn more about this game.

Battles
The most important part of any total war game is the battles and the battles in this game are great. This is NOT a Rome 2 clone, as many people claim. In this game morale matters in battles - unit moral has been reduced across the board. Flanking and rear charges matter and can rout units. Just like in Rome 1, Medieval 2, and Shogun 2, you can kill the enemy general and rout the rest of the army with flanking and rear charges. Siege battles are awesome again. You can have barricades which you deploy in siege defense battles. Place a unit of archers/slingers/crossbows on top of the barricade and they will fire super fast and get tons of kills. The siege maps are great and allow for all kinds of creative deployments and opportunities. You can legit defeat a full stack with just 4-6 units if you play your cards right.
Cavalry is strong in this game but you still have to use them correctly in order to be effective. Don't stupidly charge headlong into spears/pikes and expect to win. In most melee situations vs melee infantry the cavalry unit will lose. With Cavalry - just like any other total war game - you are looking to make rear charges on engaged units. Even your low tier Cavalry can shred elite units if used in this manner. Horse Archers are back also and are amazing if that is your thing.
Melee infantry isn't useless! If you are coming from Troy/Warhammer/3k this game will be a breath of fresh air when it comes to Melee infantry. Your unit of swordsmen will generally defeat enemy spears and your unit of spears will defeat enemy cavalry. Light offensive focused units like axes also work really well whether fighting in the front line or used as a mobile flanking force. Just make sure these units aren't shot by the enemy archers. Pikes perform admirably in chokepoint scenarios. While spears with the superior melee defense will hold back the enemy for much longer, Pikes can easily and quickly rack up kills on a chokepoint.
Archers, Slingers, and Crossbows are very deadly. Slingers have high base damage and are cheap but don't have specialized ammo types. Archers are also cheap and have access to heavy shot, fire arrows, and whistling shot and have decent fire rate. Crossbows have the slowest fire rate but have huge damage and armor piercing damage. If used to their full extent, Crossbows can easily rack up 400-600 kills in a battle.
Also, Large Onagers using explosive rounds are very overpowered. They will be locked behind technology progression for a large part of the campaign so it doesn't destroy the battle balance. But definitely keep 2-3 of these bad boys in all your late game armies.

Campaign - Settlement Management
There are three things you have balance when you are building out your settlements(or hordes). Sanitation, Food, and Public Order (Integrity for Hordes). If any one of these things are not balance, you will be in for a bad time. Lack Sanitation? Deal with plagues spreading everywhere and especially spreading to your armies. Lack food? A local province lacking food will result in -25% income from the province and loss in public order as well. An overall empire wide food deficit will cause all your armies to attrition and none of your armies will replenish. Lack Public Order (or Integrity)? Revolts.
As the campaign progresses, climate change happens and there is less fertility across the board which results in less food across the board. Food becomes a more scarce resource as the campaign progresses so keep that in mind.
Colonizing and building up razed settlements takes a lot of time and money. If you aren't playing as the Huns you'll have to be wary of which settlements you choose to raze to the ground if you plan to come back later and have that settlement as a part of your empire.
Religion is back in this game and plays an important role. While the public order penalties for religious differences isn't massive, it is something you will need to keep an eye on. Different religions have different religion building which have different effects and the different religions have different global bonuses. Once a religion in your empire reaches 35% adherents you have the option to switch to that religion. As a migratory faction, it is somewhat easier to choose your religion, just pick your first settlements to be where that religion is dominant.

Campaign - Agents
There are three types of agents - Champions, Spies, and Priests. Champions can be embedded into armies and increase their experience. Champions are also excellent for murdering enemy agents. Spies are good for scouting ahead of an army to see whats going on in the fog of war. They also can decrease corruption in your provinces. Priests are mainly for increasing your religion in a province and are also good for increasing public order in a province that needs it.

Camapign - Family Tree
The family tree is back and it is fully operational. Unlike in Rome 2, there are 4 turns every year. What does this mean? You actually have time with your favorite generals and family members to get invested in them and enjoy them. Generally you are trying to gain influence points you can use for political actions. Influence points can be used for seeking a wife, securing loyalty, adopting someone into your family, securing loyalty, embezzling funds, rallying support of nobles/senators and more. Most situations you want Balanced control (50%). There are two ways to gain influence points: actively by winning battles or passively through governorship. 

The Horde!
Attila was the first game to introduce an in-depth horde mechanic and it is wonderfully done. You can think of your armies as essentially mobile cities. Once you go into the encamp stance you will be able to build or demolish buildings just like you can with a regular settlement. If you are short on food can also just pack up and go to a higher fertility place, for example. The Huns/White Huns - who are permanent hordes - will play differently than the great Migrators. The Huns/White Huns are only there to burn down the world and revel in the destruction. If you are playing a Migrator your eventual aim is to find a home to settle down in.

Campaign - The End Game Challenge!
You will be shocked to hear that the end game challenge is.........Attila. I know, surprising. When Attila becomes King of the Huns they essentially become super charged and tend to target the player, especially if you are anywhere in mainland Europe (except Spain). During this time if you wipe out any of their armies they will simply automatically regenerate a new one out in the steppe. Its kind of BS but this is what a late game challenge looks like. Its the ultimate historical trial by fire. There is a big satisfaction and relief once you get through this challenge.

Difficulty
This game spares no punches and wants to kick you while you are down. Don't expect to have an easy time in this game. I myself have over 1000 hours in the game and most of that is playing as the Western Roman Empire. For new players, I suggest playing as one of the barbarian factions (germanic, nordic or celt) or great migrators.

Final Thoughts
Total War Attila is the last great Total War game and I don't say this lightly. Great battles, Functional Family Tree, Fertility, Sanitation, Religion, Atmosphere, and a Tough End Game Challenge. Many people didn't give this game a fair shake due to the poor optimization and the bad taste Rome 2 left. But now its 2023 not 2015, so if you have a modern gaming computer you can play this game. This game is very difficult but it also provides you all the tools you need to succeed. If you have not played this game, play it and give a shot.",1693449319,1693528623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Different troop types for different cultures and culture areas
-Can defend fortified areas and fortify cities and fight in that city, fortification isnt a 10% attack boost or something like that its visible in the battlefield
-Can fortify random villages wherever you go when you venture into areas that arent cities (just change your stance)
-Requires trial and error, game requires thinking its not like call of duty.
-Its not like Hearts of Iron IV either, the game is more tactics based than operational
-You can choose to skip battles but that isnt ideal unless you know you will win, and you probably will need to make good use of tactics in the beginning of your playthroughs
-Game has mods
-Can use the environment to your advantage, like with trees for instance.

Attila was a relatively minor Total War release that was quickly forgotten by its developer. There's little that's special about it. The mechanics are wonky, the combat is nothing special, the graphics are arguably a step back from those of its predecessor, and the engine is a little buggy. The only redeeming characteristic is a couple of its mods, but even the enormous amount of work put into those can't fully redeem this title. It does succeed in portraying the desperation of the dark days surrounding the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the perpetually war-torn landscape of that age, but that's about all it does well.

CA clearly went for a game with a more grim feel, and it is well executed. The art direction is very similar to Rome II, but features a colour pallet that is dominated by black, red and orange, like a forest fire, a strong contrast to the typical vivid colours of a TW game. But it is not all show. The grimness also features in the game play. The RTS battles are similar to Rome II, but it arrow fire and cavalry charges are far more deadly, leading to battles with large morale swings and a more tense feel. But the doom and gloom really shines in the campaign map. Unlike other games, where you build up and are unstoppable roughly halfway through the time line, Attila is famously more of a survival game. Ability to destroy entire provinces, the creeping cold climate and constantly respawning nomadic invaders result a map that steadily shrinks, leaving the factions to fight over the land and resources that are left. This not only makes Attila probably the hardest TW game on the campaign level, but also a big change for veterans of the series. It is actually a fairly unique experience in the grand strategy genre generally. Highly recommended game: a game that age like wine and offers a unique and, especially when playing as certain factions, very challenging grand strategy experience.",1691477068,1691477068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bought it for 1212 AD mod, and was taken aback by bland graphics and incoherent UI, which makes Rome 2's interface look intuitive. I checked on the original game, and yep, literally 0 changes. It looks worse than any other prior TW titles I played.

The gameplay basically consists of you smashing that 'End Turn' button, because you either wait for the enemy to attack, or you yourself expand, only to half your income, and have your stack sit on their butts waiting for public order to get back up.

But the difficulty level is made extremely high even when playing on ""easy"" level.  What makes it difficult is being constantly attacked by multiple factions before you can even get your bearings and some sort of foothold.  I've tried playing the Charlemagne campaign, played as Mercia, and as the Sassanids.  And the constant attacks just make the game tiresome.  The attrition is ridiculous and you do lose villages and settlements in these attacks.  You must respond immediately or they just keep attacking until the town is wiped out and captured.  After only 13 hours of trying this game I've lost the urge to continue with it.  Geez, give me a chance to get organized before you attack, will you?  Before I can even upgrade troops I'm losing them to attrition.  When famine hits a province some times there is nothing you can do about it.  Attrition again.   There really is no game play response to disease.  I'm willing to have patience with a strategy game, but the game play in this one is so difficult as to seem impossible.  I didn't even try the harder campaigns.  I found it irritating to make an alliance with the White Huns and then have them turn around and attack me after I did what they wanted.  The peace only lasted two turns.   I might try and play as the Romans but I have a feeling that will be just as frustrating.  Probably both factions of Huns will attack me with multiple armies at the same time.  I know they don't want to make these games easy.

Total War: ATTILA is like trying to balance a flaming sword on a unicycle while being chased by a horde of angry barbarians. It's a wild, chaotic ride that will test your strategic skills and your sanity. Just when you think you have a handle on things, a plague breaks out, volcanoes erupt, and half your army deserts to join a circus. The AI is as unpredictable as a fire-breathing dragon with ADHD, keeping you on your toes and laughing in disbelief.

It is the looming Darkness from the Volga steppes. Proto-Turkic tribes led by the great Gurkhan Attila.

You, a Germanic federate in the service of Rome, ripe with liters of blood washing over the whole village. And behind this scarlet layer of pain and suffering run the nomads. Germanic and Iranian tribes burn the cities of the Empire, enslaving peoples and creating new kingdoms.

Only here will you behold the true Apocalypse and feel the horror of the Scourge of God.

Added!

The game perfectly lives up to expectations, not only being a classic at its core, but also acquiring almost new DLC with the mod Medieval 1212. A lot of many mechanics, including the availability of different troops by the number of people in a certain class A lot of nobles, a highly respected class, here's to you cavalry. Lots of peasants - here's a cheap army of lances, archers.

Что такое Total War Attila?

Это надвигающая Тьма с Поволжских степей. Прототюркские племена под предводительством великого Гурхана Аттилы.

Ты, германский федерат на службе у Рима, зреешь литры крови, омывающие всю деревню. А за этим алым слоем боли и страданий бегут кочевники. Германские и иранские племена сжигают города Империи, порабощая народы и создавая новые царства.

Только здесь ты узреешь настоящий Апокалипсис и ощутишь ужас Бича Божьего.

this.....prefer Rome II.

Game crashed on me today when I won an epic battle.....wasted 30 minutes of my life! Had to reload and do it over.
This time, the pathing of the units was totaly stupid [but then it always has been!] causing a lot to get killed.
When grouping units into a line then pressing testudo formation....only 2/3 did it. You have to baby sit the whole process! I know it is only a game, but I like things done properly with minimal casualties [as you would in real life].

The towers kill a lot of your own men as well as the enemy. There is no way of controlling them [to switch off/fire direction etc.]

You would think the units especially the fleets would be better [hundreds of years down the line], but no, they are worse.
I know the game is 'different' to Rome II, but Rome should have the capability to build archers/balista/cav units from the start, but one has to research it again.

Oh the ingame wiki takes ages [and I mean ages] to load. I have a i7 processor, ssd drive, 16GB RAM, 2 GB video card and fiber optic 45MB/S internet. You just cannot use it at all!

Yes the campaign map looks better as does the strategic map.....but overall I would only buy it on sale [as I did].

I hope their next instalment is not rushed out and then dlc's pumped out like Attila!

Game still crap! Loads ok then when you go out and back in crashes!

Waiting for all the enemy factions to go can take upwards of a minute too. The settlement destruction penalties mechanic feels like it wasn't even quality tested, it leads to absurd situations where a victorious army that has just conquered a city gets wiped out easily by an inferior force of counter-attackers, because apparently they are just so disheartened by all the buildings they burned down.

Total War Attila is by far the greatest Historical Total War game CA has ever made. It fixes every problem players had with Rome II's multiplayer and campaign battles (Exploits like pushing through, pike stacking and camping interior settlement citadels do not exist.). Attila has amazing DLC campaigns with loads of extra factions to boot, Very diverse and unique base game factions all of which have their own religions, mechanics, faction/culture traits, unit rosters, play styles, early challenges, start positions and mid/late game crises. [b] DO NOT [/b] listen to people who say this game runs poorly, Attila is one of the best running and performing Total war titles. If you are having issues with your game I promise you the problem is on your end the game is fine (I explain further in the labeled section). If you are worried about the price; Attila and all the dlc for it go on sale multiple times every year for around $25 USD total if you want everything. I encourage you to give this title another try if you picked it up back in 2015 and got burned by the poor launch, this gem is the Total War title many have been asking for, for many years. Its so bright that you can't see it right in front of you.

[h1] [u] Grand Campaign: [/u] [/h1]
The Grand Campaign takes place in late antiquity starting in the year 395 AD. The theme of the game is that of this time period in history, shortly after the turn of the century the world became dark and cold forcing steppe and germanic peoples to migrate to warmer and more fertile places in the western and southern parts of Eurasia held by the fractured Western and Eastern Roman empires still recovering from The Crisis of the Third-Century. This Campaign is 4 turns per year and features amazing UI, deep family/political system, regional fertility/horde faction mechanics that act as an army and city combined and 14 playable factions within the base game, with another 14 factions being able to unlock for play in the Grand Campaign with dlc culture packs with another 13 factions included in the Campaign packs. The West and Eastern Roman Empires start with large empires both of which are underdeveloped and facing massive public order problems early on. The Western Roman empire has the feel of a classic roman faction sporting elite heavy legionaries, Calvary and crossbow units while The East has a heavy Greek and Eastern Influence on the classic units making their rosters each feel totally unique. The barbarian, hunnic and eastern factions each have their own flare and game play styles pertaining to their cultures, each toting unique units in their rosters that shape their play-styles.

[h1] [u] Mechanics & known misconceptions: [/u] [/h1]
A very common thing I see in reviews of Attila is that combat is very unbalanced and nothing like Rome 2, but it isn't and that's the point. Units all around got far less armor and more health to make battles feel faster and far less like grinding slog fests. For example high armor in Rome 2 was 80+ as where in Attila 55+ is very high armor. This in tune made arrow towers very deadly in sieges making you use your artillery to destroy the settlements fortifications instead of shooting units like a real siege would. There is a clear rock paper scissors counter system with units in this game, spears and swords still perform the same as they did in previous titles. Missile units have massive amounts of utility and counters with different ammo and weapon types ranging from crossbows, short, long and steppe bows, slings, javelins and grenade units. Cavalry feels as cav should, weighty, fast and they have devastating charges, armored melee cav can actually take on non spear melee infantry units and win, shock cav is beyond devastating to unarmored/unbraced infantry however it gets hard countered by melee cavalry. Bow and Skirmisher cav both feel amazing to use in this game and they actually shoot when strafing units with the handy benefit of them being typically faster than other cav units making them perfect for countering cav if you don't like using spears. However all cav will still fall short to armored braced inf, spears and being shot. Axes and shock infantry counter armor and shields but die to missiles and cav, and pike units are almost entirely unarmored and unshielded making them even more vulnerable to missiles than they were in Rome 2. I have heard plenty of people complain that shieldwalls are too strong in this game and this simply isn't true, they are very easily countered. Most sword and especially axe bearing infantry with the shieldwall ability lose Hard to armored tier 2 or 3 sword or axe bearing melee cavalry. You also can simply poke with pikes, shoot them with any kind of missiles (even front dumping shieldwalls is very effective), use two handed shock infantry, or use the previously mentioned axe infantry shielded or two handed it doesn't matter. Axes counter shields and Armour if there is a shieldwall use axes. If the shieldwall has axes use melee cav. Its very simple.

[h1] [u] The Fixed Exploits: [/u] [/h1]
Pulling through in Attila results in the pulled through units being slaughtered in seconds, pike stacking isn't effective anymore because if a pike unit is inside another unit it will take +80% of missile casualties fired at the stacked units. Siege battles can no longer be plagued by players camping interiors of settlements with the settlement destruction mechanics and cycling units to farm charge bonus is no longer effective with units now taking massive casualties (engaged men die) if they try to run from a unit that is engaged in melee with them. As it should be, if you turn your back to a enemy soldier you are getting a sword shoved through you, its very simple. 

[h1] [u] Performance: [/u] [/h1]
I will hit this section with the bat of bluntness. There are 4 reasons your Attila doesn't run well.
1.) Your computer simply isn't strong enough to play Total War games. You might have been able to get away with running Rome 2 on the lowest graphics settings, being that guy to make a 14 minute multiplayer siege last 40 in slow motion. But that won't work here. Attila is a very demanding Total war title I don't deny it, but it runs butter smooth on 6 year old hardware. You can't say the game is the problem when you're playing it on an electric toothbrush. There is no shame in needing to upgrade and not being able to afford it. The economy sucks I know, but my previous point still stands. The game isn't the problem.
2.) Update your graphics card drivers.
3.) Don't use 4k. Attila never got 4k support, so if you use 4k, the game will **** itself. Its not hard to understand. The game looks beautiful without it. You don't need it. Turn it off.
4.) Shadows have a massive impact on performance in Attila, if you are having slight issues, turn your shadows down/off.
If steps 2-4 didn't work and your game still runs horribly, see #1. There is your answer. I have only had Attila crash twice in the combined depressing 1200+ hours i have put into this title on this account and others. The only time I consistently get crashes is when the TW launcher doesn't work (Not Attila's fault) and when I've intentionally broke the game messing with files/mods.

[h1] [u] DLC and mods: [/u] [/h1]
I don't have enough room left to talk about the dlc and mods, so i will quickly rate them tier list style.

God tier: 1212 AD Is literally medieval 3 get the base game and download this insane mod, the creators are amazing and still update it regularly, its an entirely new title in itself.

This is very much a Total War that I fall into a Love/Hate relationship with and thus it is one I put on its more of a game its hard to recommend or not recommend, since it entirely comes down to the individual, which side wins out more.  This game also has a weird bug that, even after playing it on multiple different systems, it will randomly crash on start up, and you have to just brute force your way to the game successfully starting.

The base game grand campaign is one of the most controversial, between universal climate change that ruins fertility even in historic bread basket regions, way too many buildings pointlessly giving public order penalties, and not being able to share food between regions, meaning your hyper restricted in how you can successfully build each province.  Then add in the Huns faction has one of the most ridiculous cheats any AI in Total War has ever gotten of instantly respawning hordes until you can kill Attila.  Then add in that the AI is too raze happy and too slow to recolonize desolate ruins that tends to ruins the end game and makes the game have a ridiculous front loaded difficulty.  Further add in some moronic decisions like not letting you control where your capital is, which is especially bad for Horde factions where your capital can be bounced to a ruin you've recolonized, just because that is where the game assigned your original capital.  There is further some unacceptable quality control bugs such as some missing settlement slots, and certain unit trees such as the Alans being broken without using a mod.  The AI also blatantly cheats with how accurate its artillery pieces are, compared to the player's, especial above normal combat difficulty.  Further there are some units that just plain feel redundant to useless in the same faction, given they compete for the same slot, and sometimes a tier 2/3 unit actually feels weaker than a tech tree upgraded tier 1.

The game does however have some good points.  Age of Charlemagne is one of the best DLC campaigns, since Fall of the Samurai.  The family tree is interesting, even if its majorly flawed, such as people randomly disappearing from both your family and other nobles, a lack of a seek husband for female descendants, and other nobles not naturally replenishing.  Different religions actually give you different bonuses and have a choice between a public order and special effect for many religions for your building.  Compared to the Warhammer Total Wars, it is also nice having a game where cavalry can actually do something worth taking up an army slot.",1687904696,1687931701,False,13,0,0.660423398017883301,0,True,False,False

Pros: 

many mods- the mods make the game so much better like 642 and 1212ad mod who put so much flavour to the mod.
campaign- with the the huns and the collapsing western roman empire it gives so much flavour to every faction and to the campaign.
unit looks- the unit looks more alive than in rome 2 and they look just better from there armour to weopens to how they walk to the terrain.

cons:

dead servers- the multiplayer in attila is dead and theres nothing.

Attila is on another level of bad optimization. Huns brought chaos and destruction not only to Rome, but also to common players. Add to this TW classic campaign map lag feature (even when battle fps is decent) and turn times (not bad in Attila but campaign lag + optimization made it worse).

I have yet to even play Atilla even after 2128 hours in game because of two Mods that are free to play if you Buy Atilla tw. However my review does reflect the Attilas game engine and Performance. 
So i bought this game so i could download and play 
1. 1212 Medieval Kingdoms AD MOD (which has kept adding endless mods and new units maps fixes) and is at its best currently than it ever has. It only gets better i have never had any big issues with anything other than some performance in large massive battles but reading up on best performance and quality mediun for your pc is what to do.
MK1212 IS really what i paid for. as it blows almost every other Major TW title away for it being a mod. 
its medieval 3. and worth it. i even play on just a gtx 1050 ti with amd  ryzen 5 2400 processor desktop. 
So many factions and endless uniqe units for each. its crazy

2. Dawnless days (rise of mordor) LOTR overhaul mod. 
Just as epic and big as MK1212 AD MOD. Its also 100% free. and you wouldnt even know this wasnt a AAA TW title. They have kept new units and new factions and mods coming nicely. So many. How many elvish typre factions you need? orc factions. goblin factions. Northmen, Breeland, Gondorian FACTIONS, TONS OF dwarven factions, desert middle eastern factions, vale of dorwinion, angmar, northern dunedain, wood elves, mordor, moria, isengaurd, orcs and GIANTS ANd trolls. massive battles OH MYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Maps are well and nicely detailed, the period the game plays in is well represented for the game mechanics, the gameplay would result challenging even on normal difficulty, and would ease by the time you manage to upgrade your military development tree and possibly manage to defeat Attila.

This game is nice to play even without mods and DLCs, as starting from scratch with any Vanilla Game faction would give you somne good game experience and interesting challenges to keep your faction/people alive through-out the whole game.
The only DLCs I would feel to reccomend at all costs, if you ''desperatly'' want one, would be:

Before you know it it's 4 AM and you got to get up for work in 2 hours. 9.5 out of 10. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 out of 10 is cause Thrones of Britannia, 3K and Troy all refined the battle mechanics even further. Now if we can just convince CA ro incorporate city building and individual troop control, that would be perfect. Suggestion CA, please give us Farthest Frontier style city building mechanics and Cossacks 3 regiment style troop control. Oh and please, Empire 2. Atila Remastered, CK3 style politics.

Can Roman Empire from the west and east hold these invaders or this will be a bloody end for the greatest Empire of the world ? You choose with which faction you want to play, you write history. 

So, great total war game with many common things with Rome 2 but different too.

 - Nice graphics. 
 - Good politc system( intrigues and corruption, political offices and governors), better diplomancy( puppet and tribute states, giving regions to hordes, proper marriages and more), there is family system( adoptions, illegitimates and true successors but also Rebel generals and usurpers of the throne) and ofcourse historical units.
 - Epic campaigns with epic and huge battles with citizens in the sieges and More bloody animations.
 - Except from culture differences there is and religion and factions have unique traits.
 - True sanitation and food system but much difficult without mods if you want full upgrade 
    your cities.
 -  Historical units and  buildings.
 -  Nice events.
 -  Realistic diseases and attritions.
 -  Many historical battles.
 -  Much more. 

If you want you can buy all DLC for better experience.

The game suffers from the new ""streamlined"" arcade bullshit with the province system where building are severely limited and having illogical and unnecessary debuffs on top of the bonuses they provide, this can be countered with mods tho so not a  huge issue but I hope they stop with this shit for the next historical titles. Mod support for this game is amazing bringing to life new eras and a whole new plethora of gameplay. Battles are amazing, honestly one of the best in the series (except pike formation, dunno something wrong with them, they feel off).  Siege escalation system gives a ""doomsday"" feel when fight the enemy`s last stronghold and you see their city crumbling, it has cool vibe wich honestly I would improve uppon.

If you  like strategy, cool cinematic battles, grand strategy and even put the game on easy and just steamroll , from the graphics and style alone you would have a good time. 
Don`t skip this game EVER, it has a discounted price right now so even more of an incentive to buy.

Victories in Attila, and especially the Age of Charlemagne feel deep, hard won, and more sophisticated than a simple rush to conquest.  Most starting positions are embattled, require thoughtful planning and battle mastery to preserve troops, nurture economy, forge alliances.  The art and score are beautiful.  The settings and objectives are compelling.  The war weariness feature definitely adds another enjoyable layer of immersion.  

Of note, this was my first non-""paint the map"" campaign victory.  For the first time ever, it seemed like the diplomacy system actually worked: I wanted originally to take Northumbria, but they became a staunch ally, actually defending me from Norman invasions, something I've never experienced in a Total War game before. How weird is it to see an ally's full stacks march past your undefended capitol, defeat the invading army for you and then march back to York?  When they crossed the border, I thought ""here we go again,"" meaningless Total War treaties at play, but no.  I actually felt motivated to [i]not[/i] declare war on the Franks or the Northumbrians because they had been such loyal defenders, and work my conquest around their territories, picking off mutual enemies.

Also, the Imperium system actually makes composite cultural/conquest victories possible: another first in a Total War game for me.  My final map was a patchwork of allies and owned territories that really makes you feel as though you're witnessing the birth of medieval Europe. The internal political system seemed less like a mini-game (I'm looking at you Rome II), and more an actual part of the campaign from which meaningful advantages could be derived.

Tactical battle play was as as excellent as ever.  Siege battles in particular felt like step-by-step strategic puzzles.  The AI behaves at least as well as I imagine a moderately competent historical general might.

Overall A+ gaming experience.  Attila is my favourite of the historical titles thus far.",1679163031,1679163031,True,18,0,0.699024379253387451,0,True,False,False

However, Attila, and frankly a few other Total War titles still keep me entertained from time to time. 

Cons
-Can be difficult to learn (especially if this or Rome II is your first title)
-food, sanitation/squalor system can be difficult to understand
-religion is a weird system in this game
-family tree system can be a little challenging to navigate at first (I found it markedly different from Rome II, and it seems to be exploited by the AI quite often)
-can get a little tedious
-not a profound difference between certain factions
-towards the end of the game it gets a little boring
-Attila, and his so-called ""Horsemen of the Apocalypse"" can be wiped out if you adequately prepare for him
-certain factions, such as the ERE, Sassannid, other Eastern Empires can be extremely OP, especially in MP
-Age of Charlemagne is a cool addition, but frankly too simple

Pros
-If you figure out how to play the ""barbarian"" factions (Norsemen, Migrators, Celts, Slavs, etc.), it can be a neat experience for the time period
-the idea behind simply surviving the time period as opposed to a straight-up triumph is different
-dynamic battles
-truly, the strengths/weakness of the different types of units are properly understood and exploited (e.g, you WILL wipe out a cav unit with a well-timed counter-charge and spear/pike unit)
-the capturing of the truly bleak look of the period
-migrations/horde mechanics
-Age of Charlemagne, again albeit simple, it isn't necessarily a bad addition to the game (however, I believe it should've gotten its own title altogether)
-watching your enemy's settlements get turned to total ash, and then slaughtering the defenders feels, oddly right, in this game

Review:

All in all, I think Attila is great. I personally have completed a campaign as the Picts, twice as the Geats, and as the ERE. Truly, the bleakness and hopelessness of the time period is very well captured, in that once Attila shows his face on the steppes of Eastern Europe, you feel a pit in your stomach of uncertainty, and unnerving of what is going to happen. My first Geat campaign saw me become the unchallenged Latin Christian Northern Empire, protecting the WRE and ensuring the ERE would not be destroyed in conflict with the Sassannids. My Pictish campaign was all about taking revenge on the evil Germanic raiders coming to pillage and destroy my dear Brittannia. My ERE campaign practically saw me become a true superpower, bringing Christ's Word to every corner of the world. 

I think if you can figure out how to work around the religion system, and the sanitation/squalor balance, as well as the new horde mechanics along with keeping people happy in times of despair, it could be considered a darker Rome II for seasoned Total War players. If this is your first title, have patience as the truly different playstyles of each cultural group are highlighted and exploited well in this game. As such, it has quite a bit of replay value in that you could try a replicate good-luck in a particular campaign. 

Summary:
The new mechanics combined with the overall challenging nature of the game really capture the hoplessness of the time period. All in all, with a few neat mechanics and nice systems that are added to the series, Attila isn't as bad as everyone thought it was. Stands to be a really interesting game if you allow yourself to be immersed in the play.",1679029481,1679029481,True,35,1,0.796457886695861816,0,True,False,False

بس الحين لا نظرتي اختلفت بعد تجربتي الجادة لها، بالعكس المعارك يا فيها من التكتيكات والإستراتيجيات لدرجة ممكن بكتائب قليلة جداً تنهي جيش كامل بل وممكن تنتصر في معركة حصار لقلعة بعدد قليل!!

 البعض في توتال وار أتيلا والبعض في روم 2.

بالنسبة لأتيلا، الجزء هذا يتميز بالجرافيكس الحلو، المباني واضحة رسوماتها وملونة، رسومات الوحدات قريبة للواقع وملونة (على عكس روم 2)، حقبة جميلة، فيها إمارة قرطبة وحمير والمناذرة وتنوخ والحروب القوية بين الساسان والرومان والروم منقسمة بين بيزنطة الشرقية وروما الغربية وفيه الفايكنق وشارلمان وقبائل الهون المتهورين بقيادة أتيلا الأسوأ من قودزيلا اللي لعب بأوروبا لعب ومن الطفش غزا فرنسا.

Pros :
- Decent diplomacy system.
- Battles hold weight - victories and losses matter more than in other total war games.
- Dark and brutal early medieval setting full of intresting factions.
- Makes me feel like a warlord or a King everytime I play it.
- Great land and naval battles.Best in the series for me.
- Probably the most difficult total war out there.

Cons :
- A few minor errors such as descriptions of trait describing a male character while a trait - belong to a female character.
- There are some occasions where AI is being stupid,although it isn't very frequent.
- Sometimes game won't start on first attempt.
- Attila needing to be defeated even as many times as 6 to be finally killed is a little too much.Not a big issue though.

Mixed feelings on this one after Rome 2. I liked the early England expansion that felt more mediaeval, but the core game not really my cup of tea. Yeah it's fun to get the Vikings and conquer everything, but besides that I don't think this is anything special. Even the map graphics are a downgrade from Rome 2. So yeah, skip this one if you aren't a fun of Attila the Hun and that era. Game is just not special like many other way better Total War games.

The DLCs were more than decent, Age of Charlemagne felt like a game of its own and less like a DLC so worth it.

I really like the royal family/nobles' families dynamics...it feels more personal to me when I know who the family is, and what is good and bad about each character. I really like the way the game can be played VERY different ways: Starting as a horde vs normal tribe vs desert tribe vs Viking tribe vs Tannukhids fs Roman Empires is very different from one another. ALSO, the wide geographic range of starting locations makes a BIG difference. I like how there are medium, large and grand victories, and I like how religion affects the game and the victory conditions. The graphics are very nice. I like how there are more diplomatic choices, and the various choices of what to do with a zone when you have conquered it. I really like how some territories give you different bonuses, and detriments. I like how there is a scarcity of resources, so you have to plan what nations to own/control.

Battles are no better either, almost anime-like in how you can hide a few morons in an incredibly sparse forest and suddenly they turn invisible. Cavalry is the most overpowered its ever been in Total War which I'm aware is quite the statement, however, not only can cavalry annihilate an entire unit, they can simply move out and slam themselves in to the next group of hapless melee infantry. This would be fine, if cavalry also wasn't unfairly strong in straight up head-to-head melee. In Total War, one of the few weaknesses cavalry has is its vulnerability in extended melee. Nope, doesn't exist here anymore. 

Battles are won by how has the better units / more cavalry, leaving zero room for actually fun, strategic and tactical gameplay and turning the game in to an, ""I have stronger units so fuck you,"" simulator.

Boring and extremely punitive, taking away all initiative and creativity and forcing players to only play one way, squirrelling resources and getting shafted over and again and controlled while creeping forward in the game under the delusion of being a 'great strategist'.

There are plenty of units to recruit but don't bother. The cavalry is absolutely unnecessary since overwhelming majority of battles will be fought in the narrow streets of cloned primitive villages. The only battle tactic i could notice was to mass archers and try to shoot the enemy in the back. Matter of fact, archers are the only useful units, even your elite infantry will either get pulverised by two low level archery units or just run in panic. Just get a few mid level heavy infantry units to hold the enemies in place while your archers go around to shoot them in the back. That's it.

Enough has been said about the Huns and their pestilential harassment. Playing a lot of other factions, you're supposed to raid, the wild late antiquity/early middle ages don't you know, but good luck replenishing in the field leading to your only viable option becoming mercs which cost an eye, kidney, liver, lungs and your great grandchildren's inheritance to maintain or going back home to fetch fresh cannon fodder. As a Dane raiding Britain, i had to sail back to Denmark to replenish my troops! And guess what, while you're away, public disorder and ensuing rioting/civil war has prepared a few turns worth of order restoration. By the time you manage to restore order and monetary sanity, the peasants are ready to go again. Very serious and historically accurate game, don't you know. Peasants ruled middle ages!

That's the most hilarious part, you're supposed to be a period accurate feudal despot but can't wage war past a few turns before the 'electorate' start to voice their displeasure of the realm being at war yet again! 
""Bring the boys back home""!!!
Regular updates about the worsening mood while urging you to make peace as soon as possible, The Daily Feudal Bugle i guess, making management of your fiefdom more like an exercise in 21st century paranoid opinion poll driven democracy. 
""All we're saying, is to give peace a chance....""

The overall 'strategy' is very simple, start a minor war, raid a few close by territories, capture or loot, quickly make peace before the 'voters' get pissed off and start a new civil war, wait for things to calm down, squirrel more resources and start a new short round of conflict.........
Rinse and repeat and thou shall enjoy this 'historically accurate and very serious game'. Fun, you won't have. 
BTW, this approach applies to all factions. All of them. 

Just do as your'e told and you'll be fine. 
The old days of Total War when you could be creative and try multiple approaches in finding new novel ways of beating the odds and just let go and have fun are long gone.

You will end up with enemies on the other side of the map, or your close ally betraying  you just to sack your city and then sue for peace.

It's dark.  It's gritty.  It's not easy, especially at first.  

EXCELLENT BATTLES
The units have a crunchy weight to them, a sweet spot that neither the older nor the newer Total War games  have seem to have hit.  The physics just feel right, from the smashing impact of a heavy calvary charge to the satisfying thud of javelin striking home.  The animations are solid, and the combat is entertaining to watch.
Sieges become methodical - probing attacks until you find a weakness, then hitting it with combined arms and pushing into the second level.  The AI does an admirable job defending, again, in a way that later games seem to struggle with.
Field battles are dynamic and exciting, with varied terrain and generated maps.

CAMPAIGN
The campaign map is almost exactly the right density.  Enemies range from norse vikings to african tribes, with everything in between.  Buildings typically have negative and positiive attributes, so region and province design forces you to make tradeoffs and find the right balance. The family and political systems are thoughtfully designed and organized, so it is easy to understand what is going on, why, and what your options are.  It invites role playing and gives you a sense of the leaders involved, their personalities, and their strengths.  You feel it when a high ranking general or governor is killed. Technology and pacing is spot on.

OVERALL
The value is here.  With some world class overhaul mods, numerous utility and tuning mods, graphical and unit mods, the re-playability is damn near endless.  Which is good, because CA hasn't delivered a hard core historical strategy game like this since.  I am sure it will be supplanted by one of the upcoming historical TW games, at some point.  But for me, Attila reigns supreme.

Campaign is too dark for me.

MODs make this game super badass.

Pros:
-Graphics best looking total war in my opinion.
-RTS combat, Unit counters are well defined.
-UI is very clean especially battle UI
-Map looks gorgeous.
-Enemy AI is actually competent.

Cons:
Campaign is bad. didn't like vanilla. However with mods, especially 1212ad, campaign can be amazing

""Oh you have increased the difficulty? Well now you have to deal with single settlement factions throwing two full armies at you when they have a gross income of 400 gold. What's that, you want diplomacy that makes sense? How about a random faction you haven't interacted with declare war on you every 5 turns even though they have no reason to dislike you.""

Higher difficulty also seems to make your units suddenly retreat when winning their fight in battles, or cause LIGHT skirmishers to annihilate your HEAVY infantry by magic.

Also nice to see CA still hasn't fixed the bug from Medieval 2 where units will just straight up ignore commands you give them. It's really nice to have a plan thought out, but then I get flanked because 3 units are standing in place out of combat and not rushing to protect a weak spot or something.

Edit:
To better emphasize the stupid bug of units not doing what you tell them to. I had one battle where I was trying to get a couple Onagers to break open some gates. I command them to attack the gates, but they need to move up to be in range. They move up, then move up and move up until they are at the foot of the gates and done even fire on the gate.

 The campaigns are good, as are the sounds and battles, but one thing that almost breaks the game for me is the paint huffing brained AI. 

If you play as a Rome, eastern or western,  it is guaranteed that your other roman faction member will start to kill itself in an instant. I find myself restarting games often because Western Rome loses almost (if not) all of Gaul by 403 along with a lot of Illyria, or Eastern Rome most of Thracia or half of the Levant by the same time. So you may be thinking ""well, just send an army to help them bit by bit right?"", well, to get rid of the barbarians who took settlements, you have to occupy all of them (or all -1 then subjugate), but then that means you as Eastern Rome will end up owning land in Gaul or wherever your ally is losing, driving up expenses. And that's if your faction partner didn't just leave half of their land completely desolate, something they won't re-take because creating one is somehow more expensive than 2 full armies + a max level building or 2. 
 So you may be then thinking ""just subjugate them then?"", well, the ones you subjugate will randomly turn hostile out of nowhere unless you leave an army at their capital and do all you can do improve relations, and even still they might turn anyway. Also forget holding Britannia as the west. This leads to a complete cluster that makes it so you basically have no ally, because you just get dragged into a million wars as your ally can't handle diplomacy. 

If you get lucky, though, and your ally doesn't ""collapse"" in 30 turns, you're in for a great experience. All of this isn't to say the game isn't fun as it is even with the previously mentioned issues - because it is fun. it's kind of pointless to be anticipating Atilla invading the West - when there is no west, or vice versa.",1666404772,1668434043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing as one of the different cultures (while not as expansive as Rome 2) offers a different strategy depending which culture you pick. An example of this is when you play as either the Western or Eastern Roman Empire as it will test you on your management skills and knowing when to fight or give ground to your enemies. While playing as one of the many migrating tribes will test you on solidifying your position in one of the many land within the Western Roman Empire. In short the game is a great with its challenges and offers players choice to rebuild the Roman Empire or see to the whole world burn. 

The DLC's for this game has its highs and low such as the Empires of Sand and Age of Charlemagne are worth their price and offers a lot of replayability.

Once again, Fuck you Sega for your DLC. Yet more content that used to be in the game as standard cut out to sell us later.

*Edit: There are a few battle changes that make no sense to me, and never appear in other TW games. Why is there no guard mode? Why do I have to babysit all my units to stop them running off? Why have all ranged units forgotten how to fire over my own units? Why have 4 ammo types for archers when you'll only ever use 2? Why does the AI get the automatically set units to loose formation under fire, and I don't?

Unfortunately, there is a major issue with this game. During campaigns, at ~20-100 turns, the game will crash and the save is corrupted. That by itself is already enough of a problem, but where it is truly unacceptable is during Legendary campaigns. Legendary campaigns cannot have saves made for them, instead they simply autosave at the end of a turn or before a battle. This results in the crash completely ruining a campaign, without the ability to loading a previous save and hopefully not experiencing the previous crash. I have had multiple Legendary campaigns completely ruined by this issue. This is not related to mods because I scarcely use mods (<10 mods used during campaigns), and just to be sure I attempted an entirely vanilla Legendary campaign and still experienced the same crashes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game, verified integrity, etc and still have this issue.

What changed? Why can I no longer play this game that I've paid for? How does the same game get destroyed later by an online service to make it LESS compatible?

Downvote the hell out of this. Should be some kind of compensation tbh. If you were someone who came to my house and destroyed one of my things so that it wouldn't work anymore, you would be expected to pay for it. 


This is the previous review I had written for the store page (I literally edited the same comment):

The best Total War game, IMO. Great setting — not quite what we think of as classical ancient Rome, and not quite what we think of as medieval times. It's that weird ""in between"" times, the migration period, the fall of Rome, the rise of the peoples of northern and continental Europe.  The early dark ages. 

It is both 100% a history game, while also having the themes and ambience of a fantasy game; the darkness of the apocalypse, the end of an age. 

The factions feel different, and have a great variety of units. (If you do care about dlcs, then this game also has probably the best, largest variety to choose from in terms of new factions). 

The map is massive, from central Asia to Spain, from Sweden down to the Sahara. 

It is challenging, but in my opinion it isn't unfair. In single player, the largest empires are struggling just as much as saxon newcomers. 

Factions really are tailored to different types of gameplay, making it a very replayable game. But, in my opinion, on the whole the single player campaign favors caution over aggression, unless you are the Huns or White Huns, which do not ""settle"" territory, but are nomadic armies with mobile camp-settlements. But even if you are a smaller, migratory faction like the Suebi, the game will encourage you to get going... don't, necessarily. Be cautious, wait, be purposefully slow, think. 

My only real criticism is the naval battles, but it doesn't affect my liking of the game whatsoever. Only Empire and Napoleon did that right. Get this game.",1652918562,1663646882,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like strategy games then give this a go. It would suit both real time tactical and turn based strategy type players.

I'm not a fan of the newer titles; Total War Hammer because it all seems a bit silly. I don't think i'm alone in this regard so many people have been moding Attila to make it better. Some of them have done some amazing work! Check out the Steam Workshop for a mod after you've played the game for a bit.

I rate it 8/10 without mods and 9.5/10 with them.

The format is boring, the story lines are historic fiction at best, and the AI is completely overpowered, even 2 of the same units fighting each-other and the AI completely annihilates your unit. Creative Assembly haven't made a a genuine good (fun) Total War game since Medieval II Kingdoms. I'm not going to buy anymore, Attila, Rome II, Troy, Shogun II, Three Kingdoms, and the War-hammer versions have completely put me off. Even the ones in that list I've completed which is most, i can honestly say i didn't enjoy, and was glad to complete so I never had to play them again and most I haven't this is the only one i have come back to several times and as I said, it cheats, its boring and frustrating because of the AI cheating, I'm doubt ill bother trying again, I've just lost hope in Creative assembly, they are just rinsing a dead franchise these days, the games have lost all their quality and enjoyment.",1660774544,1660774592,False,0,0,0.497237592935562134,2,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Overall i play with mods such as Radious which adds more tons of new units to the game. In every total war game there is the ""Heart Attack"" death animation, it can be fixed with matched combat mods tho.

There is also a ""Workshop"" and ""Assembly kit"" which allows you to create and subscribe to tons of mods

Edit: Assembly kit is really easy to use and really helpful to create custom unit outfits or even units for 1212 MK

Great mechanics, campaign, units, graphics and battles

Main reasons is the Huns and Diplomacy.
I Understand the Huns are suppose to be terrifying and Difficult to defeat,but they end up being more annoying then terrifying. Mainly because of the cheats they get , endless spamming full stacks ,made of elites by the mid game and constantly chasing yo around the map no matter where you go, completely stopping replenishment when in your province, and my favorite getting endless money and not having to actually build an economy.

Diplomacy 
Everyone hates you, so no one will trade with you even if its in their favor, non- aggression pacts and allies never last when you need them too, and all of this is because of negative multipliers like being a Great Power, which personally doesn't  make sense to me.

To sum up
I do like many of the features in this game , Horde mode, Religion Changes, climate change. etc.
They bring me back to this game for a short stint, until i inevitably get too annoyed and put it down again.

Ultimately if that is something you can put up with ,then have fun and don't let me stop you.

And I hate saying this, because on papers these games would be the everything I wish for in a strategy game. I personally think that the problem lies in the concept of the grand campaign itself; they are too long, and as such, you often find yourself in the place in which the novelty wore off but you still ""have to play"" to win the game. For example, in this game my longest campaign is with the Western Roman Empire, probably the most difficult faction to win with; the first 30-40 turns (around 30 hours of gameplay i would say) were cool af. I had to immediatly retreat to safe regions, and then battle between internal rebellions and external invasions from barbarians, with Attila looming in the distance. That was epic. But once i survived the initial onslaught, the game quickly transformed into ""take army, attack city, autoresolve, occupy"". Even the BBEG, Attila, at the end of the day was just a ""find his army, isolate it, autoresolve, kill"" x3. What I was doing at the start of the game was the same thing i was doing in the end, just with bigger armies, bigger distances and bigger enemies. If you win a 20 to 1 battle once, it's epic; if you have to do it 15 times, it's just annoying and boring; same is true for quelling rebellions, rebuilding/optimising cities, reorganising armies and so on.

The game, as all total wars, can't escape the inevitable ""sameiness"" that imo plagues the series, consequence of the fact that during a campaign you are fundamentally doing the same thing over, and over, without any meaningful variation, but slower and slower. So much so that I started 10 different campaigns and ended them after max 15 turns as i felt no difference to what I was doing in the 150+ turns of the WRE one. Had the game some mini campaigns, short and to the point, I feel this problem wouldn't be felt as much. But as the game basically requires you to do a world conquer, you have to either waste 50 hours engaging in the same gameplay or cut it short, leaving with an unsatisfactory feeling of ""uncompleted"".

Unfortunately, the graphics engine is buggy as heck.  I run a laptop with Intel Xe integrated graphics which has so far been able to handle any other game I've tried albeit at low-res settings.  This game just either crashes or freezes, however.  I'm usually able to squeak in a single turn before it does and manage to play by quick saving continuously.  Gets really frustrating at times, though, especially when it freezes up before I can save after a battle.

You might say that the issue is trying to run it on an integrated graphics card, but again, I've run games like Civilization 6, Two Point Hospital, Cities: Skylines, and Skyrim without issue.

 TW Attila its dark and bloody like the dark ages.

 Each kingdom in the face of Earth its in a race against dead, cause the ascention of Attila its inevitable. 

 This state of urgency make you feel that every single turn, and every single decission will make the difference.

 You will experience better graphics, better maps, better units, better battles, better campaign, better better, better everything.

  Also the DLCs are much better than Rome 2.

  Even in 2022 you will enjoy a grat game plaing Attila. This is of the best games in the Saga.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Rome 2 has an horrid launch.
 But (in many ways) this dissaster was never fixed. 


(1) THE TACTICAL LEVEL:

 Attila has hand made battle maps
 Rome 2, the battle maps were FLAT-computer-generated 

 That means, in Attila, you will find great tactical elementis in the battlefield, making each battle unique. 

 
 Except fot sieges, in every single battle, the units were placed in FLAT battle maps
 
 its a tactical game, with no tactical elements...

  So, In Rome 2 battles, you will be playing the same boring SH*T battle again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, again... F*CK, thats so F*CKING wrong.  

 no high ground...
 no units hiden behind a hill...
 so, no ambushes... 
 so, no points of interest

 just a complete dissaster   
  

 Also units of Attila has a much stronger personality.
 Archers are fearsome.
 Heavy cavarlry its terrifying
 heavy infantry feels like heavy infantry.
 etc. etc. etc.

 In contrast, every single Rome 2 units are pretty much the same SH*T, fighting in the same FLAT square box. 
 
 In the tactical element, Attila was 10 times better. 


 (2) THE ARTWORK 

 Attila has a much better art design, in every single way. 

 It was a great improvment in lighting and colour pallette 

 Also, another consequence of HAND MADE MAPS, its they look much better.

 cause most of the textures were han made, not just sprayed over a flat base.  

 So everything you see, looks much better in Attila.
 

 Compared to that, Rome 2 was pale, boring, and unrealistic crap.  

 The flat battlegrounds look so BAD and so UNREALISTIC.... 
 The Rome 2 units look so BORING... .

 No living colous.... just a flat boring crap. 


 (3) BACKGROUND AND THE STRATEGIC ELEMENTS


 Rome 2 has one of the better backgrounds that will ever exist: THE RISE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE...

 NOTHING can comparr to that.

 So, the  Rome saga was the only game they not have the right to ruin...
 But they ruined it.

- The worst thing its... Rome 2 were striped from many of the best elemants implemented in the original TW Rome...

 Like the civil war. the strugle between the Senate and the ""people"" of Rome. the orders of the SPQR  

 in Rome 2 you have no fight against the Senate, and i cant even remembmber if you have a civil war... but you have no factions (like the real life Crasus, or Pompey) 

 So... Rome 2 has everything to be the BEST Total War ever... and they ruined it.

 So in Rome (as in history)  you not only have to beat your enemies... you will have to doit without starting a war against the Senate. 
 
 In Rome 2 its just a parade.


- in Attila you will play as a smaller rising nation, with the urgency of being prepared to the scourge o God...

 and when the time comes, it will be the apocalypsis

 It was an excelent concept. 

 Why people are whining about this??? 


 (4) PILITICAL CORRECTNESS

 You dare to wrote me talking about my ""political correctness"" in REDDIT... ????

 Your Rome 2 was made by a bunch of faggs.

 Just watch the videos of the press team.
 Once I even wrote to CA... ""take out this faggs, they do not represent me... 


 And...  ""Gods.. I hate the gauls...
 ""and my grandfather hated them too,  even befor they put out his eyes....

 The ORIGINAL Rome (as the history of humankind) were based on racial hate.

 Rome was so cool and realistic... 

 your beloved Rome 2 was striped from everything.... 
 the Senatum aristocracy.. the people of Rome... even the black units...
 
 Attila bring back the races, AND... the religion.  
 So you will be expterminateng another nation because of his race, or his religion...

In my view, it's because of Attila's challenging or sometimes unbalanced gameplay and different approach from other Total War games that Attila is the best Total War game and one of the best strategy games ever made.

What does Attila do so well? In a sentence: no other strategy game even comes close to the thematic and historical immersion Attila creates. I didn't think it was possible for a strategy game to have serious storytelling and such historical depth. Total War games can either be fun tactical and strategy sandboxes or they can be like Attila and create a thematic and narrative tale that uses the grand strategy genre as a means to an end.

What's incredible is that this immersion is not just achieved by sprinkling some funny-looking UI and a soundtrack on an average Total War game (though Attila's soundtrack is a masterpiece!), far from it, Attila uses all aspects of the game to create immersion. From the main menu to both the strategic and tactical gameplay, Attila highlights its apocalyptic themes and aesthetics all throughout its gameplay. Though many criticize its challenging and decentivizing gameplay where any decision you make has some negative consequences and it's really a matter of making the ""least worst decision"", I actually think this element adds to the themes and historiticity of Attila as a game. In short, Attila's gameplay, as difficult as it is, is intertwined with its goal of immersion and storytelling.

So if you're looking for a balanced and laid-back Total War game where you paint the map with your samurai, knights, or fantastic dinosaur mages, Attila is not for you. But if you're interested in historical authenticity or want to try out a unique and original grand strategy experience that uses Total War gameplay for storytelling, Attila is perfect.",1654923638,1654923638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example, I was attacked in Belgium by the Suebi.  I sent a relief army from Britain.  It took me FOUR turns to get even half way to the target, because the army's movement was so restricted.  By then, my army was caught in winter and suffered attrition, and a full Suebian army came and annihilated it.  Coming the other way, the Suebi sent an army to attack me in Londinium.  The AI Suebian army moved across northern Gaul, traversed the English channel, and moved inland to Londinium all within the course of a single turn.  Absolute BS.

I had a town in Germania which the Romans laid siege to.  I had an army occupying the settlement and a garrison from the town structure.  The next turn, a Roman army was at the gates laying siege.  My defensive army was still in place, but when I checked the town card, the town had been destroyed and there was no explanation.  No battle had been fought yet, I simply lost the garrison because of AI capriciousness.  Absolute BS.

I had a rebellion and lost a battle.  My army then suffered severe winter attrition.  However, the rebel army was in the same province, and suffered hardly anything from winter attrition.  The rules are applied unevenly.  Absolute garbage.

It is no wonder to me that they had to put this game on sale for 7 dollars.  I'm just glad I didn't waste any more money than that.  I have been with the total war franchise since the very beginning, and I have seen the quality of their games deteriorate over the years.

That's not to say it's without problems, on the contrary it has quite a few. Its Campaign AI is programmed solely to irritate, some mechanics don't make sense, there are some bugs mainly regarding pathfinding (as do all Total War games). Diplomacy is sort of broken, people can freely roam and raid your regions without having to declare war. I also don't like how the game in many cases forces you to build every region the same. The (base game's) online community isn't really active. Problems do exist overall.

However I still consider it a good game. I love the setting of it, the references to the Revelation and generally the whole mood/atmosphere. Has some of the best mods in the Total War franchise (kudos to all modding teams) and its campaign expansions do add quite a bit to the experience. The battles are -in most cases- very interesting and fun and they often give you that satisfaction of beating impossible odds through tactics. There is a variety of options when it comes to factions, armies and campaign expansion options. Probably an unpopular opinion but I personally really like the horde mechanic (despite the AI abusing it) as well as the climate change. Every faction offers a different experience which makes it more immersive. Beautiful soundtracks and fun easter eggs here and there are also worth mentioning.

Overall: A good, underrated game with its own problems. An enjoyable, sometimes annoying, immersive experience. Would suggest buying it as well as the campaign expansions on discount.",1650435319,1650435319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll say it right off the gate, it's the most unforgiving  total war I have ever played, and i'd be lying if i said I enjoyed the politics. Try to make your provinces or regions self sufficient as soon as possible, and if you have an army to attack, be sure your towns are covered because war in this game is loathed.  80% of the time its the best choice lol, even playing a nomadic faction, but some obviously lean one way or the other. You must be successful if you go all in. Early game decisions will make or obliterate you. Troops will suck your coffers dry. Also, religion and culture is a relatively important thing to consider early game, and agents will save you a rl hemorrhage, so make use.  That being said, I haven't been successful in one campaign yet, but maybe at 100 hours I'll be skilled enough to take another province without completely decimating my faction or take too much land without being prepared enough to manage it. Politics and diplomacy before starting new wars is totally advised. If you have any love for your starting faction leader, be careful where it fights and note you can switch out for another if you have it. Attila as fun as Hell on Earth gets for what it is so far for me, and I've barely even touched playing Huns yet.,  Don't expect any pleasantries, but it's certainly playable, especially if you take an interest in the era's history. Also, naval incorporation into any total war adds an unimaginable level of awesome for me, but that's me. Sea artillery in land battles, git gud at mirco in battle if you don't auto resolve and fun fact, you're units will chatter. It pays to listen. If that sounds like a lot to take in at once, it is.  I say no more. If you play a Roman faction, you will be fighting most of the world. Sass. and eastern factions are fun AF.",1650122310,1650122310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of the quality of the game itself, there are a lot of optimization issues (you probably won't experience this if you have a higher end PC) and the occasional bug, but the game is a massive step up from the older total wars in terms of in-game issues like pathfinding, and crashes are a lot less common. The battles are also much more balanced than older total war games, and unlike newer total war games like Three Kingdoms and Thrones, there is a lot of unit variety that will keep battles interesting.

One of the biggest problems this game faces is the campaign itself. The issues aren't with the mechanics of the campaign, the issue is the factions and their play styles. While the main vanilla campaigns are unique, they play very different to what most total war players are used to. The Western and Eastern Empires start out vastly overstretched, and almost guaranteed to lose a large amount of territory to the many hostile factions, especially on higher difficulties. Because of this, they can be very challenging and require a lot of planning to survive. Other factions, like the Huns and great migrators are hordes, which was not in a total war game since Barbarian Invasion for Rome, and there were some serious changes in mechanics since then. There are some factions, like the Saxons and Franks, that play more like other total war game factions, but they face the issue of having to fight the Romans, who may target you early on and catch a newer player off guard. Most of the factions that have a more typical total war playstyle are locked behind DLC, such as the Celts, Slavs and some Germanic factions. Because the main factions are very unique and typically more challenging than usual factions, and a number of the more traditional total war type factions are unplayable without DLC, it turns a lot of players off from the campaign.

One of the upsides of Attila is that it has one of if not the best modding scenes of any total war game. The number of overhaul mods and total conversion mods for Attila offer a lot of replayability. This is mostly because Attila is the last major historical total war game, (because Thrones, Three Kingdoms and Troy are all smaller and more focused games), so modders have focused on it over the years and created a ton of great mods. The only historical total war games that can claim as good of a workshop are Medieval 2 and Rome, which suffer a lot of the issues that come with the older total war games.

If you like mods and campaigns that will challenge you in unique ways, and more balanced battles, play Attila. But be prepared for some of these campaigns to brutalize you due to the learning curve in their playstyles, and if you want to play more traditional type factions, be prepared to fork up some extra money for DLC's. And if you play on a lower budget PC, be prepared for some performance issues.",1647804178,1647804178,True,5,0,0.567509174346923828,0,True,False,False

The campaign is challenging but fun. Its different to those earlier games though as you can't aggressively expand without facing rebellions. As with Napoleon Total War, I would start on hard difficulty or even normal and work your way up as you learn the new mechanics - maybe as one of the barb factions or East Rome if you want to play the Romans right away. Don't rage and blame the game if you started on legendary and got steamrolled. On the highest difficulty, diplomacy is a lot more difficult and factions do not want to make peace. That kind of desperate survival against all the factions can be fun once you get used to the game a bit more. Diplomacy generally is a lot more functional than in Empire or Napoleon, while still not letting the player cheese the game like in the original games and swindle settlements from the AI.

The economy system is not too punishing especially if you use your money deliberately and destroy buildings you don't want or need. If you liked Barbarian Invasion in RTW, this is right up your alley too. Playing the Romans is an experience where you don't have to conquer aggressively to be immersed in the world the game is trying to create. Holding the massive empire you already have is a compelling challenge of its own. Abandoning some areas as the Romans may be necessary, but turtling in one small region is not a fun or advisable experience. Attila innovates here with a somewhat new take on Total War. The Roman campaigns are probably the main course here, but you can also play invader factions if you want some variety. I hate that a good number of factions are locked behind DLC, that would be my main gripe with the game. But there are enough factions to have fun with from the start.

Ive heard a lot of bitching about the mechanics of Attila having three lives... but this mid-late game challenge is part of what makes this game as interesting into the late game. Its what Empire and Napoleon lacked... as in Napoleon, you could dismantle Napoleon's empire in the first ten turns if you wanted to. It was a bit too anti-climactic. The original Rome had the civil war... Attila's invasion is this games version of that. Attila is the boss battle of this game. You are planning your campaign around his arrival and the desperate defense you will have to prepare. I like the story driven elements of this game, they add to the apocalyptic atmosphere without taking away player freedom.

It sucks that the game limits how many armies you can have, but the system is not as bad as its made out to be. The limit to number of armies is based on the size of your empire. I think it does alleviate the unit spam of both player and AI in the late game. Garrisons are separate from armies and they can be somewhat customized from different settlement buildings. The one gripe I have with unit recruitment is that somehow the Romans can't recruit heavy cavalry from the start and instead have to rely on the weak scout cavalry until you get better buildings.

The battles are really fun I've found. The game forces you to play units to their strengths and not just play battles like an arcade click fest. People complain about Roman units being underpowered, but I'm convinced they're just not playing their units to their strengths. Collisions seem way better than in Rome II and formations like testudo work like they should. I haven't encountered any issues with these. Combat is detailed and nice to zoom in and look at. And you'll be fighting plenty of battles, which is good in my books. As Barbarian Invasion enjoyers know, walls are your best friend against overwhelming horde stacks. Walls arent as OP as in the original Rome, but they help a lot on fronts you need to defend.

Complaints of this game being ""historically innacurate"" are ridiculous. The original RTW and Medieval 2 had many completely ahistorical factions and units, but the gameplay was incredibly fun and that is what still brings players back to those games today. The game gives respect to history but is not about simulating it exactly. This is not a reskin of classic Total War though. It's more of a development of the idea started in Barbarian Invasion just with more factions, settlements, mechanics, and atmosphere.

This game definitely has a different ""flavor"" than the other total war games with its turbulent number of events for a historical title. But I think it's interesting to note that veteran players might notice the combat feels somewhat comfortably similar to older titles like Rome: Total War. Make sure you have some decent hardware for full enjoyment. 

Some things you may/may not do:

-Kill or be killed by Attila's horde of 9999999999 cavalry units. (Obligatory)
-Think Rome is near defeat and then suddenly find 40 columns of heavily armored infantry at your door step.
-Raze that one pesky rebel region to ash because its not worth garrisoning it with two armies worth of upkeep.

Short answer attention to detail, carefully look at all other Total War games that follow this look at the troops. Notice something odd? They're all clones, same armor, same shields, same faces, CA abandoned this attention to detail with other games. In this game every soldier looks a bit different the fighting is different and more brutal and the animations for combat are different. Everything about this game is what used to make CA the number one strategy turn based game in my opinion. Sadly they've strayed away from attention to detail, now the battles are boring in the new games, the soldiers are all clones, it's just not the same and kills the immersion for me.

Edit: To elaborate, this just happens to have my favorite mechanics of the series. The Huns provide a solid, almost environmental-like enemy force which gradually ratchets up the pressure until you address the threat. Setting and narrative are top notch. The vanilla factions have a good variety and are distinct from one another. The micro level of the game in terms of where exactly you place your armies, stance, ambushes, agents open up a lot of interesting options for different strategies. Makes for fun game play with replayability. Graphics are very solid despite being almost 10 years old (all the little guys are distinct and you can see them fighting and everything, runs smooth enough). Probably a solid game for someone with a mid-level to old gaming rig, and will deliver fun for folks with better gear.

This is a dumpster fire, give someone else your money. 

issues include 
crashing after launch (no mods and fresh install)
Crashing when selecting menue items in main menue (again no mods and fresh install)
Crashing at battle start (see above)
Slide show level FPS during siege battles. 
All of these issues i have while the game is not modded and freshly installed. I cannot recommend a game that does not work.

Last time I played a Total War game was ""Medieval 2""  many years ago. With Attila, I'm glad I found a harder game in franchise Even prologue campaign makes you struggle when Huns arrive. 

+Nations (era in general) in this game are more interesting to me than medieval 2 and other TW games. I don't like when settled empires fight against each other. Like Ottoman Empire vs France, Austria vs Spain etc. I want tribes, warlords, barbars. I want blood. I want chaos. I want nations to suffer and this game gives that feeling.(Even losing is fun)

+This game has very dark atmosphere. Can't say depressive but darker than other Total War games. It pictures the chaotic atmosphere of migration period well and I like it. 

-Optimization is really bad for a game came that out in 2015. I didn't have a good PC back then. But now I have. Still getting low fps values.

Creative assembly sells blood dlc for $3. This is nonsense. Unfortunately I bought it just to see better visuals but animations aren't very good. I don't recommend you to buy it. It's not necessary.

+People say AD1212 mod is epic. I only tried the prologue campaign. But after playing the grand campaign a couple of times, I may try it.

-Multiplayer community is almost dead. You see one or two games but most of them are private. 

+You can play the game in Turkish 

+I was trying to decide between this and three kingdoms and glad bought this. Don't know about diplomacy but wars are better in this one. At least there aren't superhuman heroes that can change the tide of war alone. I like these nations more than chinese warlords.

If you play as a European faction, the Huns will attack and burn down your lands and those of your neighbors for the entirety of the game. They cannot be wiped out until you fight and beat Attila himself three times without auto-resolving the battles. Attila himself doesn't even spawn into the game for the first 70+ turns meaning you must accept that the Huns will be harassing you with overwhelming force all game long. Religious strife and sanitation make it incredibly hard to maintain the public order needed to prevent rebellions. With the exception of the Ostrogoths, when you conquer a city belonging to another culture you must convert that settlement to your culture and religion. In the interim public order will be abysmal, there'll be no real garrison and the AI will be able to generate rebel units that the settlement they spawned from that the human player isn't even capable of recruiting.

This game had the potential to be the best in the series but is dragged down by AI cheating and broken mechanics. The Razing mechanic in combination with the a-historical climate change events every few years make a majority of the map uninhabitable by the midway point. I appreciate what the team tried doing with this game, but many of these new mechanics suck the fun out of the game making it feel as if I'm balancing stats rather than building a kingdom.

Rome 2: Wrath of Sparta (432 BC)

Rome 2: Hannibal at the Gates (218 BC) 
Rome 2: Caesar in Gaul (58 BC)

Attila offers three key points of history: 

Attila: Grand Campaign (395 AD) 
Attila: Last Roman (533 AD) 
Attila: Age of Charlemagne (768 AD)

However the missions playing as the Huns lacks historical direction, missions are not interesting, diplomacy for Huns is useless (while it was not in history), if you get too many women it's impossible to marry them, graphics are weird (I prefer RTW II).  The learning curve is quite pronounce, but after you finally learn the new restrictions (rivalry, difference btwn raze and raiding),  you start to enjoy it, specially the ability to settle the hordes and raze entire cities, which is unique here and historically accurate (not present in Barbarian invasion) .

The overall combat system is pretty standard for total war and make no major departure from Rome 2. Its pretty good.

Number of available factions is pretty good but the actual difference between two factions in the same culture group seems somewhat minimal and lacking in creativity. 

The user interface is probably one of the worst parts of the game. Again everything just looks dirty from text to icons  to your cursor it all just looks like it is covered in grim..... I am guessing this is to show the decay of civilization during the time period but it just comes off as ugly and distraction.

Unit description is woefully inadequate. Rather than give any kind of hard numbers for units, unless you go into the encyclopedia, It just give a few details about their worst or best attributes. Like ""Very Poor Piercing Damage"" or ""Good Charge"" but nothing that really goes in more details about the unit. I cant imagine why this was removed.


Overall i feel like the game's issues come from trying to recreate a feel of societal decay in the user interface but instead just creating a bad user interface and visually unappealing campaign map. 

I plan on spending more time with the game and playing a few more factions before i write it off, but initial reaction is something of a let down for a game with 80% positive reviews.

I was concerned with how this game might run due to an Heir of Carthage video on Youtube of him playing a Western Roman Empire campaign that he uploaded around Dec 30, 2021. He was stating that the game was running like a slideshow. For me, it runs fine. The campaign map framerate is fine, but not as good as Troy. The battle framerate is fine. By fine I mean playable and enjoyable. Now again, I'm only one hour in to the prologue so I don't have the most accurate opinion. If you're looking to pick this game up on sale like I did, I would say it runs fine on modern hardware. I might find out once I get into a much longer campaign something different, but as of one hour of playing the prologue, I've not noticed anything that detracts from the playing experience. Granted, I'm used to playing Shogun 2 on a PC that was new in 2009.

I may be biased as this was my first TW game, but Atilla has things that other total war games just lack. The sieges, the wandering factions, and surviving famines make this the most challenging Total War. In no other game will you invade another country just to get some land for food so your people can eat.
I have Warhammer II and although it definitely has more quality overall and diversity in troops(being a fantasy), in terms of actual battles and campaign Atilla triumphs even then.
You'll never get bored playing the interesting factions, especially the extreme campaign of turning the West Roman Empire around from the brink of death. Even playing an easy faction like the Persian Empire could get tricky if you screw up dealing with the white huns.
Only negative I can think of is the army limit in battles. It says the max is 3 armies at once, but really after 2 armies your third will only spawn in the middle of the battle, which takes the fun right out of it. 8000 troops fighting in a battle is pretty OP though as it stands.

And how did I deal with Attila? More like how did Attila deal with me. Once he showed up at my borders his opinion of me was overwhelmingly positive simply due to my murderous rampage around Europe. In fact, I was in middle of razing the entire British Isles and wiping out the Celtic faction after their bright idea of declaring a war at me. I ended up having a defensive alliance with Attila - an alliance that he initiated.

Pro's:
- Great tactical battle simulator and the units are awesome, you want to play as Romans you can choose beteween Rome and Constantinople, want to be the spear that kills Rome, become a Hun, Goth, Vandal, or any Barbarian civ, or you can also become a Pasha for the Sassanids, its all up to you.
- REvamp your city from a humble settlement to a walled city to the capital of you empire.
- Survive sieges either as the attacker or as the defender.
- Trade valuable resources and use them in diplomacy.
- Diplomacy and sword are great to play, either one is good after all the game's called TOTAL WAR.
- With some practice and skill you can manuver your units on the battlefield.

Cons: 
- It need to have a serious rebalance on many playing civilizations, like the huns and some OP units that just cant be killed.
- Has a long learning curve
- I just hate naval battles

This does not mean this is a bad game -- this is a normal game just like any other TW. This review is targeted specifically at the notorious WRE campaign. 

The campaign is hard, but in the worst ways you can imagine. You do not face ""strong"" opponents that make you feel challenged. On the opposite, every single mechanism feels like CA deliberately cheating in the most utterly lazy ways so that you might have a very shoddy delusion of being challenged.

I am a TW veteran, and sure I can cheese the shit out of it and still win, regardless difficulty. But that is not what I want from a challenging campaign. The hope is I don't cheat, AI doesn't cheat a lot, but not too ridiculously much. But here AI cheats too ridiculously much.

First off, the public order system is out of control. On top of the difficulty penalties, there's a -9 constant immigration penalty since mid-game that refuses to go away. The way ""immigration"" is named makes you wonder whether less warring, etc. could help reduce it. Nope. It is just another ""difficulty penalty"" that does not go away, and is just there to make this pathetic game harder, while not one bit more fun. Following this school of thought, I can make any TW campaign ""the hardest"" by slamming a -100  flat public order penalty, and then give you 5 different PO buildings that you have to spend tons of money building. This is ridiculous and extremely contrived.

Equally bad is the enemies. All barbarians declare close to the beginning, and they are always on a suicide mission. You'd think they'd stop bothering you after the 5th army they sent is destroyed. Nope. They peace out and before the peace expires they declare war again. They care not at all about their own survival, and there's no logic of any sort. They behave not like nations but AI from 1990s. CA may as well remove all strategic and diplomatic elements and just randomly spawn 5 armies near the border every turn. Won't make a difference.

Oh, wait, that is exactly what they did. The Huns are pillaging Italy and you want to kill them? Too bad because after carefully and perfectly orchestrating a coordinated attack using all the legions and destroying all 7 Hun armies in one turn, instead of being wiped out, they just spawn several new armies near the border a few turns later. Congratulations, now you need to keep 3-4 legions forever on the border so that they can deal with Huns that come from utterly nowhere and cannot be killed. It's like a Tower Defense game, only that you need to spend two hours fighting the exact same enemies every few turns, for 100 turns. It is a complete waste of time.

I can cheese and win. Abandoning settlements at the beginning, wait for siege timer to run out, corner camp, etc. etc. But you-cheat-I-cheat is not the challenge I want. This campaign is extremely disappointing, and I do not suggest anyone to try it.",1639729477,1639729477,False,66,10,0.737819373607635498,2,True,False,False

Don't bother to settle any cities, they cost too much to upkeep and you will never make that much anyways, reason being unlimited armies attacking you from everywhere. I haven't even seen much of a hunic invasion, the european tribes have big enough armies to whipe you out when they gang up on youas it is, and they do. Even if you eradicate scorched earth policy one tribe another will take it's place to eagerly declare war on you and send countless overpowered agents to ruin your day. The AI also seems to have unlimited funds to buy anything it wants. So when you are spawned with countless low level agents killing off high ranking generals or poisoning your cities and impeding movement while more and more armies approach you are basically at zero chance of winning, did I mention making money is hard? And how you need it immensly to survive? Oh, yeah, I thought I'd run around europe burning and pillaging and making a ton of cash then settling, then 10 armies attacked me from all sides in two turns and killed me off ompletely. Yeah, challenging. I bought this at a discount and still feel ripped off.

UPDATE: Still sucks, only thing improved is that there's less infinite agents running around keeping you from actually playing the game. I managed to build a safe haven in Britania. I'm safe now, everything under control. What I fail to understand is why you lose ability to build beneficial buildings the more technology you discover? Food scarcity is also an issue, keeping people happy isn't easy either. If you plan to expand, it won't happen. I keep sinking countless ships filled with armies from all over the place trying to invade Britain. It's fairly easy to do with just one navy if you keep your catapults in the back. But then, I have to wonder, so... what now? Expansion is pointless due to the debuffs you get and the constant invasions. I doubt I could keep the settlements on the mainland if I tried. The troop composition compared to barbarians is just pathetic. barbarians have archers, crossbowmen, artillery and cavalry, but I as rome have... foot soldiers and javelin throwers... yeah... not great for expansion there...",1443658399,1639531302,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Attila was my very first experience with the newer Total War games. I will never forget the hours I spent with every faction and the time I lost my anal virginity within the first two turns of a Western Roman Empire campaign.

Attila doesn’t follow the great formula of gameplay of the other TW games. Things are harder in Attila, more frantic and survival-focused, and there is a really steep learning curve to get the balance of settlement management which will entirely make-or-break your campaign. 

I personally loved Attila, but I’m just a psychopath that enjoys painful and frustrating experiences. If you want a REAL challenge, give it a try.

For the historically-minded and those who loved CA's roots, like STW I and II, Medieval I and II, RTW I and II,-you get the idea-(so, CA, will there be an Atilla II (or MTW3) to help assuage the historically minded supporters? For the die hards then it is indispensable, but particularly so for those who yearn for the fierce and active cavalry engagements offered in the MTWs.  All that and the updated mechanics found in R2 but with a very satisfying attention to the tactical level.

While I have only scratched the proverbial surface of the game at this point, and that with a dozen or so mods and a couple of DLCs to make it a more complete experience, so far so good.  (If my opinion changes, I will update this review in the future.)  

Atilla hearkens back to the Dark Ages period, if preceding it by a horse's hair, and with a ticking timer (a familiar mechanic but one that still proves appealing) hanging over your head  in the urgent form of a sword of Damocles, or the equine-culture and compound-bow armed hordes of the Hunnic Atilla.

For those who admired the historical iterations, warts and all, and to be clear that means there are no elves, magic, dragons, and so forth, what you have here is generally a reasonably faithful depiction of the overwhelming fear that the Huns and those they dispossessed planted in Europe and beyond between the 4th and the 6th centuries.  You can play them or attempt to survive as one of many European or non-European factions.

For me, it is all about the battles and Atilla has that critical element on target.  Should the realism of blood and gore be a DLC, locked behind a paywall like some archers firing behind a wall of shields?  Of course not.  For the historical games anyway, it must be included in the game as an option in settings, with an intensity slider.  If needs must be, put a parental lock of some sort on it to spare the young armchair lieutenants, but for the grognards at this point it is expected.

Lastly the game is dark, I mean visually too dark.  I get that it was the Dark Ages and there were perhaps other factors contributing to this design choice, but to make a game enjoyable you need to see clearly and this is an area where the historical should not come before the necessary.  Again, have the option in settings if it is something the devs feel is critical, but let the player choose.

Atilla, and particularly the battles, is excellent.  The attention to and the development of the power of the defense is where it really shines, and absolutely makes this a ‘must-have’ for those looking to scratch that RTS historical itch.

I have a theory that the narrower focused, smaller timeframe Total War games tend to be better and this is a fine example. It's got a brutally unforgiving combat system, an apocalyptic vibe and factions that genuinely play completely differently in campaign mode (desperately surviving as Rome is a very different experience to looking for a place to settle as the Goths, for instance. Sassanid opportunism is my favourite way to go)

What really sets it apart are the mods, though. I have no idea what drew so many talented and dedicated modders to this one, but it's mind blowing. The number of mods that remix and breathe new life into a game that already has a lot to offer. Medieval Kingdoms is, I know, going to be the gold standard against which a new medieval total war game will be judged and it wouldn't surprise me if the modders out do them.

I've been a huge TW fan since Medieval 1, and spent a lot of time in Medieval 2, also Rome and Empire. 
I've been looking forward to a new version in a European setting, because the history aspect is what counts for me. 
However, I'm not having fun with Attila. It's just too cluttered with game mechanics, and a lot of the time, the UI is counter-intuitive for me. Each time you want to finish a turn the game reminds you that you have this and that chore to do. I don't mind complex game mechanics if they serve a purpose, but in Attila, it all feels like it's just there to keep you busy, and wasn't thought through well. Like a skill tree for each general, another skill tree for each army, put all important people (which all have similar faces) into political roles, etc. etc. 
I can't keep track of it all! 

So if you find the other TW games lacking of stuff to do per turn, check this out.

To start out, diplomacy, remember that? Might as well call it fuckyoumacy because the AI will flat out refuse every single offer you make, no matter how reasonable. Got 100+ relations with Eastern Roman Empire who broke their alliance by refusing to join you in a war and want a non-aggression pact? Not happening. 

Have 3 full armies advancing an a secluded barbarian capital and want peace? Not a chance in hell son. It would be better if they just removed the diplomacy mechanic from the game all together so at least they won't be deceiving you into thinking such a thing actually exists.

Next up is siege AI. You have a low 15% chance that the AI won't attack a walled city at all and prefer to sit outside the gates until the timer has run out, this happened on my very first siege battle. 

Then you have a low 50% chance that they'll completely ignore your soldiers and advance to the town square with the same generic Roman colosseum placed in nearly every Roman city. If you are lucky enough to have neither of these happen, they'll willingly throw their cavalry away charging into a deadly wall of spears, again, and again, and again.

Deploying soldiers is a nightmare and you'll constantly have to babysit your soldiers if you attempt any manuevers because pathfinding is laughably bad, nearly Empire-tier. When I order my archers to fire at the enemy within my town square they naturally form a 2 man wide 80 man deep line, then the front will be so stretched that they actually engage the enemy and then the whole unit will follow them into melee combat.

Civilians can be seen during siege battles which is really nice for immersion, but one has to wonder why they spent resources on this instead of actually fixing and testing the fucking game.

If their siege equipment is destroyed they will sit outside the city doing nothing until the timer runs out or you sally forth.

In most cities you can place 1-2 barricades in only the most redundant spots that provide no tactical advantage, but surely after months of siege they could build more than two laughable barricades? Might as well have not included this feature at all.

What's hilarious is the fact that if they bring siege weapons they can set your city ablaze and burn down virtually every building, but CA can't program a functioning AI in a single one of their games.


Onto battles. In real battles the engagements last for hours between days, not in Attila. Naturally the battles shouldn't play out that long in a videogame but here the battles are incredibly short, the average engagement with actual fighting is around 5-9 minutes long, with engagements only reaching 15 due to preparing and marching. 

I can hardly send my cavalry to flank the enemy because within a minute one of the units has already retreated with broken morale, but they'll return to battle 10 seconds later, and repeat this process until they are shattered.

Another particularly, yet minor and tiring annoyance is after winning or losing a battle you have to sit through an animation between 1v1 soldiers fighting to simulate your type of victory or defeat. While interesting at first when playing as the Roman Empires you have to sit through at least 4 of these a turn seeing your pathetic garrisons be defeated. 

And all the animations are meant for sword wielders, so you'll see stupid shit like a barbarian stabbing you in the throat with his axe/club then seeing your head pop off. While it can be funny it really goes to show the lack of effort and laziness of the Creative Assembly.

Everywhere throughout the game you'll see a great lack of effort in design and eventually come to wonder what chuckling idiot could fuck up so many clear concepts.

I could rant forever but I will end this here with a few pointers.


Cons:
-UI
-AI
-Diplomacy
-Battles
-Sieges
-Lazy design decisions
-DLC (Blood and burning pack, really? It's funny because the description for it talks about realism when I just saw a dude's head get cut off with a club)
-Mod unfriendly so people ""want"" to buy DLC
-Online Encyclopedia for basic information that is down half the time

Pros:
-Graphics
-Improved leader system from Rome II (still subpar)
-Music

After 400 hour edit:

- Skirmishers stay at max range so barely any kills
- Skirmishers get caught 90% of the time
- Pulling out cavalry turns your men into pincushions
- Autoresolve is utterly botched and favors numbers 90% of the time, forcing you to fight every little fucking battle
- Maintaining a garrison is considered too difficult for the average mouthbreather, so CA did away with it. Enjoy *endless* 4 garrison vs 20 stack battles ad nauseum
- Armies move fast so good luck countering an enemy's invasion force in the field
- You can recruit up to EIGHT units in a single turn with bonuses. This makes fielding an army laughably easy and turns what should be heroic victories into endless, inconsequential brawls
- Diplomacy is an utter fucking joke, a potato could design a game better than these inbred brits have
- God I fucking hate this game. I'm serious, this is a quarter-finished product",1490338140,1638211800,False,7,1,0.411170750856399536,0,True,False,False

overall : 8/10 + 1 point, there is LOTR MOD, which is superrrrr awesome, even though there is no campaign at all

strategy : 7/10  - AI's corps are coming to you always
DLC  : 5/10  -  they wanna sell many DLCs, but still less than ROME2 :)
 
i played from Shougun 1 to Attila 
honestly, Atiila is way better than ROme2 and slightly less than shogun2

they made good Siege mechanism, and many detail stuff

Armies: There are a lot of factions and they all have exclusive units. So every nation/faction has its own way of tactics. Spearmen , swordsmen , axemen , cavalry ... and somewhat siege engines (:like the Sassanids have better siege engines , but they're more shock cavalry and armoured elephants-tactics.
I like the way every unit can excel in combat. They can apply stances and formations. [10/10]

City and town planning is a huge part of this game. Economical , religion , or military. Hordes are the same , but they're mobile cities. But there is a high wall bug in the Charlemagne Campaign. [8/10]

Naval battle is quite basic , and there's an annoying bug in naval battles. Sometimes when your ship enters another ship , your marines are jumping into the sea instead of jumping onto the enemy ship. It happens quite a lot. [5/10]

Best Total War politics mechanics till now. AI is sometimes stupid , but they're also reasonable. You got backstabbing allies , but also loyal vassals. Depends on their leader. So it's a fair politics mechanic. [9/10]

Mods are amazing , thank you TW society!! [10/10]

Best TW game untill now. I rate this game: [8.4 / 10]

Mods that I recommend downloading:
- Desert Kingdoms Reborn (DKR)
- Greek Christian Buildings Upgraded
- Latin Christian Buildings Upgraded
- Elite Himyarite Units
- Retrieving Mod (because of the Eastern Roman Empire units)
- Fertility-Increasing Sanitation Buildings
- Sassanid Elite Units

However, this game is a fresh alternative to what strategy fans may be looking for. It's not designed to allow you to win easily. The focus on this title is simple: Ruin. 

A few extra positives to consider is the crispy graphics and well-suited lighting to the game that fits the tone and theme. I was very happy to depart from the standards set by the Rome and Medieval titles, and immerse myself in an interesting take of what the Dark Ages of Europe and beyond would feel like. But, these are for people who are interested in such elements, so i shall not linger on that. The developers corrected almost everything that was wrong with Rome II regarding politics, unit balance and one-turn sieges. Religions have been overhauled and most of the factions can now migrate to avoid any imminent dangers incurred by nature or other factions. All these, coupled with some breathtaking musical instrumentation make the game worth your while.

The downside is that sometimes a faction may seem redundant and identical to another, while the game doesn't offer a wide palette of units for each faction. This was perhaps to showcase the difference in each 
faction's strengths and weaknesses. While many players may like that more ""immersive"" factor, I personally found it limiting so I enhanced my experience with mods.

What makes this game unique is that it offers some sense of realism in the game and in which it doesn't only focus or rely heavily on conquest which is quite a tradition on every TW titles. Unlike some of the older total war titles, expect that conquest on TW Attila's campaign is riddle with a lot of problems which needs to be dealt with if you are to maintain your newly conquered territories. These problems includes: maintaining a decent sanitation levels across your settlements, if u fail to maintain a decent sanitation expect to have another problem in the form of plague or diseases which heavily affects your public order and will kill hundreds of your men across your armies stationed within the infected areas, politics is also a problem, you'll need to keep an eye on the level of influence on different characters such as the statesmen, your most effective generals, and your governors across every provinces. The higher their influence goes, the lower their loyalty to you will be which may lead to a civil war once they've gone too far ahead of you, and also the main threat of the game which is the Huns, these guys will sack and raze every single settlement they come across with and the game is basically all about surviving against these guys. They can easily wipe out even a full stack because of their vast numbers of Hunnic devil archers which easily crushes every single unit they come across with and then retreat to safety. And there's also the usual public order managements, crushing rebellions, economy management, trades etc which was already part of the older TW tittles. So if u like to play with a much more challenging TW game, then TW: Attila it is and I highly recommend it. Plus, there are tons of greats mods to choose from like the Medieval 1212AD mod which is very famous and could be considered as a Medieval 3, Rise of Morder mod which brings the Lord of the Rings setting on a TW game, and many more.

I highly recommend TW: Attila, primarily for its survival gameplay. Attila was marketed as a survival RTS, and CA delivered with this underrated title. 

While the gameplay is very enjoyable, the game's performance is a complete MESS, with barely-tolerable framerates in campaign and in battle. Fortunately, players can fix this game's poorly-optimized graphics with some modding, by replacing the game's shaders with the shader assets from Thrones of Britannia (more info on this further below).

However, despite the poor performance, the gameplay and Attila's apocalyptic story kept me playing. 

Attila is far from perfect, but I personally give the game a total score of 8/10. 

[h1]Story: 9/10[/h1]
The game's story presents itself as a tale of the end times. This is not an age of glory, it is a hellish age of decay, where the greatest civilizations of the world are falling apart and the survivors of this apocalypse are left to pick through the scraps of a bleak, and ravaged world. 

In Attila, you are not expected to conquer: you are simply expected to SURVIVE. Usually, most of the world is reduced to a howling wasteland by the end of the game, razed to the ground by the Huns, or utterly destroyed by constant warfare. IF you survive the early and midgame, the endgame is a battle royale of epic proportions between world superpowers.  

Attila's grand campaign is extremely grimdark. It is very thematic and overcoming the insurmountable odds the game threw at me personally gave me a sense of satisfaction that Rome 2 or the TW: Warhammer trilogy could never give me: I survived the apocalypse.

[h1]Gameplay: 8/10[/h1]

[b]Unit Variety and Technology[/b] 
Like previous titles, Attila suffers from one problem: Barbarian cultures often share the same units. To make matters worse, the ""cooler"" barbarian factions with unique and thematic units are locked behind paid DLC's when they should have been in the game in the first place. 

Another thing that don’t like about the units in this game, are the Roman techtrees. For example, as WRE advances through its tech tree, their units are replaced with exponentially expensive units. Because of this, by the end of the game, you can’t even field a full army of pure Roman units.

[b]Hordes[/b]
The horde mechanic is a breath of fresh air, being able to play as a wandering, marauding tribe that can pillage and raze right under the noses of the greatest empires in the classical antiquity. 

The only downside to the horde mechanic is how annoying hordes can be when playing as a landed culture. Hordes are able to march across your territory unimpeded, sacking, raiding, and razing your empire while your army chases after them, sometimes 1 movement point behind and unable to attack. This can be fixed with mods, but this oversight should have been fixed in the base game. 

[b]Crisis Event[/b]
Similar to Paradox games and TW: WH, the crisis event of this game is Attila's fiery descent upon the world. Some might say the coming of Attila makes the game too hard, or that the Huns get too many cheats.

To that, I simply say: Y E S. This game is a survival RTS, and you are expected to fight against the apocalypse. When Attila takes command of the Hunnic hordes, the Huns get powerful doomstacks that can easily wipe out an unprepared player. Thankfully, when Attila dies (from old age, or battle), the Huns lose their cheats.

Yes, this mechanic is extremely difficult, but it is VERY satisfying to outlast or defeat the Huns. Defeating the Huns almost makes you feel like you've saved the world.

[b]Pacing[/b]
This game is very fast-paced. The lethality of attacks/charges etc are much more pronounced in this game. Units will melt in seconds rather than in minutes when attacked with advantageous or superior units. 

I personally like this pacing, because battles come across as more violent and decisive in Attila.  

[b]Balancing[/b]
Similar to Rome 2, Roman units are some of the most powerful units in the game, but Attila takes place in a time period where the Roman Empire is in a steep decline, and they make easier pickings (in comparison to previous games) for the other rising factions of the game.

Battles in Attila are very dynamic and decisive, as each faction, even the barbarian tribes, have advantages over stronger empires (Celts can vanguard deploy, Nordic units make good marines, Germans have excellent cav, etc). Rome is no longer the invincible god of war it was in Rome 2, and even barbarian tribes can kick them while they’re down, in the campaign, and in battle.

[b]Apocalyptic Battles[/b]
It is sometimes disturbing how brutal, fiery, and bloody these city battles can be, and only Attila has been able to capture this sense of violence that other Total War games could not. 

One thing I miss when playing Total War: Warhammer 2, are the climactic city battles of Rome 2 and Attila. In Attila, you can burn cities to the ground in battles. This burning mechanic reduces the morale of defenders, and gives attackers an advantage. Even a grizzled Roman legionary will tremble at the sight of his people's great cities and monuments burning around him. 

Another thing that is unique to Attila are the way plagues affect armies. Sometimes, you will be forced to fight with or against infected troops, and you'll find that their warriors are visibly diseased - they are sickly and vomiting. It is truly a disturbing sight to see.

This, coupled with the dark colors, shadows, blood and gore, and fire of Attila's brutal battles, gives players a hellish and apocalyptic picture of the end times. 

In summary, Attila's gameplay compliments its apocalyptic story with its brutal, disturbing, and hyper-violent battles. These battles can give players a darker perspective on how grim this time period must have seemed to the people that lived in it. 

[b]Zones of Control[/b]
I figured I'd close this section and transition into the things I don't like about Attila (with graphics being  one of the two things I don't like about this game). 

The OTHER thing I don't like about Attila is armies' lack of zones of control. There is nothing more frustrating than surrounding a Hunnic horde with 5 armies, and attacking it, only for it to retreating THROUGH your armies, across a river, and force march away from you the next turn.

[h1]Graphics: 6/10[/h1]
I played this game for years, and found the game's framerate to be tolerable at best. The reason why this game runs so poorly is because it is a 32bit game that is often played on 64bit operating systems, and because its assets are poorly-optimized. 

Even with lower settings, this game's performance is still terrible. However, this optimization can be fixed with a little modding. By replacing the game's shader data with assets data from Thrones of Brittania, players can enjoy a smoother and acceptable framerate, even on mid-range computers. 

Instructions on how to to do this are below:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1581603370

Personally, I really don't like how CA practically abandoned this game, while still providing updates to the much older Rome 2. In fact, before I replaced Attila's shaders with TOB's, Rome 2 ran more smoothly on my computer than Attila did, which is really sad, because Rome 2 came out 7 years ago.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Although Total War Attila suffers from insufferable graphics and performance, its brutal gameplay and its thematic, apocalyptic story kept me playing. 

If you really enjoy fighting against or outlasting overwhelming odds, then you will enjoy this game. All in all, despite its graphical shortcomings, and its lack of TLC from Creative Assembly, this underrated game is an 8/10 in my book.

Not to mention the lack of faction roster diversity where several factions will share 99% of the same exact units.  The overpriced DLC is also a turn off as you have to pay to unlock factions which is lame as hell and takes away the incentive to destroy factions (in prior games you could unlock by destroying).

It seems CA didn't bother trying to make a difficulty system where the AI gets increasingly smarter as that would actually be fun and challenging; no instead they allow the AI to complete bypass certain mechanics almost entirely which is not fun at all and feels more like you're playing a rigged game rather than a challenging one.

Campaign map is deep with public order, sanitation, fertility, and all the factors that effect them.  Economy is deeper than other Total Wars since Agricultural, culture, commerce, and industry can become a real balancing act while trying to manage public order and sanitation. 

Battles are gritty.  There is more cohesion among units, battle lines are held, there is a battle order, Cavalry is super powerful but also super fragile which I really like.  

The soundtrack is severely underrated, and the atmosphere of the game is the best in the series.  

my gripes with the game include; optimisation even with a solid system getting a steady FPS can be a struggle, also Settlement battles when more than one full stack is attacking can become boring and a waiting game.

Be just advised on :
- the ingame performance : the game does not run as smoothly as Rome 2 or Shogun 2 and may even crash from time to time
- dealing with revolts is a nightmare
- it's really important to find a balance with food at your province and empire level, since you will get public order malus if your province balance is negative and you will suffer from starvation if it happens at your empire level

Regarding DLC, I only purchased Empire of Sands and playing with Himyar was a blast through difficult on the campaign map (religion, revolts...).
A better job could have been done on balance regarding rebel armies, which often spawn with top tiers units, and with the whold food system which does not make sense.

Attila has made vast improvements to the gameplay such as: siege decay, spreading fires, hoard factions etc... Also, it possibly has the best total war family tree (if you don't consider rome 2 after the improvements\3k character system) giving characters much sway to shine as they progress through the different offices (also, you can murder your own faction leader, which might make a fun takeover scenario, which I did one time)
Also, the campaign dlc are really worth you time! Telling compeling stories about the dark ages\early medieval period. The Age of Charlamagne dlc even makes a welcome return to era inspired art, such as unit cards, buildings etc... (Though they didn't give the characters any special treatment unfortunately...) Another dlc I would recommend is the desert kingdoms one: each faction there plays with unique story missions, for example: the Tanukhids conquer and liberate story, where at the end you could decide whether to incorporate those liberated factions into your own after completing a set of missions, or continue to liberate many peoples as an unrelenting hoard.
Where Attila really shines though is its many overhaul mods, perhaps the best mods since Medieval 2 (did I say that there's also a well designed overhaul mod which sets the game during the medieval period?! which is constantly being updated with vast game-changing mechanics and more?!) 
There are a plethera of game overhauls, from one which brings rome 2 campaign into the game (plus some neat tidbits not avalble not present in rome 2) through the early renaissance, and also fantasy mods such as GoT and LOTR.

Not only is the dark and apocalyptic setting seriously fun and challenging, but also the new mechanics such as hordes and settlement razing bring a real survival game feel which I personally love. You can go straight for the Western or Eastern Roman Empire (for a new player I’d suggest the East as the West tends to get hammered very easily if you don’t have a plan in place) which is a great fun, albeit long and challenging campaign. Expect to grit your teeth with frustration as ‘barbarian’ factions decide to raze yet another of your settlements to the ground, or a pretender state decides to set up their own annoying little empire in Gaul or Spain, which makes the revenge you enact on them so much sweeter as you perhaps catch their two main armies in a mountain pass in northern Italy for a cataclysmic (and often hideously violent) battle. 
Or, an equally fun option, you can gun straight for a so-called barbarian faction, which is what I did when I started. The epic exodus of the Goths, Vandals, Suebi and Alans has a fantastic appeal, and you really feel the horses of the various steppe hordes breathing down your neck as you flee into Roman territory. These guys are a pretty fun way to start out as if you want to play it safe you can flee to the hills of Spain or coast of Africa and hide from your nomadic pursuers. 
The Huns do bring genuine terror to the game. The new voice acting, the entirely new units, new war horns, everything about them is new to Total War and I love it. The start is a bit precarious as you muscle your way through other competing steppe rivals and angry Slavic warlords, but once you have subjugated these peoples the fun really begins. There’s a lot of fun to be had razing Rome to the ground, as your enemies heavily-armoured infantry and cavalry simply can’t catch your hordes of mounted archers. 
All theatrics aside, this game is a masterpiece in my eyes. Of course it has its faults; too many units on the field tends to cause some stuttering; public order, food and squalor penalties are fairly hardcore (part of the survival element) and some of the Germanic factions tend to be a bit repetitive in their units, but with the wealth of mods out there some unit diversity is only a few clicks away. 
It’s just a very satisfying game that has provided me more fun campaigns than any other Total War. The DLCs are well worth it as they are a massive step up from the lacklustre DLC of Rome II.
TL;DR: cannot recommend highly enough. Epic storylines just waiting for you to create. Sandbox Total War with more fire.",1629447834,1629447834,True,34,2,0.772100150585174561,0,True,False,False

Every great thing about past games got cranked up to 11... including difficulty, if you are a beginner and came over from past titles, I recommend not playing roman factions and instead start with barbarian kingdoms i.e saxons,franks,langobards etc.

The learning curve isnt as challenging as the community says it is, you could get the hang of the mechanics after playing for 20 hours since every faction is very aggresive and you might have to commit to a battle once every turn esp if youre playing WRE(on easy :v).

Overall the graphics are great,gameplay wise its very polished and can compete with current total war games,awesome apocalyptic narrative pushing you to always do anything in order for your faction to survive.

After over 900 hours playtime I am still coming back to restore the Roman glory and giving some light and hope to the turbulent years of the Migration Period.

As I almost always play as Western Roman Empire (WRE) or Eastern Roman Empire (ERE) on the legendary difficult settings I am mostly be commenting about them. 

*Strategy spoiler warning*

The gameplay mechanics for TW-veterans are familiar and for the new players they are quite challenging. Playing either WRE or ERE the sheer size of manageable empire is likely too much for the beginner. Starting the game again for the 10th time because the empire is collapsing again is not a failure but a good practice. Because the first 20-30 turns as WRE is stressful and sometimes pure agony even for the experienced players. The first few years you are mostly retreating from Britannia, Northern Gallia, Pannonia and Dalmatia because it generally necessary and gives you time to rebuild your army and finances and the same time you are trying to keep your people from revolting and your African neighbors’ in peace. It’s quite overwhelming. After that it’s just re-conquest and punitive missions against barbarians. The first 20-30 turns as ERE is similarly stressful and pure agony. After beating the Visigoths on the first 1-2 turns you need to dance and bribe to avoid war with everyone at all cost to buy time to (re-)build your strong Empire. Especially when you try to utilize the 5 % interest bonus ERE has. The money is always on the short side at the beginning. After that it’s just keeping the status quo in the west and Total War in the east.

The downside is always the late game. It’s way too easy especially when you compare it to the beginning.

The late game in WRE and ERE are quite similar. After turn 30-40 you are unbeatable and it’s like you have Julius Caesar at the helm. Even if you lose multiple battles or whole armies in a row you can easily rebuild them with your unlimited money. At this point the game starts to get boring but you still go on. Even killing Attila is quite easy and especially after that the late game is just for waiting for the years to pass and conquering some weak opponents.

Even though the game is called Total War Attila I have not played as Attila more than 5 hours. I just do not like the moving city mechanics and raids. Playing as northern barbarians is taxing and slow and playing as Sassanids is way too easy even though you need to keep your allies in check. That’s why SPQR.

Overall I give it 9/10

Longer tl;dr: the game is extremely buggy and poorly optimized, the AI is stupid and they attempt to fix this with heavy handed buffs that are explicit and (more annoyingly) hidden, the gameplay can be random and meaningless, and the endgame is boring.

Laundry list below:

0) AI -- Hidden Cheats
I was going to put this at the end, but since this peeves me so much, I decided to put it at the beginning. Look, if I play on a higher difficulty, I accept there will be cheats like increased income, public order, etc. Sure, sometimes it is annoying to see a one settlement faction field two full stacks, but that's just part of playing on harder difficulties. What I really hate are the hidden buffs like increased battle speeds, the ability to fire at targets just at the edges of their range immediately (it takes my archers 3-5 seconds just to form up, let alone start their firing animations), increased accuracy, melee attack / defence, etc. JUST TELL ME THEY ARE THERE.

1) Crashes
The game has crashed from the start menu after pressing either the play or continue campaign buttons a least a few dozen times. It also crashes while playing the game infrequently, although at a rate much higher than any other game I've played. This occurs both without and with mods.

2) Optimization
The game's FPS drops significantly during battles to levels I've only previously encountered when my wifi disconnects during a multiplayer game. AI turn times at the start take a moderate amount of time, which is worsened to absurd degrees during the endgame. I'm playing Attila with a new-ish computer that can play tons of other high-quality graphic games no problem, and am running a second fan underneath my laptop.

3) Bugs
Endless. For example, the Ollam Ri generated character disappeared from my nobles list (not after marriage). Puppet states randomly end up at war with each other, which is especially annoying when playing the Lakhmids or Sassanids. One time, I had to restart a campaign after my only horde army got stuck within a city's zone of control in encampment stance and for some reason, was not able to change stances to attack. Bugs extend to battles as well; cavalry will slow walk when given the order to attack enemies (yes, they're supposed to be ""running""), units will reorient themselves for no reason, and positioning with right clicks sometimes drags the units into different formations.

4) Gameplay -- Traits and Ancillaries
Trait gaining is extremely random when recruiting new characters (seriously, my new agents are thin skulled, in the family, or have some other major debuff trait at least a third of the time) and remains so throughout the campaign. For example, testing the loot trait using the infinite sack ability, getting down the trait line for a general can take anywhere from 10-40 times. This for a campaign where 4 turns is a year, generals are recruited around ages 25-35, and characters die usually 50+. Both ancillaries and traits are often opaque in terms of how one achieves / gains them.

5) Gameplay -- Tech and Traditions
Minor critique: most tech upgrades are really only about unlocking new buildings / units. I don't understand the random +3% cultural income boosts. Bigger gripe: army traditions take an inordinate amount of time to level through, and a lot of them are useless (wow, +3 morale against Romans!).

6) Gameplay -- Endgame
Incredibly boring, made especially so because of lack of optimization and lag. Before Attila even becomes leader of the Huns, I'm usually in a good position and not too worried about this supposedly existential threat.

7) AI -- Strategy
The AI manages to be both incredibly incompetent and endlessly frustrating, as well as just plain boring at times. There's no joy in going up against Roman spear stack spams, or in seeing war targets being ""mobilized"" against (spoiler: they're not). In addition, the AI only marginally follows the diplomacy descriptions of reliable / unreliable, etc. The AI will sack an enemy settlement, return to their own, and proceed to let the enemy rebuild a full stack in a few turns (just why). I understand AI at current levels will never be able to play like a real player, but surely the AI can be better than Attila's current one.",1625623894,1625726612,False,2,0,0.511135458946228027,0,True,False,False

- stationary testudo, and mobile testudo as well.

The game suffers from the same issues like all other post-Medieval 2 Total War titles. There are shuffling units, weak non-impactful collisions and projectiles, unit with magic abilities, bad AI, lack of multiplayer features and too many underwhelming and tedious battles in campagin mode. The game also has the worst optimisation of any other title in the series, but it can be fixed with certain mods well enough. Why game companies don't just incorporate fixes provided by the community is beyond me.

Most of the game locked behind day one DLC. Thrones of Brittania is looking to be the same as this too just crammed into the U.K. I think the developers need to go back and play their older games. They might realise how far they have fallen. I wouldn't even care at this point if we got a modern game as good as Medieval 2 that had micro transactions. Just make them fun to play!

Gotta say something about my play style and that; i played with the strongest faction in this game and conquered all over the world and after finishing it, I didn't feel the urge to play the other factions. i felt like thats enough.
For me thats the downside of the game cause its not giving you to wonder how is it feel like to play other factions.

The card tells me my Video card is 512 mb of Vram yet it is 8GB. 
There is no unlimited Vmemory option for me. But I figured Unlimited Vram just offloads memory to Ram. Which is bad anyway. 
What fixed it is saying -5000 on settings. This made it 3gb card which is what the game expects.

It's odd but is the state of things. But it says I have 4gb vram now and can actually have textures higher than 240p

Aside from that It's very similar to Rome II With Nomadic tribes now. It's better than Rome II but it's not the best total war imho. Nor is it the worst. 

It's good, nice challenge. But I can't really say it's the most polished TW at all.

It is fun. Do I recommend? Sure but not at full price. 
I look forward to an Attila 2. Hopefully it doesn't feel like a rushed offshoot of Rome 2. Which we all remember Rome II release was over hyped and a bit of a let down. 
This felt like Rome II with new Attila campaign really. 
As mentioned above. Some weird optimizations maybe it can be fixed where campaign map uses low texture resolutions. 

Gameplay is good, new engine is not terrible. But I feel focus was on Visuals on this engine.  I will give thumbs up. Gameplay is there but It's not as good as shogun 2 that is for sure.

UI is worse. Kind of klunky. It looks good. But functionality. Annoying to select and target units. 
Feels near identical to Rome 2. Well it really is Rome2
Rome 1 lets just say people of the Steppes felt. Well.. More Hunnic than in Attila so far. But maybe I need to unlock more units. :)",1622393988,1623053522,True,1,0,0.532374083995819092,0,True,False,False

If you go into this game thinking you are going to steadily build up your cities, expand your territory and fight other factions doing the same things you are going to be disappointed. This is set in the Migration era, agricultural conditions are worsening, hordes assembling and the huns are coming, shit is about to go down. When you start a campaign you need to have this in mind and some knowledge of the real history might actually be useful. You need to be aware of where you are on the campaign map, don't stay put! If you play the romans, priorities! A lot of territory needs to be abandoned initially, you start very overstretched. If you start as a migrator tribe, well, it's in the name, migrate. Think about where you could find decent, fertile land that you might be able to defend and before you get there, sack cities, a lot of cities. If you chose to play he huns think like this - you are the schoolyard bully, beat everyone up an make them pay tribute.

 If you embrace the setting and the chaos, uncertainty and destruction it brings you will have a much better time with this game. As hinted at before, reading up a little bit on the history of the time period and role play somewhat according to it, might help a great deal in enjoying the game, at least thats how I play and I'm having a lot of fun.",1622579368,1622579368,True,23,0,0.700007975101470947,0,True,False,False

Another masterpiece from CA. As a longtime fan of all of the Total war games, I must say that this is a fine, polished successor to the previous games. Although the time period, in my view, is not as exciting as the medieval or roman period, this game was very enjoyable. One of the downfalls is the lack of units that are available, and the generalized similiarities between them. As everyone knows what total war is about, I need not go into the details. Some dissapointments include: 
-Weak victory video
-No assassination videos
-Weak videos in general, if at all.
-Limited unit variation.
-Mods needed include : "" Camera zoom mod, cinematic fighting mod""

I have played many more hours on my brothers account previously and I wanted to give this another chance on my account but after an extremely frustrating defensive coastal siege within which the AI glitched out a couple of boats that were stuck with regenerating ammunition (something I had never ever seen before), pelting my men and refusing to leave the field despite army losses, I felt like it was the straw that broke the camels back. This game is filled to the brim with stupid glitches and bollocks like this, half finished systems and overall feels like a construction site. There is a good game somewhere under all the chaff but the real question is whether you're prepared to put up with the bullshit of a game which has been effectively abandoned by it's developer and not updated since 2016. Another thing to keep in mind is that diplomacy is garbage in this. It's an absolute dumpster fire. Vassals will betray you for no reason, rando factions on the other side of the map will declare war on you, uproot themselves, let their empire fall to bits so they can do a bit of raiding in your territory or sniff out an undefended settlement like a pig searching for truffles. An example of this was Palmyra declaring war on me when I was playing the Saxons. Palmyra lost all their territory just so they could get one or two scraggly ass armies from Syria all the way up to the coast of France to raid 50 pennies before being absolutely annihilated by my angry and bemused Saxons.

I think the intention of this game was to be more of a survival game as apposed to a game centred around empire building but man did they miss the mark. It just boils down to having a map filled with rabid glitchy dumb AI that will find any excuse to declare war on the player no matter how bizarre or nonsensical the situation is.

I would say its better for Rome 2 For extensive List of reasons that would bloat my review into a essay, best summarised: It does what rome 2 does but expands or balances it.
For those who played Rome 2 players/fans, it plays Like Later date Empire divided but More unit variation.  It suffers from serious lack of Optimsation , On GTX 1080 i get around 30-50 fps ultra, On 2080's with I7's builds (7000k onwards) This still gets roughly 60-70FPS average, just a forewarning, And turn times, Can be *UP TO 3 MINS*,But if you dont mind that there great game to be found here.

The whole game has Dark ages within the  Fall of Rome Apocalyptic feel, Everything from half ruined cities to Skinny gaunt looking civilians roaming the streets..Life in tough during Apocalyptic age Of migration . Cities are Shells of there former glory. Caked in a layer in mud and Mould. Rome the Once great capital is in disrepair , Part of the walls Have been repaired with Wooden Palisades, Improved barricades. Rome looks alot Worse for wear, The aqueducts that once brung fresh water Into the city are all but falling apart. A depressing sight. Winters are now harsh and cold. Food shortages and famine are serious issue now.causing crippling public order penalties and army attrition longterm. This likely to time period there was Unsustainable Population size in Age of migration That rome had caused with its Mass scale farming, Trade network of global food trade . that sustained  Millions. When rome fell, So did the Food production market, And farmers were not as needed as A man with sword and spear in his hand. This time is Rife with Banditry, betrayal and Minor nations carving a Name for oneself. . As the climate shifts, land becomes less fertile, forcing you to rejig your production buildings as the game goes on. Agents are hard to come by, but can be absolutely terrifying, even instigating civil wars. Batlles are hugely cinematic  and better and gorier than rome 2's. the Sound design is God tier, Civilains who run out of there homes on fire, Or civilians who fight back with whatever tools they have, and take few numbers out of your weaker auxiliary units / This game is So good for all its new mechanics, Yet many people dont 'click' with it, Due its Hard learning Curve. This is NOT a game you can steamroll. Every Nation is in shambles, Or opportunistic  Raiders and conquers of those Empires that fall. This isnt a time period of Large epic legionaries columns marching through Gaulish Lands In Huge numbers dominating  the field of war. No. this Is a time of petty factions crushing Thy Neighbour Over famines. Emergent factions Reclaiming there lost Pre romano  heritage,culture and Reverting back to the Old ways (Religion revert-ism ,Aka Brits becoming Pagans, or Better and more accurately put The Men of the North who had Landed on England Sands.

It's Total War Game but debatly Hardest one of them all. Due to Survival mechanics and Famines, Plagues and Ruined civilisations falling apart around you. Even conquered land is Shambles. And as story prgoress's you see The once mighty Roman empire all but Crumble to foreigners  and those within the walls of Roman heartland ,This is the 'Dark souls' Of Total war, I would rarely recommend this but Play your first campaign on Easy Difficulty, Fore warning: the game has scripted events, that May cause the death of your whole civilisation and Empire within a few hours in .This is a total war game, But its Hardcore, and Quite Historically Accurate, Its worth Looking up Online about Age of migration What this time period is set in. Honestly Besides it being Un-Optimised . 

Conclusion : This Game is 9.5. AOC/TLR/BAB are only 3 dlc i would recommend, The rest are Unit packs for Multiplayer or Single player Sub nations you may want to play,Ive tried Celts But you can tell they were Not meant to be played On European Stage. as Mid game they too weak, Militia like

Mods; 1212 AD mod, is Basically Medieval 3. I heard many players say its why they got this
Many of mods are no longer supported, Due to Decemeber 2020 Update, For me i like to tweak my game.

I was in high school then, but my parents were not fan of video games that weren't Pokemon, Lego, Animal Crossing or Zoo Tycoon.  I still dearly love those game series, but by the summer before my Freshman year in high school I dearly wanted to play a ""grown up"" series.  Eventually I discovered FoTS through youtube and somehow convinced my father to buy it for me ""Strategy is fine, but I don't want you going anywhere near those shooter games, understand?""  

I fell in love with FotS, but about a month after it released Rome II launched.  I was a stupid noob when it comes to pc games so I was enamored by it, launch ""issues"" notwithstanding.  I must confess I was so excited I even switched my language at the school from Spanish to Latin.  However, I never owned Rome II.  To this day it is not in my account.  Not enough money and nervous parents stopped that from happening.  Then Attila was announced, and I actually had money from my own job and I bought it myself.  And to this day it is among my favorite games I own.

It is set during the 5th century, or ""Late Antiquity"" during the terminal decline of Western Rome and the appearance and rise of the Huns.  Thematically, it has the best mood of all TW, being focused on survival not mindless conquest, and the mildew and decay in the UI is great.  WRE is by far the best TW campaign I have played, it is so different from the expansion of other starts, as you must decide what you are what you are willing to lose, not what you want to conquer.

I can run the game on ultra with 60+ FPS at all times, but the game constantly stutters for 10+ seconds. I cannot figure out what exactly triggers it, but it happens no matter what settings it is set to. I even tried tweaking the .ini files to allow it to use all my CPU's threads - to no avail.

Other than that though, this game is pretty awesome. I only bought it because of the Total War sale right now, as I had avoided it because people said it was problematic. But the DLC and campaigns are really enjoyable. The Last Roman and Age of Charlemagne are super fun, and add new mechanics that are fun to work through. The base campaign also has constant changes/story events occurring so you never get ""too comfortable"" with your empire.

Also, the workshop has probably one of the best mods I have ever played with. Look up Medieval Kingdoms 1212. Realistically, you don't have to look far. It is the top mod on the workshop - and has the same quality and quantity of content that it could be marketed as it's own standalone game.

I would recommend this game just to play MK1212 on it's own - but the base game and DLC are great too. So it is win win.

One of the most intriguing Total War games because the setting is so fluid, and there are macro events occurring that prevent you from playing a set-piece expansion strategy.  Sometimes the best strategy is to up-root your culture and move them to the other side of the map... just like what happened in history.  As Western or Eastern Roman empires you have to play defensively - including trading land or riches to buy off enemies or redirect them.  
Took me a while to totally understand what was going on, since the game is so different from others, and was initially frustrated by the ramp up in difficulty.  But sublimely rewarding once you get used to it.",1621181920,1621181920,True,14,0,0.662019968032836914,0,True,False,False

Really enjoyed the variety of goals and playstyles that each faction has to offer even if some of the smaller ones lack in building and unit options. Specifically enjoyed the initially daunting yet exciting challenge of clinging onto to crumbling WRE, only to emerge later to crush your enemies. Requires both finesse in long-term strategy but also battle tactics.

Having said that, there a few things which could have been improved; diplomacy whilst useful, is lacking in certain options, military allies and vassals can frustrate you, and forcing you to conquer settlements in their groups of threes can be quite hard to navigate once you start to expand.

Still, overcoming the challenges faced by each faction makes the purchase more than worth it.",1620828332,1620828332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can also train Celtic mercenaries. The graphics and music is very nice. The only problem is having to balance sanitation, public order, and food. And hordes in your provenience can affect your food which can cause your food supply to go in the negatives and your units to never fully heal. Snow can affect map movement and slowly kill your armies when you travel (snows a lot). So when being invaded by the Huns, then the picts, and the other European civilizations at the same time is such a bitch because your food is -200 and it's snowing and you can't heal and public order is low so your empire starts to rebel and you start losing settlements.

Honestly I have't started the main campaign yet, I have just played the last roman campaign (DLC) where you get to play as the famous Eastern Roman general Flavius Belisarius to restore Rome and other lands in the name of emperor justinian and I did have a lot of fun.

325610,85602657,76561199121406451,0,11,958,0,661,1617849705,"This is my first Total War game and my first REAL strategy game (not like Polytopia or anything like that), and I'm hooked and impressed. As of writing this review I am pretty new to PC gaming as a whole, and this was the first ever PC game that I bought on Steam. It's a good start to my collection.

First of all, the graphics are great, and while not perfect, still good enough to provide a good experience for any player. Learning the mechanics and gameplay is certainly an uphill battle as there are many stats to keep track of, but after playing for a while (and having more experienced friends), the game becomes fun and can be challenging for newcomers and experienced veterans alike.
 
The co-op mode is, well, okay. Playing this game with a friend isn't the most fun experience, mostly because you both have to be on at the same time at all times while doing turns, which can get boring. I haven't played Head on Head as of right now but I am assuming that it has similar gameplay as co-op. This game is certainly the most fun when playing single player.

There are so many factions and tribes to play as that it would be very difficult to actually finish everything in this game, which is good if you wanna play this game for a long time. The DLC adds many new great stories outside of the Grand Campaign, creating a more finished and better game as a whole.

To conclude, if you are a Roman lover or just a strategy game fanatic, Total War: Atilla is a well made, complicated, and fun strategy game that can keep you playing for hours and even days in your campaigns. I may not be the biggest total war fan or strategy game fan, but this game is certainly good if you're looking for some strategy.",1611983167,1619795499,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I`ve not loved every one of them (mainly disappointed in Troy), so I wont say there aren`t any issues with this game, but it is very good. 

Here`s a quick and simple review

Overall 7/10 I love this era of history so a quarter personal point there. But its good overall and its playable, its not very diverse when it comes to units [Nordic Levy and germanic levy.... my god] but the horde mechanic is nice, with a few modifications to the politics as opposed to Rome II.
 
Graphics 6/10 slight changes from Rome 2 with a gritty look

Gameplay 8/10 playing as a horde is my favorite part and the family tree is great but could be better with a little more customization. It does what it promises as a total war game, and there`s many mods that add new layers to them.

UI 7/10 I like the unit cards and the placement of everything, there is more of the screen that can be seen which is great. but there`s some little tweaks that a few mods fix, notably the zoom distance. 

AI 6/10 Its good but not its greatest strength it just depends on what difficulty your on like on legendary is VERY difficult but on normal its WAY to easy if you want to be challenged play on hard or up. There`s a few mods that have helped here as well.

Sound 7/10 They`re using the same sound files in the same places from Rome 2. Which is ok, but dissapointing. The music is nice though I really like the musical sound track as compared to Rome 2, especially the nomadic peoples throat singing is amazing.",1425267244,1618689914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My Experience: 

Dear God this is one of the hardest total wars I've ever played. Finally... finally beat the game as the Anteans. Took forever. 

First started out near the northeast like all the Slavic Tribes. Then built up my economy and armies for nearly 40-50 turns, whilst doing what I can to stay on the Huns good side. Used mercenaries to high heaven, and eventually started spreading outward. The Huns had decided I was too boring and went South, and I stole one of their women for my generals to force them into being somewhat nice to me. I then took up the Hun's historical job of pillaging and razing and pillaging and razing the barbarian factions, while also keeping up friendly banter with Eastern/Western Rome.

Eventually I had near 30 or so provinces... but decided to give all of it up, as trying to build the Wolf Totem (the way to achieve even a minor victory as the Anteans), was virtually impossible due to how many damn cities/towns/villages were not adopting Slavic Paganism as their religion. Realized that I had basically turned into the Roman empire, and so as to learn from the past and stop the future, I migrated, razing all of my settlements and invaded England before the Vandals or Ostrogoths could really get to me. 

Eventually, after what I dubbed ""The Great Migration, as I pretty much traveled all the way across the sea, I invaded and took over England and Ireland. Fought a civil war along the way, again because of over-expanding like the Roman empire and migrating every army. Some men didn't really like that and decided to leave me to try to reclaim old Antean land. They didn't succeed. Didn't even really have to fight them too much. Most of my allies did that for me. 

But yeah, took over England because it had a source of timber and iron, with bonus lead... These were all the resources I needed for the Wolf Totem. Not to mention it was far easier to manage and bring up the Slavic religion due to my much smaller, yet far more defensible position in Engy. 

But yeah long story short, I got strong, fought disease after disease, over-expanded, decided to leave, The Great Migration, Civil War, Invasion of England, Changed Religion of England and Wolf Totem. Time for a well deserved break.

I had this feeling that the game was somewhat barebones in some ways that was not overwhelming/bad enough to steer me away from it, but was noticeable and annoying.

One major issue that plagued the experience was the seemingly useless/unnecessary variety of units that had identical stats. In other words, the ""variety"" was merely superficial, as units looked different/had different names, but were either identical or functionally were about the same.

Also, a huge annoyance was the seeming futility of ranged units. This really weakened the experience and made the use of ranged units unsatisfying/useless. Removing a core component like this was especially upsetting when so many factions are range-focused (i.e.the Huns). They removed a core part of the game mechanics that has been around since the first Total War game I ever played (Shogun 1, circa 2000-2001)

However, the mod community has done a terrific job of building on the game and incorporating much needed features and tweaks. Age of Charlemagne campaign was MUCH better than the original game, particularly when modded (namely, Radious, cinematic combat, Olympic camera, etc.). 

Overall, I would recommend this (with mods, of course) to fans of the series, ONLY if it is: on sale for $30 or less, OR you are a big fan of the series and have not played this one yet.

      First off, I love this game dearly. A six year relationship I was in ended just about as bad as it possibly could. She ran off with a family friend and it left me devastated. Without the lady around I was able to throw myself into this game (and drink way too much). I didn't care about work or any responsibilities at that time, so I was able to completely immerse myself into this game.

     I played as the Caledonians with a few mods to make the game longer. Divico was my faction leader. Pretty quickly off the bat his son was killed in battle against the Western Roman Empire. We took a city the Romans were hunkered down in (it was a brutal battle) and Divico killed the general responsible for his son's death in one on one combat. They were friends a few years prior. (Man I felt that betrayal and it was satisfying to watch Divico run that sword through him.)

     Years passed afterwards. Divico was infertile and could not have another child (this game has so many cool traits for the characters and infertility is one of them), so I raised a massive army. We navigated the dangerous seas and did a beach landing somewhere in Northern Africa. After establishing a foot hold there, we invaded Italy. It was FREAKING AWESOME. We took Rome and named it after Divico's dead son. That was not enough though. Now it was time to move forward and conquer the known world before Divico's death.

     After conquering 3/4s of the map, Divico realized there was nothing that would ever fill the void within him. So many years had passed with so many dead. His empire was spread thin and so was the loyalty of some of his men. In a brave charge, he sacrificed himself on the battlefield to hold off the enemy while his soldiers could withdrawal in a crushing defeat. Every major engagement in battle had him on the front lines with his men. Right after Divico's death, Attila invaded. My empire crumbled without a true leader and splintered.

      This was the best Total War experience I've ever had. A part of me could relate to Divico's loss and not finding something to fill that void. I learned a lot about myself throughout this grand adventure. Divico's death was symbolic to me and I still think about that character from time to time now years later and everything he represented to me. For that alone, this game will always hold a special place in my heart.

      I highly recommend this game and I hope you have a great experience with it.",1617827433,1617827433,True,36,3,0.721235275268554688,0,True,False,False

The game absolutely sells the hopeless atmosphere of late antiquity. Winters gradually become longer, lands less fertile and enemies become more aggressive. It also has an interesting faction dynamic, where massive empires like the WRE start out big, but in absolute shambles, while other kingdoms or migrators start small and build their way up. In that way factions can play out quite differently, as the Romans you're expected to survive, leave territories that you aren't worth defending in the short term behind until you can stabilize and then take them back. On the other hand with kingdoms you start small and just start expanding, while with migrators you look for a good place to settle in the beginning and on the way sack and plunder settlements until you get there, then use your ill-gotten riches to start your kingdom.

The meh:
While there is a diversity of the way you're supposed to play the game as certain factions, there isn't too much diversity in rosters. There's just way too many factions that are just the same Germanic stuff, but with a few unique units. It would be better if some of them had more identity, like how the Saxons and Vikings have Nordic rosters or how they fixed the Alans from just being yet another Germanic faction into being a cavalry-based faction. The battle AI isn't really too bad, it is aggressive which keeps you on your toes but it has one fatal flaw. It makes the general hang back with no reserves to keep him safe. That makes it easy to snipe him if you have cavalry units. After he's gone the rest of the enemy army suffers a massive morale debuff, so as a result some battles become a bit too easy even if you're outnumbered. Finally, the Huns rampaging after Attila is born is a cool concept that goes into the theme of the game, but it devolves into the same old stack spam where if you kill an army a new one just respawns out of thin air. It was tiresome in Shogun 2 where in one turn clans would just shit out full 20 unit samurai-tier stacks after you defeated their last one and it's tiresome here.

The bad:
Some things seem designed to trap the player into making a mistake. Certain technologies seem tailor made for that. Similarly, some building chains seem not even worth it because they just give too many penalties for too little gain. If they had a niche use I'd understand, but they don't, they are just bad. The game is also poorly optimized.

Should I buy it?
Yes, most of my complaints are about the vanilla singleplayer campaign, but there are some excellent mods that I recommend, in particular 1212AD which is what Medieval 3 should be, if they ever make it.

It lacks unit depth and some factions are really horrible. It's also kinda buggy, especially playing online. It needs a good patch.

The aesthetic and direction of the campaign though is really impressive, it really does portray europe as being in this horrible Dark Age as other factions are going nuts scrambling to find land and the Huns are a ticking time bomb of destruction. It's really fun but it needs a good polish. Age of Charlemagne DLC is good but could be so much better

Wait for it to be on special but please CA do some work on this game. The medieval mod for this game is EPIC though. Got the plucky kingdom of Toulouse clinging on to Montpellier, absolutely epic

Having said all this the game is completely overpriced, the ai is fairly poor even if difficult (just through mass) and CA have done themselves a great disservice with this game",1611090044,1616674290,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although not everything in the game is 100% historically accurate, I feel the different historical facets of the game were adequately researched and implemented accordingly. I was satisfied with the graphical options and settings however I did run into a problem a few times while playing in which some of my game's save files were corrupted. Normally I would brush this off but this happened more than occasionally which was very frustrating because I had to go back a few turns when this happened. Reluctantly, I learned to save after every turn, a minor inconvenience but noteworthy nontheless. This problem seemed to have gotten worse with each subsequent DLC campaign that I played, until the Age of Charlemange DLC was almost unplayable. Don't get me wrong, I love this game and I think anyone interested in this period in late Roman history, and anyone who really enjoys Total War should try this game. But I feel the developers could have put more effort in the coding side of things so as to make this game more playable. Another thing I should mention is that I think all of the factions in this game should be playable, but for some reason aren't (and for some reason seems to be prevalent in all Total War games i've come accross). But of course there are mods so you can go down that route. I found the naval battles to be a little glitchy and in need of more work as well.

+Playing as the WRE feels like you're two steps from collapse and ruin
+Combat is hyperlethal compared to more grindy games like Total Warhammer
+World becomes more chaotic as campaign goes on with the remaining factions being hardened from their experiences (They're still AI)
+Religious chaos is great and hilarious as you see groups take crazy turns sometimes (WRE tends to go pagan when AI because of all their starting buildings)
CONS
-Many of quality of life changes from later games are lacking here, and it hurts (mods can fix some of these)
-Food mechanics make no sense (Province 1 has surplus, but Province 2 next door is in the negatives because no one shares)
-Sanitation was cool idea, but there's a reason later games don't have it.
-Cavalry is horribly overpowered (From my casual experience)

there is  a TL:DR at the end

[b]Campaign[/b]

The campaign is much more in depth and I appreciate the extra complexity in faction and unit management. Now you can control your court and help maintain the balance of power, it is not as complicated as other games but in TW I don't think this matters too much. I really like the food supply and the trading. I like the diplomacy more, now in negotiations you can see why they either like or dislike you, and you can manipulate this to your advantage, but sometimes it can be a bit random.

You can recruit generals, which is a really nice feature, I remember in other total war games the chronic general shortage. You can appoint Governors who are province wide and are not the same as Generals, no more ai auto-manage. I also like the Province system, settlements are organised into provinces, all settlements in a province can be controlled from one screen simultaneously, settlements in a province share things like food, public order and recruitment.

Public order is much better. It is on a scale from +100/-100. When it hits -100 you have a rebellion. Much more predictable and controllable than with previous public order which often seemed completely random. There are other features too like corruption which I like.

Armies crossing the sea, a nice feature now it that armies can cross the sea without having to faff about building and moving a navy to a certain position, you just right click and your army goes in boats by themselves. HOWEVER it does feel this feature is overused, for some factions it does seem a bit stupid. For Saxons, Danes, Jutes.. i.e. raiders I guess it makes sense, but for WRE... not so much. 

Raiding settlements, at least there are a lot of game mechanics for it. However as there are only 3 settlements (or so) per province, and no minor villages to raid a settlement you basically need an army, and once you have an army you may as well conquer the place. This feature could have been nice if they'd thrown a few fishing villages and things in, like the farms or towns in Napoleon, but there aren't any, so raiding is a bit pointless. Because of this Britain falls within the first 3 turns... so no more raiding :( .

Religious differences now have much less effect on the campaign than in Barbarian Invasion, I am a bit lukewarm about this change. It does make it a bit too easy just to steamroll whole regions and not really incur many religious/cultural penalties. I remember in Barbarian Invasion I thought it would be fun to see what converting your religion was on turn 1 would do, constant rebellion, uprisings and circa 2 million denari (thank goodness for cheats) later and I had gone from Pagan to Christian. But now if your Germanic Pagans conquer Latin Christians, there don't seem to really be any penalties, this is further made piss easy by Stonehenge which limits religious problems by 20%.

They have gone for the newer historiography when it comes to fall of Rome, and gone for corruption/food shortage/migratory crisis narrative, I like this change and it is well represented in game.

Compared to the 'original' (Rome: Barbarian Invasion) I think it is an overall improvement. Much more in depth, much more historically accurate (in the way the campaign mechanics work, food, 'invasion' more migration than war). The campaign is much more interesting and engaging  (although this may be because I have decided to fight every battle on map to prevent full stack armies being defeated by 1/4 stack enemies...)

[b]Battles[/b] (Campaign)

The battles are quite good, however there are some unit collission issues still, when a mass of infantry is engaged you do sort of end up with a soup, shield walls do not actually form shield walls (they have gaps), and they fight 1v1, so a lone enemy in your  [strike]formation[/strike]  soup could still take ages to die. The controls are like any of TW game. General skills are nice, however they are a bit tanky verging on OP.

Pikemen are completely OP, hmm I see you have a top level legionary unit... well I have tier 1 pikemen so f*** you.

The auto-resolve feature can sometimes be completely stupid, I wouldn't really recommend using it unless the odds are at least 75% in your favour, or crazy things can happen.

[b]Atmosphere[/b]

The music and visuals of this game are very good, many times it does feel bleak which is very appropriate. They seem to have upped their game on the music front too, it is now much more atmospheric, you can really imagine your Empire is crumbline around you, or that you are a newly established kingdom trying to assert its dominance in a turbulent world. The original Rome had the best music, but I feel that this soundtrack for this game was the best choice. 


[b]Glitches/Crashes/Technical Issues[/b]

I have encounted only one crash so far, apart from that it has been plain sailing.
game can be a bit resource demanding, I would have liked a simplified campaign map.


[b]Conclusion[/b]

I would recommend buying, however it is important to acknowledge the game has flaws, however they are not nearly as bad as the problems other titles had and still have in some cases (Empire, Rome II). Everything seems pretty decent so [b]7/10[/b].",1449023018,1613760298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been five years, I've gradually climbed up to 250+ hours (mostly recently), and I can safely say that this game is a mess. The mess it was meant to be. Sure, there are a lot of issues in the campaign with the AI and the intent vs realization, but it's a game that really does do its job. Playing as one of the Roman factions I told my friend it was like a horror game, and every press of the end turn button was like Russian roulette where all six chambers are loaded with different bullets. It intends to abuse you, and does so brilliantly. 

The pace of this game is much slower than other TW titles, intentionally so, and that really adds to the pressure and also makes you think much more carefully about decisions, as they will haunt you for a much longer period of time. Everything you do must be intentional, and it even on the easier difficulties the game is challenging. 

One downside to the game is that it depends on you to play it properly. There is a right way to play the game, and there is the correct way to play the game. As you scale up the difficulty the difference between the two becomes painfully clear. Especially as the Empire factions such as the Romans and the Sassanids. At the lower difficulties you can, with some challenge, attempt to hold the empires together, manage your economy, and protect the borders as some sort of casual balancing act that is still rewarding for the struggle it puts you through. At the harder difficulties you feel like you really have to make the hard choices leaders of that day and age could not. Abandoning settlements as the Western Roman Empire so that you have less borders to defend, or demolishing all the churches to limit the strain on your coffers. Reviving paganism for the public order bonus. It kind of does a great job showing that if you attempt to play this game with historical accuracy, you're doomed from the start.

That, is why this game is so great. It gives you a historical scenario, and the ability to change it. Through excellent strategizing, brilliant tactics, and cunning policy, you can rewrite the outcome of moments which decided centuries of history.",1461641864,1613559402,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most annoying thing about this game, and there are quite a few things, is the ability of the AI to know exactly where you are weak AT ALL TIMES NO MATTER WHAT. They will send units from the other side of the world and attack the one developing city with no defense, without ever sending units or scouts or anything to that area. It's damn annoying. 

Second most annoying thing, and this annoys me about Total War games generally, is the inability to engage an army that wants to run from you if you don't have a hero capable of slowing them down. At least give us the ability to attack while in the forced march stance at a penalty. Anything is better than endlessly chasing an enemy army that has been fucking with you for the last 10 turns. 

Third most annoying thing is the random AI migrations. After spending a lot of time building up reputation and finally getting a faction to ally and trade with you, they will suddenly, for no damn reason, decide to migrate, abandoning its city, and therefore abandoning the trade agreements you spend dozens of turns trying to secure. 

Finally, if you play this game, whatever you do, don't accept marriage proposals from other factions. Generals and governors and other characters will suddenly become inaccessible to you. Their loyalty will drop, but they will have vanished from your family tree, and therefore there is nothing you can do to stop them from rebelling (and they WILL rebel).",1613407168,1613407168,False,1,0,0.501474142074584961,0,True,False,False

This game is a mixed bag. The gameplay is complicated, between additions to the campaign economy and to the political system; battles have more special abilities than is realistic or fun for me. There's too much micromanagement, and battles feel like a click-fest rather than giving a few basic orders and watching what happens.

This game has the most poorly taught campaign I've seen in the series. I'm a Total War veteran at this point, and it was so unapproachable I put it down for a few years. On top of that, there's no ""standard"" starting faction. The most famous factions are the Romans and Huns. The Roman Empires come pre-built but falling apart, so you have to manage 20+ provinces under pressure from the start. The Huns don't settlements, so their game mechanics are completely different from the other factions. The Sassanid Persians are easier, but are politically complex with the large number of satrapies. Once you choose a faction, you have to manage your budget, your food, your trade networks, your diplomatic relations, your research, your risk of bandits spawning, your people's happiness, your risk of disease outbreak...and none of the AI factions have to deal with any of these things. It just keeps building armies and units regardless of money, never has settlements rebel, etc.

But there are also some unique features that make Attila appealing. The theme is terrific. Attila's Huns invading the Roman Empire signal the decline of Classical Civilization. The destruction is apparent from the opening cutscene. Nearly everything is dark, and what isn't dark is on fire. The music hits the right notes, and sets the stakes at hand and the trajectory of the Western world. When you choose a faction, start with the Saxons or Franks. They are smaller factions with normal gameplay, and you can learn the systems under pressure from fewer directions. When you start playing, go to diplomacy first, sue for peace with all factions, trade with all factions that will do so, and make a non-aggression pact with any nearby trustworthy factions you don't plan on invading soon.

Then build buildings that will balance food, happiness, and sanitation. Once those are safe, THEN you can make money. Then invade at the first good opportunity.

That's all the strategy you need to start. It took me forever to figure out, and I only found the Franks and Saxons at a YTer's recommendation.

Also, the Charlemagne DLC is worth buying, and it's probably better than the main campaign. You might even start with that before attempting the main campaign.

TL;DR:

In summary, it's good. It's a bit over-complicated and completely inaccessible, but if you go in with a guide and choose the right faction, it's fun. Maybe try Charlemagne DLC first because it's simpler and more streamlined.",1612629792,1612629792,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-12 armies that never die belong to huns, you can glitch them by not killing them making them recruit shitty mercs instead of advanced tech god units
-Corruption mechanic (more land you hold less money you make, feels like they didnt even play western rome on legendary, purposely have to lose just to make income making everything you give up just buffer states)

The sieges in this are fun and the mechanics where you can demoralize people by burning down the city during combat is cool. Mods for this game are also really awesome. The base game is just so badly put together. Eastern rome is just as volatile as west and the saracens are argueable the strongest faction due to loyal vassal spam. Frickin ridiculous that one of the strongest things you can do as east is unally the west to avoid getting declared war on.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but seeing as this is the 20-21-22 version of the original, it just really lacks.  The lack of variety of units has been a disappointing for a couple of versions to come out.  

Total War Shogun 1 & 2// Rome // Empire are probably the best IMO.  Warhammer I believe stands on its own because it's a completely separate story, units and so on...  However, MANY of the games are at best a DLC.  Three Kingdoms is ""good"" but again, I feel they keep short changing the consumer.  Shogun 2 is the only one that felt like there was extra creating your character.

The rest don't buy until they're in the $15/$10 and under price point.  

Attila suffers from a poor research and development to better buildings and units.  It's boring and so are any of the units you do upgrade to.  There isn't really any original design to any of the units.  Different factions have some variations but nothing is really any stark difference.  The AI is pretty stupid and predictable and no matter how well you control the Huns, they continuously spawn 3 sets of armies.  No real point in creating peace as they eventually swarm to zerg something.  So it's a constant battle of attrition.  The lack of information in game to bring you out to a browser of whatever wikipedia style information tab is annoying.  Maybe that was developed to save on the bloat of the game, but definitely seems cheap to hover over something and then wait for a window to pop up.  The buildings have absolute musts and I never felt I needed to have ""naval force"".  The limited number of generals kind of just there to inhibit you enough for the AI to be annoying.  The senate/influence/family seemed really optional when in fact it could have been pretty amazing.  Perhaps to have great generals have amazing offspring to conquer later on...  So much more development is potentially there but never takes advantage.  Cities always have a real horrible defense without a general that you have no way of influencing.  I think if I was going to buy a new Total War game, there would have to be some love and care into many of these features and more.  It shouldn't feel like ""skins"" and I would like the world to evovle throughout time to experience a true world history and your ability to influence that story based upon how well or bad you do in history.  If it could only be more dynamic...  Just feels like since 2000, there have been little innovations and as time has gone on there are a handful of noticeable differences. 

Game is really missing some customization, world impact/influence and dynamic play.  I love the series, don't get me wrong, but as a gamer, being objective, I can't say this was a good version of the game.  Found myself really ignoring most of the features and just rolling end term to get to the next upgrade or city siege.",1611621792,1611621792,False,1,0,0.477610677480697632,0,True,False,False

No matter what I do the game just crashes right before I get the victory screen. I have tried everything from reinstalling to updating drivers and software, I even made sure the overclock was running smooth as I thought it was a power issue.

Now Creative Assembly and the whole Total War series is just a cash grab. Sure they update the graphics with every update and they did create the whole real time battle genre but what have you done recently?

I played Troy and it is no different then the last 3 games you have put out. Over powered AI that isn't held to the same standard as the player. Horrible diplomacy that is clunky and completely over handed. Outside the 10 or so building in the game there is no economy and this is a down grade from the number of building they used to offer. Only Troy has tried something different and its the worst system I've ever seen used. Not even to get in to the stupid uber powerful general unit they introduced in shogun 2 and continue to toss resources into like that single feature is worth the 50 dollar price tag, How about the constant DLCs that you now have to buy? Remember when they would just update your game? FOR FREE? 
 
It's sad for me because as a small time company they were 100x better then they are now and though the games still have that shiny core that we all come back to play save your money, buy Medieval 2: Total War the last good game before they decided their player base was big enough to pull every last penny out of us. Why? Because we trusted them, now 10 years later I wish i would have left at Attila.

Yea, reduce that by about half if you're lucky.  I was able to just get by with running it on average at 1920 x 1080 resolution and get 28 FPS with a 1050 ti and an i5 6400.  That should not happen.  To make matters worse, for some reason, when you launch it through the Rome 2 launch app, it gives a 6-7 increase in average FPS.

Add on top of this the identical gameplay of Rome 2, and you see very little has changed in terms of battle-level tactics or strategy, save for the over-powered BS of crossbows, along with the broken siege AI (when they were defending, the AI managed to seal themselves all off in the harbor with a wall...a wall facing them, so when I took the city, I merely lined up my crossbowmen along it and slowly but surely killed every single unit....), and the unnecessarily long turn times and you have a game that's a step back in both design and execution than the previous one.

this is the original. 

(unplayable with bugs. its so bugged i cant even get through the prologue. as soon as i click on a unit everything on the screen(menu, courser, unit colors ect) blinks over and over. cant move the courser cant click cant do anything)

i fixed the game breaking bug and now that its playable i like it. unlike rome 2 you actually have more choices in campaign and that makes a huge difference to me. Also depending on who you play as the difficulty changes which is also refreshing. i think the variety of troop types and the way they upgrade as you research and build is great. the political system starts off kinda complicated to learn and in some ways it stays difficult but in other ways its easy once you learn some tricks. 

i give the base game itself a 7 out of 10. if i didint have to do my own fixes i would have given it an 8. 

some tips with possibly minor spoilers

tip one it will be very hard to fight against the huns so unless you are being the huns or very experienced stay very north or very west. 

tip two, the huns burn down a ton of settlements on their path to rome, save your money and take advantage you can hold the line build your wealth and forces keep spies on them and then rapidly expand. (unless your looking for more of a challenge of course.)

tip three the auto resolve battles are not as easy as in rome 2 they are more like the previous games before that and can unexpectedly sway in a good or bad outcome so if its close or even match its best to just do it yourself.",1609995056,1610474864,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are severe balancing issues with the game which I'm sure can be fixed with mods, however it's sad that the only way I can play Total War games these days is with mod overhauls.
It's not a bad game, it's just the same game, it's fun, if you liked Rome 2 you'll probably like this. 
If you can get it on sale I'd recommend it otherwise it's not worth more than $15.00.
Still better than that warhammer rip off.

Attila, to me is the only total war game I have played since Medieval 2 where I can see the glitches really affecting the gameplay.

This may just be the best historic total war ever. 

Nothing screams survival RTS, like a norse faction having to get in their boats, sack Londinum for ""gas"" money, and resettle in Africa. I did cause someone to do that BTW. A shame people back then didn't have Greta Thurnberg to warn them of the climate-change, otherwise people wouldn't have to pitch up horde-camps in my fertile southern provinces.

Now granted i bought the whole game at a steam winter sale (incl all dlc's) for like 20 bucks and haven't regretted buying one bit. This game despite its age, holds up really well along wth Rome 2. Although this game has something that Rome 2 doesn't. The Medieval 1212 mod :P Jokes aside, this game has some advantages, first of all its graphics are still top notch compared to other historical!! total war titles. Its in game engine along with a fully fleshed out family tree makes you care for your characters. Ifound myself playing as the WRE actually struggling to keep some of my family members alive for marriages or for their abilities. Also another big thing, marriages are ever present. Trying to find a suitable bride/groom for your family to marry into was quite a challenge because more often than not, i would find this excellent bride that had the positive traits that i was looking for only to realise that she belonged to an enemy faction. So i would shape my playgame accordingly as to please my sworn enemy into marrying her. Another big thing was the climate change that they introduced. Ok, i would be a liar if i say that i haven't used any mods for this thing, because in vanilla after some turns it gets ridicullous, but the whole concept of that is so interesting that with the right kind of mods it is actually really fun. Some of the problems that Attila has, are some of the lifelong problems of CA. Some factions may feel like a copy/paste of other larger ones and generally not offering anything new to the game. Most faction other than WRE or ERE have a similar playstyle. I would love for CA to make a dlc offering some new units replacing some of the stock units for every faction giving some of them a unique flavour. There are many things that CA can add to this game, drawing inspiration from the unique playstyles and units they introduced in warhammer series that i believe one or two dlc offering new units to replace some and adding some challenges to each faction would really skyrocket the game, especially now that it has come int spotight again. To sum it up, with a few mods to make up for any little inconviniences this game has me coming back and enjoying every campaign that i choose to play.",1609496461,1609496461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Poorly optimized. Low-end machines won't survive. I have a RTX 2070 and I'm still getting 50fps.

Modding is unfriendly, everything is encrypted and the tools that we are given are locked, meaning (no new world maps, no siege maps) the best can be done is reskinning the units.

The campaign NPC is potato dumb, you end up holding off dumb hordes of NPC while they bottle-necking on 1 of your units, and the rest of your army flanks for easy kills. This done over, over and over. After your 10th battle it feels soulless. (And I am on my 300th battle...)

higher difficulty settings give cheats to the NPC, not making them smarter but boringly overpowered

Gameplay wise, Attila is an evolution of the mechanics introduced in Rome 2 but the ambience has changed from the sunny mediterranean days with colorful battlefields and soldiers to a more darker tone with drab uniforms and darkness and destruction in the wake of Attila the Hun.

Take a little time to mod the game, and the game becomes amazing.

+Great visuals, if you have a PC that can handle it.
+A variety of good mechanics.
+Real time strategizing found in no other strategy game series.(None that I know of at least).

-Few frustrations here and there.
-Could've been optimized a little better.

Overall a very enjoyable experience.
You definitely won't regret it if you're a fan of the Total War series or a devout believer in Tengri.

Attila has it's advantages over other Total War titles, but at the end of the day it's very underwhelming and doesn't do Total War justice. Granted though, it's nothing to the horrible level of Three Kingdoms or Troy.

[h1] What I Noticed: [/h1]

[b] Graphics: [/b] The visual look of the game is for sure an upgrade. The only exception being ugly view distance making the horizon or your regiments of units look like twigs and stick figures. Optimization however was atrocious. It seems that CA gave up on trying to fix their issue (if they even tried at all), as they've had 5+ years to do so. You'll get constant FPS drops in battle when all video settings are turned to the max, regardless of your PC's capability.
[b] Voice Acting/Audio: [/b] I really liked the small ambient details put into the atmosphere. When in battle, your troops will make various comments based on what you're doing or what's going on around them. The voice acting was overall pretty good; close to the level of Medieval 2, but no cigar. Arrows made a pretty decent noise when shown to impact troops. The music however was nothing special and practically just a background filler. Gone are the days of Jeff van Dyck and his amazing soundtracks.
[b] Combat/Animations: [/b] The fighting animations for units was... pretty horrible to say the least. Soldiers in Medieval 2 showed enthusiasm and involvement in the battle while soldiers in Attila just try to lightly poke and prod at each other every now and then. It made my immersion in the battle pretty weak. I also noticed units clip into the ground on uneven terrain. Of course, they massacred the visuals of the ranged projectiles making them look like wet noodles slowly flying through the air. Turning off the wet noodle effect only made it impossible to see where the arrows were going. The shooting animations for crossbowman looked like they weren't even complete. They would just look around their shoulder every two seconds, fire off a shot, do an instant reload, and then rinse dry and repeat the cycle.
[b] Campaign/UI: [/b] I could not wrap my head around the new campaign user interface. It was not very simplistic and everything was shoved into the corners of the screen. Not to mention that when you click on the report of a major/important event, an obnoxiously loud and long gong sound will play for every single one.

TL:DR: This isn't the worst Total War but it sure isn't even close to the best. It's clear not much effort was put into this game and it severely missed the mark as a result. What's even more clear is that CA didn't learn from their mistakes and continued to make them in future Total War entries, time and time again. Not to mention Blood and Gore is a paid DLC.

Whether you decide to play the Western Roman Empire or the Eastern Roman Empire, the vulnerability of both factions provides you with constant struggle and entertainment, especially when the namesake of the game decides to show up with several twenty-unit armies.

I even bought it twice because Steam refused to recognise my first purchase after they closed my second channel. The subject, the era of the Huns and the downfall of the Western part of the Roman Empire has a lot of drama and a lot of appeal. The graphics are nice and the dynastic model a good addition to the subject. But there is a downside. Even on easy it is almost impossible for most players to win if you play East Rome or West Rome . Because the AI cheats like hell. To have a biased and cheating AI is acceptable if the producers of the game are open about it. But are they? I haven't found anything in that respect. Cheating means to be able to field troops in quantities that do not correspond to the potential of the realm. The Sassanid Empire is such a case. Or to have generals with superior experience. How is this possible if that realm did not  take part in any wars? Or to win a naval battle as a landlocked tribe without any navy but some rickety barges fighting against a professional high tech navy? Unfortunately there is no link between recruiting pool (which should be limited as manpower is a scarce resource) and fielded armies. No link between training troops and fielding them. Surely it is impossible to produce trained units of soldiers without taking time to train them? Instead the script of the game producer relies on endless waves of troops, some of them almost unkillable (Hun cavallerie not dying despite charging into walls of spears). On battle maps that never change, as if one city was an exact copy of another.

TW: Attila is worth getting for the Age of Charlemagne DLC alone. Even then, the Grand Campaign, although grindy and uneventful at times, offers some enjoyment and is a huge timesink if you got days to waste.

Above all, TW: Attila succeeds where Rome 2 and Thrones of Brittania fails. It doesn't waste your time with meaningless, bloated hindrance mechanics. Instead, it wastes your time with trying to keep your faction afloat and relevant on a hostile campaign map.

It is a great game, highly recommended, if you're a Total War ""collector"", buy it on sale and play it, you'll love it. Attila is one of the best iterations of a Total War game since Medieval II and it feels like it has that depth, strategically it's very similar (infantry, archers, horses, artillery) and city sieges once more have an epic and rewarding nature, especially if it was a hard-fought victory where you employed some clever tactics. Or if you accidentally set the town on fire... The battlegrounds are one of the highlights of the game, the scenery is truly beautiful at times, especially when the weather's at play and there's plenty of variety. The details on the ground are also great, I often found myself just looking around a town, trying to see what buildings have been put up.

On the campaign side of things, the map looks great and the weather effects are good, there's also a lot of detail that you might not spot until the end of a campaign. The Faction mechanics is okay, a lot of advantage can be gained if played correctly and the character levelling was well done. The spies, priests and heroes are very useful as always, a bit of a frustration though is the very low limit on the number of agents you can recruit. Province and city management is good and there's a lot of different ways you can specialise towns and cities to focus on military, commerce, culture, agriculture, etc. and boost output by adding buildings with certain ""combo"" attributes. Food plays a very important role in the game and it adds an interesting aspect to the gameplay. Diplomacy is decent and it feels for once that your allies are actually useful. So why don't I ever want to start a new campaign in this game? Because it takes a very long time to play through and when I'm busy with a campaign I don't want to play any other game, and that bothers me. One of the best parts of the game, the management, ends up being the one thing that frustrates me about it, but while I write this, I know I will play this again one day, when I've forgotten how I felt and remembered how gritty and enjoyable this is.

Gamey missions appear out of thin air. Do this and get 5000 gold and do that to gain 10 000 gold. No story telling or immersion at all. The game punches you in the face, not just once, but keeps on hammering that this is a zero brain gamey game. The devs keep on failing. It is hard to understand how they can fail when they made these things right in the earlier games. They had ready made working concepts, but they just threw them all away. Of course the characters level up again in the Rome 2 way where you have the extra gamey system to choose the skills from. In the older games the characters were interesting and would develop based on what they were doing instead of this awful gamey level up and choose skills system where you just min max the characters.

It's been over ten years now. Create a tool that would help us with this problem or stop using third party software to make the maps. In reality this is done by them on purpose. Because they know you wouldn't even bother to buy any new campaign DLC if modders could make new maps for free. That is the hard truth about this situation. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 10$ for factions that should have been included and playable at the launch of the game ? You are blood sucking leeches. In this day and age CA is basically a group of greedy no talents that get paid to think of new ways to suck your blood without having to put much effort into the job.

This game is in its core a unique TW experience. For most factions its not so much about building up huge empires but to survive the next winter. The horde-function really helps playing the great migrations that took place at that time. Also the missions ordered to you let you kinda replay your chosen factions history.

It seems that this game is harder than the other TW titles. I would like you to play as the Vandals - survive the onslaught in central europe, travel through spain and set camp somewhere in the mediterrean and conquer some roman provnices.

after buying the expansion for Al-andalus as a muslim Arab It got 500% better for me (relatability I guess) is key in these games
this is why medieval 2 is my favourite 
what I wish they would improve is the UX which is seriously bad and over the series they just dont get better 
a simple example is when your empire get massive you dont even have a menue to know what your building you have to go to each city on its own 
same as the family tree if it grows you .. its just unvewable .. absurd menu you have to go right and left and memorize their names to be able to do anything or just lose the family features and its purpose which I suppose is 99% for gamers who dive deeper into the game and get massive empires

And I've purchased every historical period they have produced.  I appreciate the changes they've made in Attila with the horde and razing game play, but it has made me more keenly aware that it is time for the Total War series to innovate their maps, as they did with their battle graphics, to allow for more interaction and development everywhere on the map.  This would give the map greater historical and game play richness with small villages, forts, towns, sea ports and cities growing and being destroyed through time, rather than this none changing grid system.  It would be far more exciting if capitals and important sites, such as religious centers changed with cultures and eras.  Also making the map features, such as forests, swamps, rivers, lakes, mountains, deserts give bonuses and negative resources to these map developments.

It has a lot going for it, taking the framework of Rome 2 (Which was dismal on release but eventually reached the giddy heights of basically ok), and sets itself at the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It does feel somewhat reminiscent of the old expansion pack for Rome 1, although more like a full fledged game rather than a mere expansion. It has a lovely dark colour palette, some amazing fire effects, and a lot of effort has gone into fleshing out the various factions. The Sassanids in particular feel a lot more like the rival empire they are supposed to be and less like a tiny faction struggling to survive at the edge of the map. Sieges are decent, you are actually reliant on siege engines and can't just swarm the walls with every infantry unit you have (please stop giving every infantry unit invisible ladders CA, it makes walls irrelevant) and even have random civilians running around throwing rocks at the invaders. The whole tone feels darker, and you even have to deal with a cooling climate on top of everything else. On a whole they have tried to make it a lot more interesting experience than the previous game. But maybe that's where the issues start.

Rome 2's biggest issue for me was that it was far too easy. It seems that once you get to a certain point fairly early in the game, you have reached critical mass and no other faction in the game can ever meaningfully threaten you again. You essentially become the order tide from warhammer 2, and the game turns into a ""paint the map"" simulator as a result. Attila seems to have been designed with the intent to counteract this, and they seem to have swung too far in the opposite direction, with pretty calamitous results. There are the Huns, but I'll save them for later, my biggest issue is actually the management. It legitimately feels as if the entire settlement management system has been reworked to stifle growth and to slow down the player as much as possible. Settlements don't have very many build slots, and almost every building that you can build will give you a negative buff, consuming food, upkeep or leading to squalor. The small number of build slots means that it's quite difficult to balance these effectively, and even in the event that you do you are going to be extremely limited in what else you can build. Buildings have obscenely long construction times. Public order seems to be particularly hard to manage (This issue was also very prevalent in thrones of Britanna for a long time) and this results in a vast amount of the game being you simply sitting your armies in a settlement, sometimes for twenty to thirty turns waiting for public order to stabilise, before briefly hopping out to fight a battle or two before turning tail and running for home. If you actually do manage to conquer a region, prepare for even more sitting around consolidating. There's always been an element of this in most total war games, but it feels like it's taken much too far in this one. I attempted a campaign as the Irish, and after conquering britain in the first 5 hours spent the next 10 sitting there doing nothing but maintaining public order and waiting, either for population to grow enough to build something, or for a plague to go away so I can actually move my army. End turn and loading times are obnoxiously long, either due to CA not wanting to invest time patching an unpopular game, or because Deathmaster Snikitch is in no hurry to deliver a potion of speed to the Ro-man things! Let them die-die! I think I fought maybe two battles in 7 of these hours, the last three were spent with the game's other big issue.

The huns. I hate Huns. My Father hated them too, even before they put out his eyes. 
The Huns are the midgame crisis (The endgame being the Sassanids and their twenty vassals who don't get attacked by the Huns and so always survive, then devour most of the map), and I hate their implementation with a flaming passion that outmatches that of Attila on his wedding night. Remember the Warriors of Chaos, and how easy it actually is to defeat them? Well whoever designed the Huns thought it would be a sterling idea that, every time you destroy a Hunnic army, a fresh one will appear where it died the next turn. Stop, read that again. I wish I was joking. Kill the Hun, another identical hun appears where he dies. If that didn't already sound stupid enough, they also stop your troops replenishing when you are in their provinces, so there is seemingly very little point in fighting them at all, as you get very quickly worn down whilst they take no damage whatsoever. The only reasonably safe strategy is to defeat their armies but not destroy them, but CA also decided to give the Hunnic units absurdly high morale (as well as many giving your own units fear penalties) so this is a lot easier said than done. Even then the tattered army will only slink off, hire mercenaries and come for you again. The only way to beat this is to either pick Attila out of the 12 or so stacks and kill him four separate times (he can be assassinated some of these but not all) or hope to outlast him. Or play as the Sassanids who don't get invaded, have a sanitation bonus that means they are a lot less pemalised when expanding, so just sit on your backside then steamroll the ruined map. Needless to say it is the very definition of artificial difficulty, and it means even if you can get through everything else you get nothing but a very absurd and arbitrary challenge, and surviving it means nothing but getting steamrolled by the Persians.
So, in conclusion, of all the total wars, do not touch. It's the only one which I can tar with the dirtiest brush available to me as a random joe who writes reviews about games he plays. It's boring. The combination of the sitting around and the long turn times make it a chore to play, and the mid and end game just add nihilism and almost inevitable defeat, so you can suffer through all of that boredom for nothing.

However, I will say, the two DLC campaigns are legitimately quite good. If per say, you were to get it on sale to play the last roman or the excellent christopher lee simulator, that would justify the purchase. Stay safe fellow romans! It lives on in our hearts!

There just doesn't seem to be a point. They took Rome 2, which while not perfect was at least visually appealing, and made it a drab and dull experience. I mean, even the pictures of all the buildings basically look the same. 

Usually with a new-to-me TW game I choose one of the factions with an ""easy"" start position to sort of get the feel for the game. So, first time through I picked the Visigoths, and started working my way west to work on my faction objectives ... and learned the hard way that there is no point in doing anything with the horde mechanic, because any money and time invested in hordes disappears once you settle. Other horde factions start settling everything in sight, and you start to suspect that the AI plays by vastly different rules than you, because you can barely afford the cash to do anything. (This was on normal/normal difficulty too.) I was doing OK but got so bored that I basically just ended up fighting everyone around me and then quit.

So, then I thought maybe playing a horde as the Huns was where the fun must actually be in the game, but I found this even more boring. There is no real objective except burn down everything. It seems that whenever you get to a settlement, some other faction has already sacked/razed it and even if you do get to sack something for the first time, there is very little money gained. You can subjugate other tribes but the cash you get is minimal and they rebel after a short time anyway.

Every single battle is you attacking a settlement. It's extremely repetitive. 

I'm sure I will force my way through a campaign at some point, but really... with how much fun Warhammer is, it's hard to justify playing this.",1604279229,1604279229,False,0,1,0.497794896364212036,0,True,False,False

the battles are short, path finding is horrible, sieges are way better though, unit rosters are very smaller and feel samey, armies are hard to move around the battle field, units have no semblance of order or formation, the music is ether throat singing or something else --in that they really captured how bad it is to live in late antiquity-- with the roman empire being an empire of rust.

i think it comes down to the Time period it is depressing for Roman history buffs as it is in the time where Romans stop being cool and the ""germs"" are invading every where, the lack of roster variation is one of it's week points as there are very few factions playable and otherwise. the age of Charlemagne is good though, the Huns are very hard to deal with. in conclusion the game is an inflated mess of a Rome 2 DLC",1588192743,1604208517,False,1,0,0.490837693214416504,0,True,False,False

1. Poor optimization. I was playing this with a GTX 1080, so i didn't noticed much, but when I tried to run this on my old computer (with 32 GB RAM and a GTX 780) I got 14 FPS on medium settings, I get 34 FPS on total war three kingdoms on the same 780, and very fluid FPS with Shogun 2 or Empire.

2. No MOD support on Linux. Feral, that usually delivers, didn't go the extra mile on this one, so there's no launcher or Mod support on Linux.

Other than that, I really like this game. There are some complaints on balancing and on the Huns invasions, but all in all is a solid entry in the Total War series. Far from being my favorite though.

The biggest issues i faced in this game were the campaign mechanics and design. Specifically with siege battles. Every city no matter where you were in the map took one of 3 layouts, to go along with this, no matter the difficulty, the computer took the same battle strategies every time.  It made the game boring and repetative because all you had to do was follow a basic strategy and your garrison army of 360 people could beat virtually any army size numbering upwards of 2000. (if you are wondering, set up shield walls infront of towers, the enemy rushes in 90% of their units into that one spot, your shield wall doesnt move, the tower kills literally hundreds of them, then just send one calavry unit around to flank the back of their force and you route/kill them all. ) it got to the point where i simply no longer wanted to play siege battles anymore. I either autoresolved and had an overwhelming loss, or play the same battle that for 1000th time and win but literally get zero joy or entertainment from it.

There's a massively game-breaking bug that makes buying the game irrational and counterproductive: After a certain, and varying, amount of turns, the game CTD's during loading a save. AND it's *permanent*, so the savegame is just lost. To me, it happened between turn 204 and 205, and corrupted both the autosave and the regular save. Playing as Persia, having just beaten both the Eastern Roman Empire and the Huns, and getting ready to play around in the post-Hunnic world, it was really, really frustrating to not be able to load that game I've devoted so much time to.

Lemme explain. So this game is Rome 2 but uglier and a little worse. Everything just looks gross and muddy, stuff can be hard to see, like everything in this game just looks kinda dark grey. if I couldn't highlight my units in bright yellow with the spacebar, I might just not be able to see them. The unit cards are nice and realistic, but I prefer the Rome 2 unit cards with their simplistic and easy to understand style (although I understand that that's a thematic thing). It's just gross to look at. On top of that, the gameplay feels a little worse. Not a lot, but a little. Like, they rebalanced a lot of stuff, so like newer and more expensive troops will pretty much always beat older and cheaper troops. Now, you may say ""cool, that makes sense, that checks out, that's aces and a-ok by me"" and I'll say ""no shut up"" because the thing about Rome 2 was that it was about strategy in battle. If you have weaker troops, you can still defeat the enemy, you just gotta think bigger thonks.  If you walk into battle with weak troops, but position them really well, or set up a trap, or a flanking maneuver, or just manage to bait them into a stupid attack, you could still win. I remember playing Attila at one point, and I had four units of spearmen completely surrounding a single, weakened enemy unit, and that enemy unit managed to beat them all. That should not happen. Like, I could make the realism argument that no army, no matter how well trained, can survive being outnumbered 4 to 1 and surrounded on literally all sides, but I won't make the realism argument. That's just bad gameplay. I didn't click the right clicks for the stupid game so my superior strategy didn't work. Whoops. Shoulda researched pointier sticks... i guess. 

So, why did I give this game a thumbs up? Well, honestly, because it's still good. I've been comparing it to Rome 2 this whole time, but that's just not fair for me to do. Rome 2, if you ask me, is when Total War peaked. But Attila is still good. It's still fun. It's a different kind of fun that puts focus in different things, but it's still better than most strategy games. It has good mod support with stuff like 1212 AD (please CA make medieval 3 I just want medieval 3 is that so much to ask) and they fleshed out things like the family tree a lot better, and I still have fun playing it from time to time. It's just... when I play this, I keep asking myself ""man, why am I not playing Rome 2?""

Insipid victory conditions

Its popularity has sadly been hampered by the distrust caused by Rome 2's disastrous launch, coupled with clunky optimization and lazy design choices.

Rome 2 has been chosen by Creative Assembly to be the DLC cash cow for historical Total War fans, but the much stronger fundamentals of Attila make it a much better vehicle for profitable DLC content (e.g. the Age of Charlemagne DLC), if only they appointed someone to work on minor updates for Attila.

There's a reason the Rise of Mordor mod is being made for Attila, not Rome 2. Just like the Medieval 1212 AD mod (which you might as well call Medieval 3, at this point). Hell, even classical antiquity is funnier to play in Attila thanks to the Ancient Empires mod (yes, even better than Divide et Impera for Rome 2; fight me, plebs).

I did not enjoy it in the beginning due to the complexity but once you learn how to play it is very addicting. If you want to play as either the WRE or ERE and are new to TW Attila, I recommend starting the Last Roman expansion first. You don't have to worry about city management and can just focus on the basics of running an army and fighting battles. 

I am going through a WRE campaign now and like how the difficulty keeps the campaign from being a simple map-painting exercise. When you take over in 395 AD the cities are underdeveloped, armies poor quality and understrength, the emperor is a chump, etc. Meanwhile your enemies are ready to bumrush and take advantage of your weaknesses. It reflects the period well where various tribes saw the weakness of the Romans and sought to exploit it. I am used to playing games where the Romans are the strongest but here you find other factions have more numerous and better quality troops in the beginning. You have to work hard to improve your military technology to get better units. Even your maxed out units are not best in class (found that out the hard way when my Herculani Seniores tried to fight a few Uar warriors straight up). You have to rely on tactics such as defensive formation, picking the right ground to defend a settlement - Hint... try to limit the directions from which the enemy can attack, and using combined arms tactics with your archers. I found the large onagers and ravenna elite crossbowmen a bit OP though.

Managing the military and social challenges is difficult enough but then Attila spawns with what seems like a million stacks of high-morale, high-quality troops. Europe also undergoes a climate change event where provinces produce less food. All of these obstacles make completing a campaign feel like a minor accomplishment even though it's just a video game haha. I think TW did a solid job covering Late Antiquity which is a very underrated time of history imo.

The only criticism I have is that the battle AI can be very dumb even at the higher levels. I have won many battles due to luck where the AI failed to flank my outnumbered forces and simply charged head on.

- Yes this game feels like Rome 2.5 being built on the same engine with more or less the same assets. Yet there are many improvements in both land and naval battles and all nomadic factions have been significanly reworked. Playing as the horde or a migrating nation is a completely new total war experience.
- The campaign's atmosphere is unique, not at all like in Rome II. The Hunic horde is a real menace for every faction close to them or every bigger empire. You will also feel the slow descent of the world into darker and filthier times, as sanitation gets a greater role here and fertility level of the provinces will decreese over time. Yet again, I am forced to give the atmosphere 4/5 for female warriors implemented into the units. This time there are no purely female units, rather they have made some units mixed. I cannot consent to this in a historical game. But again I have to thank CA for allowing mods. Yes, many factions play similarely as this is reality not a fantasy game with mummies and lizard-people, but their starting conditions and location on the map with a combination of the unique traits make for a fun experience with all of them.
- The politics are similar in some ways to Rome II, but the political positions have been redone in more logical and fun way. Character leveling has also been made more comprehencible.

- The DLCs are awesome. The Last Roman and Age of Charlemagne are the best DLC content for a Total War ever.",1587906669,1601325273,True,2,0,0.526066362857818604,0,True,False,False

The castle sieges and custom battle combat is very very fun and it allows you to use your imagination to have any sort of siege or battle. I personally love the Fall of the Roman Empire period and the dark ages. The campaigns are ok but they are far harder and complicated than most Total Wars I play.  The DLC are a little disappointing because all they bring in are different factions, however a must for Attila is the Charlemegn campaign (Sorry for my peasant spelling). The factions are new and unique and the campaign is unrelated to the main game feeling like you are playing a different game. The worst and most expensive and pointless is the Last Roman campaingn. It only brings in one new unit not kidding one unique unit and the campaign is kinda lame too.

Táto recenzia je v Anglickom a Slovenskom jazyku:

Most games in the Total War series are very similar and have many positives and negatives in common. In my opinion, Attila is the best in the series, but the potential of the game is much greater and the game contains a few bugs and unintended things. The worst thing is the faulty mechanics of the game, which after the defeat of the Hun tribes immediately at the beginning of the next move will create a new fully armed army not far from the place of crushing defeat. I understand that Attila is a major part of the game, but the mechanics should either create an army in another remote location or create only a small and weak Hun army nearby. The historical significance of Attila is quite overestimated, because despite the enormous footprint they have left in history, they have spent most of their existence with only a small plunder of weaker opponents. Moreover, it was an ethnically diverse conglomerate of nations, where the Huns formed only a small socially dominant part. Additional campaigns purchased with downloadable content are even worse than the main part of the game in all the shortcomings mentioned. Downloadable content is not as expensive as other games, but its content are parts that I think should be part of the basic game (especially playable fractions). The company's policy in the Total War series is another reason not to buy any of their games. A series of Total War games has turned into a breeding farm! One game is not finished, it is full of mistakes and imbalances, but the company is already starting work on another game and no one will return to the previous one to fix it.

Väčšina hier zo série Total War sa na seba veľmi podobá a majú mnoho spoločných pozitív aj negatív. Attila je podľa mňa najlepší zo série, ale potenciál hry je oveľa väčší a hra obsahuje niekoľko chýb a nedomyslených vecí. Najhoršou vecou je chybná mechanika hry, ktorá po porážke Hunských kmeňov okamžite na začiatku ďalšieho ťahu vytvorí novú plne vyzbrojenú armádu neďaleko miesta zdrvujúcej porážky. Ja chápem, že Attila je hlavnou časťou hry, ale mechanika by mala, buď vytvoriť armádu na inom odľahlom mieste, alebo vytvoriť blízko len malú a slabú armádu Hunov. Historický význam Attilu je dosť preceňovaný, pretože aj napriek obrovskej stope, ktorú v dejinách zanechali, väčšinu svojej existencie strávili len drobným lúpením slabších súperov. Navyše išlo o etnicky rôznorodý konglomerát národov, kde Huni tvorili len malú spoločensky dominantnú časť. Dodatočné kampane zakúpené v rámci stiahnuteľného obsahu sú ešte horšie ako hlavná časť hry vo všetkých spomenutých nedostatkoch. Stiahnuteľný obsah síce nie je drahý ako pri iných hrách, ale jeho obsahom sú časti, ktoré by podľa mňa mali byť súčasťou základnej hry (najmä hrateľné frakcie). Politika spoločnosti v rámci série Total War je ďalším dôvodom, aby ste si žiadnu ich hru nekúpili. Séria Total War hier sa premenila na rozmnožovaciu farmu! Jedna hra nie je hotová, je plná chýb a nevyváženosti, ale spoločnosť už začína pracovať na ďalšej hre a k predošlej sa už nikto nevráti aby ju neopravil.",1549910415,1598958136,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Recommend giving a different Total War a go first. This one can be a little spammy, and pretty gruelling - the campaign takes no prisoners. Try Rome 2 if you liked the visual style of this game but want a more rounded strategy experience, or Rome 1 / Medieval 2 if you want the absolute best of strategy this brand has to offer and don't care too much about the game being graphically impressive.

If you have played Total War before:
This is one of my favourites. It's not perfect by any means - the campaign can be gruelling, and it's frustrating to see the AI cheat quite so much sometimes (Doomstack of tier 3 units magically spawns 3 feet from one of your border settlements, can be a bit frustrating...). It can also be a bit spammy - often a gimmick spam army gives you better results than a balanced army, and the rosters are kinda geared that way. (e.g. the Alans are best played by just spamming cheap melee cavalry).
Pros though - the gruelling campaign captures what the developers were going for. It's meant to be dystopian. You're meant to feel the walls closing in. That doesn't take away from the campaign at all - if anything, it's much more interesting than the standard ""Everyone starts a bit weak and grows from there"" setup. You feel the desperation of being in a horde, or the chaos of the collapsing West. Is it truly representative of the death throes of Rome? Well, no, the year is all a bit wrong and it all happens a bit faster than reality, the 'norse' factions are just wildly out of place. (And the less said about berserking units the better.) But frankly, it's much more fun to play this way - it's meant to play like a mythical interpretation of the events, rather than to represent their reality. And Attila really captures the theme of dread and societal collapse. The music is excellent, probably my favourite soundtrack from the TW games, complete with throat singing to instill you with the mounting threat of the Hunnic Hordes. The visual style is also great, the darkness and gloom of the world you're in only ever broken by the bright flames of whole countries being literally burned to the ground. The battles are intense and swift, but also I feel give you more options with each unit than e.g. Rome 2 did. 

In short, if you enjoyed Rome 2, definitely give this one a go. It's a great follow-up.
If you enjoyed other TW games, give it a go if you're cool with pre-gunpowder, a bit of creative license doesn't bother you too much, you aren't a Rome 1 or Medieval 2 purist, and you like the idea of a more 'existential crisis' kind of campaign.
If you've never played TW, give a different one a go first. Rome 2, or Shogun 2, or maybe Napoleon.

DLC-wise, Last Roman can be alright, it's a fairly neat experience, whereas I found Age of Charlemagne to be a bit meh.",1598905083,1598905083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love playing as the Western Roman empire as its by far the biggest challenge & all other factions are to easy to play with. The only thing that stops me recommending this game is the infuriating campaign. Each time 
 you begin to rebuild and expanding you are faced with 3/5 major issues, without fail these wipe out your army or set back your economy just when you need it most, causing you to focus on something else. 

An example of this I faced was a disease, my main force was crossing a province toward the English channel (this province did have a 2% change of disease while cross - so granted there is always a chance this could happen) where it became infected. The disease passed in the region within 3 turns but took 9 turns for the disease to base within my army (the time taken for diseases go vary). With the army depleted I was then attacked by 3 factions at once (for no logical reason) forcing me to defend what lands I had. 

Weather will be a constant issue, food will go from +100 to +20 on the flip of a coin & you will randomly get attack by a tribe that will cross half the known world just to raid a random fishing village. 

All this issues combine really make this game a boring survival game were you are simply waiting for the next issue to come along and any effort to expand out is meet with 'random' crisis that makes it pointless to play.

Get Attila Total War if you want a unique entry in the franchise: grand strategy mechanics have been flipped from conquering to [b]survival[/b]. This change informs the bleak historical setting and audio-visuals of the game or perhaps vice versa. Mods turn a relatively rough vanilla product, by CA standards, into a great game. 

[h1]Positives:[/h1]

If Shogun 2 represents the quintessential total war experience, then Attila stands opposed to that tradition. Unlike Shogun 2 and other games in the franchise, Atilla does not want you to campaign and conquer--the game is not about unification or imperialism. Instead, the game is about [b]survival[/b], which is reinforced by the historical setting. The Huns are seeking food and glory; migratory tribes flee west of the Danube for shelter, Rome is fractured, famine and disease are rampant...

The historical theme of survival is well actualized in the gameplay. Eastern and Western Rome are vast, but your armies are few, and you will lose territory quickly to the migratory tribes and later the Huns. Migratory tribes begin as hordes that must colonize fertile provinces to survive. The Huns must survive by subjugating factions and fueling their armies with tribute--in turn gaining diplomatic penalties and constant hostility from everyone including their tributaries. The game is bleak and the design, sound, and setting reinforce it. 

[h1]Negatives and Troubleshooting:[/h1]

Conceptually this game is fantastic; however, I have to warn that gameplay heavily favors 'kiting' and is micro-intensive. Thankfully, there are several overhaul mods (with ongoing support) that balance and tailor the game to your liking. 
Also, the game needs some tweaking for optimization--mainly fixing framerate issues by lowering shadow quality to less than the highest and mods that edit the LOD ranges for units.",1598171842,1598171842,True,22,0,0.713013708591461182,0,True,False,False

I Honestly hate this Title. The stupid duel death system is ridiculous.
They took perfectly good projectile trails and ruined them. the lighting is to dull. the shaders or shadows make you feel like its the late afternoon all the timmmeeee.
The Battle UI is unsightly.

How, playing as Mordor, am i going to defeat anything with the silly feature, within my graphics cards life time.
Not to mention the coding is trash. Large scale battles are Heavy on the FPS, in comparison to Newer and older titles alike
(for my computer)



Medievil 2 was the Last Great release of the Historical Franchise.
Yeh, rome 2 is good on the campaign screen, but the battles are slow due to this feature also.
Warhammer 2 is honestly the best Title this franchise has. (no LOTR mods though, so M2 still is the best)

Extraordinary Modding community with great overhauls and time setting changes such as Terminus: Imperium, Ancient Empires or Medieval Kingdoms 1212. 
Many quality of life mods around, people have some usefull collections to make even the original setting more interesting. 

Great dlc, generally the added cultures have strenghts and weaknesses that are remarkable and have an unique playstyle. Great expansions with Age of Charlemagne being one of the best campaing expiriences aviabale, very new player friendly in comparison to the vanilla campaing. If you are picking it up be sure to get either the briton or viking culture packs to have a enjoyable first campaing as most factions in vanilla are sorrounded by enemies and constant war, which can be overwhelming for new players, specially such complex factions like Western Roman Empire or the Huns.

CA should revisit this game and make official the import of Thrones of Britannia optimizations, which would fix 90% of the major stuttering and big battle problems that this game has. 

Second best behind Medieval 2, and its clear successor in terms of modding community, only shadowed by the incredible rise of the Warhammer games that have a modding community equally strong , and even bigger. Graphics and effects hold up to this day and there are many great modded texture packs that increase quality and variety even more.

I recommend this game to people who have already played other total wars and dont mind a more challenging expirience, with extraordinarilly agressive AI only matched by Rome 2 recent dlc and patches ( that take many mechanics from Attila I might add).

I recommend the title because it plays fine. It delivers classic TW action.

It does what it says on the tin, like all TW titles I have played... the problem is that it's a very specific tin: ""total war"".

I suppose my issue is that these are the mechanics that, for me, give the game replayability, rather than the real-time battles (that said, M2TW battles still feel much more satisfying than this or any other TW's). Many mods, of course, are incredibly fun, but even very polished ones like 1212AD seem to eventually hit a wall when they try to change key mechanics, or introduce new ones (and old ones, left unchanged, can still annoy the player from time to time). I should note I have been playing these games mostly on an old laptop, and I feel the new titles in particular (ETW-onwards) would be much more appreciable in a proper gaming computer, to show off unit design, scale, etc... so it would also be fair to say I haven't played the game ""as it is supposed to be played"", a bit like watching LOTR on a phone...",1596761302,1596761302,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The real struggle of reviewing Attila is that I really really love the game. But I almost can't get myself to say it because this game is so obviously a step in a direction that and old-school total war fan simply cannot appreciate. But let me get to the point. The reasons why I love Attila and why I'll definitely play another campaign or three:
- The map is huge
- Diplomacy is solid
- Unit roster is amazingly diverse, including a wide range of mercenaries
- Huns are such a dark and threatening menace. I always sh*t myself when I see their army of Devil Archers approaching.
- I LOVE razing and colonising settlements
- Battle AI is above-average
- Battle maps and battle mechanics are original and fresh. You can see how much ammunition enemy units have left. You can build barricades, set stuff on fire etc.
- Amphibious battles
- City building is good
- Interesting internal politics mechanics
- A very tangible era-ending atmosphere
- A lot of playable factions

Reasons why I won't play another five or ten campaigns (like I did in Shogun 2 or Medieval 2):
- Campaign AI is below-average (seriously, running away with your superior army into the hills and letting me take your cities?)
- Graphics has taken an unfortunate step back. Heck, even water looks worse than in Shogun 2!
- Just like in Rome 2, you can't have armies without commanders. Furthermore, the number of armies you can weild is capped. Can only weild 5 armies but have 6 border settlements? Sorry! You'll have to make do somehow. This is a slap in the face to any strategy game enthusiast. Why in the world can't I transfer units from one army to another without moving the ENTIRE army?!
- Traits development for characters seems even more random than in Medieval 2
- Weird agent development trees. Each agent has ten or more abilites, most of which are useless.
- Weird religion traits/benefits. Was Christianity really so useless back then?
- Nonsensical city building mechanics. Why in the world are fields lowering public order? ""Damn, I'm so pissed at those f****g wheat farms over there!""
- Really, graphics is much weaker than in older titles! Zooming in on battles is far less satisfying than it used to be.
- DLCs. Want all the factions? Pay up (and not once!). Want blood in this military strategy game? Pay up. (To be fair, those burned corpses look awesome... but why do I gotta pay 5 euros for that?)

There it is. I'd give Attila a solid 8/10. Good game, but lacking. Lacking in things that could be very easily fixed.
Overall a good choice for any Total War lover who loves ancient era but can't stand Rome 2.

Tribes can now migrate somewhere else after being beat out of their settlements. Some tribes can resettle, like the huns. I beat 8  hun armies and they kept appearing, i beat 6 more.

They burned down entire northern europe and the only thing standing was the middle east and some remaingin settlements in europe. I was the richest obviously and they woudln't stop coming. I had to quit that campaign for this reason. Infinite hordes isn't gameplay it is torture. I just play with tribes not located in europe to avoid the huns and now the game is fine.

The premise is interesting, the gameplay is challenging, the soundtrack is excellent. They also managed to make it a very immersive game, the setting, color palette, and music make you feel like you are playing in a decadent world that is just about to crumble.  But you can't really enjoy it much when every battle turns into a slideshow. You can improve it by turning down the graphical settings (specially shadows) but then it looks really bad. There are some performance mods that make it more bearable by tweaking LOD but it's not enough.

It's a shame because CA is using the same engine for Thrones of Brittania and they seem to have fixed these issues (that one runs smoothly on the same PC), sadly they never care about Attila to fix it's issues.

TW: Attila is completely unbalanced. The game is supposed to be based around counters, but horse archers and shock units are the meta of the game. Charge bonuses wipe out units with only a few charges and horse archers can reduce most units to nothing. The meta is an insane competition between shock armies and horse archers. This however is undermined by the [i]Slavic Nations Culture Pack[/i] and its addition of poison arrows. Poison arrows have largely broken the fun meta by countering everything with a play-style that encourages camping. Poison arrows are not an issue in the single-player due to their obscure position on the map and proximity to the Huns. However, the meta of shock units and horse archery will dictate how you make your armies.

This game is ugly but that is not too much of an issue. The theme of the game's art style is degeneration and the ugly textures support this style. This theme of degeneration permeates the whole game and creates a strangely immersive experience. The ugliness of this game could be an issue for some people. 

TW: Attila is a poorly optimized game. Despite looking ugly, the game lags and crashes even on a system with decent specs. 

The most difficult challenge in Total War is featured in TW: Attila. The Western Roman Empire campaign can be cheated and cheesed, but nothing compares to defending the empire the way it was intended by the developers. Pretty much every faction in this game is challenging because every faction is threatened by roving hoards without settlements that like to raze cities to the ground. Climate change, sanitation and religion are not easy to deal with and cause economic troubles and chaos. Attila the Hun himself will spawn infinite armies until he is killed three times in battle. Very few Total War games are this challenging. 

TW: Atilla is a broken game but it's the right kind of broken.

If your looking at this to be a copy of Rome 2 Total War, stop right there, because its not. Its based on a different time period leading into the medieval ages and its got a whole different global setup. That being the climate shift which changed the soil a bit, and also the introduction of christianity to the world, where before it was pure paganism.

The city defenses are a lot different in this one because a lot of the settlements appear to share a similar layout, and that layout has a clear benefit to the defender, which is not a bad thing seeing as most places were built with defense in mind.

I do suggest playing with a few mods though, since if you play Rome it can be really brutal trying to survive the hoards of everyone throwing themselves at you mixed with soil that turns into wasteland irregardless of your irrigation and farming technology the Romans spent hundreds of years developing. So having a mod that adds buildings that increase fertility makes sense.

Troops wise, the Romans seem to have the advantage in terms of heaviness, however one thing you will notice is that regardless of your clear advantage, the game will say its even or your losing, when your really winning, maybe its a glitch in the game.

Attila is a darker version of Rome 2, most of the mechanics are fairly similar between the two but with Attila instead of being a Rome conquest game its much more about the decline of Rome and that can be seen in the game: Settlement razing - You can raze enemy settlements or you can even choose to raze your own settlements in order to launch a scorched earth campaign against the enemies at the gates.
The combat feels really great, cavalry charges and flanks are devastating, infantry combat from the front is slow. There's no more magic satellite link-up guided arrows from Shogun 2. Ranged units just feel much better than Rome 2. The fatigue system is neat in that you can cycle units in and out of combat to rapidly return to fresh.
The long term fertility situation, sanitation vs public order vs food, politics, offices and other systems are involved and feel really fun to manage once you understand them.
There is also the horde mechanic which can make things interesting. The Huns are a purely horde faction who have limited economic prospects beyond sacking and/or razing enemy settlements or maintaining a large number of vassal barbarian tribes. The Barbarians can also choose to pull up stakes, abandon their provinces and migrate elsewhere to avoid the Huns and perhaps better attack the Romans who can be sitting ducks.
by the way, the 5th Century doesn't interest you? Try the Age of Charlemagne DLC or the 1212AD Mod. You don't like historical TW and for whatever reason you don't want to play TW Warhammer? this game even has Lord of the Rings mod lmao.
HOWEVER, why people are so negative about Attila you ask? Because it forced players out of their comfort zone, they don't like the lack of food penalties, the diseases and climate change mechanic, Attila (compare to other TW) is a survival game not an empire building game. If other Total War games are ''haha map painting go brrrr'' this game is ""live to fight another [i]turn[/i]"".

Although I'm coming back to this now because I am going to keep the thumbs down. A recent trend seems to be popping up in the final updates that SEGA and Creative Assembly do to past TW games. MODS no longer work... Something that radically adds flavor to games that sometimes can be rather upsetting, especially with only the base models/units that tend to be the exact same. Majority of my hours have been playing as the ERE and I would not have been able to find success had it not been for the mods that added those extra layers of ""small detail"". It seems that SEGA and Creative Assembly really don't want you to play their older games...





This is a review of a naive fan of Total War; who has not been able to discern the corruptable forces of CA, until now.

If you are looking for a game of graphics, thank you Total War, this game will suit that. Rome II or Shogun II accomplish the same, and I find to be definitely better; gameplay-wise. However, there are some underlying factors that should steer you away from this game:

1. DLC is King! ""No seriously.... Just give them your money. Its fine, all of our DLC's worth it!"" (Says every CA spokesperson, who doesn't need to pay for it).

2. Random bugs. This is minor in theory, however when you start noticing the same bugs.... It doesn't feel minor... This is an another gripe against CA as I seem to find these bugs in their last 2 titles apart from Attila, and no Facks were given on any day to fix them... Look forward to Warhammer!

3. Pricing of this title. I would not recommend it, again, you can achieve feel and looks in past games, especially since they cost less than this.

4. DLC is beautiful, again! ""I mean come on, we can release this shit like clockwork, and they'll [consumers] never know! Pre-release DLC and DLC just weeks after the game is released? With no differences amongst these packs? Fuck yeah! Additionally, we'll throw in little details like blood and vomit... That will make panties fall! People [consumers again] WILL LOVE THIS."" Impersonated CA workers conversing at final release development. -- Understand that pre-release DLC is already made game content prior to release, which means that it was made with the base game, they only separated the two to make more money.

5. AI are about the same as past Total War games. Attila's AI... May be more dumb than the wiseguy at CA who thought DLC was a good idea. AI is not too difficult to beat, however you need to do it in certain ways, which eliminates certain play styles (unless you mod).

6. This is a conclusive observation. Although the graphics are amazing, and the ideas behind this game are interesting; this game is a reskin of Rome II at its finest. The multitude of redundant factions shows carelessness on the developers behalf. DLC prior to first day is something I have always been against (which is why I DID NOT pre-order this game (not that naive)), and should steer clear from unless certain criteria is met. That criteria is price; this is too much outright, so buy everything on sale if you are hellbent on being interested in this game.

Overall, I will still play this game, as I like the graphics and the time period that this game is set in. However, will I support anything else from CA and Total War? That will have reside on the outcome of what happens with upcoming games, such as Warhammer (which is not looking good from what I have seen).",1451530188,1593500376,False,6,0,0.552715778350830078,0,True,False,False

However having finally come back to it, and to play West Rome proper, I must say it's the best one to do date, and although I would suggest getting it on sale, I had no regrets getting it at full price, I would say it is even better than Three Kingdoms, and Warhammer 2, the latter game I have been playing a lot and really enjoying too. What makes it better is the combat in this game feels really really good, I would say even better than Shogun 2. 

You can have battles where you may only have a 10% chance of winning and tactics actually favour the victor, as opposed to other games in the series where even if you are smart morale debuffs are way too effective, in this game they are their but feel fair, fitting of a game where you are instantly put on the back pedal having to defend your land from a number of factions (if playing as Rome). Makes unlikely defences really fun to play, as opposed to just auto resolving and giving up, all be it that still happens once and a while either due to personal negligence of looking after land or just not caring about every single province.

Besides the combat, the feeling and setting is really unique, and for sure feels different, if not scary and lonely at times, but in a good way really keeps you feeling like each turn is another step in your factions survival during a period of change, eradication, and chaos. 

I can see myself playing this for quite a while, and doing coop with mates, for sure fun, and a nice continuation of Rome 2.",1592316388,1592316388,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's guite amusing to develop your tribe, capture new lands, and so on. The politiccal system has both pros and cons. 

First of all, what the hell? If you have almost demolished an enemy state, its rulers in theory should give you their best to save the state. But enemies either offer pathetic 300 coins or refuse any your offers. 

Nevertheless, the system is actually good. You have a lot of options. You can conclude a non-aggression pact, make a defensive alliance, make an alliance, give money to other tribes, demand money from them and so on. And each your decision is very important. So, if you made a lot of unnecessary alliences, you will paid for this. You will have to fight with other tribes because of your ally. And the ally itself may not to fight, because it has unleashed a war with a tribe, which is situated too far. Why do allies do this? Nobody knows. But it has a bad effect on your economy and public order. So you should think before make an alliance. 

Secondly, the economic system. It's very strange. A region may have either surplus food or lack.. If a region has a lack, it's bad because people starve and it has a bad effect on the public order (by the way, an important thing). But when the state as a whole has an excess food, a region may have a lack. Really. For example, you have three regions. Two of them have an excess food, but the last one a lack. And extra food cannot be sent to this region because... because what? Nobody knows. So, each region supplies itself.

What about other aspects of economics? I like them. Have you found a source of resources? It's good. You can trade the resources you found. Moreover, the resources allow you to build some buildings. If a trade route is under attack, your tranding income falls. 

To sum up, this is a casual game. It might seem that the game quite difficult but actually when you play a bit, you will get used.

This game follows historically with Total War: Rome 2. We progress a few hundred years and see the fall of the roman empire after it has split between east and west. The game changes a lot for the series and many of the mechanics from this game have found their way into the Warhammer games.

As usual for creative assembly, a lot of the game is delivered piece-meal through DLC. Many factions are locked into DLC culture packs you have to purchase if you want to play anything beyond the bigger empires.

One of the best changes is the creation of Hoards or free-roaming armies that are not anchored to any city. The mongols are the best example. They can never settle in a city and must always stay nomadic. Then you have the Barbarians Hoards that are fleeing the mongols. These are the Ostro/Visigoths who invade and settle the collapsing roman territory. They are all about getting strong, then taking land. 

The units are interesting, but there is not a whole lot of difference in units between cultures. They tend to play more like re-skins and are class based, but there is way more variety than Shogun 2.

I think this is one of there best historical themed games, but it tends to be ignored in favor of Rome 2.",1589474414,1589474414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game, it was truly the last genuine historical total war. The game is fun and beautiful. It has one of the most groundbreaking and popular total war mods ever made for it. It's historically accurate and the graphics are still beautiful even by today's standards. However the reason I had to click not recommend is something I can't fault this innocent amazing game for. CA completely abandoned it. It is truly a shame, because this was their last great historical game before jumping the shark, but instead of continuing to work with what is arguably one of their masterworks, they dived headfirst into the pool of greed and left this on the diving board. If CA had continued to work with this, who knows what we could have gotten, instead they killed it and went on to make games solely for the purpose of making money for themselves instead of giving the fans what they want and deserve. It makes me really sad what happened to the creative assembly. This game is beautiful and is still worth playing but it's a testament to how horribly derailed CA has become and angered the fanbase by abandoning this poor amazing game. 

pros
great graphics 
historically accurate
fun 
still worth playing 
has one of the most groundbreaking expansive mods ever 

cons 
showed how badly CA has flushed down the toilet but flushing this game down their toilet. 

Overall 9 out of 10. I love this game but I can't forgive how CA abandoned it when it could have been so much more. This is the only negative review for anything I have ever wrote a negative review of where I actually felt bad for having to press not recommend and I had to write a negative review of one of my favorite restaurants because their pizza stinkbombed my car, but like that restaurant, it's still worth enjoying but there are things that just can't be forgiven that you can't fault it for and doesn't change the circumstances.",1589451509,1589451509,False,3,1,0.509528696537017822,0,True,False,False

OK then.

But ATTILA is one of the best TW games available.
I dont like three kingdoms as much; I dont like shogun2 as much (though its pretty close); I dont like rome2 as much. Oh and forget about the ""saga"" games, they are basically ""half TW games"". I dont count those.
If you have ANY TW games, you first need medieval2 obviously (#1) - but for 2nd and 3rd I would take ATTILA and WARHAMMER2.

Its cheap now.
The DLC are optional.
Theres great mods for it.
Pretty simple choice here: if you like this genre, you need this game.

If you play the huns, watch this playlist to add immersion:

1. It isn't optimized well and the custom settings are somewhat confusingly named, which made it difficult for me to adjust them.

2. It makes my laptop hot when it shouldn't, RTW2 ran just fine, but my fans were constantly blowing at full speed while playing this.

3. It feels like too much of a grind. I had to constantly fight manual battles in order to make the attacking hordes take more casualties than they would have if I had simply auto-resolved. Doing that multiple times for the first 50 turns or so became annoying and felt like a chore.


4. It felt kind of pointless. I managed to kill Attila and received no cinematic or message, he was just dead. I destroyed the remaining hordes and simply got the message that the Huns had been destroyed, the same message that I got when the other factions got destroyed. 
It didn't seem worth it in the end. After I restored public order, rebuilt cities, got food and sanitation up in all provinces, secured the borders, destroyed enemies...It just seemed like it went from frustrating and grind-like to pointless to continue playing, all while my laptop was hot with fans blowing. 

Updating review: I've been playing it a bit more and have found the game somewhat more enjoyable, but I do not know how much longer this enjoyment will last. I noticed that if I put everything on performance or even max performance, the game runs a lot better. I guess performance is like saying ""low settings."" There were some other things that I unchecked like shadows that also made the game run smoother. 
All that being said, I assume the game has little replay value since the Huns are always going to be the main enemy, but I'm not sure how the DLC for Attila is yet.

The campaign isn't quite regular strategy as it is 'survival horror'. People coming in from one of the other games be warned, thanks to the sanitation mechanics, climate change, and the Huns, it's the hardest in the series, so don't try something like the Western Roman Empire right off the bat.
The art style is great, the game nailed the grim atmosphere of the 4th and 5th centuries, and every campaign feels unique in its own way, starting position and good unit rosters helps a lot with that.

so first of all this will be review of mod that you can use for Attila. I buyed this game for this mod only and played game just with 1212AD mod and dont have a single minute with base story of game. The 1212AD mod is FREE so keep that in mind!!

As all total war players i am waiting for Total War Medieval III. When will it come? i dont know...but until then i am playing 
MK 1212AD. It is almost like beta of Medieval III. Mod is looking great and preforms great in game. Factions are accurate and have accurate historical units. Units looks so great, i can just say good job to guy who desing units. I like how you can go on crusade, it feels so realistic. Game as Attila si runnig poorly...but that its not mod fault. Also game is to dark for me so is not right theme for medieval time...which again is game's fault. all i can say this is the only way for you to play while you wait for Total War Medieval III. 

Now i will try to tell some downside of mod, which I DONT KNOW IF IS EVEN MOD FAULT!!! 
first thing that it's bothers me is that there is very few settlements... as we know in medieval era there was a lot of factions in europe and so one of those factions comes in game with only one settlement. that means when i take that only settlement i destroy faction and then i feel odd becasue there were many more lords in factions which would came to aid in real life. But this is not a mod fault!(i think) this can be used as something for Total War Medieval III, to make it more fun. 
Looks of the Castles is also something that does not belongs in that era but i dont know if thats even posible to change in game. 

Other than that the mod is life saver!! Try to donate to modders if you can cause they gave you for FREE Total War Medieval III Beta.

I'm a longstanding total war fan and started playing Attila just recently because I found myself captivated with the Late Roman Imperial period. It's a time of turmoil and tragedy for the Romans. A dying of the light, as darkness comes from both within and without. Fighting back against the darkness and halting the Roman collapse is what interested me here, and if you share that interest then this game may be for you.

As for the actual mechanics and content, it is very much Rome II with some interesting additions and some further polish. Compared to other total war games, the quality and variety of the battles is enjoyable. The siege battles are very interesting and cool, and it's certainly also nice to be able to play naval battles and have them connect to land battles. The characters system is also quite well fleshed out, and there are plenty of ways to get attached to your favorite characters with all their positive and negative traits.

The main issues I have with the game come in two categories. Firstly the AI issues and secondly the ""Modern Total War"" issues.

AI problems are easy to describe, basically this refers to the strange and stupid ways in which the AI will behave. In field battles this is less pronounced as the AI generally employs quite competent and aggressive tactics. The AI generally also defends settlements very well, but as an attacker it generally performs very poorly, getting its generals killed and armies routed. The campaign map AI is the worst failure in this category. In diplomacy and army movement it seems more interested in infuriating and annoying the player faction rather than building its own power, such as when factions refuse to trade or surprise attack you to sack one settlement only to then be crushed by your much more powerful armies. The only way to play is to treat every faction as a potential enemy and never leave a frontier unguarded. All of the AI's nonsensical campaign plays are facilitated by the bonuses that the AI gets to its finances and empire maintenance. It feels incredibly frustrating to be the victim of unfair AI strategies that would get the player killed if they attempted them.

Lastly we have a bunch of issues that irritate me as a fan of total war classics like medieval 2. In no particular order, these are: Building slot restrictions, army stack limits, shared province wide resources and public order, the politics system, the recruitment system and the technology tree. Some of these mechanics impose artificial and annoying restrictions, while others attempt to add depth to the campaign while only making it more tedious and time sink like. In my mind the game suffers from these issues to a degree, but thankfully not enough to prevent me from enjoying it.

So if you like the time period and are able to overlook the issues, enjoy this fun and expansive Late Imperial Roman sandbox.",1588336330,1588336330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The vanilla campaign can be very challenging. Mechanics like governorship and a more in-depth internal policy makes this more immersive than Rome 2, if you ask me. Siege battles are great, especially due to the well made custom/specific settlements (Yes, you can defend/siege the Theodosian walls of Constantinople). 

Overall, if you exclude the optimisation issue and the time setting, this is what Rome 2 should have been. It's a shame that CA didn't give this game the same post-launch attention it gave Rome 2, especially in terms of optimization.  

Lastly, the mod support is great! Two especially good mods are Medieval Kingdoms 1212 and Ancient Empires, which are set in the medieval period and the 2nd Punic War, respectively. 

The game has its flaws, like the previously mentioned bad optimization. Additionally, there are some strange design choices in terms of modability, like hardcoded music and non-modifiable settlement location. However, I would still recommend this game if you are a total war fan (especially if you prefer the historical titles).",1588326228,1588326228,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

325610,68278814,76561198008667586,0,18,3221,0,955,1654275283,"One of my favorite games in the Total War franchise thus far, and a huge improvement on its predecessor, Total War Rome II. Attila takes essentially the same engine and incorporates a new set of mechanics and flavor that perfectly suit the transition from early to late antiquity. The doomsday vibe of the game's sparse narrative helps to ground its sandbox in the psychological space of its setting: the end of the Roman world and the beginning of a new era. This game is essentially a spiritual sequel to Total War Rome: Barbarian Invasion, with the migratory tribes and the Huns stealing the show in both aesthetics and mechanics.

If you played the Nomadic Tribes DLC for Rome II, you might have been disappointed at the lack of ""Barbarian Invasion"" style nomad mechanics, leaving them with the same city-based gameplay as sedentary civilizations. Attila makes up for this in droves, with a massively expanded nomad migration system that's tremendously fun to play compared to settled states. This is why the Great Migrators (think Goths, Franks, Alans, and Vandals) are at the center of the game, with the formidable Huns driving them westward into the ill-defended Roman territory. All these factions have no cities at the start, but instead carry their cities with them as mobile army encampments that can be packed up and moved on the fly (with construction pausing while the army is on the move and resuming when they encamp). Unlike the Huns, though, the migrators are not locked into staying nomadic: their goal is to raid their way into settled territory until they find a good place to settle down and create their own kingdom. This gives an otherwise sandboxy game a firm sense of goal and direction, whether you want to recreate the historical path of your tribe's rise to power, or change history and make them outlast their real-life counterparts.

The player who wants to face a near-impossible challenge also has the option of playing as the Western Roman Empire and trying to prevent its fall, but as they have a massive amount of territory to defend, they will have to pick and choose what parts of the empire are most important to hold onto. Eastern Rome (aka the Byzantines) is a more realistic challenge for players who aren't quite so masochistic, as for them one merely has to recreate their historical survival, though against they won't be likely to come out with their empire intact.

As for the tactical battles, Attila rebalanced the system of Total War Rome II to better fit the time period and make for more dynamic gameplay. Unit morale is much more of a factor, as all but the best trained units will rout under sufficient pressure from the enemy (or if you accidentally throw them into friendly fire), though they may also regroup and return to the battle if their casualties aren't too severe. There are more dramatic differences between factions as well, so for example migrating nomads cannot capture buildings, only destroy them. Overall, the battles in Attila feel more fluid than previous titles, and it's much more possible to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, or vice versa...

Both battle and campaign maps are rendered in gorgeous detail even on medium settings. As the fifth century goes on, the map will actually change over time. The onset of climate change, which rendered the northern regions inhospitable during this time period, is reflected in the reduction of regional fertility and increasingly barren land. Speaking of which, the land is also likely to suffer from invaders razing settlements, which not only wipes them off the map but also burns and desolates the entire region with a glorious animation sequence that leaves the trees burned and the territory uninhabited.

Major political features have fleshed out the campaign as well. You can now assign governorships to your leaders (a feature appallingly absent from Rome II's unwieldy and unfinished politics system), and you can distribute other offices to worthy characters in your employ, so long as keep an eye on their loyalty to make sure they don't become too ambitious for their own good. Religion is also a part of the game's mechanics for the first time as well, replacing the culture spread from Rome II, and dynamically changing over time as you construct religious buildings and proclaim edicts. This opens up the possibility for the player to create their own goal of spreading their faction's religion across the entire map, or perhaps preserving a historically embattled religion from this period, like Arianism or one of several Pagan faiths. Tying into this, faction and unit voice callouts will often reference their faction's religion, which adds to the flavor of an era in which religious motivations played a large role in military morale.

There's definitely a lot more I want to explore in this game, but already it stands out to me as one of the most interesting titles in this series to date, and one that has aged relatively well compared to its predecessor. It's a shame there's only two DLC campaigns, compared to the massive number of interesting scenarios available for Rome II, but there are some excellent total conversion mods available on the Steam Workshop that help scratch that itch for more historical content. I would argue that Attila is the gold standard of comparison for future TW titles and fans of the series should definitely consider picking it up.",1588220531,1588220531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the elephant in the room: ‘Attila’ is poorly optimized, to the extent that it runs worse than its predecessor Rome 2 (or at least, worse than Rome 2 in its current, final, ‘Emperor Edition’ state).

We’re talking half the frame rate of R2 with equivalent graphics settings - and the Attila engine is evidently unable to take advantage of the brute power of modern graphics cards to get itself out of trouble - so don’t think that this warning doesn’t apply to you just because you have a modern GPU. 

At best, your Nvidia 2060 will allow you to add 8x AA and x16AF, SSAO, DoF and maybe distortion effects (i.e. aspects of rendering internal to the GPU) while the game waits for your CPU to compute shadows, unit detail, trees, grass, terrain i.e. whatever game assets are hardcoded to be handled by the processor only.

Having said that, ‘poorly optimized’ does not mean ‘broken’: the game is stable to the extent that I can’t recall any crashes. So it’s a question of what you as a player are prepared to put up with: this is a game that struggles to run its own internal benchmark - a short scenario featuring less than twenty units - satisfactorily on maximum settings; so it’s really no wonder that siege battles featuring four full stacks degenerate into slide-shows. 

As a result, I have found myself autoresolving multi-army siege battles that I would otherwise have enjoyed - a sad thing to say about a game in which epic confrontations should be the highpoints of a playthrough, not an ordeal to be sidestepped.

Ok, on to the game itself:

Attila was the first recent TW game to reintroduce the horde mechanic, whereby some factions don’t have any settlements but instead camp wherever the hell they like, a mechanic which increases scope for creative playstyles. Moreover it adds a new dimension even if you don’t play as a horde yourself, since dealing with hordes is a new challenge for settled factions too; and if you lose your last settlement, you may find yourself playing as a horde after all!

The new ability to 'raze' (obliterate) captured settlements also adds creativity, since the player (and the AI too) now has the option to delete entire cities from the map rather than overextend their empire by capturing them, or risk having to return at some point after merely 'sacking' them - now there is a more permanent solution available. 

This can be used to create buffer zones of inhospitable wasteland around your core provinces; or (Attila allows you to abandon i.e. raze your OWN settlements) in desperate circumstances you can employ a 'scorched earth' policy to deny an advancing enemy the benefit of the region they are about to capture.

The option to 'recolonise' abandoned/razed settlements, though costly in men and gold, provides a means for players with the necessary funds to snap up some of the devastated real estate left in the Huns' wake (providing, that is, you are confident they are really gone...).

And if you are playing as a horde and you capture a prosperous, fertile or easily-defensible settlement, you have the dilemma of whether it might not be a good moment to settle after all.

Food is now on a per-province basis so no subsidising your hungrier provinces from more productive ones.

Climate change may sound like it’s been shoe-horned in by politically correct developers but is actually a really solid game mechanic since it adds incentive for factions to migrate south to more fertile lands (as well as west, to escape the Huns).

The Huns represent a fascinating dilemma for the player: do you evade or confront them? Indeed the mid-game can feel more like survival horror than strategy if you find yourself isolated against multiple hordes: there's no doomstack like a Hun doomstack...

A raiding horde also 'steals' food from the host province, thus decreasing public order and preventing resident units from replenishing so 'hoping they just go away' is not a foolproof response.

Army integrity feels like it should always have been a feature of Total War games, particularly when combined with attrition when marching in snowy or desert regions (a mechanic missing from, say, Rome 2).

Army traditions were already in R2 but are even more valuable now, because you can spec your army to be, say, resistant to snow attrition.

Customizing your generals/governors (and indeed spies etc) is an interesting challenge but gets a bit tiresome late on when you have numerous agents and armies.

The politics system manages not to be obnoxious for once, not least because here, civil war is not ‘scripted’ (i.e. inevitable at some point). However the key mechanic (of striving for a balance between authoritarianism and lack of control) is somewhat counter-intuitive so perusing a community guide or two is highly recommended. 

I also like the crucial role that female characters play here behind the scenes, rather than appearing on the battlefield as they did in Rome 2. The versatility of influential noblewomen as 'fixers' (providing everything from loyalty boosts for wavering generals to outright assassinations) means that careful attention to the diplomatic marriage market can be even more valuable here than in other TW games. 

Diplomacy seems to work better than average, with factions for the most part seeming to act in their plausible self-interest.

Steam achievements are well integrated and comprehensive although the absence of specific recognition for completing a campaign on 'hard' or 'very hard' feels like a slight to non-legendary players.

The usual several victory conditions strike a good balance between challenge and fairness (at least, in my experience) and I particularly appreciate the absence of arbitrary time limits. Rewards for simply surviving until certain dates feel earned and the optional goals for each 'chapter' provide some ideas about what direction you might want to take with your faction whilst representing no great loss if you choose to ignore them and go your own way.

The tech tree is set out more logically than in R2 and allows the player to 'customize' their faction in a variety of directions e.g. do you go for elite spearmen before swordsmen? Or is sanitation (or eking a bit more food out of the increasingly barren soil) the better priority? Conceivably you could experience two very different playthroughs with the same faction as a result.

Faction variety is excellent, to the extent that playthroughs with, say, the Sassanids, the seafaring Danes or the snow-resistant Slavs provide very different challenges.

Unit variety is also very good and provides a particular incentive to recruiting exotic mercenaries when marching far from home. 

Attila also offers for purchase some of the best DLC expansions in the Total War series, namely 'Age of Charlemagne' and 'The Last Roman'.

Minor annoyances:

Why can’t I look at the initial post-battle screen for as long as I want? 

Why can’t I target an enemy siege tower directly, rather than only being allowed to fire at the enemy unit that is pushing it? Are siege towers protected by some Geneva Convention I don’t know about??

The sheer awkwardness of placing units on certain types of terrain (typically, ‘farmland’-style landscapes, frequently encountered around settlements) suggests that the CA ‘terrain-scaping’ team never actually played any battles themselves.

End turn times are long compared to later games e.g. TWWH. Here, you literally have time to go make a cup of tea.

[b]TLDR:[/b]

DON’T BUY IT if you are just looking for a graphically-improved Rome 2 that will run as smoothly as Rome 2 does these days;
DON’T BUY IT if you would actually prefer to play Total War Warhammer, Thrones of Britannia or Three Kingdoms but assume that an OLDER title will run better on your pc (it won’t);

I also love campaign co-op, I think they should expand upon it in future Total War games and even allow more players, also make it where you can be allies or if you want wage war, not forcing one or the other.

I love the factions, but Sega got scummy with selling so many factions in little DLC packs. They're already in the game, you're just paying for the ability to play them.

Sometimes I feel like the lighting looks a little off in the game, maybe that's just me, I don't know.

Unlike Rome II, changing the main city center culture is overly expensive for no reason. In fact I never liked the changing building culture system at all. It makes no sense. They're just dumb founded on expanding buildings because they look different? Very dumb.

Population get's angry way too easily, no matter how much you suck them off sometimes. This would be less of an issue if you could take soldiers away from generals, which leads me to my last issue with this one and all the recent games...

The general system is awful, only being allowed to have so many generals until upgrades, not being able to split your men from their general, all makes no sense and is a bad system. They should go back to Medieval II/Empire.

There is no ability to gift cities, which makes co-op a nightmare.

Becouse only modded version is somewhat enjoyable for me. Im a Total War veteran. I enjoyed the most first Rome, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2. I also played first Medieval and Napoleon, avoided Empire and Rome 2 becouse of terrible AI and annoying mechanics. I thought that Attila will be better, and I was disappointed.

When I first bought the game I thought I will be enjoying a huge, interesting and difficult campaign. That I will be carefully planning my moves and military campaigns thanks to various and detailed maps, that I will be fighting in exciting and huge battles, protect cities, street after street, falling back to inner walls and barricades, that I will burn the cities and raze them to the ground, that I will enjoy great graphics, and overall gameplay. Oh boy, was I wrong.

In the campaign, I didnt have to plan anything. There was no military campaign that seemed hard and challenging enough to waste time on checking the maps and planning moves. The AI will not protect its territories and will do just random, sensless things. Did you want to have a nice historical experience of the campaign? Then you will not find it here, becouse, starting before 400AD, Rome will not hold for next 20 turns and will fall like a century before it historically did, it starts as theoretically biggest military power but thanks to incapable AI, Roman armies are always nowhere to be seen. You will see tribes wich in history did not do much to do a lot, and those that mattered in history to not matter at all in this game. Playing as Saxons I expected nice fights in British scenery with the Celtic tribes but little of that occured. The Celts were bothered with conquering Galia and Hispania, leaving their British territories defenceless, and the Scandinavians, who should also target Britain, did the same thing as the Celts. And this happens always, all the time.  Mainland barbarian tribes are doing nothing.  They do not care about their historical targets and territories they should want. If most of Roman territory is conquered, barbarians will not fight each other for it. When Galia was conquered by the Ebdani and Jutes, Franks, who still had one province, instead of fighting other barbarians for the nearest territory, seemed it fit to just try to invade Roman territories in Spain. Leaving their homeland defenceless, of course. I just steamrolled everything and everyone, even on hardest difficulties, and my skills had nothing to it. You will need no skills. You will just autoresolve most of the battles becouse situations when the chances are equal will be very rare - the AI will not bother to have any strategic advantage over you. And when that rare opportunity to have a big battle occurs there will be yet another disappointment. You will not enjoy any good graphics becouse optimization in this game is a joke. The game is just a slideshow without specific mods improving this matter. And after you get rid of terrbile optimization you will be disappointed once more. The AI will not bother with commanding units in a smoewhat organised and intelligent way. There will be no battle in which the AI will be a threat to you. There will be no interesting sieges too - the AI will just throw all of its units into a single alley and you will easily surround them and cut them down. And the public order system is as annoying as useless. It is almost impossible to keep your people happy, but after some time I realised that there was no point in it. The rebels that spawn when your people are angry have only some units on the first turn and are theoretically supposed to get more over time, but it never happens. The rebel AI, instead of gathering forces, attacks nearest settlement on the first turn, and gets smashed by the garrison.

In overall: The AI is terrible. On the maps I cannot look anymore becouse of bordergore. Battles are easy and disappointing.  Diplomacy is senseless and disappointing. Campaigns are easy, boring, and disappointing. The game is not worth its price. But the modders community is. If you want to play the mods - then buy this game.",1587902393,1587902393,False,30,5,0.619292914867401123,0,True,False,False

If you have not played a Total War series game before, consider this title suited for more experienced Total War series fans or those that enjoy more challenge. This review will be aimed to give an idea to those that played at least one Total War title before.
If you played Total War series before and you liked the empire building aspect but felt that you could use more challnege - this one is fr you. Especially if you consider 2-3 mods (see below).

Diplomacy - decent, for a Total War series game, but it isn't as good as in Three Kingdoms(the only one I have not played) nor does it have as much options as Napoleon/Empire.

Battle AI - aparat from the joint land/naval battles, where it's pretty clueless, it's decent for Total War game. It managed to beat me few times whlie I was only slightly overpowered. Note I am not a big cheese fan.

Campaign AI - active, far more than in Rome 2, at times I would compare it to Warhammer 2 AI. It frequently punished me for not taking precautions. The two biggest drag's/con's is that a lot of regions become unpopulated quite quick, and they stay like that throught the game and the fact that most of the AI factions do not work to achieve their goals(become an empire), maybe except for the Huns - but I leave them for last.

Faction/government mangement - quite obscure to start with, but ok, when you get a hold of it. The amount of options is about right. All of those available are usable (unlike some of those in Rome 2). Although I find it quite easy to avoid civil wars, unlike in Rome 2. Keeping all your armies loyal is a bit more of a challenge. It presents you with options that in most cases are meaningful gamewise. (eg. provincional edicts based on your state religion)

Empire/province management - this is the area that it almost shines, if you like a challenge. Optimalization of your kigdom is very difficult. You need to think about happines, squalor/sanitation & food. There are contributing factors, like fertility, religion and to extent culture. This game punishes you if you build what you want, where you want yet it doesnot forbid you from doing it. You can assign governnors directly, which gives you direct bonuses to a particular province and unlocks edicts there (improvement over Rome 2 and Warhammer 2 - empire faction). You can even see a governor in the battle if the province capital would be assaulted.

Other points:
- hun invasion. So it's done in quite a harsh way, where even Attilla respawns once. It's wery annoying to deal with and seems very unclear on how to deal with it. It is reminiscent of Chaos invasion in Warhammer 1 & 2, but more annoying if you are in the wrong place on the map.
-Climate change is implemented (increases the challenge).
-Every year has 4 seasons, that impact the gameplay (eg. snow attrittion) and give you time to know your characters. This decreases the role of children though.
-I suggest considering the following mods(even before first playthrough): 
--Hun Invasion related, to tune it to a level that you would like (requires a bit of reading or possibly a youtube video).
--AI resettling related - so that the unpopulate areas (be it due to hun invasion or other actions) will be a t least partially populated by the AI over time
--Fertility related mod, that gives small buff to the region fertility through sanitation buildings. It does not really decrease the challenge but increases the player options(replan the economy or invest more in sanitation).
--Few bugs remain, so consider community patch/fix bundle.

Hope this will help some of you guys, considering if you should buy this.",1587665218,1587665218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing as one of the horde factions makes for an interesting play through since you have to raid and pillage until you find a suitable place to settle. Its also unsettling since the game revolves around Attilla and his campaign of destruction, and subjugation. Once you see his warbands approach your borders you better hope you have prepared enough to fight him off but dont expect too not have some losses he usually approaches you with up to 4 - 5 warbands that can easily beat your best troops.

Other factions are cool, for a while. 

Hordes and migrating factions have cool mechanics and start off super fun but get old after a bit. You don't empire build as a horde, you just raze settlements and extract resources from factions until they eventually turn on you and you have to burn them down anyway. Migratory factions play the same as a horde except they have to inevitably settle down, meaning every turn you stay migrating is another turn you'll lose out on empire building for the hell that comes mid-late game.

The other settled factions vary. The Sassanid Persians are very strong and very isolated, making them by far the easiest faction, but they have enough diversity to make them interesting until you get too powerful to have any reprecautions for your actions and lose interest. The Celts/Norse/Germanic factions are all basically the same, with very minor differences in unit rosters, buildings, technologies, and locations/allies/enemies. The tend to be absolutely screwed mid-late game as the harsher climate starves them to the point they either cant afford to feed their armies or pay for the higher tier units. The Slavs are doomed from the start.

 Some of the desert factions are cool though. The Garamantians can start carving up Rome from get-go while the empire is distracted elsewhere. Himyar is the most unique faction in the game, with a unique religion, diverse and powerful units, buildings, and starting location. The Tanukhids are basically a migratory faction like the Germanic ones, except they have eastern units, bonuses, different horde mechanics, and can pick better locations to settle. Lakhmids and Axum are ""meh"", but still more interesting than the europeans.

This all might sound a bit negative, but none of what I said above matters. The heart of this game is about the Fall of Rome. One of the most important events in the history of the world is at stake, and the game wants you to feel it. Rome is divided, there's the rich East which would later survive for over 1000 years and become the ""Byzantine Empire"", and then there's the imploding West, perhaps the single most influential state that has ever existed, and its fucked in every embarrassing way you could imagine.

This game is meant to be played as the Western Roman Empire, saving it from impending destruction and rising above every problem thrown at you. 
*Every germanic, celtic, nordic, african, gothic, and nomad faction around you declares war on you one after another
*The Huns are traveling across the world explicitly to burn your civilization to the ground while its weak
*Public order is gone, and 30 or so provinces are on the verge of revolting from the first few turns.
*Nothing is prosperous anymore save a few areas in Italy
*Some are starving and wont even be able to feed your troops
*Religious differences tear you apart
*You have a pathetically small army compared to your neighbors with much less quality
*Corruption is robbing you of your taxes
*Plague and disease will break out unless you dump tons of money into sanitation
*Your Emperor is the most pathetic leader around. 

Turning this around and painting the map with a prosperous and powerful Roman Eagle is literally the most rewarding gameplay experience I've had quite possibly ever. Kudos to CA for making a game so polarizingly difficult and stressful that it ACTUALLY gives it turbulent historical setting some real justice. This game is not easy, its not relaxing, but it can be incredibly rewarding and immersive, so it gets a big thumbs up.",1586195086,1586195086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I pressed ''Start Campaign'' 
At first sight it was beautiful, seeing all those settlements beloging to me, and surrounded by pitiful barbarian tribes who had no idea of what culture is. I felt powerful anjd told myself it would take a few turns and I'd have the entire continent.


I was wrong.


THIS GAME IS LEGIT THE EQUIVALENT OF DARK SOULS BUT IN AN RTS STRATEGY GAME STYLE AND IT JUST WANTS YOU TO DIE
PLAYING AS THE STRONGEST EMPIRE EVER? HAHA NO
JUST BUILT THIS ECONOMY? HAHA LEMME RAID
WON A HARD BATTLE WITH SOME OF UR MOST EXPENSIVE TROOPS? WATCH ME AMBUSH THEM


So you want to die? Then go ahead. 

Any other faction than the Roman Empire is useless though. They don't really exist.

For example, it introduced a set of factors which you had to balance within your settlements (food, income, and public order). This meant you had to manage your settlements to a greater degree, which had two main effects:

1. It meant you had to ensure your owned settlements are stable before having your armies leave them to conquer other lands.

2. It added a city management aspect to the game.

Rome 2 also fleshed out agents, giving them their own stats and more options when upgrading them. Rome 2 introduced army traditions, giving your armies more meaning and a greater sense of history.

Why am I bringing up Rome 2 in an Attila review? Because Attila took all those ideas, and refined them. See, Rome 2's ideas were very good, but were often awkwardly executed. Attila was a fresh chance to take the community's criticism and put it into action.

There are a few Total War games I have not played. Namely, the original Shogun and Medieval and the games from Warhammer on. But even still, I consider Total War: Attila to be one of the greatest Total War titles ever (yes, right up there with the original Rome: Total War and Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai). There are several reasons for this:

1. As mentioned before, Attila took the good but poorly executed ideas of Rome 2 and enacted them as they should have been.

2. There are a wide diversity of cultures to play, each with their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of both soldiers and buildings.

3. Attila introduced the horde system, adding a completely new style of play.

4. Related to 2, the differences between factions are deeply meaningful, especially in terms of units. This is something that cannot be said, for example, about Shogun 2.

5. The game is fairly well-balanced, and the AI is a little better than most other Total War games.

That said, there are several weaknesses to this game:

1. While the AI is significantly better than in previous games, it still isn't the best. The Total War series is not known for its stellar AI.

2, While the game is pretty well-balanced, there are still some over-powered and under-powered units. Huscarls, for example, are pretty hard to counter, while elephants, while useful under the right circumstances, are a lot easier to counter than in previous games.

3. Related to 1, the AI seems to decide whether or not to make peace with you based on how much they dislike you. This means that if you raze even 1 city, they will practically never make peace with you, meaning you have to actually HUNT DOWN EVERY SINGLE SETTLEMENT AND ARMY THEY OWN in order to 'make peace' with them.

4. The Huns are very difficult to play. You should be able to play the faction the game is named after without a whole lot of difficulty.

5. Again related to 1, increasing the difficulty basically gives the AI a whole list of cheats. I understand that it is difficult to craft an AI without doing so, but let me illustrate with an example:

With about 6 settlements, you should be able to field 2 to 3 full armies. On hard, an AI faction with only one settlement will be able to raise just as many armies as you, often even more. This is because the AI gets huge discounts to unit upkeep as the difficulty increases. This makes starting out very hard, and factions difficult to fight at almost any level of development.

If you're ok with that, then that's fine, but I and I assume other players are not.

6, Also like its predecessor Rome 2 the game is split up into several DLCs. You can't play the Nordic factions, the desert factions, or the Slavic factions without paying $27 in DLCs. This is a bad practice that EA is unfortunately in the habit of. 

So should you get this game? Yes. I would wait for a sale, but it is more than worth it even at full price. This is, in my honest opinion, one of the greatest Total War games of all time. If you are a total beginner to the Total War series, I would consider buying the original Rome 1 instead, so that you can see if Total War interests you and so that you can start off with a simpler game in the series. But this game still can appeal to all Total War players of all skill levels and experiences.

The learning curve keeps it interesting, but the Creative Assembly are more interested in churning out new games and DLC than making the fucking games work properly. I have no more patience for little bugs. They've had decades to perfect the games. What's the story CA??? Is it the board of directors? Grow a pair of balls one of you and stick up for the long, die hard fans.

Save corruption is a big issue with every iteration of the franchise. Boats sitting in the harbour not attacking and making you wait until the timer runs down. Factions still hating you even if you give them a territory, money, you name it. This was just today. And lets not talk about the bland AI or the lack of story. How cool would the game be to have chapters, a character you play as in the actual fucking game and not more grubby DLC. C""^!s! 

It's a trend for CA to not listen to what fans want. Fucking capture points. Who the fuck wants that when defending a city? It makes it a dull game for dullards.

I recommend this game as a real challenge for Total War fans, especially playing as either East or West Rome. It can be a real struggle sometimes, as due to constant immigration, every other faction hating you, a religion that handicaps you and a near Immortal Atilla. The chances of snowballing like in Rome II are slim. This game does have its problems, Atilla and his death stacks can be a real pain, but also the Roman civ tech tree, as it kills your ability to build useful concrete structures in favor of a big church and palace.

And after 40 hours of Attila, I can definitively say that this is the worst game in the series. I think this is mainly due to the fact that they changed many of the games characteristics to fit more authentically within the time period. The problem with that is that during this time in history life was incredibly difficult and things took a long time to do.

Total War as a series is already strenuous concerning how long it takes to accomplish conquest. This game takes that concept and ramps it up tenfold. This may be what some Total War fans enjoy about the series but as for me it feels like I am moving along much to slow even while playing strategically correct. That is unless of course you play as a like the Huns, in which your not conquering land but rather raiding or just down right destroying it. And this is where the main flaw lies with Attila. The purpose of a strategy game, to myself, has always been to creatively think your way out of a problem. In this game you feel like you are being forced to play a certain way to make any progress at a reasonable rate. I mean what the hell! I wanna conquer land when I play these games! Is that too much to ask for?

There are other reasons why this game is flawed and I why I am giving this a down-vote, however that is the main one. Don't waste your money on this title. There are better Total War games out there.

-Diplomacy: You want to trade with somebody? Well, good luck. They might like you, they might have profit too, but they will not trade with you, because they just don't want... You missed random war declarations from Medieval 2? You are lucky, because it's back in Attila TW... You defeated you opponent, razed all his cities and left him just with one unit of general. No problem they will gladdly fight you for another 150 turns till you make them disappear.
-Strategy Map: All generals have same range of movement, so 90% of time you will be chasing enemy army, that will raid you cities in front of you and then run away withou chance of catching them... Then you realize that there are other 3 armies on other side of your realm.
-Battle: have you ever tried to shoot the bow? Great if yes your are better that all archers in Attila TW, If they don't miss, they hit your own with poision arrow. Just on f**** poison arrow and you own units starts to die. Those f***** arches killed more own people than enemy. 
-Music: After hour of listening of throat singing you'll turn music off before your head explodes. It's much worse than in Rome 2... 
-AI cheating: Yes, that is daily bread in TW games, but in Attila it's... well... Have you ever wonder how can a country with one city have 2 full armies when you, with 5 cities has only 1 and half? 

I played the game for a couple of hours and didn't enjoy either of them. This Rome 2 remake is a disappointment!",1584891538,1584891538,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
