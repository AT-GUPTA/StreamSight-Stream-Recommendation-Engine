This is a Definitive edition of Sea Dogs To Each His Own TEHO it has all of the dlc from that game including bug fixes as well as more content.

This is a classic RPG sandbox Experience There is very little help you are just some guy with no skills if you were around in the 90's think about the OG fallout games instead of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L traits this game has P.I.R.A.T.E.S same thing you get to choose a Character Archtype as well as choosing who to play as which aside from what you will look like each one has a different nationality The Spaniard The English And The French The French guy was the only one you could play as in TEHO as such He's the only one with A fleshed out story everyone else has freeplay sandbox.

As far as the sandbox content goes that is where i have spent 145 hrs and personally i have had a blast i had to start a new campaign because you can make it nigh impossible by angering the nations to be fair i was pirating they're ships and enslaving the crew's but if you do that without knowing anything about the game like i did you're going to have a bad time in the very beginning since you have no skills you can't really pilot a huge warship i mean you can the game won't stop you but all of you're skills will be heavily penalized  see you can't be just a solo captain you need crew and officers to fill the role's that you are not skilled in and in order to do that you need to build a reputation as well as lvl up no one want's to sail with a rookie unknown captain so you have to build reputation by doing literally anything in my case pirating ships and as long as they dropped the cargo i'd allow them to leave with they're ship so long as it wasn't one i wanted if not i'd capture the captain and hang him while enslaving the crew eventually people start surrendering learned all that on my 2nd go around.

now the gameplay is pretty dated not much renovation from all of the old sea dogs games sailing ships is the bread and butter as such it's not bad each ship + your navigation skills handles different the ability to just fastforward time using the +/- keys really helps in some of the tedious encounters and after 145 hrs or sooner sometimes you just don't have it in you for an hr long sea battle watching as your crew reloads cannons to miss another volly on a tiny ship that has shot you're sails to tatters, now the land combat and boarding combat is not where this game shines it's like sid myeres pirates in the sense that during boarding your crews will hit harder and have more health IF you outnumber the enemy otherwise the enemy will be much stronger and one hit you and your crew. the land combat controls the same way except the men on your ship does not matter in how tough the enemies are its just you and your companions its honestly my least favorite part in this game the combat is pretty jank you can hold space down and block 360 degrees around you the combat stamina is pretty rough and if like me you have a massive bounty then in every port you will be ambushed by an army of bounty hunters honestly this part sucks however since the only way to increase skills is to use them eventually you can lie to them to avoid a fight or lvl up your weapons skill to make fighting them easier but it's honestly pretty lame so avoid bounties don't take loans and if you are gonna be a pirate raise the black instead of firing on friendlies there are ways to lower bounties but it requires a bunch of money and talking to certain people and in 145 hrs i can't figure it out so a pirates life for me.

the too long didn't read of it is as follow's :

if you were too lazy to read it or my spelling errors are to much then this is not the game for you  ",1708202314,1709064334,True,4,0,0.51804119348526001,0,True,False,False

This game has an outdated user interface and game mechanics. In fact, it is a remaster of the original series of corsairs and created more for the old narrow audience rather than for the masses, so I will not do a retelling of the plot and mechanics and will go rather to compare this product with the original series. 

Most importantly, it is operable and runnable on vindows 10 and 11 without any third party manipulation. In order to start older versions such as City of Lost Ships you need to sweat a lot or use a virtual machine or emulator. The interface has received some nice changes although it is far from ideal and still has some bugs. So for example, if at the start of the game you select another window, the game will lock your cursor on the center of the game and will keep so until you do not select the game window, but this is a small thing compared to the bugs and flaws of previous parts of the series.

Was to some extent modified graphics, but it led to the fact that in the presence of not the latest hardware (3070 and 64 RAM) still in some places there were sags up to 10 fps. Unlevel these sags can be adjusted game settings. 

An important detail is that now available several characters among which is the original Mr. Blood, but the presence of others gives you the opportunity not to go through the opening series of quests of Blood once again. Reduced the amount of character customization when you could custom spread skill points, now there are only a couple of ready-made presets from which you have to choose. 

In terms of gameplay, I didn't find much change. There were a couple of new generated typical quests, fixed bugs of some old versions. The most for me was that in the pirate settlements no longer have a diplomat who can restore reputation with factions. For 30 hours of play I have not met any of them, although I was looking for a lot. 

In fact, it is nothing but a remaster of corsairs to each his own. Do not expect anything new. This is an old game that is close to some people to tears and if all you want is to play a stable version of the game of childhood without too much effort, this is what you need.

I see people complaining that its still using the same old engine. You know what they are forgetting? its a nitch game. it would be INCREDIBLY risky to spend BOOKOO dollars on a full revamp then charge 60$.
For what it is, its a great buy imo. it just came out so yes there are some bugs and frustrations, but that comes with the territory being THIS GAME. Overall my experience so far has been fun, and for what it is i think the game looks great. Only thing id like besides some QOL updates is ability to change PIRATES stats in beginning of game. Im a fan of supporting the developers. I got it on sale for 22$ and would have paid 30, or maybe full price. perhaps 40$ is a little steep for it, but again remember it is nitch.
8/10 keep up the good work devs. finally got what ive been waiting for and you delivered timely as well!
I think some of the people downvoting this are missing the point, and what it would take to do a full engine revamp is outside the scope of what was trying to be accomplished. If anything, this seems like a test bed to gauge interest in the feasibility of doing such a thing, comparing the technicality challenges and audience. I hope more people see this game for what is is, get enjoyment, and rate positive.

I start off, and can't recruit anyone. 
I try to take someone to another island. They didn't get aboard I wasted a week trying to get to another island.
No one to recruit there either.
Talk to a lady. This forces me into combat with an officer who shoots me.

I go to the sea and try to find someone to fight. Once the boarding is over, I crash repeatedly into the ship and sink. 

I buy stuff to trade. Storm hits. I lose more fixing the ship than what I bought.

I try to go to have a look at a treasure map I have. 
I get ambushed by soldiers and they one shot me to death.

I try to find things to do on the island. There is nothing to do on the entire island.

I take a quest from the governor. My ship and crew are not able to fight anyone.

I go out to sea looking for things to do. Every fight is too much for me. 

In a fight, I can spam parry and then slice everyone, but that prolongs the inevitable, because all my crew are already dead. 

So, there is nothing to do, nowhere to go, and if you find something to do, you will likely die in some form and if you don't want to save scum, you are back in church.",1708979872,1708980120,False,3,0,0.46287006139755249,0,True,False,False

First of all, the gameplay is smooth once you get used to it, making it easy to navigate through the various environments. The combat system is also well-designed, allowing players to engage in intense battles on the high seas. The variety of weapons and skills available to the player adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, making it a true pirate adventure.

The storyline is also quite engaging. The game takes players on a journey through the Caribbean to become a legend, where they encounter various characters and face challenges that test their skills and wit. The story is well-written and keeps players hooked from the time they begin as a newcomer to a sea wolf.
One of the most impressive aspects of the game is the attention to detail in the naval battles. The combat is realistic and intense. Players can customize their ships with various upgrades, making each battle unique and exciting. And of course, every battle requires a strategy.

The game also offers a variety of new quests and missions that keep players engaged and challenged. These quests range from simple tasks to complex puzzles, and they all contribute to the overall experience of the game.

Overall, I'm very impressed with this pirate game. It has everything a fan of the genre could ask for, and I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for future updates.

At it's core this is a pirate trading game with light RPG elements, those elements being a skill tree and an attribute system with a quest system on top. The problem is that the trading is implemented in a way that makes it annoying and pointless, the combat both on land and water sucks, and the quests are often bugged or implemented in a way that makes them practically impossible. 

Speak to a quest NPC and say that you will come back later? Congratulations you just locked yourself out of the entire quest line. There is no way for you to finish that quest anymore. Enjoy! Utter garbage design, some quests require you to sink enemy ships for a reward of 10k pesos. When you show up to the location you realize the enemy ship is way out in the distance, so you decide to go into the traveling mode to get to the enemy ship faster. OOPS! The quest log just updated because the enemy escaped. Escaped where? I just saw them hanging around. Nah, the quest is over, do something else. So you reload a save you sail all the way to the enemy ship which takes you half an hour of real time despite putting the game on 6X speed, because of course the wind is blowing the wrong way only for the enemy to completely obliterate you because their ship is better and crew is better. So in the end after wasting all that time, you have to give up on the quest anyway. BUT FINDING A THIEF AND RETURNING WHAT HE STOLE WILL GET YOU 20K PESOS. He stole one tool. And this tool was worth 20k pesos. :I

First thing playing you will quickly notice is that your main character moves like a tank. Tank controls in 2024. Now this is a remaster of an older title, but still. Star wars jedi knight came out the same year as another version of this and movement and combat in that is immaculate. This movement makes combat incredibly annoying as moving around is practically impossible. You just stand there, parry and swing. That is it. It is laughably bad. Witcher 1 level bad. On top of this you start to get motion sickness from walking around because the camera movement feels so detached from your character. This game is vomit inducing.

What is the problem with trading? The problem is that the amount of time you are required to spend travelling between locations is several days which is a problem because according to the main storyline you have 6 months to get a certain amount of money. So you can imagine what issues would arise from that when the process of making even a little profit traveling between locations eats a considerable chunk of your time. Not to mention your starter ship, and the ships you can get in the beginning of the game in general lack the capacity for transporting large amounts of cargo. This means that for the first 10+ hours in this pirate trading game you will do no trading, only selling cargo from sunk ships. It is incredible that a browser games like caraveneer has better trading than this. Actually better combat AND questing too, play caraveneer.

Speaking of sinking ships, ship combat is terrible. You swing from side to side shooting bombs at your opponent until you believe they are weak enough to be boarded. I am quite sure the best strategy is literally to just spin in place like dradle firing from each side as they finish loading, comical stuff.The boarding teleports you into the smack dab middle of several enemies completely at random, sometimes you get insta killed, sometimes you dont. Try again if you get unlucky. The ships are also incredible cramped and thanks to character hit boxes being big chungus level massive you can barely move around. Frequently you get stuck in between your crew and your enemy and you get cut to bits as you can not escape, or alternatively you can't help your crew fight because there are rows of your guys fighting rows of enemies and all you can do is stand behind and hope your guys win. Fantastic implementation, no? 

The main story is that your brother got in debt and you need to make a million bucks in 6 months or your family will be in big trouble. Acceptable starting premise, but too bad the gameplay itself is as atrocious as it is so why would anyone bother playing it through.

Now some might have been fooled by the promotional material, more accurately the two women that are front and center next to MC. Well, you will find them pretty much at the very end. Barely in the game. The developer when asked if Mary could be introduced earlier instead of the very end just said that Mary is meant to be a ""easter egg"" so thats why she is only near the very end. Yet they have no issue putting her all over the promotional material and the games storepage as if to imply they have a prominent role in the game. Some might call that false advertising.

The game is shit. This so called remaster only remastered the superficial garbage nobody cares about. Better graphics, new items these were never actual issues. All the underlying problems are still in place and seemingly never being ""remastered"".  Some interesting elements ruined by awful mechanics and implementation.

Caribbean Legends is a remaster of an old Russian pirate sandbox sim, and it has some of the baggage you'd expect from that. There's a good bit of Russo-jank that still seeps through the cracks, like confusing quest designs, unforgiving time limits, and a penchant for letting you get way in over your head with no lifeline. This game doesn't hold your hand; it ties your hands behind your back and slaps your face cheeks with a studded leather paddle. There may be a few bugs in there too, but the devs seem committed to fixing those.
Underneath this prickly exterior is possibly the best pirate game you'll get in your lifetime. You can trade, smuggle, treasure hunt, or be whatever kind of privateer or pirate you'd like. As long as you're amassing doubloons and pesos, you're playing correctly. Port cities are all unique are fully explorable, and you can even trek into the jungles on foot to find hidden treasures or natives, whom the game doesn't always force you to fight (they invented barbecue, and deserve your respect).
It's all very immersive too. You have to buy maps, learn to chart a course through unfavorable winds, balance your earnings against the upkeep of your ships and crew, etc. You feel like a sea captain doing sea captain things. You can even move around on the deck in first person view as you sail through the Caribbean, watching sharks lurk about under the surprisingly well-rendered water.  There's a ton of depth and detail here.

When this game was announced I was expecting something great, but I was dissapointed. The game is still using the same old buggy storm engine, the textures are improved, but at best they look like upscaled 2009 Age of Pirates 2 choppy textures. I like the UI changes they made, game indeed feel's a little more modern.
What frustrates me the most is that the combat is still the same. What could be a 5 minute fight ends up being 30 min long attack, block, attack, block pattern that hasn't changed a bit from previous titles. After you and enemy used all your energy, it goes into a standstill, waiting for your enemy to recharge their energy so they could attack, cause that is the only opportunity you get to any damage to them, as they are constantly blocking. Even if there are your allies behind them attacking, they still block their attacks. So in the end you end up fighting 3v1 for 5+ minutes (WHILE speeding up time to faster regenerate energy).
In short, I'll just say that it's an advanced mod for the previous game with upscaled textures, new ui, a sandbox mode, tweaked quests and thats it. If you played previous games and was expecting some ground breaking changes that would make the game different and fun to play I'd recommend to skip this.

This is a very deep and immersive game, with lots of features to explore. It´s also a very frustrating game, with age old systems, bad translations and some very questionable design decisions. 

It's a pirate simulation game that tries to do everything. It has ships, sea battles, boarding, trading, smuggling, jungle exploration, treasure hunting and questlines about greed, betrayal and other recognizable pirate themes. You can pour hundreds of hours in this game, but just like in the Caribbean during the pirate age, it all comes at a price. A lot of people will probably quit this game after an hour or two.

So who will like this game? This is a very complex and quite janky Russian simulation game. That should already tell you quite a lot. It has countless of features, some of them are great, others not so much. Most of the common features, and above all everything that happens behind the scenes (and there is a lot), is not explained. You will have to research guides and forum posts to get things going. Also you will have to save scum, a lot. I sometimes spend more than an hour save scumming, trying to achieve the simplest thing, because the game just happens to screw me every time. 

This game also has a lot in common with the older Mount & Blade games, the original one and Warband. In fact, I think the Mount & Blade devs were probably inspired by this game, because it's actually quite old. This particular version is a remaster of a game that's practically more than twenty years old, called Sea Dogs.

Second, do not buy this game if you didn't play the Pirates of the Caribbean (Sea Dogs) from 2003, it will frustrate you from the first minutes. And don't buy this if you like AC Black Flag. This is more of a simulation and you need to sped hours to do anything.

The game needs a lot of work, especially in the waste of time for the player area. Quest are very ambiguous and is more of a trial and error game, spam the save button sort of thing. 

You don't really get a map or if you get one is more of an art piece, the islands are very big and there is a loading screen every 5  to 10 seconds, witch i'm not sure how the developers thought this was acceptable 23 years later. At least the first game had some markers on the islands.

It needs a world map, markers on the islands, fewer guards in town at night, fewer bugs at every 10 minutes, a more comprehensive guide for a new player, i mean, if a had picked this up without playing the original, it's a nightmare. 

And the balancing, men, it s really bad, i mean miss some delivery date for some cocoa and the game is over for you, the fine is so big that you will never repay and that s it, no more delivery contracts for you.

Escorting mission, good luck figuring out why the ships don't moor and finish the job.

Judging by my nine hour observations, Caribbean Legend Is pretty much an improved version of Sea Dogs To Each His Own (as expected). In comparison to Sea Dogs To Each His Own, textures are better , game looks and feels nicer. Some of the UI elements feel better, like the abilities tree.

I have been playing sea dogs series since early 2000s , so i am well familiar with this game engine and combat mechanics which by today standard is dated.  If you are old player in this series, you know what you are getting into. 
 
New players to this series be aware: Game feels dated, character controls & land combat can be frustrating. However,  navy controls (ship) are not bad at all.  By today standard graphics feels very dated, the game is build on 20+ years old engine. Also Quests can be frustrating because there is no clear pointer where you need to go, or who you need to talk to,  so use published user Guide  ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1286690349 ) .

Do i recommend this game : Absolutely! I have personal bias to this game & series, it reminds me of my childhood.

What a waste of all that great sea gameplay! 

If the game was like 5 or 10 bucks i maybe could look past it, but at the price they are asking, with a combat system so appalling, its refund time. I do hope they completely redesign the land movement and combat aspect of the game, to let a wider audience appreciate what was made here.

I checked the forum and apparently the way to advance was to stash my weapon before going to the governor, so to get through the tutorial you have to take a metagame action with foreknowledge.  That's just remarkable.

For me this game scratches that weird old school itch of doing what I want when i want with certain mechanics.

Some improvments do need to be made however your will run out of money on the turtorial if your not careful. ( develiper is looking into this. ) Like is said this is an old jankey game. There is a diamond to be found here how far your willing to go is up to you.  

NEW PLAYERS: dont be afraid to look things up and check out a guide or online turorial. It is a bit scarce at the time of me writing this however. If you can stick with it though there is a good fun game here ( NO ONLINE BS WHAT SO EVER) I am kinda of an old one coming back when i saw this as I only ever played this game on the xbox and that game was called "" pirates of the Caribbean "" by betheseda .  never heard of sea dogs before this either. I spent many hours on that game and i wanted to have something like that on PC. 
enogh of my old dragon ramblings go out and have fun with this or if its too jankey its not for you and thats ok.

So basicly tutorial is none exsisting, in story mode there is tutorial but it is same as ETHO, wich is slow and boring and tons of reading.Dont give me wrong i personaly dont mind that, but to new players ???? i doubt it.
One more thing i want to ask is what are we paying for here ? it is completly same game as ETHO, with just little bit polished cities...
Graphic is same, gameplay is same, i didnt see any inmprovment... HUD is little bit diferent. 
Things that were lacking on ETHO are still lacking.
On world map time goes waaaaaaaay to fast, dont know why????????
Camera is.................like i dont know how you didnt START remaster from this things ???
Camera is just... i dont even have words. When i am boarding i cant even see health bars because i cant move camera up...
Fighthing still the same... attacks too fast, but now you have pop up message that tell you to slow time xD wich is... like come on.
looting sistem is still bad. ( ofc because of camera again ) 
Questing i hope is not the same, but i just get started so i will see yet, so far it looks the same.( i am talking about lvl restrection for quest, wich i find very disapointhing, because it is all about our freedom of play right ??? i dont see that freedom if i have to always run to menage to get quest... and ofc i didnt get final lession quests, because i was under other quest and didnt have time, because ofc time on world map FLY like tornado)
There is a lot of other things i dont understand why are not changed...
I mean, nothing is changed but some visual efects and interface... wich i personally to be honest dont give a damn about... we want better gameplay of game, better questing, better AI of npc, to actually have freedom to do what ever we want, without always watching for our lvl, or thinking did we get this quest before this one, or that one. Plus that is all because I play ETHO and i know there are restrection, NEW players will not have clue.
So if you ask me do i recommend this game ? I must say NO
Because i dont know what did i pay for and i cant recommend 20 years old game that is unfinished, and that new players will not have CLUE what to do in game :/ sorry but that is just truth :/
Dont give me wrong i am hudge fan of this game, and i whould pay 50 dolars for it... just saying i dont know for what did i pay, but i play this games my whole life ( i mean sea dogs saga )
With this product you can only MAYBE and big MAYBE menage to get some old players that know what is happening in game, new players ?? hardly
So sadly i give this game bad review not because it is bad game ( it is one of hte best FOR ME EVER) but because i think devs faild us big time to be honest :/",1708255956,1708255956,False,9,0,0.533520936965942383,0,True,False,False

- Think Mount and Blade Warband but in a pirates of the caribbean setting
- 100s of Hours worth of gameplay
- Good balance between Story and Sandbox gameplay
- Ship combat is fun, hand to hand combat is a little less to be desired
- SAVE OFTEN (and in multiple slots) and always read the text during quests, this game does not hold your hand in any way and many crucial details are revealed as you are conversing and are not always noted in your journal

This game is not for the faint of hearts, sometimes frustrating, sometimes rewarding, always entertaining, i've been a fan since one of the first inceptions of the game that was released on original xbox in 2003 titled ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", then rediscovered the franchise with Sea Dogs to each their own back in 2014.

This is a sort of re-released updated version of that game. Graphics are pretty much the same as its 2012 counterpart with a few touch ups here and there. From what I can see so far they have done a much better job in the translation from russian to english, and alot of the frustrating bugs from the original are no more.

After a small introduction you are unleashed upon the caribbean (or the caribbean is unleashed upon you) free to do pretty much whatever you want with the aim of accumulating wealth by almost any means necessary. You want to use your ship to courier goods throughout the caribbean for local traders, you can. You smuggle contraband through the smugglers network for huge profit, you can. Buy produced goods for cheap in one part of the caribbean and offload it to a market in demand elsewhere for profit, you can. Or maybe you want to hoist the colors and sink/board/capture ships to make your money, you can do that too. Or maybe you would prefer the life of a military man and sign up with one of the colonial powers all competing against eachother in the caribbean, you can do that too. Perhaps none of that excites you and you would prefer to explore the map searching for lost incan treasures and tales of cities of gold, you can do that. All you can do all of the above if you wish, all the while progressing the story of the game which is an adventure in itself.

All in all this game will make you laugh, cry, contemplate refunding then reel you back in again and everything in between.
A must try for any sandbox and/or pirate fan.

Rant aside, the game is amazing, i played TEHO many years ago and was one of the best gaming experiences i've had to date, no old graphics/controls can change that.

Was eagerly waiting for this improved version to dive back into it and it feels like returning home.

My apologies to anyone I made that assumption about - you were absolutely right, the controls are just BAD.

Even if I could get past the poor controls despite offering a ""Window"" option the window isn't moveable.  Which defeats, at least from my standpoint, the whole purpose of having it.  Nearly every other game I play gives me the option to play in a window that I can move to a different monitor...but not this one.,  This one plants your game right in the middle of whichever monitor it identifies and you're stuck with it there.

Word of advice: try the free (at least it was at the time of writing) Sandbox game first.

The gameplay is old-school relaxed walk-and-talk, and I'm enjoying it a lot! The graphics, misic and voices are very high quality, so it's really taking the best out of old and new.

The setting resembles late 17th century and while I can't tell if it's historically accurate it certanly makes you feel the spirit of the epoch.

The dialogs sometimes are in voice, and sometimes are text-only (which is fine with me, I can't imagine every phrase being voiced overs, there's so many pesonages!)

The difficulty has been rebalanced so gameplay isnt impossible. I remeber playing the original for the first hour I was thinking I wasted my money but I gave the game a chance and got better at understanding the mechanics and truly loved it. This remaster has me captivated and has fixed alot of the issues I had with the original like the unplayable time sensitive quest, sailing, crashes, and the level and skill caps/requirements for quest.

Like other parts this one have minor bugs.

Things what should be fixed:

*Camera, character have very close camera look like in fights and by free run in cities.
*Cities in this game cities are very small.
*Character runing speed, :D he running with that small area like ship fights and small cities very fast, not talking about runing in jungle.
*Heavy attacks, if you fighting against 5 or 6 enemies, they pushing you into in the corner and spaming heavy attacks which can be dodges only with A D S dashes.
*Make bigger SHIP AREAS because it's too small and not even relistic.

Good things what I liked in this game is:

* Good new interface, it's modern and way better then in other parts.
* Stamina, it gives things like you are not unkillible captain and can't go 1 for all.

This is a much updated version of the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/223330/]Sea Dogs: To Each His Own[/url] and which is in a way a sequel to the original and the best pirate game of all times [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(video_game)]Sea Dogs 2[/url]. But more updates are on their way. Even though this is an old game, it is by far one of the best single player pirate games out there! It can even run on my potato laptop with [b]80 to 200 FPS[/b]. While some other devs out there are trying to make a new game like [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594880/]Corsairs Legacy[/url] that currently runs at 15-20 FPS on my laptop and has almost no content and is more buggy than this game. 

This game has more than 200+ hours of gameplay to offer, basically at least 1 month! So strap in and enjoy the ride! Is it more expensive than Sea Dogs: To Each His Own? Yes, if excluding the DLC. But it actually does include [b]all the DLCs[/b]. So in that regard it is already cheaper and less buggy. Also it is going for more replayability in the near future. And since there is no real competition out there for this genre, even though more than 20 years had passed, in my opinion it is worth the price and is much better than nothing!

[b]OLD PLAYERS[/b]
I am sure that you guys will enjoy the new look of the game. Anyways, I enjoyed the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782680/]Sandbox[/url] version of this game and as long as I can run it on my laptop, it is already good enough for me. I do indeed want to support the further development of this game. So I would like to pay for this game and keep it and see what it will turn into in another 1 to 2 years. I paid so much money for so many other games. With 400 games in my library worth $2.500, what's another $25? Am I right? I keep returning to this game anyways as I still find it the best pirate game out there. Maelstrom engine alone cost about half that price tag. And here we get all these visual updates and more in the same game, ready to be downloaded and play with no additional figuring out as to how to install this and that. 

[b]THANKS[/b]
So yeah, I would like to thank BlackMark Studio developers for returning to make this game a bit better. It is sad that back in the days Akella just ran out of funding for this game.

------------------------------------------------
And about this game, the Caribbean Legend is a remaster version of ""sea dog"". It features a big list of improvements on graphics, sound effects, controls and bugs.  some changes was made to make the game more appealing for modern players, well, more or less. 

The origin  ""sea dog"" series was born like 20 years ago, which is like a stone-age of modern video games, so the game has a lot of mechanics that may cause you pain. Like the stupid control style and when you play, the game offers limited guide and you have to pay attention to every mission dialog which is very long and wordy. If you don't know what to do, then you will have to check the log which is another long article with a lot of information for you to process. Caribbean Legend has a lot of improvements though, and they do make it much easier to play, but still its basically the same to the original game. 

For me? I am just a big sea battle person, so i can accept those imperfection and generally love this game. I mean a game like this is scarce,  to remaster it is more like a miracle , and i have waited for a long time. 

From what i know, there are only a handful of naval slash pirates sims on the market, but none of them can beat the ""sea dog"" series, not in general sense. believe me if you are into 17th centuries sea battles with some rpg content and open-world sandbox game play, this is your ultimate choice.

I went into this knowing that this was essentially the ""final iteration"" of a game from the early 2000s, but with reassurance from the developer that there were significant changes to gameplay and graphics that brings it up to ""modern standards""- that it ""plays like a modern game!""
Well, even going into this game with low expectations, I'm blown away by how outdated the gameplay is.

Tank controls while walking, getting hung-up on every minor object near you.
Trying to decipher the broken English of NPCs giving you quest objectives or half-baked attempts at tutorials.
High resolution (AI Upscaled) textures thrown on top of ancient meshes that would look at home in Runescape Classic cause quite the juxtaposition.

Going to the ""Atlas"" screen, I get the ""You don't have a map!"" notification... okay, I'll search around the shops to see if I can buy one. After awhile, I realize that I have a map in my inventory already?! Turns out you have to ACTIVATE and EQUIP your map in order to access it on the atlas... what an intuitive design. :p

I could've dealt with all of this jank if the ship combat made up for it, but oh boy...

Ships move and turn at a glacially-slow pace, which would be fine and dandy in more of a sim-game where the entire game is devoted to realistic (slow) naval combat, but we're talking about 30+ minute ship battles with the most boring engagement imaginable in an open-world RPG. 
Slowwwwly rotate your ship, get the aiming-cones lined up with the enemy vessels, fire, do 0.05% damage to the enemy vessel, keep rotating until someone sinks.

I'll come back to it at some point if it receives significant updates, but considering they're in the process of making a new pirate game in Unreal Engine 5, I'm not going to hold my breath.",1708021590,1708021948,False,209,7,0.822108685970306396,0,True,False,False
