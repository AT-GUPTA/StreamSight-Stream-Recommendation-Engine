One big problem that I have with this game is the naming of your character. You must pick a name that is not taken... this annoys me so much. I've spent close to an hour thinking about a name that was not taken. Now I login after not playing for a while and my characters have expired and require renaming? What is that? I've spent hours playing with my characters in HARDCORE, only for the game to force me to rename them? So in that regard, Diablo 3 is better since this never happens. Diablo 2 was even better however since I could have as many characters as I wanted and since I could name them without having to worry about ""that name is already taken"". I don't understand how game studios can design games with this limitation intended.

You can't call this an ""ARPG"" if you're forced to pick a name like :  ""asuhjf34w897yu"" which is probably already taken BTW. There is 0 roleplaying here when my characters ""expire""... Insanely bad design in that regard. I want to play this game Single Player... what do I care if 15000 other people have picked the same name? Have they never heard of unique identifiers for our characters?

I really wanted to play Path of Exile tonight but since I can't login with my expired characters and that EVERY name is ""already taken"", I think I'll just play something else. Well, enough of the negative, let's look at why I still recommend this title.

But this is a well-thought out, modern ARPG with classical medieval fantastic elements and original ideas. You start by selecting a character from multiple different classes. You can create multiple characters. Also you can create ""hardcore"" characters which if they die stay dead! Otherwise, non-hardcore characters are revived automatically. The ""skill tree"" which lets you improve your character is enormous with hundreds of choices.  Also, you have a large inventory and the items that are in the game are generated randomly. Normal, magical, rare items are present and more. Even potions can be enchanted. You have a paperdoll to see the items you are wearing. Quivers too can be magical. There are bosses and regular monsters and champion monsters. There is a wide variety of monsters. Obviously, this game offers the same interface and control scheme as the Diablo serie, Titan Quest or Torchlight and similar titles. The controls work very well, the graphics are beautiful, the sound is great and the music, from what I remeber is also good. So overall this is an excellent game.

The bottom line: For it's price (currently 0$) this is an incredibly good game to spend time getting invested in.",1487387343,1680318527,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The sheer variety of class and build choices there are is simply astounding, and it never gets old dying in a hardcore league, only to rebuild a new character.

-----------Old Review left to show the change in position----------

Bought Diablo 3, day one. Played for a handful of months and found it a to be a really nice house without any furniture. 

Play PoE. Give these great Kiwis a hand on making fine game that allows a player choice in how to play. 

Pros- Simply a great game. Going into detail would this review into tl;dr.

Con- Respecs. Don't plan on it. Plan accordingly or plan to grind out respec currency, and good luck with that!

Been playing since perandus and after three years I'll say that indeed, they will do what it says in their terms of use, they will cut your access to the game whenever they want, and even without reason.

Not sure if I p issed (steam censorship) off a GM or it happened because I was streaming and they don't want competition for the big guys, but either way my time in this game is over. 

It's a good game. Just don't put all your eggs in the same basket, you never know when it'll be taken away from you.

Game no longer randomly uninstalls. With new content out consistently, it feels alive. Game is very difficult to learn and get a grasp of, especially with the concept of ""make your own class"". With an extensive talent tree, mmany new-comers will go through deleting a few characters.

The game has an in-depth currency system, in the form of items such as scrolls and orbs, that players are constantly searching for. Because of this, it is possible to make a profit off of these lucrative (YONG YEAAAAHHH)  items, either through farming them or through trading.

Game is fun an enjoyable, especially as a time-killer. You may enjoy the game less-so if you are looking to actually make a profit off of selling items, as you will constantly have to search for the most Meta builds regularly. It is not uncommon for players to make pure support characters, termed as ""BUFF BOTs"", which is also a decent avenue for profit.

tl;dr game is only complex if you plan on just going in blind and figuring every little thing out and needing to solve everything yourself.

2018 Edit
So, Now I'm 1200+ hours deep in this game. I will touch briefly on a few of the things that make me spend an ungodly amount of time playing this game, and I will highlight the things that in the face of that, are minor speed bumps.

1. The community. It's probably the best community in an online game that will ever exist. Yes, we will argue in global 1 for hours about political topics after a stealthy bait is slipped into the fray. However, the feeling I get when I see a new player ask a question which is immediately answered by MANY people, expanded upon for clarity, or immediately rush to help a new player find their way, it really does warm my heart and make me feel fuzzy inside (OwO). We all know the online world is a rough place, and PoE is a great place to realize simple resilience is one of the greatest human qualities. You will find an overwhelming amount of agreeable people in Poe.

2. The in game mechanics. You can spend hours theorycrafting if it's your thing (and thanks to those of you who do--because you set the bar for what the rest of us do and can do) and still have such a vast array of possibilities at your hands. The permutations for some items like Ventors Gamble make you truly appreciate what the devs put into making the mechanics in this game cohesive.


3. It's fun to crash the game by doing lots of things


4. It's fun to be thicc


5. Small quality of life things, and selfish things(I'll start with those) like guild stashes (please let me ctrl click), price of mictrotransactions (please don't make me spend the price of an AAA title on a back attatchment) 


Anyways, this game is accesible to anyone who wishes to spend the time to learn it. After the short learning curve, you can be sure to have a good time with PoE if arpg's are your thing!",1485624957,1541158856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a great game. Try it out, its free anyway.

[h1]Review:[/h1]
Path of Exile is a ftp-Action_RPG game, released 2013 and being under continued development since then, having had multiple free expansions, leagues and content updates. It can be played solo or in a party with up to 5 other people on either soft- or hardcore.

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Free to Play, only cosmetical purchases
-dark & gritty style fitting the story and lore
-insanely deep and varied skill system
-smooth leveling experience
-expansive and challenging endgame
-interesting and unique currency and crafting system
-free trading economy
-seasonal leagues with their own twists and challenges to keep the game fresh
-regular free content patches
-big and friendly community
-around 5h of soundtrack
-nice looking cosmetical microtransactions

[b]Cons:[/b]
-this will eat your time
-start of play can be unimpressive
-since this is a always online game, connection issues can be a problem
-daunting skill tree
-through the leveling process you have to play the same story 3 times in increasing difficulty (changed in the future*)

*as of now, the new expansion ""Fall of Oriath"" has been announced for mid 2017, adding 6 new acts to the 4 existing ones, therefore eliminating the need to replay the story 3 times. (i have a boner)

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
For anyone interested in the action-rpg genre and disappointed by Diablo 3, look no further than this ftp-gem called Path of Exile. Challenging, rewarding and smooth to play, this appeals to everyone: the casual softcore to the min-maxing hardcore player. There is little as rewarding as building up your own character, theorycrafting, gearing, fighting, struggling and finally concquering everything the game has to offer. And then doing another one, thats complety different. And another one.
For someone new to the action-rpg genre, don't get scared by the seemingly endless possibilites and mechanics the game offers you, punch through the somewhat tedious first 2-3 hours of the game and enter the realm of the game that will suck you in and never let you out again.

as a long time fan of the diablo series all I can say is HOLY $@&*!!!
Opening the Skill tree is like shedding gods light upon your eyes and getting 3rd degree corneal flash burns!
*Awesome Classes
*Awesome Lore
*Great Span of Skills  leaving you with unlimited building
*Dark and Gritty D2ish feel while being original
*Graphics pretty on par
*LOOOOOOT SO MUCH LOOOOOT
*UNLIMITED SOCKETING AND UNSOCKETING GEMS...FOR FREEEE!
*Item filter customization (NeverSink Best IMO)
*Pretty good community so far even in Global Chat D: amazing!
*ONLY THING YOU CAN BUY IS COSMETICS?! WHAT?! YOU MEAN I DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO WIN?!
(you'll need stash tabs eventually if you play this game a ton but its cheap)
*Has Seasons I mean Ladders! With REWARDS!
 *Devs are constantly releasing updates and new content to keep the game fresh

Cons:
*This ones kinda iffy not a real big issue but I feel like the moves and actions could be a little smoother that being said it wont effect your experience with this wonderful gem at all its almost unnoticeable. (the one thing D3 did right)
*Wasn't too bad at starting up for a exp ARPG player, skill tree is a bit overwhelming  at first but I've seen the community telling new players asking about builds to just play the first time and enjoy it which is nice.

---A little advice that helped me so far being a new player:
Watch A diablo players guide to PoE and anything else that is good Tips and Tricks for PoE they really do help with a quick guide to the skill tree that will make it not so overwhelming. Please don't go to the global chat as a google you wont get a response I've found this to be true even with a minor questions. With that though I find it EXTREMELY easy to go from desktop to game quick which is surprising because I don't believe I own a single game that will let me do that without running really slow or messing up the game.

With this all said NOW is a perfect time to start playing this game with Tons of Solo and Multiplayer content coming, a new Ladder starting, and the new League starting which is basically round up past events with famous times that are buffed even better, Come play PoE!

I just cannot believe this game is free and here I am enjoying it more than some $60 titles I've bought.

- The storyline is too short and can be finished in 10 hours. You then have to do it again 2 more times on higher difficulty levels for more XP and better gear.

- You can't easily respec your skill tree if you made bad choices. You either need to spend days farming items that grant you respec points or you can start fresh with a new character. In fact, experienced players always warn new players that ""Your first two characters will suck"" so that should tell you something.

- Higher difficulties make you lose XP when you die. So basically if you're too weak to progress in an area of the game, the game's logic is to keep you weak. The only thing to do is to farm XP for hours by killing monsters in areas you've already visited and cleared without too much trouble.

- Farming for better gear is a chore. The drop chance is the same everywhere. If you want a specific item, such as a better armor for your mage, you can't farm it faster by going to an area where it's more likely to drop.

- There's no auction hall, trading with players is done through the public trade chat channel and private message. At best there's a third-party website that sort of helps organize trades between players but it's not exactly convenient to use (at least it's far from as convenient as a real auction hall would be). This is obviously intentional to keep the players playing and farming for gear instead of acquiring it easily from other players, yet the devs have the nerve to say that the lack of an auction hall it's a feature intented to promote player interaction!

- There's a new ""league"" every now and then. A league is like a separate server that lasts a limited time. When the time is up, your character gets moved to the main server. You must make a new character to join a new league. The thing is, some unique items can only be acquired in specific leagues. So to get them, you're forced to start a new character with every league. Again, just another ridiculous way the game tries to make you grind.

- The game is incredibly hard (again, to keep you grinding and playing). In other games there's a point where getting more health or resistances than you already have just makes things easier but isn't required, but in Path of Exile you need to grab all the health you can in the skill tree and max out your resistances (all of them at the same time, because enemy encounters are unpredictable and monsters aggro you off screen).

I keep dying in areas of my level. I have a good balance of health, mana and damage but it's not enough to survive long enough to earn XP and level up. I could have maxed out my health first, but then I'd either be running out of mana after casting just 3 spells or my damage would be so low it would take me minutes to kill basic mobs. To reasonably progress in the areas of my character's level, I actually need at least a dozen more levels. It's just ridiculous, but again the game tries to make you grind for XP, gear and everything else or otherwise you'd be done with it in 10 hours.

I don't know why people like this game. I assume they got tricked into spending money and don't want to face the fact it was a mistake (the game is enjoyable in the beginning, the frustration only becomes obvious halfway through the second playthrough). Or maybe these players just can't afford to buy games so they're stuck with PoE and have to make the best of it. Or maybe they have so much free time that spending 10 hours grinding for a few levels isn't a big deal to them.

Either way, the objective truth is that this game has an awful design. It's nothing more than a grindfest. Honestly I tried. I really tried to enjoy the game and getting through the tedious parts. I tried to believe the positive reviews saying it was a good game, or that end game was fun, or that you could overcome the difficulty once you knew the game better. But it just keeps getting more grindy and tedious, and the difficulty is artificial and there's not much to learn that makes it easier. It gets worse and worse as you play. I got far enough to realize that the game has only 10 hours of content and the only way the devs found to keep people playing is to make them grind for hours on end for a small bonus. If that's the impression I'm left with after more than 80 hours of playing, I'm not going to stick around for another 80 hours just to see if it does actually get better at some point. I'm not going to spend dozens more hours testing yet another ""good build"" recommended by an experienced player (I've spent at least 20 hours researching information to get better and I'm still stuck). 80 hours of playtime and all I see is a grindfest. That's probably because [i]it is[/i] a grindfest.

So honestly, stay away from this game. It's not fun or enjoyable after the first playthrough.

Edit: Also, the community is just awful. There are a few helpful mature players here and there but for the most part it's just rude and childish people. I've never had to remove so many insults and one-line troll posts from a review before in such a short amount of time. I'll start leaving non-constructive comments up though, that way mature people looking for actual information about the game can see the problem for themselves. And I'm not even going to mention the stuff I saw in the game chat.",1488189842,1488344563,False,37,2,0.498557716608047485,7,True,False,False

The game puts you into the role of one of seven possible characters, each with their own story, that has been exiled from their homeland and is forced to try and survive in the harsh and unforgiving terrain of Wraeclast.

Graphics: 7/10

Graphically, the game isn't absolutely spectacular. In fact, it's dark, gritty and quite gruesome. It sets the mood extremely well and really gives the image of a dark, foreboding land where the people are oppressed and monsters and bandits are rampant.  Some of the areas in the game can be quite disturbing and really set the mood of the game itself.  Although, as stated, it is far from graphically superior, the graphics and the design work really mesh well with this game and set the tone the whole way through.

Music: 9/10

The score of this game is incredible. It really works alongside the dark, foreboding land of Wraeclast and meshes extremely well with the environments that the player is tracking through to give the game an atmosphere that is really quite gloomy, yet aesthetically pleasing.

Story: 9/10

The only reason that this wasn't marked a Tye Dillinger is due to the fact that you kind of have to really find the story elements by talking to NPCs, finding stories and graffiti engraved on rocks and walls throughout your travels and really listen to the interactions that are taking place on the screen in front of you.  If you do take the time to learn the story, you'll find an extremely engaging and in depth masterpiece, with an extrordinary amount of fluff for those of you who want to learn the history of Wraeclast and what has happened prior to the land being in its current state.

Gameplay: 9/10

The gameplay is absolutely fantastic. With a passive tree reminicent of Final Fantasy X's sphere grid, hundreds of skill gems, hundreds of different monsters and enemies and insane amounts of differing equipment, the cusomisability of this game is second to none that I have ever found. Although there are only seven character/classes to choose from to begin with, that by no means locks you into a certain style of play.

On top of all of that, new content is released consistently from GGG.  Approximately every three months, a new league is created, trialling a new mechanic and potentially adding complete new areas, enemies and bosses to the game.  That league will then usually be incorporated into the game in some way or another, eventually joining mechanics from previous leagues and making this game truly challenging.

GGG are currently also hard at work on POE, creating their biggest content update so far.  The game will be expanded to ten acts, up from the previous five. Apparently, there will also be only one difficulty throughout the entire game, making it far less grindy to get to the end game.

The only reason I have deducted points from the gameplay is that it can be extremely daunting for newer players and the learning curve is quite steep. This is offset by the community however, which I will go into more detail next.

Community: 10/10

The POE community is one of the best I have ever seen. People are always happy to help out if players are having trouble. Trolls seem to be few and far between.  The POE community is home to some of the best and nicest streamers I have ever had the opportunity to talk to including Ziggy D, LiftingNerdBro, Zizaran and Pohx.  These guys are always happy to help if they can and will generally take the time to help new players. They each have several build guides that are perfect for players that are just starting out and will help you get a hang of the mechanics for the game and eventually learn to stand on your own.

Cost 10/10

F2P!!! There is nothing else that needs to be said here. The game in no way, shape or form is pay to win. The only slight advantage you can get from spending money is to buy extra stash tabs for all of your loots, which are quite cheap anyway at about $2 or so each.  This game is easilly worth any money that you will spend on the stash tabs. Other things you can buy to support the game are mainly cosmetic changes to skills and items, basically making your character look cooler.  That's it.

Overall: 9/10

An absolutely solid game, well worth a shot for anyone who is a fan of ARPGs along the lines of Diablo, Titan Quest or Grim Dawn.

Aside from a deep, complex and rewarding experience, the game taught me a lot about economics. Much like other popular MMOs with functional, live economies, the trading in this game is very dynamic and conceptually representative of real-world economics. To really grow and amass your wealth in this game players naturally develop business strategies that are applicable in the real world. Flipping, currency manipulation, product research, value assessement, market forecasting (legacy items), negotiation, marketing and monopolization are all important skills to apply if you want to be the richest in the leagues. Simply grinding through the game and accumulating wealth through linear progression won't be enough to a major influence in the economy.

The game is clearly made for the hardcore fans of the genre. There's a fair bit of complexity and very little handholding. At times the game feels downright hostile to new players as there are plenty of ways to permanently mess up your character build and the game does a rather terrible job of explaining many of the game mechanics. In practice you are pretty much forced to read wikis and guides unless you enjoy going through a lot of tedious trial and error.

On the other hand it's quite refreshing to see a complex character development system in this day and age when most games go for the dumbed down approach instead. The massive skill tree is certainly the most notorious example of this. I wasn't actually a massive fan of the tree, however. The tree just feels like a lot of added complexity for little additional depth. The skill gem system on the other hand is a great addition and offers some interesting choices between the different active skills and the various support gems. I would have actually preferred to see even more options and complexity here.

Unfortunately the actual moment to moment gameplay is rather lackluster and simple. While the character builds are complex enough, the actual combat is not very involved and you generally have only a few active abilities available to you at a time. This is something where both Grim Dawn and Diablo II do a much better job.

The loot system is pretty standard for the genre and not particularly exciting. The monsters drop a lot of loot but the vast majority is useless junk. Even most of the unique items feel rather underwhelming. I also strongly disliked how clearly the loot system is designed around trading items, something I personally have zero interest in games like these. The potion system on the other hand is a great innovation and one of my favorite features of the game.

Visually the game is not much to look at and the maps and monsters often look boring and dull. A bit more inspired visual design would have certainly helped. The game also suffers from rather serious performance issues and terrible optimization. Sound effects and music are passable, but not particularly memorable.

On a more positive note the free to play model is extremely well done. Most of the things you can buy are just cosmetics with no in-game bonuses. The extra stash space is really the only thing you need to spend money on, but the standard four tabs should be sufficient for quite a while unless you are a pack rat.

Overall I had somewhat mixed feelings about Path of Exile. On one hand it offers decent character customization and lots of content. On the other hand the actual gameplay is rather lackluster and the production values leave a lot to be desired. Still, it's almost completely free to play and as such easy to recommend. Just be prepared for a massive time commitment and a large amount of repetition if you want to reach the end game.

For this review I played once through the normal difficulty mode. Personally I didn't enjoy the game enough to push through the other difficulty modes to reach the end game. I also played a fair bit around the original launch, but I wasn't overly impressed by the game back then either. I'll probably come back for another look when the 3.0 patch is released.

The good:
- Superb free to play model
- Lots of content
- Good variety of different character builds
- Skill gem system is great
- Innovative potion system

The bad:
- Boring loot
- Good items are very hard to get without trading
- Bland visuals
- Poorly optimized
- Weak writing and utterly forgettable story
- Obtuse game mechanics
- Grindy and repetitive (which is normal for the genre, still doesn't make it enjoyable)",1487971732,1487971779,True,1,0,0.512587606906890869,0,True,False,False

It is among the most amazingly awesome games I have ever played. Coming from Diablo 2: LoD, and the various mods (Valhalla, Eastern Sun, Median, etc) this game is perfect for me. 

* I will start here, with the things that I enjoy about it.

1. Diversity among builds. Want to shoot a thousand exploding arrows per second (Quill Rain + Chain/Greater Multiple Projectiles/Exploding Arrow/Fire Penetration)? Want to blast rays of fire that launch exploding balls of magma (Scorching Ray/Cast While Channeling/ Fire Penetration/ Multiple Projectiles/Magma Orb)? Want to call forth the fury of the heavens with a mighty scepter, smashing your foes into submission (Mjolnir+ Lightning Strike/Arc/StormCall/Spark/Multistrike)? The sheer amount of ways you can go about destroying mobs is limited only to your imagination. 

2. Story is great, very interestnig, and keeps you entertaining while playing through the game. Unlike other ARPGS of similar play style, Path of Exile is able to effectively deliver a quality story along with the extremely well done gameplay.

3. Scenery is dark and grim, gloomy, morbid, and full of gore. From corpse ridden beaches, ancient temples filled with undead and skeletons, destitute crumbling cities, palace cellars flooded with blood - ridden with heaps of corpses and twisted miscreations, echocing crystal caverns of golems and mutated freaks. The variety in enemies and terrain is very broad. 

4. Item creation, map alteration and creation, uber dungeons. There is plenty of challenge to be had in this game, thus keeping you striving to achieve ever greater power and push yourself ot the absolute limits of your capabilities.

5. Infinite replayablity. I have made probably 50+ characters so far, and each one gets progressively more powerful as I understand more about the game, the mechanics, and how to build them effectively. 

6. Temp Leagues + Ladder. Nuff said.

7. Constant expansion and content updates. The game is constantly being updated, minor balance tweaks, additional items, skills, monsters, maps, etc. It's amazing.

8. Grinding Gear Games are among the most amazing gaming company. Really really good people and they constantly interact and have dialogue with the playerbase. ""How do you guys feel about X? Does Y feel right to you? If you could change X, what would you do and why?"" etc.

[b]I could go on for another thousand lines but I feel as though I got the point across. The game is amazingly fun and addicting.[/b]

[h1]Now, for the things that, I don't necessarily ""dislike"" - but things that I feel may dissuade other people from playing the game.[/h1]

1. Learning Curve is incredibly steep. Your first 3-5 characters will be absolute trash. You need to do a bit of research on what to do and how to build effectively, otherwise you're probably going to get wrecked hard once you get to a4 merciless. Here is a beginners guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZtq6FSebE&list=PLjlRwdIo6SixoG_Bo5bhKCzZtOMVuVnJZ&index=8&t=8s

2. Repetition of acts, 3 difficulties (however, this will be gone come July - TEN ACTS ONE PLAYTHROUGH HYPE!) Going from Normal, to Cruel, and then to Merciless can really put people off. Myself, I'm used to it and have done it since d2 so it's just a normal thing for the arpg genre. GGG are going to change that though.

3. Item crafting is [b]extremely[/b] expensive. Like, unfathomably expensive. I have never crafted an item before other than throwing an alch and a couple chaos into a rare item. 

4. Currency is nightmarishly rare. I've found maybe 4 exalted orbs in my entire time playing this game. Two of them were just within the last week as well. I have only ever owned two 6-link items. Wings of Entropy, and some random rare 2h sword that is garbage. 

5. poe.trade is the only real way to trade. $Chat is a scam 100% of the time. Once they implement a real trading system other than posting shops online and checking the forums every 3 minutes, or browsing poe.trade for an hour at a time trying to find an item to fill a hole in your build this game will be just shy of perfection.

Those are really the only negative things I can think of that might dissuade a player from sticking around... the game is magnificent.

I highly, highly suggest you play.

Learning curve is simple but can become complicated.

Best advise I can give is, READ THE SKILLS... Dont waste currency until you know its value, since there is so much varience in currency you dont want to end up losing a ton because you dont know.

Endless amounts of free content released at regular intervals that really make you want to support the developers.

The character customisation can be extremely intimidating at first, but with a little practice (and a lot of online guides) you'll be able create a character that perfectly suits your play style. 

If you're sick of playing the same old acts 2 or 3 times, PoE has you covered. They're releasing 6 new acts in which you go to new places, and revisit others to experience the impact of your actions during the first 5 acts. If there was ever a time to give Path of Exile a go, now would be it!

The community can be a little hit-and-miss but I've managed to find some really friendly, knowledgable people to help me out.

One of the most pervasive negative things about this game is definitely the trading system. It's fine once you get used to it, but expect to take some time out of gaming to learn the ropes. If you're against downloading external programs for trading then you might have some trouble selling off your gear, but it's not a game-breaking issue.

I highly recommend this game to any ARPG lovers. Just keep in mind that it's much more complicated than most ARPGs, and has a much steeper learning curve.

I joined this game looking for something to fill in the loss of ARPG games. I put countless hours into Diablo 2 and did spend time playing Diablo 3, but as time went on they were extremely repetitive. So, I decided to give this game a shot.

Never have I been more satisfied with a game before, and the fact this is free to play is just icing on top of the most delicious cake you'll ever try. They have taken the ARPG genre and have blown any other competitor out of the water. From the crafting, to how much content there is, to design of character talents and how they work.

I'm just going to be posting a summery of what I consider pros and cons here, but I am going to say that this game is an absolute must for any ARPG fan, and it may turn a lot of you Diablo 2 folk to the light.

Pros:
-To start, 100% free to play - There are only a few quality of life things in the store, which are just for inventory management and extra storage, the rest is entirely cosmetic, no pay to win/progress. Grinding Gear Games has also shown me what a REAL free to play game is, and has shown what it means to be a real game studio.

-Coming in the newest expansion, they are removing the typical ARPG element of repeating content 3 times in a row. It is being replaced with a total of 10 unique acts. Currently there are 4. A very unique stray from what a lot of this genre.

-A very in depth system to design your characters with. You choose passives rather than actually putting points into your abilities. It is a system which reminds a lot of people I show of Final Fantasy X's ""sphere grid"". Your class determines your starting point on this grid of passives, making it easier to reach certain stats. You earn a point to put into this tree each time you level up as well as from a few quests.

-End Game content is hardly as repetitive as any of the competition. While you eventually widdle your way down to a handful of them, there are several end game bosses to take on, and a mapping system that is as in depth as the crafting system for gear. You have 4 main paths on your atlas, a total of 126 maps, that progressively get more difficult as you find, roll stats on them, and progress into finding tougher battles. On top of that you can enhance these maps via sextants that you find, causing level maps to gain a temporary bonus effect, which can improve loot and spawm more enemies of various types.

-A crafting system based on leveling up multiple NPC characters that send you on daily missions that unlocks player housing as well that you can fully customize and grow in size with the characters level.

-There is quite a bit in regards to loot, stats, enchantments, etc. It makes really finding the things you need rewarding and worthwhile to use.

-Graphically, this game is gorgeous for an ARPG, especially if you like a dark, gritty atmosphere.

I am very happy to say that the cons of this game are very few in my opinion

Cons:
-Servers seem to be intermitant at times, and the game doesn't seem to like processing large amounts of abilities at once. Buffing a giant army of skeletons, for example...be prepared to experience a delay for a moment as it gets everything together.

-The difficulty of several of the end games maps scales severely, and causes a meta game that pushes away several build types in favor of clearing the game as quick as possible. If you play with online groups prepare to need a high clear speed, and people like to move as fast as possible through everything.

-3rd party tools are highly recommended to use in trading. The market is web browser based. The quality of life stash tabs I mentioned prior are able to post directly to the site, others who decide not to own these tabs are able to use 3rd party software to do the same thing however.

-While purchasing cosmetics are 100% optional, the pricing of these items is very high. I actually explain to people that these are MACROtransactions with armor sets costing $42 and individual items sometimes costing $32 or more. Still, 100% optional and it does help out the game considering it is FREE. Quality of life stash space to use the market from in game will cost you something around $10-15.

[i]Did you play and enjoyed Diablo 1&2?[/i]
[spoiler]Well, D3 wasnt what we expected it to be, tbh, that game is crap. But this game with this in-depth crafting system, the build system is un-explanable (You will get used to it thougth,, just look at the skill-tree, read some basics about build-crafting and you will honestly be set to go.)  the massive build variations in PoE.. I don't know what to say to explain myself short but, it's tbh the greatest, hottest, most amazing ARPG out there and has been and hoppefully stay so).[/spoiler]

Try it out, if you're a fan of Action-RPG, Hack&Slash die to an unexpected one shot from a detonate dead mob then this is the game for you. Mark my words, for real! Frikking frokking try it and play the game trougth once and you're hooked as if it was Mr. Walter White who cooked this game,

[h1]Some explanations:[/h1]
I honestly dont know how many hours i put into this incredible frikking frakking frokking awesome game made by the frikking frakking company Grinding Gear Games. Wich from the start had a staff on (idk, 11-13 active developers). *ChrisRNG*

Never played on steam really, that was after my time *_* (--> dedicated member since 2011).
 
To be fair I can just say, screw you D3! Path Of Exile is the game Diablo 3 should have been.
So a quick headsup for you guys who did ""try"" the game, running to Mud Flats and got bored.
Keep going, you don't know what you're missing out on.

The game is so much bigger than you could imagine, there is so many things to do.
Level up your masters wich will reward you with many kind of options, gear optimization, Atziri (End-game boss (UBER Atziri),  labyrinths wich will reward you with powerful passives in the Ascendansy tree. Different type of mods you can roll on different maps (maps is the ""mainly focused"" end-game content I guess.)

[b]Stop reading!! Go theorycraft, go look into builds, and you can thank me later.[/b]

[h1]How come the game is free2play?? Pay2Win???[/h1]
[b]NO! It's not p2w at all! It's up to you if you want to look badass in the new Golden, silver, bloody, goor MTX![/b]
+++ The trading econymy isnt viable by gold, you have different kinds of Orbs, for example:

+_* Alchemy Orb: Makes A white items into a(rare, items yellow random stats.
*_+ Chaos Orb: wich rerolls the affixes on an rare (yellow) item. 

+++ You don't HAVE to pay anything if you don't want too (there is microtransactions *Mtx*, skins, extra stash tabs).
+++ I have spent alot of money into this game and I don't regret it for a minute. But I don't get more powerful beacuse I wear my cuul armors from MTX.
+++ No, there is too much! Ill stop writing now and just listen to me and the growing community, the game is good, really, there is no.

Ginding gear games succeded.

A bigger review from my side, I will keep on suporting this game as long as I live, I promise!

This is the very first review I have ever written. In my opinion Grinding Gear Games did their best during the creation process of Path of Exile, they gave us everything they could. This game offers endless possibilities and countless hours of fun for absolutely no charge. We all should be thankful for this business approach while every other company tries to squeeze out as much money out of gamers as possible with unfinished games.  I highly recommend this game for everybody who was a Diablo II – Lord of Destruction fanatic. This game is so much more Diablo than Diablo III – Reaper of Souls.

On the one hand it's like playing against a slot machine, but on the other you could play entirely self found if you play enough. Everything revolves around play time. It's a game that tends to be better for those who have a lot of free time, because you won't get anywhere playing for a few hours a day. 

It's got a good community though and a lot of youtube content to help guide ya early on. It's fast paced and requires game knowledge and actual skill to suceed in this game. But again, it's like playing a random number generator simulator. Go online and try to roll 4 four's, 1 six and 1 three on 6 eight sided dice exactly.

To start off I believe one of the major reasons to just give the game a try is the fact that it's free. 

It's a amazing game that still recieves major updates ever since its release a couple years back. The content they add is really well done in my opinion as well. And if you're a fan of the original two Diablo games it's perfect for you. It's got that griddy feeling that made the atmosphere of Diablo, Diablo! When Diablo 3 launched I felt like it was more like World of Warcraft than Diablo. This game fills the void that it created. Don't get me wrong I still play Diablo 3 and I still enjoy playing every season. But the story just didn't grab my attention that well. Path of Exile's story is pretty good and fits the surroundings. It's concept somewhat reminds me of how Dark Souls puts you as the protaganist. You're the exile to surpass them all and triumph. Even though I haven't beaten the game, I still think that the amount of time that I have spent in it gives me enough reason to say that it's worth a try. I do like the way they give you skills. In Path of Exile you aquire skills through gems that can be inserted into weapons and armor. I like this because you can create builds based around certain skills instead of the usual I'm this class so I have these certain abilities. It does make creating your character a bit complicated however. It's kind of vague with the way it shows it's skills. The skill tree is massive though. The skill tree lets you put skills even in other classes skill tree. It's just a giant circle and your specific character starts out at a certain point based on which character you chose. As long as you have the skill points you can just work your way over to another starting point and create cool builds. The game gets really interesting once you start figuring things out. You can aqquire a personal hideout once you get an npc to level 3. The hideout is a place where you can craft and modify items. It's also like a personal home. You can buy decorations and move them around. Npcs can also be moved into it. With the new legacy league coming up in the game as well as the new expansion this summer I would say it is worth a try at the very least.

It was refreshing and I hadn't played a game like this since Diablo II, which was at least a decade ago. I made my first class a Marauder because I liked going two-handed weapons, maces specifically. Nothing really seemed so bad about this game. It was a very enjoyable experience. I found the story compelling and the graphics appeasable to the eyes. And since everything was voice acted so wonderfully, it made the immersion even better. The only thing I didn't like was that the story was so short (4 arcs which is like 4-5 hours each if you take your time and explore everything) and then they would just restart you into a more difficult mode.

I was skeptical of such a thing, but I figured before I rate this game I should at least reach end game or close to it. So having gone through the story once already, I just mindlessly grinded through Cruel (the more difficult mode after Normal) to gain levels and better loot. Now I restarted the story again into the most hardest difficulty which was Merciless! Things were getting pretty dreary here. There's hardly any party interaction in this game as most things are done solo. The only reason you would party up is either for XP grinding or you hang out with friends or a guild. The looting allocation in this game also dissuades people from partying because there is no dice interaction or some substitute for a fair and random way to distribute loot, but rather 

[list]
[*] a short allocation - which is that the leader of the party gets control of the loot for a short amount of time before it becomes availalbe to the rest of the party members.
[*] a permanent allocation - which is that the leader has full and permanent access to all the loot that is dropped.
[*] a free for all which honestly just creates chaos
[/list]

Eventually things just become a grind. And it doesn't help with the fact that your stash - pretty much similar to a bank in other games - has limited space and you are forced to spend money if you wish to increase the amount of loot you can hoard in your stash. I know it's a free game so I wouldn't mind spending money on that, it's just that $8 - $20 depending on which stash tabs you purchase for virtual storage space isn't exactly worth it in my opinion unless you are planning to dedicate a lot of hours to this game. 

Right now I am pretty much at the end of Act 4 in Merciless mode and I would consider that pretty damn near to end game. My Marauder is level 73 and for the most part I think I skilled pretty decently for not have following a guide. End game is pretty much the never ending grind of breaches, maps, and Uber lab which you will find out if you play the game. And like all other mmorpgs, it eventually becomes a grind. I don't mind grinding, I really don't. I've played many MMORPGs and specifically I've spent at least a thousand hours on Tera. The important part is that a game has to make the grind fun in a sense, and not just put your face against the grindstone type of grind. On my Marauder I am pretty much only using one ability, maybe two abilities depending on the situation plus 1 self-aura and 1 party aura that both grants me a massive damage boost. 

There isn't really much of a skill cap in this game. There's no important factors other then gear and putting points correctly in your skill tree. Yeah sure you may have to memorize some animations for certain bosses, but it's honestly not that fun of a game at end game. It becomes a boring grind, and I hate boring grinds. Some of you guys may ignore it, but for me there's nothing interesting to keep me playing this game. I've experienced all it had to offer, well most of it anyways, and I am pretty sure if I am bored of it now, I'll be bored of it later. That doesn't mean it's a bad game. It's a great game and I highly recommend that you try it out! It's a fun experience for those who missed out on the Diablo series and maybe you might just fall in love with this game as I did. Maybe it'll be a lasting relationship instead of both sides just losing interest in each other. Just maybe.",1487293122,1487293122,False,9,2,0.439139097929000854,1,True,False,False

[b]Who should spend time playing this? [/b]
[List]
[*]Any fan of Diablo 2, Torchlight, and other similar ARPG’s
[*] If you want a difficult and incredibly deep game with endless grind potential.
[/list]
[b]How much Money Should I spend? [/b]
[List]
[*]This is F2P, though it is certainly worth a $60 investment if you enjoy ARPG’s.
[/list]
[b]What’s it about? [/b]
[List]
[*]You are an exile that has wound up fighting for survival on a disturbed, violent, and hostile land. 
[*]Your goal is to collect gear and wealth and work your way through ever malicious boss encounters and waves of monsters. 
[*]Open ended Grind focused gameplay with tons of variety and loot gathering galore.
[/list]
[b]What is the Gameplay? [/b]
[List]
[*] There are 6 classes, perhaps the most well developed and complex skill tree I’ve ever seen in a video game, and hundreds of different unique skills that really will let you play the game in a whole new way dozens of times over.
[*] The game uses a skill slot system that is essentially Materia from FF7, you pick up items called skill gems which you slot into your gear to grant your character spells and attacks.
[*] The PvP is decent though most of your time will probably be spent focusing on PvE grinding and gear farming.
[*] The game is much more difficult than other ARPG’s such as Diablo 3, there is a lot to learn within the game and it is very punishing for players you haven’t mastered certain game mechanics and interactions.
[*]The game has various leagues that change throughout the year and add special gameplay properties that really help to keep play fresh and exciting.
[/list]
[b]Graphics/Visuals [/b]
[List]
[*] A good looking game with a macabre art style that is constantly improving all the time. 
[*] The animations and movement is fantastic and everything moves and interacts smoothly.
[*] The effects are the high point here, though certain character models are to a degree stale and bland, the games spells are vibrant and pop magnificently.
[/list]
[b]Sound/Music [/b]
[List]
[*] The music is rather good and fits the dark and somber mood of the game.
[*] Spells and attacks sound crisp but never become too messy or overcrowded.
[*] Dialogue is voiced very well and the tone of character voices suits the atmosphere of the game.
[/list]
[b]What does it compare to? [/b]
[List]
[*]Diablo 2
[*]Torchlight 2
[*]Titan Quest
[/list]
[b]Achievements [/b]
[List]
[*]The achievements are very straight forward and primarily focus on progression.
[*]Keep in mind many of them require hardcore progression, so if you want to 100% this game you will really have to invest the time to learn the mechanics and practice your gameplay.
 [/list]
[b]What are my overall thoughts? [/b]
[List]
[*]The best ARPG since Diablo 2 by far. Significantly greater depth, and difficulty, compared to something like Diablo 3. 
[*]The game runs great and is very well optimized.
[*]I have found myself spending hours just sitting in town looking at websites trying to theory craft a fun and unique build.
[*]The PvE is incredible and is constantly updated with new content and leagues to keep things fresh. I can’t speak for the PvP, didn’t play it much, but the story is well done and the zones are all unique and interesting.
[*]This game is F2P and there is absolutely no reason not to try it out. If you like action RPG’s or just RPG’s in general you could get your fix with this game easily. I personally Invested at least $80 into this game and encourage anyone who enjoys it to support the team as well.

With their content release schedule, it's almost like I get one or two guaranteed hype games to play each year. And not like No Man's Sky hype. GGG has, for me, consistently delivered a more than enjoyable experience that brings me back to their game regularly.
[*]It's free. Though I have purchsed many microtransactions/supporter packs, but I feel justified with my play time.
[*]I like min-maxing. I like theory crafting. I like games that reward you for applied depth of thought.
[*]I can play a build that requires me to pay constant attention. I can play a build that will allow me to watch Netflix. Play however you want.
[*]More reasons.

With PoE, you can spend countless hours running end-game maps and developing your character(s). 

One of the biggest pros is that the developer pushes new content out regularly in the form of Leagues, which adds new game mechanics to freshen the gameplay.  As far as developer support is concerned, GGG has to be near the top.

There are too many things ruining gameplay and have not been adressed as of now, one of the worst is desync. Loosing hours of playtime you have spend because your character dies and suffers a 10% XP penalty becaus the servers loose the exact position of your character and sends you back to a place where you had been a few seconds before isn't really fun.

This game may be inspired heavily by diablo 2 but presented a pinnacle of greatness out of itself.

+ One handed easy to play isometric hack and slash worldwide standard.
+ Main storyline, missions are decent enough.
+ Every single game mechanic is perfected to the extremes.
+ Huge skill tree, interesting gem properties resulting in brilliant active skills.
+ Artistic/Graphical side and variety of characters, enemies, landscapes etc. are a sight for sore eyes


Some of minor issues ""for me"" which has no effect on the value fo the game:
- Where is the pause button? Respawning of monsters in a particular map whenever you are disconnected or hit esc to get a coffee. You have to go through everytime.
- Too much unecessary loot (little bugs droping heavy armours!).
- Countless of weapons which make no sense. (a common problem with diablo genre)

 Bottomline : Evil Blizzard's worst nightmare.

Recommend : Play it now.

Lovely game, completely free. Non Pay To Win. The cash shop sells cosmetic items, and storage space. (Though you really get a big load of storage without paying a dime)

Deep character customization.
Beautiful graphics.
Runs on older machines in a graceful way.

Any attempty to try and understand the meta of the game is tied up in different concepts that, on their own are cool, but require you to put a TON of time into the game.

If you have the time to dedicate to a single game, this one is a good candidate. But the lack of a trading mechanism that isn't whispers with shitters and a skill point system that punishes people who don't have the time to learn the meta means I wouldn't recommend PoE. I've read multiple people say you're supposed to fail a couple of builds, but I don't see that as interesting or worth putting my time into. If I've failed at putting together a build, I'd like to at least be able to reasonably grind out respec points or reasonably tweak my build without starting over from scratch. I can only run the mid-game so many times before it gets boring. With the skill system's current state, you're better off putting tens of hours into what you can only hope isn't another failed build from scratch.

Build a decent trading system and help players who want to respec and I don't think I'd ever want to play anything else.

SMALL TIP FOR NEW PLAYERS:  Pay attention to your skill tree.  This is very important.  If your skill tree is not optimized properly towards what types of spells and attacks you plan on doing then you will not be able to defeat the higher tier enemys and end up grinding HARD.  Look up some good Path of Exile builds online or on youtube and follow those.

Abandoned it time after time for other ARPGs. Especially D3. But their inspiration is gone. Really. So I started playing PoE again. This time READING on how the class system and how the gems actually work. That helped. A LOT.

Loving this game now, and progressing steadily (act 3, level 29  (or so) Ranger).

Pros:
+ Free
+ No pay2win model. You can only buy stackspace and cosmetics (weapon effects, transmogs, etc).
+ Visuals are great if you crank up the settings.
+ Some quests have choices (with a different outcome/reward)
+ Skill gem system
+ No strict classes, a class is just a starting point in the (large) passive skill tree. But with enough points you can go anywhere.
+ Voiceacting is excellent
+ All items are (party) tradeable / giveable.
+ Loot item filter system (just download a premade script to get you started)
+ Upcoming SSF-mode (Solo Self-Found)
+ Game is under active development (despite being around for quite some time now)

Cons:
- Load times. My disk is not the fastest around (I play on a laptop), but the waits are sometimes annoying. Hopefully Steam will have the ""move local game files"" update soon for everybody, so I can move PoE to my SSD.

However unkown to me at first, since I just started playing it, it's far, far better than any of the games in the Diablo series. If you've played any isometric-type, farming, looting, grinding game then you already know what you are getting yourself into with this one. Another great game, not as famous as Diablo or any games alike, but it sertaintly deserves it. The late-game is what you will be aiming for in this game. However, to reach this you have to go through a couple of hours of grinding and looting, whilst creating a character which is completely unique to all others. With an immense skilltree, with every perk avaliable to reach on every charather, you can truly create some unique builds. Want a spell-casting marauder? Feel free. Want a heavy assassin? Feel free. The possiblites of character custimaztion done right are endless.

TL;DR
Played Diablo? This is better. If you like grinding games, like Diablo, Borderlands ect you will most likely love this game as well. A bit hard to start off, but once you get going you won't stop.

Unlike many games, this game is really fun, actually balanced, and has a lively community. It really feels like this is what Diablo III should have been but wasn't. The game's graphics and atmosphere are gritty and dark, yet all acts have a very unique feeling to them and the devs have really put a lot of effort into realistic weather effects. Sound, physics and design are all really well done.
The skill system will seem familiar to those who played Final Fantasy X. There are no real classes, all you really select is your starting position on a giant disc of passive skills connected through lines. Each skill unlocks those adjacent to it, allowing your character to travel along a specific ""path"" of related skills.
So, if you start with the witch, you will have easier access to magic skills, but that doesn't mean you cannot end up developing your bow skills as you grow stronger. Eventually you will unlock a character that starts in the middle and can literally be anything!
""But what about active skills?"" I hear you ask. This is a really well done system: You have items that have sockets, much like the old favourite Diablo II. But instead of slotting gems with stats into it, you slot skill gems that drop from monsters. These skill gems level with your character and can be freely traded between your other characters or other players. These two systems mean that every single character you play will be your personal creation, with a limitless amount of different ways of playing.
Finally, there is no gold, no zenny, no coins or credits. You trade with ""currency items"", which aren't just items you give to NPCs, they have actual functions. The lowest item is the identify scroll, and it goes up to orbs that can create special effects on your equipment.

So, this is probably the most unique game you will ever play, and it is totally free!
There is literally no excuse to not at least try it.

Here's what I like in my RPGs. Variaty.

I like to make character after character in a game simply to try something cool I found. I'll play a character 40 hours into a game, just to restart in the blink of an eye because I found something that seems cool and I want to see just what I can do with this new little toy. Not only this, but I do the same thing when a stupid, unconventonal idea enters my head and feel so good when it somehow works. 

This game right here, this game feeds that sooooo much, and I knew that was true the first glance I took at the immense skill tree. I have probably spent more time plotting a course through it, picking out what I want and the best path to get there, which route will take me through the most stats that will compliment my end goal, so on, so forth, then I have actually fighting.

and I love it so much.

This is a game that masterfully blends action and deep thinking and planning, and truely rewards you for practising both with potentially insainly strong characters. If you enjoy that, all the better. Each time you wonder if you can do better is a chance to start from scratch and plan it all out again, and the best part is that, for me at least, half of this game will, I suspect, take a super long time to get boring.


So now that I have more time and am genuinly ready to commit to this, it's time to ruin this game like I did with dark souls. Time to make more metas and suffer disapointment when people copy and spread it around.",1485447319,1485447319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some positives:
- Lots and lots of viable builds and room to be creative
- End game content done right
- Great community and responsive developers
- League system is outstanding and filled with consistent updates. A lot to look forward to every three months
- Very few botters and currency sellers. They have zero tolerance and dedicate resources to preventing/stopping them
- A true Free to Play game where there is 0 pay for power. With that being said, please support these devs by buying the aesthetics or account features, especially if you want to send a message that pay for power is not an acceptable revenue model for PC

Some downsides:
- Game performance and extreme over the top VFX on skills make it difficult to group up unless you have a super computer. I wish they would tone down the skill VFX a bit
- Because there is so much going on on the screen, it is very difficult to tell what is harmful vs what isn't when in a party
- Very intimidating new player experience with very little guidance. I honestly believe they can reduce the intimidation with some better onboarding
- There needs to be better options for trading. One of the more frustrating aspects of the game is having to leave your map or whatever you are doing to trade. I understand the downsides of having an AH, but I think there is a better compromise to be made.

the quests become boring very fast, if you finished the first act you will fly over the others faster and faster until you encounter the point where you could NEED some other player to go with you. well...if nobody of your real life friends play this game you can forget it. in the community you wont find SOCIAL or FRIENDLY people. only egoistic and rude ones.

Basically if you want something between (in terms of power creep) D2 and D3 that is infinitely replayable and has a huge playerbase that uses a trade system in which you interact with other people, you've found it!

Starting off, the lack of trading currency (not money, they have innate value themselves) to trade for good items, the slow drip of loot keeps you hungry for a better drop, well past long enough to hook you.

The ""talent tree,"" which is actually a giant web that connects all the classes, amalgamates the traditional stats and skills trees into a hugely diverse amount of possible builds. This of course occasionally results in insanely OP builds-of-the-week, which GGG soon has to nerf; watching the reactions on the forums and in global chat is always a good time.

At the end of the day, the biggest flaw to the game is just that it feels a little too grindy.

The seasonal aspect of the game is cool, but realistically it just means you're spending the first week or two every season just grinding the same three areas over and over until you reach level 80, at which point you're ready to start grinding the maps for crafting material that you sell to get better items.

Oh - and the inventory system is just plain stupid. Loot drops so prolificly that there is even a custom loot filter in place so that you can limit what you see to only the items you care about, but your inventory is so small that you can only hold 10 or so items before needing to sell. So realistically you just don't pick anything except the best stuff up, which ruins the whole loot piniata experience.

Overall I can't recommend this game. Diablo 3 is just plain better in every way. If you've played that game to death and are bored, sure, pick this one up and play for free, but otherwise don't bother.",1485114912,1485114912,False,2,0,0.406626194715499878,3,True,False,False

This game has incredible depth and unique varied RPG systems that makes leveling up really fun. You have the skill tree (similar to FFX) as you level. You also have skill gems and gem slots that allow you to add, remove, and mod skills with other skills. Its a very fun system. You can also level up those skills too. 

The gameplay is addicting and fun. Party up or solo its a great experience. Skills are unique and fun to use and mod, and the addition of 5 potion slots makes it even more vaied.

The only gripes I have with the game: I have to start all over again every new league, since the leagues specific content is not available in the graveyard I would call Standard (I think?) and it takes a huge amount of grinding to even get anywhere in the endgame.
