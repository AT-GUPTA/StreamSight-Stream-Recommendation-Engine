I wanted a downhill biking game and it was such a hard decision. Well, luckily I own both, so I can compare them side by side so you don't have to. I'll just copy+paste my review on both so you can compare the two without purchasing both. (Or, heck, DO buy them both. They're both EXCELLENT games in their own regard, with each of them having unique things that make them 'stand out' from the other.)

So without further ado, Descenders vs Rider's Republic.

Q. Which one 'feels' more like biking? Which feels more natural?
A. Hands down, Descenders. I don't know what it is, but I've never played a biking game where the riding just felt absolutely natural and 'right.' Don't get me wrong, the riding in RR is still great, but there's something about the flow of D that makes it feel like you're actually riding a bike. (Also, RR, despite being loads of fun, can feel a little glitchy at times.. and occasionally, if my Steam Deck lags a little, my rider will come to a dead stop in a heartbeat... which is somewhat problematic in a game all about maintaining high speeds.) In D you will feel the trails, feel the speed, feel the jumps. It feels right.

Q. Which has more to do in the game?
A. Hands down RR. I'll speak a little more about D in a bit, but let's be real here: RR has bikes, skis/snowboards, wing-suits and more (and skating if you buy the DLC's). There are all kinds of side quests in RR, different types of races, all kinds of goals and achievements... It is an open-world setting, and that world is filled with things to do. In contrast, while the levels in Descenders are large, the only kind of 'open world,' so to speak, are the lobbies and the multiplayer arenas (where you can't gain Rep).

That's not to say there's nothing to do in D. You can mess around in the lobby with other players, you can go on adventurous rides, conquer boss jumps, and pull off great stunts. You can go play in the multiplayer worlds. There's plenty to do - it's just not filled to the brim with content like RR.

However - it needs to be said that sometimes quality vs quantity is a thing. Maybe more on that next.

Q. Which has more VARIETY?
A. That's right - although RR has a TON of stuff to do, it HAS to be pointed out that Descenders' levels are procedurally-generated, so each time you go on a ride your paths will be different. Now, it's not so different that you'll feel like you're in a different world every time.. but the paths ARE different enough that it will absolutely keep you on your toes. You can't attempt to 'memorize' the paths like you can with RR. You'll ABSOLUTELY have to establish some real flow in D.

Q. Which has better graphics?
A. This one is VERY hard. While RR is an enormous game filled to the brim with details, there's something extremely beautiful about D as well. Both of them have highly detailed worlds, and each one has their own 'feel' to them. Descenders makes you feel like you're in this lonely, far-away natural world, while Rider's Republic makes you feel like you've gone on vacation to a huge park of sorts filled to the brim with people. The 'world' seems to flow a little more naturally in D, while the cuts between biomes in RR can sometimes feel a little abrupt. I don't know if there's a clear winner on graphics - despite RR having way more assets, the simple beauty of D has its own stunning appeal. I think this one will just be a matter of opinion for each player.

Also has to be said that it can take a bit of a beast to run RR at full settings. My Steam Deck seems to be able to handle most graphics-intensive games fairly well, but I actually had to turn down the settings on RR just a little because I was losing FPS and it was getting glitchy.

Q. Which has more multi-player/better function?
A. Probably RR, although the multi-player in D still adds a lot of fun. In D you can ride around with others in the lobby, go to multiplayer worlds full of random stuff, and encounter other players out on the trails. Far as I'm aware, that's about it. Out on the trails you're not really racing others, but it's still cool to encounter them.

Meanwhile, in RR, there are 'mass races' with 50+ other players (although I'm pretty sure there are plenty of players who are able to cheat), you can challenge others, etc. So yes, there's a lot more competition in RR. It's also a little more seamless in RR - in D, players have a tendency to 'glitch' and fly all over the place. Both are fun, but if multi-player competition is extremely important to you, probably RR.

Q. Which has more 'stuff' to get?
A. No clue. I have LOADS AND LOADS of 'stuff' in D. Bikes, accessories, shirts, pants, helmets, it seems like there is just no end of customization stuff to get in D. Meanwhile, in RR, I have plenty of 'stuff' like bikes, skis, snowboards, wingsuits, and all kinds of garbage... but very little in the way of clothes and accessories. Crappily,  it seems that if you want clothes or things like that, you've got to actually purchase (like, with real money) in-game currency to spend. I have no desire to spend money on clothes. That stuff should be won by playing, just like in D. Seems greedy of RR. 

One difference is that in D, the different 'bikes' are mainly just skins, whereas the different gear in RR actually have their own performance stats. So this is again a matter of opinion - if you like things to be fair and be more about skill, you'd prefer D, where everyone's bikes are on a more equal playing field... if you want to have the 'fastest gear around,' then I guess RR.

But remember, again, there are TONS of things to be had in D, and a lot of stuff in RR that is locked behind a paywall. It will be up to you to decide how you want to play it.

Q. Better music/sounds?
A. No clear winner. I don't usually like in-game music so I often turn music in games off, but in both of these games I leave it on. The music in D gives you more of that 'I'm riding with determination in some far-off and lonely world,' while the music in RR tends to give more of that 'woo-hoo, I'm riding like crazy in this adrenaline-junky world filled with people.' Each on has their own appeal.

For the sound effects, I prefer the ones in D. Once again, they just feel more natural. (Despite being a somewhat smaller production, there's actually a lot about D that just feels more 'natural.')

Q. Which has a better 'reputation' system?
A. IDK. Each one has a 'reputation' system where you can show off your skill in the game... It's REP in D, and 'stars' in RR. I'll say that the rep of other players is a lot more visible in RR. You of course earn rep and stars by doing well in the game.

Q. Which one has more daily/seasonal events?
A. RR. D has a 'daily run' which can be a lot of fun, but I hear that a lot of folks are able to cheat and get billions of points or whatever. (But then again, from some of the races I've done on RR, I am almost certain there's cheating there as well.) Meanwhile, there are always a ton of on-going events in RR.

Q. Is there a clear winner between the two?
A. Not for me. I play both. When I feel like playing with a ton of variety or against other players, I'll switch over to RR. When I want an experience that feels just about as natural as it can get, I switch over to D. When I want to try to earn the fastest/best gear, I'll play RR... when I want to win an enormous variety of customization, I'll play D. When I want a more open world 'free play' style I'll play RR.. when I just want to go through procedurally generated series of levels I'll play D. I really do believe that each game has its own unique strengths and weaknesses.

Q. Worth full price?
A. Wait for a sale if you can. But for either one, they're both fantastic, so it wouldn't be the end of the world to buy at full price.",1708789639,1708789639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aside from the D-pad (for movement), the pause button, and the menu button, game controllers have EIGHT buttons. It's a good idea for you geniuses to make games that only require the player to use, at most, EIGHT buttons.

- Game lets you try all of the year 1 pass toys like the rocket skis as well as the bmx bikes and skateboards for free in both some of the rotating weekly LIVE challenges, and some of those creators' custom events which is appreciated and helps players decide on what toys they wanna buy for the freeroam.
- Game will constantly populate the open world with short-life ghosts of players that make the world feel quite alive, it's quite the clever illusion and probably the first time I've seen a game try emulating world life of this scale, it's basically the next best thing you could ask for in an open world multiplayer game after, you know, the actual other players. (Which is especially awesome in my case if you read the last point in this review)
- The sense of progression with the account star system is fantastic, even if you login for 5 mins and grind some rails and that's it, you'll still get a star or 2. While mass races and weekly challenges are the best sources of stars, it's ultimately just an account playtime indicator which serves its purpose well. For reference, I've played for about 50 hours and my account has over 2000 stars. I've seen some flashy-looking dudes with hundreds of thousands of stars. Seasonal progression and rewards are also pretty neat with best-stat gear or exclusive seasonal cosmetics.
- Game is an absolute content creator's paradise! Between the ability to completely hide the HUD, the excellent photo mode and all of its settings, and more recently with the skateboard expansion, the replay mode? Capturing memorable moments here is super easy. All of the listed features are not new unique inventions by any stretch, but a lot of games choose to include them when they don't need to, or get how much flexibility to allow the player all wrong. This game has JUST the perfect amount of options without feeling too little or too many.
- Cosmetics and emotes are not too stingy if you don't spend and play those weekly challenges, but I would have preferred a bit more generosity on that front. It's kinda annoying that not only is the game NOT free, where the cosmetics only cash shop is an acceptable trade-off for monetization, but it's also not even cheap, and on top of that it still expects you to spend some cash if I want to get me some outfits with cloth physics or neon/animated shirts and masks? Pretty greedy from ubisoft if you ask me.
- I need a grappling hook/swinging mechanic, or short-range teleport. The game's greatest strength is its traversal and it's kind of criminal that I have all of these extreme sports available, but not a more unique/engaging way to encourage switching between them other than literally navigating terrain made for other sports. Perhaps that could be a great idea for a future expansion or 2 for the game.
- I also need a custom decal system that allows me to customize and paint our skateboards/snowboards/hoverboards/etc, or at least a gear transmog system that lets me copy the appearance of any of the unlocked skateboards/skis/rocketwings/etc to whatever I have equipped. The curse of choosing between good stats and good looks should long have been a thing of the past by this day and age of gaming, Ubisoft. Where it not for the good range of available cosmetics for your character, this would have been a MAJOR problem given that the game is all about YOUR STYLE, but thankfully this is just a minor personal inconvenience for me.
- I also don't understand why the game feels the need to be always online. There is a literal zen mode in the main menu which is basically solo mode. And this isn't a seriously competitive game where cheating is of any concern. Again, you will understand my frustration with this a little better if you read the last point in this review. I am basically always playing this game solo all the time anyway. This is a foundation that absolutely deserves immortalization in some form or another, it tries some wild ideas and it actually nails some of them quite well for some really fun times. I truly hope Ubisoft will include an offline patch that allows playing the game without internet at the end of the line.

- As a very chill game this is overall a little expensive, I would ultimately recommend buying either the skate or complete edition and ONLY when they're on sale. With that out of the way, this is the game I play in between my other big time-sinks and greatly enjoy the variety to this day. 
It doesn't NAIL any particular sport to the point of skating being more fun than a standalone skateboarding game, for example, or skiing/snowboarding being better than SSX/etc, (and I really hate the occasional jank of bike racing controls Ubisoft, please fix that shit asap), but it gets the core aspects of all of these sports right. And in the end, that's what truly matters as you fly/skate/glide/ski/bike across the chasms/mountains/canyons/forests/parks/snow. More content is planned for the next season including the new longboard and the custom event editor, so the game will continue to thrive for a time, I suspect.

- (Very specific and niche complaint which will likely not apply to you) Apparently, connecting to this game from Egypt causes ISP throttling problems which means I am not able enjoy any of the actual multiplayer aspects of the game (including the mass races), without using a VPN, and this sucks. Ubisoft doesn't give two shits about trying to change their servers' required ports for access so Egyptian buyers be warned on this one.",1707090556,1707090556,True,14,1,0.645664036273956299,0,True,False,False

Was looking forward to play this game. But after start playing this i feel so blended.
The game is great, but not for me. BMX is the only good for me. Rest of them were too much "" Fast and Furious"".

Kinda complex for an onboarding experience, not to mention there are a lot of sports to figure out at the same time. I have grown to like a lot about this game, pros outweighing cons but lets talk about it:

Pros:
- Competes with dedicated indy games and gives them a run for their money, while being an all-in-one solution (looking at Skating, BMX and Snowboarding/skiing, Downhill games) 
- Cool open world exploration with jetpacks, wingsuit, paragliders etc. Not to mention you can bike, skii and skateboard around too, almost seamlessly switching sports on the fly.
- Lots of various terrain, plenty of decent tracks but honestly even just freestyling down a path can lead to plenty of replayability as it's almost never duplicatable.
- Music choice is excellent (Ugly Duckling, Black Thought, People Under The Stairs!) for a game trying to be the Fortnite of extreme sports this is as good as it gets.
- Day/Night cycle, you can pick your time as well from the map.
- Community is alive, compared to many of the extreme sports games it's great. Compared to the most popular games, it's on the lower side. Like 50-100+ people playing on my server at a time from what I've seen.
- Multiplayer features work well, rare lag when more than 20 people are in the middle of your player during a 60 man race.

Cons: 
- Customization is honestly not that great, despite the large amount of choices. You either like something or you don't, no color changes, no different looks (like Skate 3 where you can choose hat tilt, shirt tucks etc.. not even hoodie on/off toggle)
- There are only a few faces to choose from for either sex and they are all cheeks apart from 1. Hairstyles are also lacking, not to mention beanies cut out hair completely (to avoid awkward clipping obv but that should have been addressed differently)
- Requires the Ubi launcher which only works in Beta and you gotta hit cancel three times on the open prompt before it actually starts up. Not the hugest hassle but it's more of an assle. heh
- Requires online connection at all times (the offline mode doesn't work when their server is out)
- The gear itself is cosmetically locked (there's no transmorphing it either) so if you want the best performing gear, bike, board w/e you are stuck playing a single item or two for the rest of endgame. Not even griptape for the skateboards, wheel color, etc... LOCKED.
- Mod support is made near impossible (still zero mods to this day) due to Ubi making their code extra saucy and trying to make some extra money on the cooler looking (in their opinion) gear which is made only obtainable by real cash. 

P.S. I'm gonna need a LONGBOARD FUNKIE for the Skateboard career.

P.P.S. PETITION to add AGGRESSIVE INLINE make it into the game! Ubi you already have a rollerblading game besides that the rest of the trick animations can be reused from the ski stuff - i.e. super low barrier to entry and you have untapped profit potential here as there hasn't been a good inline game since the Aggressive Inline on the PS2!

When I heard about Riders Republic teaming up with Prada, I knew I had to have it. Who wouldn't want to carve up mountains in the chicest gear possible? However, my journey into this open-world sports paradise wasn't all glitz and glamour, and it took a bit of time to find my stride.

As a die-hard fan of Steep, I went into Riders Republic with certain expectations. Unfortunately, my first attempts at skiing and snowboarding left me feeling like I was trying to dance in high heels for the first time – a bit awkward and definitely not runway-ready. The gameplay, especially for my beloved ski and snowboard activities, took some getting used to, and I found myself missing the familiar feel of Steep.

But fear not, because where Riders Republic truly shines is in its biking gameplay. The developers seemed to have put some serious thought into it, and biking through the expansive world felt nothing short of fantastic. The controls were intuitive, the terrain responsive, and I couldn't help but get a genuine adrenaline rush as I raced down slopes and took on daredevil jumps.

The disappointment with skiing and snowboarding was quickly forgotten as I found myself spending more and more time on two wheels, tearing through the landscape in style. It's like the virtual Prada gear was tailor-made for the biking experience, elevating my fashion-forward adventure to new heights – or should I say speeds?

While Riders Republic might not have entirely lived up to my expectations as a skiing and snowboarding enthusiast, the biking element saved the day, delivering an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. So, if you're ready to trade in your skis for a sleek bike and embrace the Prada-fied thrills, Riders Republic might just be the stylish escape you never knew you needed. Just be prepared to give those virtual slopes a bit of time before you hit your fashion stride!",1706192329,1706192329,True,4,1,0.484830796718597412,0,True,False,False

Oh, and I considered deleting my game save to start over in the hopes of identifying whatever secret task it is I need to accomplish to unlock the ability to like... play with other REAL people, and apparently short of creating a brand new Ubisoft account there's no way to delete your saves for this game.

Since I didn't want to do either of those I road the bike out of the starting area and just kept riding till a few of the previously shown events appeared back on the map.

The good side, the trick interface is a good improvment over steep. You feel more in control. The ""trick assist mode"" reasonably helps you land without feeling like its fighting you or like you don't have to try. The manual mode is excessively tricky to master but it should be, so that's fine.

The bad side, you are way more limited in what you can do in free roam or ""zen"" as compared to Steep. You can't just pick a spot, pick some equipment, and have fun. Plenty of equipment is locked to only in specific sports. This means ski-ing over to a snowboard event so you can ride a snowboard within the confines of that event.

If like me, you're just looking for a modern coolboarders to play, skip this entry. Because while the actual snowboard riding is fun, the getting to any of it is not.",1705439986,1705439986,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I tried this game for a few hours on Ubi+ and decided to pull the trigger while it's on sale.  
Great arcade x-sports game overall.  

The skate dlc is great despite a learning curve. You may need to struggle rewiring your brain to the controls like I did, but once you do this game is every bit as fun as any other I've played over the years.  I started with T and C surf factory and Skate or Die.  Love THPS, Skate, Skater XL, and Session. This is a great arcade skate game. Gameplay is most similar to Skate, but with better animations.  Not quite as good as Skate in its depth and freedom of expression, but close.  Contrary to other reviews you CAN choose from different landing options; assisted, auto, and manual. If you are curious and hungry for an arcade skate game to play while EA finishes Skate 4, check out some gameplay on YouTube.  

I bought the game for the Skateboard dlc, but overall the gameplay is solid. 

I turn off the music and dialogue as I can't stand the sterile vibe of the focused-group-friendly sports game aesthetic.

Paragliding

Snow mobile

The physics and gameplay are very boring, simplified versions of the many games they ripped off. It's trying to be Skate but with copy/paste execution that feels more like THPS. It's trying to be Descenders but with lazy, on-rails physics, automatic landings, and no carving. The snow sports are too forgiving to be enjoyable. You can pretty much slam and mash buttons all day without crashing. 

It would be nice if the servers worked but they have constant traffic issues that prevent people from even being able to buy these expensive features that should already be included in the game.

Its a fun game for sure. The biggest problem with Riders Republic is in how it somehow downgraded in comparison to Steep. Sure you now have a lot of more sports that are not just snow-sports. But the controls feel subpar in direct comparison. This is especially bad for the snow-sport-disciplines as Steep was feeling much better. I dont quite understand, why they would downgrade from their already existing systems from the predecessor. But thats how it is.

The progression system is absolutely flawed, as you have actual loot that differs in its stats. You dont feel like achieving something, because most of the time the loot is just pure useless clutter which you will also never use in the future because of the loot quality differences. This also means you have to play the game for a solid 50 hours+ to actually have the best items and be able to compete on the leaderboards. Its not even guaranteed to get a good item just by playing the carreer, which means you might have to grind endless hours just to get a lucky drop in the lootbox system. This is beyond fucked up in my opinion.

In Steep there was only cosmetic changes, which was good, because it ultimately means the only thing holding you back was your own lack of skill. Riders Republic is completely different. You will never compete before investing into the game at least 50-80 hours. You could say its the longest tutorial a video game has ever done.


I cannot say anything bad about the price, because what you get for around 40$ is a lot. 
I can understand the pain when you buy everything without a discount tho. Because literally everything is hidden behind a paywall. Wanna Skateboard? Go buy it. Wanna ride the snow-mobile? Go buy it. Steep was not different in that regards, but the paywall was not as big.

The whole presentation is made for 10 year olds and feels like playing Forza Horizon. In comparison to steep this is bad as well. Its not so much about the vastness of the nature and about exploring good lines. It also lost a big chunk of realism. Sure, Steep wasnt a very realistic game, but Riders Republic is even more far away from that point. Prepare to do 999999 degree flips while landing on a rail after a 500m jump.


Why do I still recommend it? As I said, I would like a ""meh"" option. But there is no other extreme-sports game out there which even comes close to this game. It has a huge map, and the different activities are fun. There is a lot to like. This game shines in downhill biking and bmx. It feels like it was made for that.

But if you only buy this game to play a Steep successor - you will be disappointed. I have warned you.
If you only want a realistic snowboard game, buy Shredders. If you want a Skateboard Game, better wait for Skate 4. If you want a good ski-game, yeah no, I feel you.",1703762298,1703762940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just gift it to my 3 other friends so I can make them to play with me now hahaha. They don't know it coming hell the game don't even on their wishlist so it is a surprise alright.

The game hosts various challenges you can tackle in about a dozen designated event types, snowboarding and skiing, mountain biking, flying with rocket wing and wingsuit, the DLC skateboarder and BMX as well as the toys. A lot of fun and varied ways to traverse this beautifully made map. If you haven't guessed yet; freeroam is easily my favorite aspect of this game.

You can also participate in races called events against CPUs, winning these will get you exp for the relevant career. Leveling your career up will reward you either with better gear or bucks you can spend on outfits. These outfits are on weekly rotation. While tastes are subjective I think there's plenty of good outfits you can earn for free. You can also earn gear and outfits from completing sponsor challenges.

Beyond this there's a lot more activities you can participate in like online Mass Races and Trick Battles. There's also Daily Sponsor Challenges, Weekly Challenges and Weekly Shop Rotations making you almost never run out of reasons to play even after finishing the main game.

Downsides
The game opens up with a tutorial and cutscenes, you'll quickly notice this game is a little cringeworthy, but that only makes up a tiny percentage of your playtime. The dialogue in general is a little cringeworthy, but again it only makes up a small percentage of your total playtime. The music isn't really good in my opinion, different strokes for different folks I guess. You can disable the ingame music, still use the other sound effects while playing your own music in the background.

Events are in my opinion the weakest part of this game, because it's an open world game it has to confine you to the intended area and route somehow. Basically keeping you from taking shortcuts during races or earning trick points in unintended locations. Their less than elegant solution is to put checkpoints every 30 feet. If you miss a checkpoint during a race you can kiss your victory goodbye. While an alternative solution is hard to come by, at least make the checkpoints less frustrating to deal with, I've lost tons of races just because I missed and arbitrarily sized checkpoint.

There's also little incentive to try if you can't make it into the top 3 as 4th till 12th (last) get the same rewards. I know it's supposed to reflect medals in real life, but from a gameplay perspective it makes little sense not to just make it more incremental. However once you have your gear you can mostly avoid events in the bulk of your playtime.

Monetization
This is basically an MMO so it should be considered a live service game and should be treated as such. Premium outfits shouldn't be considered any more or less taboo in this than other live service games like ESO or Warframe. Doing so is kind of a double standard. This is a game that gets regular updates and DLC. The developers need to be paid to get us that content.

I preface this because the game seems to catch a lot of flack for selling outfits for real money exclusively, However compared to other monetization schemes Riders is arguably one of the healthiest ones. I'd argue it's a really good example of how monetization should be done.

They're confident enough you'll enjoy the DLC items, they let you playtest them for free so you can make an educated decision whether you want to buy them or not. There are no lootboxes or fomo items as about half the seasonal Premium outfits can be bought outside their featured week and there's no pay-to-win at all. Even the bought currency isn't purposefully inconvenient as the incremental amounts you can buy are usually exactly what you need for a set number of outfits.",1702656027,1702656027,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I am really happy with this game for so many resons, like i got the game on sale for like 14 dollars!!!! I really thought the sale would be like 30 or somin but this game cost less then desenders! The main reason i wanted to get this game is cos i started playing desenders, then i saw this game and i was like, better graphics, bigger area, more detail, more sports and like snow cars and stuff. I was a bit thrown off at first by some of the other reviews, and did not get the game, however i ended up getting it just a small bit back. it is really fun to play. different bioms ranging from like snow mountains to the grand canyon to forests to the skies. i relly dont wanna type much longer so imaa get to the problems.

there is no sky box (i think). this does not seem like sommin to worry aboat but i'll give you a reason, at some point we all gotta see how high we can go, and then we are way to dumb to like fast travel to a nearby race. also the game is not really begtginer friendly, pretty good game.",1701998145,1701998145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics - 7/10 , good , but not amazing .
Difficulty - 8/10 the game wants you to learn to be able to do lots of tricks and score more points ... It's pretty hard , but fun .
Gameplay - 5/10 I give it 5 , because the game makes you sometimes handle easily , but sometimes it starts bugging out and it becomes actually unplayable for a moment , but it's still Ok.
Story - 2/10 No actual story going on in the game , just some chick that teaches you the basics and a welcome story line that is around 5 mins . long , cool intro tho .
Overall - 6/10 It's a very fun game , difficult at times and sometimes frustrating and annoying things happen , but that's ok , considering that you can drive a bike uphill with 60 km/h and downhill around 100-110 km/h . And yes you can fly in the game which is the hardest sport in my opinion , the controls are very weird and pretty hard to adapt to ...

But nobody wants to read another wall of text from an overtired idiot as he nitpicks a bunch of tiny annoyances and the industry at large. I'll stick to the big one. Well, the biggest big one.

The biggest issue with Rider's Republic is the camera and lack of camera adjustment. The first of the third-person cameras moves around a bit but spends most of its time too close and too low directly behind your character's back, making it difficult or impossible to see directly in front of you. The second one is thankfully zoomed out a bit, but it's even lower and off to the side so now it's hard to judge exactly where you're facing beyond having just a general idea. Some games do the second ""off-to-the-side"" camera angle pretty well but this isn't one of them. I'm sure it's great for low-speed flatland tricks on a skateboard but not for anything else. And as I mentioned earlier you can't adjust this. There are no options to adjust the distance or height of the cameras at all. Why not? That alone is enough for me to [i] STRONGLY [/i] recommend against picking up Rider's Republic, even on a good sale. If you're not convinced, a quick Google search can show you a wide range of camera complaints. I'm surprised it's not better reflected in the reviews here. Anyway, thanks for reading.

RECENT CRITERION:
I can confirm that Steam Deck support is well done and playable. My only issue is that I'd like to be able to play offline on Steam Deck which is not currently supported. I don't care if I don't progress in levels playing offline, but I'd like to have the option. I rarely ran into game breaking bugs like freezing or stutter. 

SOUNDTRACK:
9/10 Matches the theme of the game, but gets repetitive like all games. Just use your own music once you re over the OST.

GAME PLAY:
10/10 for this genre. The sheer number of toys you can use and the size of the map are insane. Then you have around 20-30+ missions for each ""toy?"" that add countless hours of progression. It's the perfect laid back Xtreme sport game that you can pick up whenever you're interested. I'd recommend increasing your trick difficulty so you have some challenge landing things rather than being assisted by the game.

CRITICISM:
Paywalls ofc. You have to pay for a few campaigns like BMX separately. You also have to buy skateboarding and/or the campaign for sb separately. The skateboard DLC feels like it pays homage to Skate 3, but since it's a small part of the game there are only a few skate parks right now. Some of the DLC toys are a ton of fun, but some of them are pretty uninteresting too. 

OVERALL:
If you're a fan of the genre then this is a must have. If you want a new skate game then this can quench your thirst temporarily. I know I'll be coming back to this game based on how fun the free roam is. It's got great graphics and atmosphere that bring me back to hit the slopes again and again.",1701063647,1701063647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even the base game should not be at the price it is during the non-sale period. But if you purchase it do mind that it may get stale after a few hours. The trick is to play it for an hour or so to get used to the controls and then quit it for the day. Only pick it up the next day to really see if you are a fan of it's gameplay (keep the Steam's 2 hour policy in mind though).

The good:
- More locations: 
- snowy mountains, snowparks, forest bike trails, deserts, canyons

- More sports:
- Skis, Snowboards, Bikes, Wingsuits, ""Jet"" wingsuits, BMX and Skateboards and possibly more in the future 
- each mountain sport has 2 variants: race and tricks 
- BMX have park and off-road variant (idk about skateboards)
- ""Toy"" sports: snowmobile, powered paragliding, hoverboards, jet bike & skis

- Better ""sport campaign"" challenges:
- it's clear which challenge is for which sport
- race and trick challenges have bonus side objectives
- tournament events
- actual collectibles: points, vistas and secret rideable gear
- in-game editor returns but it's overhauled

- Actual online gamemodes with other players:
- 64 player races for utter chaos (seriously, the devs who made collisions between players in mass races are absolute madlads and deserve a raise)
- 6 vs 6 trick battle (teams not only compete for trick score but also territory)
- free for all score attack and races
- ""live"" challenges (campaign missions but with / against other players)

And it works on Steam Deck / Linux now!

The bad: price - I'm not even rating ""Deck"" (skateboards) dlc because it's too expensive for now

Riders Republic features a variety of extreme sports, including biking, skiing, snowboarding, wingsuit flying, and more. The seamless transition between these activities within a vast open-world map is a standout feature. The controls are intuitive, offering a satisfying learning curve for newcomers while providing depth for experienced players. The sheer scale of the map, featuring iconic American national parks, adds a layer of exploration that keeps the gameplay fresh.

The multiplayer aspect introduces a competitive and social element, allowing players to engage in races, challenges, and events with others. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle further enhance the immersive gameplay experience.

Visuals:
Visually, Riders Republic is a stunning showcase of the capabilities of modern gaming technology. The diverse environments, ranging from the red rock canyons of Bryce Canyon to the snow-covered slopes of Mammoth Mountain, are breathtakingly rendered. The attention to detail, especially in character animations and equipment customization, contributes to a visually engaging experience.

The use of vibrant colors and realistic lighting effects adds to the overall visual appeal. Performance on current-generation consoles and high-end PCs is commendable, ensuring a smooth and visually impressive experience.

Socials:
One of the game's defining features is its emphasis on social interaction. The multiplayer mode seamlessly integrates with the open-world concept, allowing players to share the experience with friends or strangers. The mass races, where dozens of players compete simultaneously, create a sense of scale and community rarely seen in sports games.

The social hub, where players can gather, customize their characters, and access various challenges, adds a sense of camaraderie to the overall experience. The integration of social elements feels organic and enhances the overall enjoyment of the game.

Pros:

Diverse Extreme Sports: A wide array of sports ensures that players have a variety of activities to engage in.
Open-World Exploration: The expansive open-world map offers a sense of freedom and discovery.
Seamless Multiplayer Integration: Multiplayer features enhance the social aspect of the game, providing a dynamic and engaging experience.
Stunning Visuals: The game boasts impressive graphics, capturing the beauty of the diverse American landscapes.
Intuitive Controls: Whether you're a novice or an experienced player, the controls strike a balance that caters to both skill levels.

Cons:

Occasional Technical Glitches: Some players have reported occasional bugs and technical issues that can disrupt the gameplay experience.
Learning Curve for Newcomers: While the controls are generally intuitive, there might be a learning curve for those unfamiliar with extreme sports games.
Repetitive Challenges: Despite the variety, some players feel that certain challenges can become repetitive over time.
Conclusion:
Riders Republic successfully delivers on its promise of an adrenaline-fueled experience, combining extreme sports with a vast open-world setting. The seamless multiplayer integration and stunning visuals make it a standout title in the sports genre. While it's not without its minor flaws, the overall package is a triumph for fans of extreme sports and open-world gaming alike.",1700734157,1700734157,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are lots of NPCs everywhere you go and you'll never feel alone in the map, there are also lots of players sprinkled throughout the map for you to have those organic interactions.

The gameplay can be really in-depth and takes a while for you to get the grasp of it completely, but after that it all makes sense, it reminded me of ""Session"" and ""Skater XL"" in those regards. Talking about skate, the last big update was the addition of the skate sport, I didn't buy the skate edition and can't personally recommend that you do it so now, if you wish to play a skate game, those I mentioned before are better options. The base game with the year 1 pass combo appealed to me, the base game already has a lot of content for you to chug through and with the year 1 pass you have access to the BMX and it's events, with some accompanying ""toys"" (whacky funny vehicles) that add lots of events on top of the base game.

After you tackle all of that, in a few months time, get the skate with discounted price for added hours of gameplay. That will be my strategy at least.

I refunded this because of various issues...

1) Very slow at startup, especially on first launch

2) They display a dialog window telling the user that they are installing a program called BattleEye. You get no choices to not install this app. This program is a program that monitors your entire system and sees if you are using cheating mods. It will also collect lots of information about your account, system and game. This is a 3rd party ""spyware"" program that tracks everything you do while you are playing the RR game (I don't about when you're not playing the game). I have no intention on cheating because I only play single player mode, I do not do online multiplayer. So, I don't need this ""spyware"" running in the background of my PC. Plus, I don't think this a cool thing for UBiSoft to be doing.

3) There were issues in the Option screen that if I changed a setting the screen would turn white and freeze the game. I would have to end task the game.

4) I also had Black Screen issues when I took screenshots using the Print Screen button on my keyboard. Therefore I couldn't take screenshots for my own uses or posting cropped images on discord or where ever.

I spent 45 minutes trying to deal with the issues and only got to play 5 minutes until I had enough. These two programs are my only games from UBiSoft that I have tried... and both were bad....

WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT!!! Ubisoft is one of the most shady money hungry companies there is.  Yes the game is fun at times. Yes i do recommend buying this ON SALE on PS5.

-more Skinner Box and time waster mechanics

Confusing menu UI and intrusive tutorials, check
Horrendously difficult events that are unfair by design to keep you restarting over and over again, check

This game as it all, so unless you are desperate for your action sports fix or absolutely need it. Do not buy this game at 40$. Maybe spend 10$ at most or wait until it goes on sale for an absolute steal. And keep in mind, Riders Republic was not made with the action sports enthusiast in mind. It was made to profit off them and the brands in that space, you are just dollar signs, not players.

However, as a multi-sport game with a variety of things to do, it's really fun. I can see it being even more fun with a group of friends. I went straight out and bought the ultimate edition, not one to spend big on games but aside from the complaints about greed (£34.99 for a skateboarding dlc that doesn't even compare to skate 3 is a bit insane), the game serves it's purpose and I think I'll get my money's worth from it.

The main thing that caught me off guard was the controls, I tried to use the ""Steep"" preset which is nothing like steep at all and ended up settling for ""Trickster"". 

Once you understand how triggers correlate to your grabs + left stick being your tricks, and pre-loading an input before you jump, then after you jump with right stick to manage your rotations, I believe it's the best working option for all the activities. 

Some mechanics and animations can be a little bit janky and it is fairly arcadey, but it does what it does well and it's good fun.",1698495574,1698495574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To unlock the skateboard or hoverboard you need to spend over $20+ dollars, and you already spent $60 dollars to by the game in the first place. This game was good for its content in bike riding but for everything else it felt like a drag. My Personal a opinion is that this game is Overrated and in the trailer is looks 10x better than the actual gameplay. if your reading this review and you think i'm dumb because it has a skate edition well, there are other things that you can't see which need to be purchased, for example the hoverboard and snowboard.

They threw DLC activities at me straight at the start which is never a good sign, after finding the non DLC activities and after doing a few rounds or so I started to get bored and lose interest.

I grew up with Tony Hawk and Mat Hoffman BMX games and loved them but I found this game play to be quite boring, the graphics are ok but nothing great and the entire world and activities were pretty bland. I also really hate the physics.

I wanted to like it though as the idea is nice and I like the game genre but I just couldn't find anything at all to keep me interested in playing it.

Will change the review when they fix it for Steam Deck.

After installing Battle eye runtime to make the multiplayer work, the game is still lagging a lot going from 45fps to 15-20fps frequently. It works perfectly in Zen mode (offline mode), around 45-50fps stable in medium graphic settings, so I am assuming it is an error caused by battleye/the multiplayer and not the game itself. Gotta play it in multiplayer ON to be able to have any progress in the campaign! 

Hope they fix it soon cause the game itself is amazing, fun and beautiful and the Steam Deck can handle it judging from the Zen mode performance.",1696535413,1697175200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

why i need to buy the skatepack for 39.99 BUCKS when it should be in game included from beginning 
because they make a huge promotion with it and at least I thought that it was already included in the all in one base game.

40 BUCKS !!!!!!!!! come on you cant be serious.... 

normally for this i should vote negative but since the game itself is fun........you have to decide by yourself.

I bought the Ultimate edition with 1 year pass which is supposed to give access to ""exclusive additional content"" and it cost as the ""Complete edition"". After some time Ubisoft just replaced ""Ultimate edition"" with ""Complete edition"" and you will not find the Ultimate edition in the store.

I mean it is unfair and after a half-year, Ubisoft can replace the current ""Complete edition"" with a new addon the ""Full pack"" or ""Extra-complete pack"" and ask you to pay extra money again.

So I think Ubisoft should give players who had the Ultimate edition the Skate Plus pack addon for free because they already paid extra money for the game and they were promised to give additional content.

If I had known that the Ultimate edition did not provide the whole game I would not have bought the Ultimate edition and waited for the Complete edition or any other that would be the last one to get the real final game.

This game was a total disappointment. Its overly complicated UI makes you feel lost all the time. Finding stuff is nauseating and the whole freedom and joy of exploration that was the soul of Steep is lost here..
In steep there was constant urge to do better and trying again was motivating. Here you finish a race and be glad it's over. shut down the game and maybe return after you forget how painful it was.

Controlling is more clunky and less fluid. There are always some tiny obstacles that suddenly lock you into place not letting you go. The whole experience feels not fun at all.
And what I find the biggest failure of all: You unlock gear and get your favorite equipment but there's no point in using it because all equipment has stats so you're forced tyo use the ""best"" stats making the actual equipment irrelevant.

In Steep they were cosmetics so you could use any equipment and truly be ""you"". Here you are forced to use equipment some idiot chose to rank better stealing the decision from you. For example Burton Custom is ranked 803 pts while Nitro Santoku is 900 pts. IRL both are great boards but if you think Custom is Mikkel Bangs choice for Natural Selection Tour and Ben Ferguson has Custom os Hometown Hero no one rides Santoku. Jared Elston had Team Pro. Hailey Langland had Karma. Yet someone decided Santoku is better board here and if you want to use Custom you're putting yourself in disadvantage.
For DH bikes Cube Two15 is right there at the pinnacle with SC V10 but somehow GT Fury is worse?
And bikes that the very best Rampage riders ride are not elite bikes? Like Norco Shore, YT Tues, Canyon Sender, Transition TR11, Devinci, Hyper, Commencal.... No, but someone decided Cube of all bikes is the best your money can buy and is the dream bike of all humanity.

This game is a mess and not fun to play. If you like wintersports, play Steep instead or SSX. Or anything else.",1696161823,1696161823,False,1,0,0.496894389390945435,0,True,False,False

Had to change most of them from to their defaults to be somewhat playable, but still ain't cutting it. The fact that you do flips on flatground is a joke. Had to completely disable air rotations altogether because it's simply impossible to do a basic 180 or 360 -- it always flips! How bout putting flipping behind a button press? Also, having to press L2/R2 before flicking to do any tricks is just annoying and prevents me from doing tricks most of the time, since I seem to flick first before pressing L2/R2, causing the flick to be ignored. Moving the trick input stick in any direction does an ollie/nollie, which is a bit weird on flat as only down/up should work. Lastly, as others have mentioned, there's no goofy stance! I skate goofy IRL, so having to constantly press L1 to switch stances is incredibly frustrating.

there are big air and tricks you can do 
also if you want a Skateboard in this game its 40$, why? because they know people will buy that.
you can customize your character but not alot of choices, more choices in clothing though after you play more, most of the cool cosmetics are payed with real money

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
½ tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)

2 tbsp tomato purée
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice, to serve
soured cream, to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.

If you're looking for something similar that actually runs on the Deck, I'd say check out Descenders. It's a little older and limited to only down hill bikes but it's got a lot of replay-ability as the maps are all procedurally generated.

The world is beautiful, but the world building is so incredibly awful. Beautiful vistas are ruined by giant inflatable balloons floating around in the sky. Exploration is trivialised by a character calling you and telling you when there's something interesting nearby, with a big pop up on your map to further spoil the fun of it. The racing aspect is great but it's getting to a part when you're finally done being forced to sit through introductory cutscenes that is such an aggravating process I wouldn't blame anyone for refunding this in under 20 minutes. I shudder to think that every new player is going to be force-fed the same bland Ubisoft gruel that I had to suffer.

This is a simulated world built for simulated Gen-Z adrenaline junkies. Specifically a boomer's idea of a Gen-Z adrenaline junkie. Every single character in this game is annoying and embarrassing, there is not a single redeemable personality present. I press pause and there's my guy acting like a man-child using his skis as pretend machine guns like Rambo, or using his snowboard as a pretend bazooka, and doing the weirdest poses on post-game screens. My character behaves like the kind of person I'd be instantly annoyed with the moment they came into my vicinity. All of the cosmetics I've seen are terrible. Again, a boomer's idea of what they think Gen-Z will consider fashionable. It's the ""letting your child choose their outfit for a school day"" but as a whole fashion style mixed with overbearing product and brand placements.

[b]How do I know this game was designed by out of touch boomers?[/b]

1. In the home base there's a chalk board that references Thinking Foot, that old rage comic.
2. They use a cover of Gangsta's Paradise [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnq28ZtRJhw] with a f***ing Ukelele. [/url] How dare they not use Weird Al's version?
3. Everything Brett says. Every single word. No exceptions. His entire script is full of dialogue that will make your chocolate starfish pucker up with cringe. ""ThIs'Ll pUt tHe PiCkLEs In YOuR buRgER. [i]yUmmY yuM YUm.[/i]""

[b]So, now that I've gotten that off my chest, on to gameplay.[/b]

As I've said, you'll not start enjoying this game until you're a bit further along. That's not just because of the forced cutscenes, it's also because you will start out with gear that is categorically worse than end game gear by a whole lot. Turning, acceleration and breaking will all feel so incredibly sluggish until you get something halfway decent. I don't know why they keep the better content until you're 8 hours in, you'd think that's what they'd want to start out with, so I won't blame you for quitting if you do give it a try. In every race you're going to be many valuable seconds behind your peers just because you're new, not because you're bad.

You'll be able to unlock the snow racing, snow tricks, bike racing, bike tricks and flying careers for free, but the BMX career will cost extra, and I'm sure so will every career released afterwards too. You'll not find any missed opportunity for monetisation in this game. The cosmetic shop pulls the age old FOMO shtick by not showing you the entire cosmetic store at once. 

There is a handy dandy feature that lets you almost instantly get back up if you fall, and lets you rewind your last movements if you've made a mistake. However, I hoped they would've added an instant respawn button taking you to the last checkpoint since rewinding is so incredibly punishing. There are also some bugs causing you to lose races over a matter of seconds, such as getting stuck on props in the environment, and visual bugs such as [url=https://imgur.com/a/GrW1lK6]this[/url]. There is also no way to reverse on any of your equipment, so you're going to have to rewind instead, which is annoying. Also the costs that are attached to this thing are disgusting.

Between the high octane races and absolutely wild trick events, there are nearly endless ways to just... have fun. Riders Republic calls back to the days where games were just meant to push the player to do things purely for their own enjoyment, whether that be crashing into a mountainside on skis made from literal tree bark or finally nailing a trick that even the pros would fear to attempt. This game has permanently solidified itself within my favorites for all time, and it'll take hell, high water, and a lot more to pull me out of the Republic!

Fun gameplay absolutely ruined by the terrible out of touch music, the CONSTANT forced fullscreen reminders and tips that you cant dismiss until its been blocking your gameplay for a few seconds, giving you no chance to learn on your own unless you are me and just completely ignore it out of spite and frustration, an ABYSMALLY long tutorial that you cant skip, and $15 for a single vehicle with 3 skins (because not included in Ultimate Edition god forbid). Its more annoying than going through the Forza H4 tutorial for the 4th time over. Oh and the servers are down, forcing Zen mode to be played, giving me the realisation that I don't have access to my other paid content in the also progression locked single player mode.

But this is the only game that has all of it plus some other things (Master of none type deal). I like the art and vibes the game gives off. and once you turn off all the assist landings and junk it feels a lot better. But I don't love it. I find my self playing it and wishing it was something else. The cash shop, gear levels, internet connection, ties to Ubisoft, and lack of customization compared to Steep, just feel scummy over all. Campaign is to short and the missions become repetitive, with boss events being the only cool things to do. Becomes more about grinding good gear and less about having fun or doing cool shit.

Over all it's a good game but with a unpleasant after taste. 
I would say pick it up on sale.

There is a vast open world play area with lots of really cool challenge sections and some wild track designs. I love the ones with all the ramps and wooden structures to ride along. More than riding there's also tons of trick score activities to keep you busy.

After unlocking all the races there's still yet more swag to unlock and further challenges await you in higher levels. Multiplayer races are super crazy and tons of fun.

Performance is a tad weak but the graphics are incredible. I can't wait for skateboarding to get thrown into the mix! This game is awesome!",1692291815,1692291815,True,44,0,0.784830033779144287,12,True,False,False

I stopped even trying the flying events cuz of the unlimited boosts that bots had. almost every jump in the game has these invisible bumps right infront of them no matter what angle you hit it at it messes up your speed and then makes it so you cant jump I've had to restart events so many times because of this.

What is unfortunate is that you still have to sit through some unskippable cutscenes with dull-as-cardboard characters that add absolutely nothing to the game or world. With that said, I generally play this game with something else to watch or listen to in the background. This game is great if you like playing something while you kind of half-watch something else. That sounds like a subtle burn against the game, but it's actually one of its stronger features; it's very zen. There's even a ""zen mode"" which I haven't tried, but I can imagine what that might be like since I have found myself more than once just riding around, bombing down hills, trying not to fall for no reason other than I thought it would be cool. To make it better, if you successfully ride for a few minutes without falling you can pop open the race editor and it automatically traces where you have been going, allowing you to make the paths you've been riding into races very easily.

This is still, however, a Ubisoft game and no Ubisoft game would be complete without an overlong tutorial. Good lord, y'all. It's 2023. Please let me skip the tutorial. I'm a mature, functioning adult and I can figure it out on my own. I moved to the bay area without a job lined up having no friends in the city, and now I've been living here for 5 years. I CAN FIGURE IT OUT, UBISOFT. GET OFF MY BACK.

ANYWAY.

Everything feels pretty nice, but the controls aren't perfect. As an example, doing tricks isn't as seemless as in a lot of other games of this type. Tricks are accomplished by holding the triggers and pressing different directions on the analogue stick, but the right trigger is also used for acceleration with different vehicles, and it doesn't seem to register that you're holding the right trigger while you're in the air unless you fully release and depress it again. Because of this, I tend to do the same 4 tricks a lot which makes me just want to play more races and often avoid ""freestyle"" game modes. But to this game's benefit, there are a lot of races.

The progression system in this game feels good. You will earn levels as you complete events, which help you unlock new vehicles and the like. You can also unlock new things by competing in the mass races, and even if you place in the lower ranks you still get something, which makes you feel like your time isn't being wasted. You will also earn stars as you play, and season pass items unlock when you achieve certain amounts of stars, so there's a sense of accomplishment when you're doing just about anything in the game.

The real question is, is the game worth $60? My conclusion is no, but it's a really great game to get on sale. I think I bought it for less than half price with the Year 1 Pass included and I have definitely gotten my money's worth. If you like Steep and games of that style it will definitely scratch that itch. But you do gotta deal with that Ubisoft launcher though. Ugh.",1690233492,1690233492,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are fair, and the gameplay is very fun, especially the downhill chaotic races and wingsuit challenges. The snow events are decent too, and overall, there's a little something for everyone in terms of gear types.

The progression in the game is flexible, allowing you to earn bucks and gear via sponsors. However, I must admit that certain rewards can be grind-heavy, and this aspect could benefit from a little rework.

The in-game store cycles every so often to keep things fresh, but it does feel rather limited in terms of the content on offer. It would be great to see more variety and options for players to explore.

The game offers plenty of unlockable gear scattered throughout the world, which adds a layer of excitement to exploring the map. However, the thrill of finding them is short-lived once you've collected all the relics. Given the size of the game's map, I was surprised that further effort wasn't made to include more Easter eggs or incorporate mini-games to extend the exploration experience.

Despite some minor flaws, the game has much to offer and is definitely worth picking up. In its current state, I would give this game a 7/10 rating. And with the addition of skateboarding on the horizon, it has the potential to earn an even higher score.

Looking ahead, I hope the team at Ubi continues to support this title further for years to come. Expanding on the content, addressing player feedback, and introducing new features can keep the game engaging and fresh for its dedicated fanbase.",1688422543,1690082570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oh, Riders Republic, you quirky devil of a game! Prepare for a wild ride, both on and off the slopes, as this cornucopia of craziness combines extreme sports, hilarious shenanigans, and outrageous fun like no other. Strap in your seatbelts (or don't, I mean, who needs 'em?) as we navigate this wacky world that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter!

First things first, get ready to look at your character—uh, your alter ego—with an equal mix of adoration and uncontrollable giggles. The customization options in this game are off the charts. From perfectly coiffed hairdos that defy gravity to outfits that scream ""Wow, I paid a lot to look like this,"" you'll definitely be the talk of the Republic. And who can resist the allure of racing down the mountain while dressed as a giant avocado, or better yet, Santa Claus on a unicycle? Bring it on!

Now, onto the gameplay that'll make you question your life choices. Hold on tight as you hurtle down a variety of landscapes, including snowy mountains, sandy deserts, and yes, even the cityscape. But don't think these races are your typical serious business—oh no, Riders Republic encourages you to break all the rules and unleash your inner prankster. Launch yourself off cliffs into unsuspecting fellow riders, take an unexpected shortcut through a poultry farm (that's right, chickens included), or even knock someone over so expertly, they'll think they just got hit by a drunk snowman. Just remember, folks, it's not about winning—it's about making everyone cry with laughter!

Now, let's talk about the multiplayer mode. Strap it up and prepare yourself for the craziest party on virtual wheels. Join a crew of adrenaline junkies from around the world, laughing, joking, and occasionally crying together as you hilariously sabotage each other's attempts to reach the finish line. The truly beautiful thing here is that even when you're in last place, it somehow feels like a win because the pure joy and ridiculousness of the game eclipse any semblance of competitiveness. It's like a group therapy session, where the only medicine is laughter!

And can we take a moment to appreciate the bonkers events featured in Riders Republic? Whether it's a twisted game of ""Capture the Llama"" or a ""Wing Suit Watermelon Challenge"" (yes, you read that right), you'll be left questioning the sanity of the game developers with a massive grin plastered across your face. There's never a dull moment in these wild events, and if you're looking for something that will keep your friends entertained while simultaneously questioning your taste in games, look no further!

In conclusion, if you're seeking a game that combines extreme sports, outrageousness, and an endless supply of belly laughs, Riders Republic has got your back (and your sides). Unleash your inner daredevil, embrace the chaos, and prepare to be thoroughly entertained. Just make sure you have some spare pants nearby because you might just laugh them right off!",1689611719,1689611719,True,5,0,0.539923965930938721,0,True,False,False

Few games truly encapsulate the pulse-pounding excitement, freedom, and camaraderie of the extreme sports world quite like Rider's Republic. It’s as if the developers bottled up the adrenaline-infused essence of the great outdoors, and the result is a chaotic but thrilling playground of endless fun.

From the moment you first boot up the game, Rider's Republic extends a warm welcome with open-world freedom and diverse challenges that do justice to extreme sports aficionados and casual gamers alike. With picturesque landscapes stretching out as far as the eye can see, this title is more than a game - it's a digital tourism brochure for adrenaline junkies.

With the option to bike, ski, snowboard, wingsuit, and more across a wide variety of terrains, Rider's Republic is an extreme sports buffet where the main course is always thrill served fresh. Each sport boasts a unique feel and handling, making the transition from bike to board feel as exhilarating as it is seamless. Plus, the grand, mass start races are adrenaline-inducing events of pure, controlled chaos that truly test your mettle.

In terms of the social aspect, the game is a jamboree where you can connect with friends, meet other players, challenge them or simply take in the stunning views together. I can't count the times I've laughed, cheered, and shared memorable moments with players from all corners of the world. The world feels alive, active, and ripe for exploration.

Visually, Rider's Republic is a feast for the senses. It's hard not to be impressed by the lush, sprawling landscapes, the sun-kissed peaks, and the dense, mysterious forests. The attention to detail in the environment enhances the immersive experience, and I often find myself simply admiring the scenery.

As for the soundtrack, it's a spot-on blend of tracks that inspire the right amount of adrenaline rush or serenity depending on your activity. The ambient sounds of nature also contribute to a superbly immersive atmosphere.

The game is not without its challenges, both in the traditional and technical sense. Sure, there are occasional bugs and glitches, but these hardly detract from the overall experience. The developers have shown consistent effort in fixing these, and with each update, the game becomes more polished.

In nutshell, Rider's Republic is a thrilling love letter to outdoor enthusiasts and extreme sports fans. It captures the heart-stopping excitement and the indescribable freedom of these activities, making it a must-have title for any adrenaline junkie. If you're looking to conquer breathtaking landscapes and defy gravity in epic, heart-racing challenges, then it's time to strap on your helmet, and dive into the unruly, unforgettable wilds of Rider's Republic.",1689408430,1689408430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a shame really because I really enjoy it and I find myself in a constant state of stress trying to guess WHEN I will get my progress and efforts slowed down to a halt.

I am giving it a few more days for Ubisoft to try to fix it but if you see this review is still negative after July 2023 then i gave up and refunded the game.

I only have a few hours on this game so far, but I wanted to get my review out while the summer sale is still going on. This game is incredibly fun. There is something for EVERYONE in this game, you truly can play your way. 

The design choices are great and I will give some examples. For instance, you have the option to ""teleport nearby"" to an event but it does not directly teleport you to it and I actually like this because depending on where you are at sometimes you get distracted and just start doing tricks and racing down a mountain with some random guy playing online next to you. The jetpack I thought was goofy at first, but its actually awesome because you can use it to get to events quickly or to get into crazy to reach spots and switch to a different ride and do insane stuff. Another positive consumer practice is the BMX bike. The BMX bike career (story mode) stuff is all locked behind the 1 year pass, but you have full and complete access to the BMX to run around the vast open world and skate parks doing tricks and free play. Because I got to mess around with the BMX bike freely I grew to really enjoy it and play on getting the story mode for it once I beat some of the other rides.

It only takes one trailer to know this game doesn't take itself too seriously. That in mind you should keep your expectations to exactly that with multiple facets of the game. The physics are a little wonky, the speed absolutely outrageous for some sports and the dialogue is very ""how do you do fellow kids."" Not all of that is a criticism from my point of view at least but I guess this is a word of warning for anyone expecting a simulation of the sports in this game.

Do I recommend this game at full price? Probably not. It is fun but I wouldn't break out £50 for this.

I'll list out what I like and don't like about the game short 'n sweet.


Like:

[list]
[*]Open world is mostly decent with a variety of environments.

[*] Easy teleportation to get around to your preferred sport.

[*] Challenges and events keep you engaged for different content.

[*] Game gives a fantastic rush of speed. Especially participating in Mass Race events and/or going into first person.

[*] Music is ok and has a couple of stations to flick through for different genres.
[/list]


Dislike: (not so short 'n sweet)

[list]
[*] Wonky physics can sometimes be frustrating, especially if you're attempting specific tasks in an event. You will end up in a loop of restarts for some of them and that can sour the experience. The hoverboard for example is the best example of the physics going wild. Another peeve of mine is that starting a race in first-person can have you taking off at a weird angle. I have had to develop a habit of starting in third-person, then first once the race begins for some sports like snowboarding.

[*] The music is ok but the difference in volume between each track is staggering. I have attempted turn down all of the audio except music and I am still left with some tracks being as silent as a mouse. I have been relying more on Spotify to improve the experience lately.

[*] Progression (although improved somewhat in the latest patch) can be a little unclear and dull. A lot of complaints I see for this game is a lack of new clothing as you play. The game frequently throws new gear (bikes, snowboards etc) but it's purely a grind of incrementally better stats. If you like the look of a certain bike it will sadly be replaced with something slightly better in no time. I can only recommend players look at the sponsors window as soon as possible to give a sense of progression for cosmetics. There are also some items that appear in the store for in-game currency as well. Still doesn't seem like enough for me personally.

[*] Due to a lot of progression being tied to getting slightly better gear in each field, you will have to accept that in online events like Mass Races, there will be people straight up faster than you. I'd just recommend enjoying the spectacle and the track for yourself until you get better kit.

[*] The game loves to wrestle control from you after completing an event and you return to the map. I understand it's trying to highlight a new event for you but I wish it was much faster. This can be skipped with a couple button mashes at least.

In my search for a game that could lift my spirits, I discovered Rider Republic on Steam, and it turned out to be a surprisingly therapeutic experience that offered a much-needed reprieve from the depths of despair.

Rider Republic's vibrant and immersive world provided a welcome diversion from the weight of depression. From the moment I stepped into its expansive open-world environment, I was immediately captivated by the game's visually stunning landscapes and lively atmosphere. The vibrant colors, breathtaking vistas, and energetic soundtracks all worked together to create a sense of joy and freedom that had been absent from my life.

The game's wide range of activities and challenges became a valuable outlet for my emotions. Whether I was racing down mountains, pulling off exhilarating tricks on a BMX bike, or soaring through the air in a wingsuit, the sheer thrill of these experiences acted as a counterbalance to the weight I carried. Each triumph and accomplishment within the game provided a much-needed boost to my self-esteem, reminding me that I still had the capacity for joy and success.

Rider Republic's gameplay mechanics were a crucial aspect of its therapeutic value. The intuitive controls and responsive character movements allowed me to focus on the sheer enjoyment of the moment. Whether I was embarking on solo adventures or engaging in multiplayer events, the game's seamless mechanics made it easy to lose myself in the experience, temporarily setting aside the struggles of depression and embracing the thrill of the ride.

Moreover, Rider Republic's emphasis on freedom and exploration resonated deeply with me. In a world where depression can feel suffocating and limiting, the game's open-world environment provided a sense of liberation. I was able to choose my own path, set my own goals, and embrace a virtual world where the possibilities seemed endless. This sense of autonomy and agency helped me regain a sense of control, even if it was confined to the virtual realm.

Furthermore, Rider Republic's multiplayer mode fostered a sense of connection and camaraderie. Engaging with other players in events and competitions allowed me to experience a sense of community, even from the comfort of my own solitude. The shared experiences and friendly interactions served as a reminder that I was not alone in my struggles and that there were others out there facing similar challenges.

In conclusion, Rider Republic proved to be a therapeutic escape for me as someone battling depression. Its vibrant world, thrilling activities, and emphasis on freedom and joy offered a respite from the darkness, allowing me to find moments of happiness and accomplishment. While it may not provide a permanent solution to the challenges of depression, the game's ability to provide temporary relief and a sense of empowerment was invaluable. For anyone seeking a game that can lift their spirits and provide a therapeutic escape, Rider Republic is a captivating choice worth exploring.",1688940316,1688940316,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

⭐️⭐️ (2/5 Stars)

Riders Republic is a game that promised excitement, thrills, and endless fun. However, my personal experience with this game took an unexpected turn, leaving me feeling depressed, dark, and emotionally drained. Here's my account of how Riders Republic transformed me into a shadow of my former self.

At first glance, the game seemed like a thrilling adventure, with its vibrant graphics and the promise of extreme sports galore. I eagerly dove into the open world, ready to conquer mountains, soar through the skies, and engage in heart-pounding races. Unfortunately, my journey quickly turned sour.

The controls in Riders Republic felt clunky and unresponsive, making even the simplest maneuvers frustratingly difficult. It was as if the game itself was conspiring against my enjoyment, taking pleasure in my failures. The lack of precision and the constant glitches turned what should have been a joyous experience into a source of endless frustration.

Moreover, the multiplayer aspect of the game, which should have been a highlight, only exacerbated my misery. The competitive nature of the community transformed the once-exciting races into cutthroat battles filled with toxic behavior and relentless taunting. Instead of fostering a sense of camaraderie, Riders Republic seemed to bring out the worst in people, turning the online experience into a breeding ground for negativity.

The repetitive nature of the gameplay further added to my growing desolation. The challenges and events, which initially appeared diverse and engaging, quickly devolved into monotonous tasks that felt like a never-ending grind. The lack of variety left me feeling trapped in a cycle of tedium, draining my enthusiasm and extinguishing any flicker of enjoyment I had left.

As my time with Riders Republic continued, I found myself becoming increasingly withdrawn and disheartened. The game, which should have provided an escape from reality, instead became a catalyst for my dark thoughts and emotional turmoil. It was as if the relentless failures and disappointments within the game mirrored my own struggles in life, amplifying my insecurities and deepening my sense of despair.

In conclusion, Riders Republic failed to deliver on its promises of thrilling adventure and fun. Instead, it became a catalyst for my descent into depression and darkness. The clunky controls, toxic multiplayer environment, repetitive gameplay, and overall lackluster experience left me emotionally drained and feeling worse than when I started. It serves as a stark reminder of how a game, when poorly executed, can have a detrimental impact on one's mental well-being.

Disclaimer: Everyone's experience with a game can vary, and the impact on mental health can be influenced by personal circumstances. If you find yourself struggling with negative emotions, it is essential to reach out to friends, family, or professionals for support. Remember, your well-being is important, and there is help available.",1688940246,1688940246,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I love the game-play, the challenges, the huge open world and seeing the thousands of other players around me enjoying multiple sports in real-time.  The immersive environment and multiplayer events are intense, fun and nothing short of magical.  I've been excited about RR for quite a while and was excited to finally buy and play it.  There are two words why I am giving this game a negative review - Ubisoft Connect.  

As an adult who balances work, kids, wife, life etc. There is precious little time that I actually have to play games.  This is especially true for games that I like, but are inappropriate for my young children.  When a game comes out like RR that I feel I can play with my children, I get really excited to bring them into this hobby.  When my young son wakes me up early on a Saturday morning and I recommend to play a few video games, I want the game to work.  Ubisoft's madding system of negotiating multiple admin screens, dual security verification, email confirmation, internet errors, rinse and repeat, makes me just not want to play, let alone purchase any Ubisoft product in the future.  

I hope that Ubisoft can figure this out.  I stopped playing Farcry 5 about a year ago due to this exact same issue.  Compounded with an poor customer service experience, I nearly wrote off Ubisoft games at that time.  Coupled with this continued experience now with RR, I will think very hard before ever purchasing another game from Ubisoft again.

no achievements
-40 minute tutorial (what the actual fuck ubisoft?)
---Uplay launcher
-controls are stiff and not precise (even when using the manual control mode)
-you will not win anything until you're 300hrs in with the best gear. every race pairs you against ghosts with little balancing. You'll be paired up with a someone who's gear is far better every time. 
-mass races are the only real pvp racing, unless you're in a party
-the money you earn in game cannot be used for anything but helicopter drops. no clothing, no accessories, no helmets, no rides. Nope, you gotta pay premium currency for all that, or grind through the races to unlock season rewards. 
-bmx career is paywalled but they still give you the basic bmx bike. I assume the upcoming skateboarding will be the same. 
-holding down on the left stick at the start of the race to get your speed up asap will actually turn you around facing the other way after the go. Surefire way to lose a race
-last one is a bit petty, but there's no way to turn off announcers. These voice lines are so weird and cringe. Whatever personalities they were going for fell way short of lovable and memorable.

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH

The freedom to switch between activities kept me engaged and excited. The BMX tricks were satisfying, especially when I seamlessly transitioned from a high jump trick to a rail. It made me feel like a pro rider, and the trick mechanics were spot on. The presence of ghost players in the world added a dynamic and competitive feel. Racing alongside them and seeing them perform tricks created a lively and thrilling experience. The mass races were chaotic but incredibly fun. Once I learned the maps and improved my skills, aiming for a top 10 or even top 3 finish was exhilarating.

Overall, Riders Republic delivered an action-packed adventure with diverse sports, seamless tricks, and thrilling races. It's a game that kept me entertained and hooked from start to finish.",1688520141,1688520141,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's way too long, throws too much at you at once, and never lets you take a break to actually go enjoy the game until you complete it all the way through. It is UNBEARABLY LONG and tedious with the worst dialog of all time. I legitimately almost refunded it because it was that bad and I am NOT the kind of person to do such a thing. If you did refund, I do not blame you.

That said, if you made it through that agonizing process, you'll find an excellent game. I LOVED this game's predecessor, Steep. Played it here on PC and even more on PS4, completing every event on the latter. This game really steps up what that game already did pretty well in my opinion. Switching between sports seamlessly is really neat to experiment with and it makes the map effortless to move around in. The map is HUGE and full of both bots and real players anywhere you go; giving the ridge a real sense of life to it. There's a Zen Mode where you can explore the map without any events so you can simply just vibe while taking in the gorgeous landscapes. It's a beautiful world to just take in when you're not thrashing every inch of it with your sick tricks. The base game has plenty to keep you busy, but I'm really enjoying the DLC content so far. The BMX and Hoverboards are a blast to tool around with and give me Tony Hawk and Dave Mirra/Matt Hoffman vibes for sure.

Snowboarding and skiing are back with a different trick system which is both hit and miss for me personally. It is nice that they let you switch out control schemes on the fly at any point (even mid race!) and they even included the old Steep controls as well. It really takes a minute to get used to the controls, but it did click for me eventually. Wing suits and Rocket suits are back too and still fun to use. I will say the Rocket suit events are incredibly hard at times and even borderline unfair in some cases, so be prepared to redo them a ton of times. Wing suits got a bit of a rework and they handle more arcadey but in a very positive way by letting you gain some altitude to keep a line going via the boost button. It does take some of the danger of wing suiting that made it so satisfying and dangerous in Steep, but overall it's a welcome addition.

The downsides in this game basically boil down to a classic answer: Ubisoft. They'll nickel and dime you as always and the Ubi launcher is horrific. The DLC is, again, pretty fun, but it's not really cool to lock new sports behind a paywall. If you're going to add new sports, everyone should be able to use them. It's a scummy tactic that is anti player, plain and simple. I've experienced some stability issues where I've clipped through halfpipes and had plenty of bugs happen in my time, but never anything completely game breaking. It's caused me to have to restart events, but that's about as bad as its gotten. Usually a bug just makes me chuckle and it's fixed by just resetting my character. It still sucks, but polish is rare in AAA games unfortunately.

This game is FUN at the end of the day. It's a blast once you're able to access it. It's a wonderful sequel to Steep I've always wanted personally and it seems like there's plenty of content on the horizon still to come. Even if the people on the map are bots, it's really cool to see this active and thriving world as you're exploring it. Having someone do a flip over me on their snowboard while I'm in a bike race never gets old, and seeing active races in real time going on in the distance gives the world a little more vitality that other open world games lack nowadays. Worth picking up on sale, especially the deluxe edition with the extra DLC sports if you're interested.",1688517202,1688517202,True,15,0,0.694123983383178711,0,True,False,False

The tutorial takes like almost an hour to go through and it completely takes your controls and forces you sit through the map showing you what seems like hundreds of waypoints around the map, and seeing something like that when first starting the game could be enough to turn someone off completely.

I also previously played this game through the Ubisoft Connect launcher itself sometime last year, and had save data in the cloud that game downloaded from there. I wanted to delete the save data the game downloaded from there previously so I could start over and get a grip on how to play the game again. There's no option to delete your save data within the options in game, and no matter how many times I would disable cloud saves and delete the data on my PC, it would still download every time. No articles online helped either.

I ended up contacting Ubisoft asking if they could delete my save data and help me start over, to which they literally replied that they could not. I wish I could start the game over again so I could remember how to play, but Ubisoft is forcing me to be stuck.",1688504850,1688504850,False,5,0,0.540712952613830566,1,True,False,False

I have restarted the game and my computer and, yes my internet is fine (I can watch youtube, listen to spotify and in fact write this review dispite ubisoft insisting I am offline) and it still wont work. Since I am at the moment literally unable to play the game which, judiging by a good few other reviews discribing the same problem is probably not on me but on ubisoft, I can not really give positiv Feedback. I hope the game will start working again an other day since otherwise I will have to refund it. 

Dispite that when it DOES work it is quite some fun. Mind you I have not played the ""campaigin"" or what you call it and I have not tried any races. Instead I have only played the so called ""Zen mode"" which dispite not liking the game, I acctually love was added. I am glad that the developers realized that some people acctualy dont wanna suffer trough an hour long tutorial where a bunch of bad actors shout things at you that are so cringe and bad that you almost have no choice but to alt F4 and refund. I really liked therefore that there is a mode added that allows you to just get right into cycling or snowbording or snowmobiling around the map without anybody annyoing you with anything (as soon as you turn the radio off) and I think that expirience for me is diffintly worth the 15 Euros I payed for the game. Unfortunatly, dispite the notification stating otherwise I am still locked out form playing the ""Zen Mode"" when i am declared ""offline"" by ubisoft so no luck there for now either. 

Summed up I would say WHEN it works the free roam mode is quite fun and while deffinitly not being worth 60 I think 15 Euros is an accaptable price for it. Never the less if it won't start working soon or at least let me back into free roam when i am suposedly offline I am affraid it will still be a refund.",1688477774,1688477774,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am going to list some of the major issues i have with this game.The game can become hard locked at times putting you in either an infinite load screen or locking you into a screen where you would push enter to start the match but nothing happens, this has happened to me 4 times now over just a few hours. The game also has crashing issues as well, seems to happen at random. Server stability is not good at all! every time a player joins in on the game world you are in it causes a pretty bad lag/freeze spike to occur, if you have cross play on like most people normally would to have more players around the stutters/lag/freeze spikes are constant due to many people constantly leaving/joining the game world. I found that turning cross play off is necessary if you would like to cut down on the freeze/lag/stutters by like 80%. Obviously the down side to this is there will not be nearly as many people in your world, but hey i think it is worth it purely for better stability server wise. The other issue i have with the game even though it is not game breaking it looks god awful! i mean i don't know what happen here but holy hell it is bad! textures always fail to load in on time so you are always seeing unfinished textures along with many visual bugs that occur, as far as i am aware i do not believe the console version of this game had any of these issues according to what i found of the internet. Now i want to talk about how bad the controls are for keyboard and mouse users like myself, it is bad i mean really bad, it almost makes me wounder how much they tested before they decided to launch this game on PC. There are even tricks that you just can not do with a keyboard at all, like a nose manual on a bike or a wheelie, the game tells you push s or w SLOWLY to do said trick, how the F do you push a key on a KEYBOARD SLOWLY? yeah anyway point proven. Not everyone owns a compatible controller like myself, and no i am not going to go spend 60+ $ on a controller that i will rarely ever use. The other issue that i just recently started running into is the random disconnects from the game serves that occur, you can be in the middle of a race/competition and then all the sudden you get disconnected from the server for no reason at all. I am honestly so confused why people are giving this game a thumbs up in it's current state, the game feels like a half baked product, i mean seriously i have played early access games that are much more stable/visually better than this game. If you are willing to still play this game despite it's issues then i would say pick it up well it has a deep sale like i did, thankfully i only lost out on 30$ instead of 120$ for the ultimate edition. I will list my PC specs below for the people reading this thinking it is my computer being a potato. I forgot to add that almost everything in this game seems to be a pay with real life money to unlock. (like the bmx bikes)

There's an unskippable 45 minute long tutorial. Every single line of dialogue is atrocious. The music selection is pretty limited. Everything interesting for the character customization is locked behind a paywall. The trick system is straight up bad.

If you crank the dialogue volume down to zero and get past the tutorial, you'll find a game with an incredible sense of speed and an absurd amount of ways to ride. Ride bikes downhill. Take a ski jump. Use a jetpack to soar through the sky. All of this can be done in one continuous run, as the game lets you swap equipment while playing. I've flown my jetpack at breakneck speeds towards a ramp, swapped to a bike, and before landing the jump, switched over to a big wheeled tricycle, because why not?

There's an absolutely ludicrous amount of routes to ride, and every 30 minutes, a 64 player event can be joined that is utter chaos in the best ways.

I have played this game for many hours now, and my opinion of it has only improved over time. It is an incredibly addictive game that you can easily hop in and out of for both short and long play sessions.

THE INTRO: The intro can be as short as a couple hours or as long as 20 hours depending on how quickly you progress. As a casual player, I'm not even sure what specifically constitutes the ""intro"" other than unlocking all the sports, which does take a while. For some, the zen mode where you freely ride alone may be the most enjoyable.  

CONTROLS: The controls have a learning curve and took me a while to get used to. They are a mix of SSX and Tony Hawk. I originally hated the controls and repeatedly changed them to find a better setup. What ultimately helped was mapping all the tricks to the D-pad and the original D-pad controls to the letter buttons. This helped me understand how the tricks actually work by directing your rider left, right, up and down. Once I grasped that, I switched back to the default controls, and the letter mappings made more sense. This method may not work for everyone but helped me tremendously. 

MULTIPLAYER: Playing with friends can be frustrating at first but is enjoyable. You can ride together in the open world and challenge each other. Finding each other initially is difficult, so I recommend turning on the visible line in the accessibility settings which draws a line between players within 20 feet of each other. This is especially helpful when you're still learning how to control your rider. 

One thing you can't do in multiplayer is complete tasks together. Like to progress through the actual game you have to play every track solo and finish it at least once alone. You can always challenge friends and build your own track, but it would be very nice if I could somehow do some of the actual missions along with my friend if I've already completed them. Would be fun to watch or to be able to do it along with a friend while we both unlock things independently. Something like that? Just kinda sucks to kinda always bounce in and out of social groups. The multiplayer battle modes are fun, but I haven't really explored them much. There really is a lot going on in this game, which is why the intro is so long. It kind of needs to be.

DIFFICULTY: The difficulty is customizable. Easy settings are highly recommended for the first couple of hours as you get used to the speed and controls. The difficulty provides a real thrill once you progress to the pro levels. A small mistake at high speeds can end a race in an instant, which can be panic-inducing but feels extremely rewarding when you succeed. Reseting your rider after a crash is immediate, but the falls can be jarring enough that I often leave my rider lying on the ground for a few moments.  

MAP/GRAPHICS: The map and graphics are gorgeous, similar to Red Dead Redemption's landscape and variety. Instead of riding horses, you can use almost anything else to navigate the terrain, and more options will likely be added. The changing time of day and weather enhances the evolving feel of the game.

SOUND DESIGN: The sound design is fantastic. I love hearing the skis on the snow, the wind, and ambient nature sounds. While there is a lot of good music, especially 90s alternative rock, I prefer using Spotify to play my own playlists. The ability to incorporate custom Spotify playlists into games would be amazing.

As others have noted in their reviews, the annoyingness of the radio DJs and announcers have that weird overly happy vibe as if I'm being talked to like I'm a 10-year-old who thinks hoverboards are totally rad. I see why they did it. It's a fun and playful game that you shouldn't take too seriously. However, I just wish it was a bit more for adults in some ways while retaining litterally everything else other than the Voice Overs.

First, if your graphics driver is out of date, expect this game to crash randomly a LOT. I didn't figure that out until about 20 hours into the game, and I had barely any resources online telling me otherwise. On to the game...

It's a little annoying, but the gameplay is fun. I really enjoyed steep and was hoping that this would live up to its reputation, but there's a lot of things missing from steep that didn't carry over here which I really don't understand. In Steep, you progressively gained money to buy your character different boards or skis, jackets, hats, etc. A lot of the equipment wasn't behind a paywall that's also extremely limited depending on what's being sold that week in the shop. Everything was there, and if it wasn't you had to unlock it. I truly enjoyed that about steep because I could even change the different boots I had on my board, rather than a complete set. I hate that they changed that system into this, where all of your gear is ranked and some gear are more obviously better than others, creating a meta that top players would use just to get the fastest times instead of showcasing pure skill. 

Second, graphics are worse in riders republic than steep. I don't even know how that's possible, but the snow trails that players would leave in deep snow don't even show that well in this game compared to steep. It's obvious that the game was made half-assed with the intention of living up to steep, but doesn't even bother to retain some of the best parts about it.

Lastly, like many other Ubisoft games now, the unskippable dialogue and cringeworthy writing is terrible. Everything is supersaturated like some sort of advertisement for a hot wheels game. Ubisoft has a very unclear target demographic for this game since it fails to master the racing and extreme components to the hardcore players, and fails to make it arcadey for the kids. It has a little bit of an identity crisis, but hey, that's most of Ubisofts games nowadays.

As an aspiring game developer who wants to enter Ubisoft's NEXT competition for upcoming developers to win an internship there, man I don't know about working for them someday.

The controls are obtuse, often I find that movement is unresponsive and it's a coin flip whether my attempt to do a corkscrew passes through to the game or not. The default bindings are uncomfortable for every scheme. I had to play around for half an hour to find a setup that worked for me but the problem is there's way too many assignable actions for a controller to handle comfortably. A big problem is the camera, stationed directly behind the player or to one side, and is only manually accessible with one control scheme. You can adjust the FOV slightly which helps but there's no adjustable zoom. I wiped out more times to objects I couldn't see in my path or around corners, and even lack of information from where I'll be able to land safely after a jump than from my own incompetence. God forbid you use first person.

The events themselves are pretty miserable. I tried 25~ish on expert for a semblance of challenge but I found myself fighting more against the poorly conveyed terrain and horribly restrictive checkpoints than the AI ghosts I was racing against. The ""pop 5 balloons"" objectives were particularly awful, most requiring carefully manoeuvring dangerous terrain that lead away from checkpoints, which are mandatory lest the game force rewind you and waste a huge amount of time. At that point you might as well restart the event. The first few downhill bike races the game suggests are fun, fluid and persuaded me to continue playing over my Steam refund timer, which I deeply regret. If I had to compliment one thing it would be the BMX segments, which appear to be the only activity designed with player experience in mind. The overall design philosophy leans more on the serotonin from ""the one good run"" instead of making sure the player has a good time doing anything they want. If you don't take the game seriously it has a nice, casual appeal.

I'm not going to go in depth about cosmetics. It's classic predatory garbage. If you're not riding naked you're doing it wrong.",1687312572,1687312572,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Optimization is iffy, with huge frame drops and stuttering consistently and makes the experience not all that good. And the final one is that the game is from Ubisoft, which forces you to use their own service/launcher, which is a stupid implementation and seems to cause more issues than anything.

Whilst this game is also lacking achievements and still needs ubisofts own shit launcher running in the back ground I am at least pleased to say it runs very well.

So Riders Republic is a game I was very disappointed with because it wasn't on steam, I'd recently sold the last of my consoles so I couldn't play it at all (as I'm strictly steam only), needless to say when ubi started dropping games on steam again I was hoping they'd release this, well it's taken it's time but I finally got my wish, and I'm not disappointed. 

This might be one of the best ubi games in recent times, look I know ubi is a shit company run by cunts but I still find myself enjoying quite a large portion of their library but I'm not blind to the criticism. I get most of the games they push out suffer with open world bloat or are too similar but this game is different, yes it's open world but it's so fresh and unique I can't but help love this, especially when extreme sports games aren't as common anymore unless you look at the indie scene.

So this is an open world live service game that let's you freely swap between various sports, you can do this on the fly and it's so incredibly satisfying. There are so many events and races and cool mp gamemodes to play. I have been playing nonstop and managed to finish the battle pass and getting myself 1200 stars, rookie numbers in the grand scheme but hopefully a testament of my enjoyment for the game.

They are adding skateboards soon and I cannot wait, sure this game gatekeeps content as dlc but considering I paid so little I'm not too mad to throw a few more bucks at them for a fully fleshed out career, if it's half as good as the bmx update then I'll be happy. 

The game isn't perfect, the tutorial is too hand holdy and the voice acting is the most cringe shit ever but man this game is so fun to play. 

Ubisoft you're a shit company but you put out an absolute banger of a game with riders republic and I'm glad it's finally home on steam.

First and foremost, one of the major issues plaguing Riders Republic is its poor optimization. The game suffers from frequent FPS drops and overall instability, making it frustrating to play. It's disheartening when a game fails to deliver a smooth and seamless experience, especially in today's gaming landscape where optimization should be a priority.

Moreover, I found the story and voice acting in Riders Republic to be lackluster at best. The narrative feels pale and fails to engage the player, while the voice acting often falls into the realm of cringey and annoying. A captivating story and strong voice performances can significantly enhance a game, but sadly, Riders Republic misses the mark in this aspect.

The map itself is plagued by lag issues, which only exacerbate the overall gameplay problems. Constant lagginess makes it frustrating and at times impossible to enjoy the game fully. Additionally, the incessant pop-ups further impede gameplay, making it a cumbersome experience to even attempt any meaningful progression.

One of the few redeeming aspects of Riders Republic is the sports it offers. When they work as intended, they do provide moments of genuine fun and excitement. It's a shame that the positive aspects of the game are overshadowed by the numerous technical and design flaws.

To make matters worse, the game took an inordinate amount of time to release on Steam, raising expectations among the community. However, it ultimately fails to deliver on the anticipation it generated. The long wait only adds to the disappointment of the overall experience.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend Riders Republic in its current state. The lack of optimization, subpar story and voice acting, laggy map, and intrusive pop-ups hinder the potential enjoyment that the sports aspect of the game offers. It's a shame to see a game with such potential fall short on so many fundamental levels. I hope the developers take note of these issues and work towards addressing them to provide a more satisfying experience for players in the future.",1687107682,1687108013,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the bicycles race. Downhill and Road. Some of the snow stuff too.
The flyingsuit I hate and while I really love some part of this game, the game map and open-world system is annoying. I just want to do my races... Traveling to place in the open-world gets hold really quick. The sound FXs gets old, the music except a few songs get annoying real quick as the dialogs and the presentation.

If this gameplay elements (open-world map system) was removed from the game and I could just choose leagues, career path and such, I'd def. enjoy this title way more. At the very least, a menu to do so...

Checkpoint system within races can be unforgiving and frustrating.

I grew up on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. This game brings me back big time with the BMX and the snowskate, stringing together combos and racking up tons of points. It feels like a spiritual successor in that sense. Skateboarding is coming in September, and if it's anything like BMX, it's gonna be great. Mountain biking is my 2nd favorite behind BMX. The sense of speed is there when going down huge hills. The Mass Races with 64 live players are a highlight of this game. Hectic and fun as hell.

It's a chill game, messing around in free roam is where I spend most of my time, but there are tons of maps and events to play. Speaking of maps, it's GIGANTIC, smashing together several real life national parks into one.

NEGATIVES: 
The controls are pretty unintuitive, and the tutorial SUCKS (30 minutes at least). But power through those and you'll have a good time. Also, BMX career/events/sponsors cost money. I recommend getting the season pass when it goes on sale, or just buying the Gold Edition (also when it goes on sale) if you want to get the most out of BMX. Otherwise you'll still have access to a few BMX bikes, but only in free roam.",1686811888,1686811888,True,1,0,0.516908168792724609,0,True,False,False

The mechanics are almost unintuitive, and are sometimes unresponsive, I found myself ""dying"" a lot because I would try to jump. and wouldn't, then hit the button again and the game registered as a backflip.

The soundtrack is annoying, i heard the same 5 songs multiple times in 1 hour of gameplay.

As far as character customization goes, there is very little (aside from clothing which is all great)
All of the character face models look like they have been beaten within an inch of their life.
All of the hair models look atrocious, and there arent many options to begin with (I have a common male hairstyle, and It was not in the game, so I made my character bald)

The gameplay itself (once you get to experience it) is honestly rather fun, but the issues that plague this game quickly creep up and make you want to turn it off.

Among a few other things that I have forgotten, this game was a disappointment.

I have seen footage of this game, and have wanted to play it for so long. After finally having done so, I refunded the game after an apparent 1.4 hours.

TL;DR Sucky mechanics, dialogue is awful and unskippable, character design (both npc and customizable player) is AWFUL, map is unintuitive, and many other issues plague this game that is otherwise mostly enjoyable. I refunded.",1686780893,1686780893,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the sale it has as of writing this, $15 isn't terrible. But for $60 after the sale ends, better use of that money is to set it on fire. Same goes for the two ""better"" editions, you get some clothes, some special bikes, and a special jet pack that you immediately will replace after the first air race. I regret buying the Ultimate edition, waste of $30.

For the first hour of game play, the tutorial grabs you and doesn't let you do anything else but it. I wanted to explore and learn for myself how to ride and such, but instead got force-fed this crap.
The game, for being a recently released game, does not look pretty (I am using max graphics). Landscapes in the distance will look like un-rendered blotches and bikes sometimes won't render in right. 

Game play is alright, by what I heard its like Steep but downgraded; i haven't played Steep so i can't say much about comparisons, but IMO the bike racing is really the only interesting sport in this game. It's pretty good, the game does capture the feeling of speed pretty well. and thats it, thats what it really only hit well with. The snowboarding is just tricks off ramps, the jet packs are""race through the giant gates"", wingsuits are just flying close to the ground for points, and thats it really. Theres also bike stunts and snowboarding racing, but they're pretty average too.

Another thing is the micro-transactions, this game is full of it. Most clothes, 2 careers (sports) and a event pack cost money to access them. Yeah, they're adding content to the game, but its behind a paywall of course.

Glitches are common place, I've fallen down into the void many times on the bike, I've soft-locked multiple times while restarting the jet pack races and my character like turning into an eldritch horror after landing a jump. 

I really wanted to give Ubisoft a chance again, but I instead wasted my money on an average game full of micro-transactions with subpar graphics. (Will admit though, the 64 player races are kinda fun and chaotic.)",1686712917,1686712917,False,1,0,0.471580833196640015,0,True,False,False

[h2]Ubisoft being Ubisoft[/h2]
In-game purchases to customize your characters, repetitive gameplay that, while entertaining at first, becomes dull and boring after a few hours. Mountain Biking is my favourite activity in the game and in real life. It was fast-paced and exhilarating, while the controls for stunts and other gear were a little finicky I thought it was great. 

The whole game feels like one long drawn out tutorial with cringe worthy dialog and personalities. It's best to mute everything for the music and dialog while listening to your own tracks on spotify or playlists. 

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Great arcade modes, but as a full on community based game very shallow and lacking in many things.

Tutorial, rushing it as fast as you possibly can, is 40mins. And filled with low quality video's, and voiced by a bunch ""Cool"" and ""Radical"" individuals attempting to hype up the game.
Who ever designed the map to slowly go to every new event that's become available to you after you unlock them, in a row, and unskippable, should be fired. I ended up Alt-F4'ing after sitting there for 3 straight minutes watching the map uncontrollably go to each new event one at a time. First 45mins of this game was more then enough. Not even worth the sale price at 75% off. Feels like a downgraded Steep game, where they attempted to tie in features of The Crew 2, but instead filled with a bunch of simulated characters to pretend to be real players, when it's practically 98% ai's riding around. The funniest part is they are all on paths, and if you sit still for more then a minute, which your forced to on several occasions, you can very quickly tell the game isn't full of people, it's full of ai. With the worst tutorial, clunky UI, and bad controls.

It's honestly Steep, but made slightly worse in all areas, and filled with gimmicks. Go look at the 2 videos on the steam store page, and ask yourself, how much of it is actual gameplay, and how much of it is random showoff crap to try and get your attention. I feel ashamed purchasing this.

EDIT: Others weren't joking about Micro-Transactions. I started up the game again here to give it another go, and pretty much everything, including various events, have to be purchased with micro-transactions.

Would only recommend at the $15 sale price and even then only if you can put up with typical Ubisoft bloat and greed.

I like the concept. An open playground with events for racing and stunts.

I dislike the presentation. The UI is terrible. I dislike the extreme high energy nonstop party atmosphere, have to get the most pogs-per-minute. Didn't like it in Forza and don't like it here. I just want to ride and race without the fake fluff.
The introduction was way too long and obnoxious.

It has the GaaS stink all over it. Would not recommend for the full $60 price because they are going to try to milk you for more with overpriced transactions in-game. It's Ubisoft, you know what you're getting into.

the game is not PTW at all but at 60 dollars base edition, and cosmetics costing around $3-7 each depending on what it is, the monetization is very poor. intro tutorial is very hand-holdey and takes a while so once your done with it there's a good chance your refund window has expired. although i doubt your gonna want to refund. once the game clicks and you start nailing tricks the amount of creative juice you can let rip in this gorgeous world of never-ending jumps, fun locations, slopes and rollercoasters its an amazing experience. coming from skate 3, amazing game though priced / monetized poorly",1686513565,1686513565,True,28,5,0.684252917766571045,3,True,False,False

After its announcement I didn't hear anything about it, but when I found out it was on sale I picked it up for $20, and honestly I don't think I would have paid more for it. I'll talk about it from a Steep fan POV as well as a regular player POV.

In relation to Steep it's an okay Steep successor; it has similar features (like session markers, custom race content, etc) that Steep fans will like and the gameplay is roughly similar to Steep but with new sports and gear to use. There's a noticable absence of the Bone Collector progression and instead seems to focus you more on 'getting good' instead of crashing in fun ways, which is a little disappointing.

However, comparisons to Steep aside I think even for a general audience there's a lot of UX and game design decisions feels either a little sloppy or strangely directionless, and its microtransaction economy is one of the worst I've seen in a Ubisoft title to date.

UX: When dropping into the game it immediately puts you into a race scenario, and you can tell they wanted to get you directly into the action. But after that begins a series of forced introductory cutscenes and missions that took me about 1.5 hours to complete. Some cutscenes I could skip through, while others (like video call or ones that play when you unlock new content on the map) force me to sit through them even when I'm not interested. Generally speaking it feels like the directors couldn't decide if they wanted the player to get in on the action right away or onboard them slowly, and it ends up falling flat on its butt on both fronts.

Gameplay: Some mechanics just feel sloppy or purposeless.

For example there's a 'rewind' mechanic like Forza that lets you rewind your progress at any time to a previous state in the race. The game seems to tout this as a thing you should be using, but I've found it to be very intrustive. Firstly, it resets you facing forward, even if you were turning, which has the possibility of sending you careening in a different direction from your rewinded point. It also doesn't preview your momentum very well, which can make it hard to know if you should be breaking, gliding or accelerating at your restored point. It also doesn't stop the timer during some race types, which makes the prospect of using it instead of just restarting the race pointless if you're on any difficult aside from the easiest one.

There's also swarms of AI riding around the world, and following them can show you where major paths and courses are in the open world. It's a neat technical feature at a glance - some of them just jump around in place or mimic the behaviour of players randomly goofing off. However you'll soon notice that they phase in and out of existence at the start and end of their lines like some kind of Matrix glitch, and if you stand in place you'll see that they're all actually the same characters repeating the exact same action over and over on a short loop. What makes them extremely unbearable is that there's some sources and challenges that require pinpoint precision which become 1000x harder when you have a swarm of 12 AI jumping around and flying this way and that in front of your screen. There's no option to turn them off, they add little, and get old very quickly.

Realization: What was nice about Steep was that generally the 'realization' and justification for the world was pretty minimal. You were just a person on a mountain doing sports and events. For some reason the direction here decided it needed to double-down on rationalizing this premise - like some Ubisoft Executive looked at the premise and complained that it 'didn't make enough sense' or something - and it hurts the game so much.

Now there's a cast of characters who all talk with dialog and ""cool"" lingo written as though a 45 year old man tried to imagine how a 15 year old talks (bless the writers, I can only imagine finding 100 different ways to write dialog basically just telling you to ""Go play [x] event"" or ""You did a good job"" would be such a pain in the butt).

The world itself is also full of branded tie-ins, which I understand is standard for Sports Games but feels out of place here - most Fast Travel points have a Ford F-150 in front of them framed perfectly in camera when you travel to them (which you'll be doing a lot) while CLIF is featured in the main HUB and Prada has a line of in-game events you can complete. It just feels aggressively integrated for even a sports title.

I personally thought the art direction in previews looked cool at the time, but after playing for a while it felt really aimless. The world is a...eco-tech-neon-punk 'rider's paradise' but it's really difficult to nail down what the 'look' its going for even is. Players are given clothing items to either look like a regular joe or a character straight out of Fortnite. It's whiplash inducing and generally a look that feels like Ubisoft Direction generally just didn't have a solid vision for what the game's world should look like at all and it really shows. Maybe some Executive looked at Watch Dogs Legion and said 'idk make it like that I guess'.

World: The mountains, forests, canyons outside of the manmade stuff is pretty, however I find that unless you're travelling on the more level defined paths in the world it's easy to bump into stuff and feel like you're in the wrong place. I found Steep was much more forgiving when it comes to exploration and 'carving out' your own path in the world, but here if you go the wrong way it's much more likely to feel like you're *going the wrong way*

Economy: This is the most painful part to me. I understand games are expensive to make and am typically skeptical when people complain about game pricing, but I do think Rider's Republic is one of the weirder monetization schemes out there.

It's a premium game you pay full price (~$75) for, but its in-game economy is structured like an MMO. Most gear like bikes and skis are earned through events which is nice, but I noticed I played 5 hours and had no new cosmetics and a ton of 'Bucks' to spend. Steep rewarded cosmetics fairly regularly, so I was surprised I hadn't got anything new and decided to check out the in-game shop.

I checked the in-game shop and noticed that I could afford exactly 1 outfit from the shop with my in-game money, but the selection was really limited. There was maybe 16 items in total and out of those 16 maybe 11 of them were premium-currency only. I looked some stuff up online and learned that not only is this normal, the shop also cycles content *weekly*, so if you don't like anything in the shop that week you better be ready to come back next week and try again.

It's an arbitrary restriction that you can tell they lifted from F2P MMO models to enforce user retention and get people coming back with their friends again and again, but I need to reiterate that this is a paid game that costs $80 regularly. I don't think I'd play this on a *weekly* basis, especially not just to see what's in the store, and since I already paid for the game I'm doubtful I'd every buy the premium currency. This cosmetic store would be fine as an optional side-thing for die-hard fans, but as a casual player it's crazy that I now have tons of money in-game, nothing to spend it on and no cosmetics I feel like buying - it seems like a massive failure in the economy's design. I hesitate to call things 'greedy' but it really does feel like it's overstepping goodwill here.

TL;DR It's a fine (maybe a little worse) successor to Steep that has gameplay annoyances which compound into larger issues, hostile economy design and what feels like sloppy direction on what could have been a much cooler idea.",1686496106,1686496106,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I am so very glad I only spent 30 bucks on the ultimate addition (Down from over 100 dollars). Because you get rocket ski's, a rocket bike, a absolutely poor amount of cosmetics, and that's it... for about 40 dollars more than retail price you get a couple cool vehicles, and about 7 cosmetics. You also get a game that's about as much fun as eating a pile of dirt. The game is poorly optimized, but after playing Watch Dogs: Legion, i knew that good old Ubisoft would drop the ball on that one. The biggest issue is that I feel like I have absolutely no control over my rider. I will hold the turn button for a solid two seconds before my character turns, whenever I decide to go up a hill, (with my bike with literal rocket boost), it will almost always autocorrect my character to either be going sideways or straight down back where I came from. It takes a overly considerable amount of effort to straighten my rider to go up the hill. It should be as simple as me accelerating my bike, and dodging obstacles. My character will randomly get caught on a flat piece of hill, or start hopping around more than a rabbit on a damn trampoline.

You can't own one version, then upgrade to the next one like almost literally every game ever that sells bundle versions of their titles.

This game is very arcade, feels like the crew, snow sports feel horrible and very unrealistic. e.g- ""To change stance you press a button instead if using the joysticks, doing tricks seem way to fast and there are random speed boosts before jumps.""

Camera angles do not feel good and need improvement.

Controls on bikes feel very slow when turning. e.g- ""when you do a full turn it starts slow then speeds up the turn even when going at the same speed, should be instant turn or slightly faster, at the angle you put your joystick"".

Looks to be marketted to kids, soooo many stupid costumes.

Annoyingly long introduction, took over 30 min to do and I was rushing it.

Annoying force map open everytime you finish an event well to show you where new events are.

And annoying dialogue telling you to do things, e.g- in Yosimate, telling me go do a pizza delivery job or there is a hidden path go find it, NO I JUST WANNA EXPLORE.

expensive season 1 pass.

Useless DLC's, don't buy them as you get better stuff unlocking them ingame, besides rocket bike and ski's but they honestly don't seem that good anyways.

If you after something better and do not mind not having jet wings (that you cant do tricks with anyways), Bikes and powered parachutes, but instead have fun wingsuits, skiing and snowboarding, with more realistic controls and physics and honestly better graphics, get STEEP.",1686460313,1686460313,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

1. Mind-numbing decision to put gear ratings on your bicycle and equipment. Real-world road bicycles can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but past a certain upper-level point, there's no difference between the $1000 road bike and the $5500 bike... except that the guy riding the $5500 bike is a dentist, while the guy riding the $1000 bike isn't divorced three times
2. Your avatar, a Ageless-Faceless-Gender-Neutral-Culturally-Ambiguous-Adventure-Person, appears to have spent a lot of time eating Big Macs instead of hitting the cranks (not that there's anything wrong with crushing Big Macs... now I want a Big Mac...), and holding down the accelerator after hitting an arbitrary top speed on a flat does nothing
3. Unskippable tutorials. Don't let some weird guy tell me how to ride a bicycle, especially that one in a straw trilby. He looks like he should be getting verbally destroyed on camera by Chris Hansen and subsequently arrested. Seriously, the NPCs are beyond forgettable and could be replaced by text tutorials.

The weird:
1. Crammed with massively cringey Gen Z slang that's already dated. It sounds like it was written by a Baby Boomer that Ubisoft found cryogenically frozen in a vault
2. You can't physically contact other riders, which is good sportsmanship, but annoying to play. If you're encouraging me to jump off the trail and take shortcuts between checkpoints, I should also be allowed to knock another cyclist off his bike at 50 miles an hour and laugh as he slams headfirst into a tree stump
3. There's no discernible reason to win races. Seriously. I can't tell if there's any difference in rewards if you win or come in last place. This is probably good, because if you miss a checkpoint, the rewind feature only rewinds the player, and the NPC racers are unaffected- you will almost absolutely need to reset the race.

The good:
1. Controls are solid, and there are plenty of options for control schematics
2. A lot- seriously, a lot- of accessibility options, which is positive to see
3. ... to be determined. I'll edit this as more positives come up, or refund if none do.

On a real note -
The game itself is beautiful and can be fun if you dont rage at sudden glitches and things that ruin the racing experience, Example: During a Mass race against 60 other people, you could be in first and suddenly crash into a random invisible barrier, and there goes your #1.

Also, the hoverboard is probably the most agonizing thing I've ever experienced in a game like this. It'll get boring and repetitive after the first 10 hours you put into it unless you enjoy overachieving absolutely everything possible, then you're just in it for pain, you filthy masochist.

Also, you cant really buy a lot in the game with the cash you win from races and stuff, they really just want your real money for stuff that wont make to much of a difference in the long run.

Riders Republic changed that forever.
I've played this game today for 13 hours in one session. Let me tell you why:
This game is all about progression, levelling up, and getting better gear.
The fact that, no matter if you get first or last place, you will make progress, regardless of your difficulty setting or gear level.
I had so much fun riding down hills, doing tricks on the snow board, doing impossible 1440s and so on.
There's literally so much you can do, from bikes, paragliding to even funny and weird gear like a pizza bike or a giraffe costume.
It's an amazing experience overall, even with the weird visual glitches.

I WOULD easily give this game a 11/10
But unfortunately, it's far from being a perfect or well thought out game.

Here are my complaints about the game:
Almost everything like clothing, even careers (sport modes) requires real money, and it's not cheap.
I bought the standard edition of this game for 15 euros. After playing for hours and having fun, I decided to get the most of this game, like the bmx career, by buying 2.3k worth of republic tokens (real money currency). The bmx career costs 2k tokens to unlock, that's around 20 bucks. If that's not crazy enough, wait until you see the price of single items and outfit bundles, 900 to 2k tokens, that's around 10-20 euros, it's a ridiculous price! And it needs to be reduced to something reasonable.  
But don't worry there are also items on the shop that can be acquired from in-game earned bucks, but there are 2 two problems: 1. There's not much to see on the shop for bucks. 2. They're also very expensive, keep in mind i've been playing for 13 hours, have almost 500 stars and around 50k bucks, and items cost 20k bucks, seriously???

Thank you for reading my review this far.

the only pros of the game is the gameplay is fun and the map is really big and it has fun sections. 
but the cons heavily outweigh the pros. the in-game currency you receive by actually playing the game is almost completely worthless. almost all of the accessories and all of the funkies (funny sports equipment) are only purchasable with the in-game currency you have to actually buy with real money. Ubisoft has also locked some of the game away in a $40 season pass. 
I'm so sick of games putting stuff behind paywalls. remember back in the good 'ol days when DLC had an actual fair price and wasn't just skins? well that memory is fading fast. if you want to buy a better version of this game, buy steep, where you can actually use the in-game currency you get from actually playing the game
most AAA game companies have tarnished their legacies. 

Blizzard and Activison have stopped trying to make new IPs for quite awhile
Ubisoft manages to only pump out games that are meant to siphon our money from us
343 has screwed up every game they have made so far, especially infinite when they made the first ever halo game with microtransactions

It's like, the most epic gaming adventure you can have without leaving your bean bag!

Okay, so the game is set in this futuristic California, where all the bros and babes have formed their own rad republics. You get to be this sick rider, cruising around on your neon hoverboard, dodging palm trees and jumping over beach volleyball nets. It's like a wild mix of Tony Hawk and Tron, but on a whole new level, bro!

The story is like, totally righteous. You're part of this super cool crew that's all about bringing the stoke back to the republics. You gotta complete all these gnarly missions to unite the factions and take down the boss dudes who are trying to ruin everyone's good vibes. Talk about a righteous adventure!

The graphics, man, they're straight-up trippy. The sunsets over Malibu are so vivid, they'll make your eyes pop. And the characters, oh boy! You got this dude with a handlebar mustache, all about the retro vibes, and this chick with rainbow hair, spreading love and positivity like a human disco ball. The game designers totally nailed the California vibes, bro!

Now, the controls take a bit of getting used to, like finding your balance on a shaky surfboard. But once you get the hang of it, you'll be pulling off tricks that'll make even the pros jealous. Plus, you can customize your board and gear with all kinds of rad stickers and neon paint jobs. Gotta look fly while saving the republics, right?

But here's the real kicker, my dudes: the soundtrack! It's like they took all the best tunes from the '80s and mixed 'em up with some futuristic beats. Picture this: you're grinding on a rail, doing flips, and jamming out to some sick synthwave. It's like time-traveling to the ultimate beach party, bro!

Overall, Riders Republic is the ultimate game for all you California dreamers out there. It's got the sun, the sand, the sick tricks, and a righteous mission to save the republics. So grab your shades, twist one for ya boy, start up the game, and get ready to ride into a totally tubular gaming adventure that'll leave you stoked for days, dude! 

Cowabunga! 🤙

im just going to keep a list of things that have happened in game:
- at the end of a solo race the podium characters all did the same animation in sync, like a fucking dance troupe
- my character started un-ironically doing the dollar dollar bills hand gesture and i had no choice in this
- there is one long hair preset, it is made of jelly fish
- republic.... coins..... because i didnt just buy a fucking game for the game, so i have to buy the game in bits and pieces after already buying the game
- you earn in game money for completing things... roughly 2 things in customisation menu uses this money. the other few hundred cost those ""republic coins."" i didnt just buy a game, i brought access to an online NFT market place, NFTs that other people can also buy, so if regular NFTs have no value, this is negative value
- there are no white flat sole sneakers to choose, what the fuck, an actual staple of extreme sports culture and you dont have it as a default option?
- your body clips through the only decent pair of default trousers... note, you dont get to change your body shape, everyone has the same shape, how is this still a thing after a year of beta testing on other stores?
- you cant change your snowboard boots.... thats like basic customisation for snowboarding
- the practice bowl is so busy you cant even see what the fuck you are doing
- i just spent 5 minutes being dragged back and forth around a GPS map,to be shown a bunch of clearly sign posted events that did not need to be pointed out to me individually
- there is a prada event? what, ran out of sponsors for your shit game?
- i just got wedged in a kicker and turned in to a 15 odd foot long monstrosity
- i dont know what a shackdaddy bandit is, nor do i want to know, they seem like a bunch of tools. im guessing theyre meant to be cool, but they come across as try hards sharing a single brain cell
- #lonewolf .... its not even bad at this point, just sad
- the burger granddad is getting annoying, i wish he would stop 
- the gps dragging is getting boring too
- the little ski board is pretty good, maybe the skateboarding when it releases will be fun, but im not holding out hope.

First the (few) good things:
Its a big and beautiful open world thats fun to play in.
Its cool to play in multiplayer and the community seems pretty chill.
There are lots of sports that you can choose from and you can also pick your own playstyle.

Now to the cons:
After some time, it gets kinda boring.
The game feels a bit soulless compared to steep.
They try to make the characters in the cutszenes feel badass but its just really cringe.
and OH BOY, the microtransactions. Its a full pice game and still they throw in microtransactions. And its not just the cosmetics. To unlock cool stuff like a rocket powered bike you need the year pass. FOR 40$. Thats just a shameless money grab.

Its really got potential, but ubi just destroys it w microtransactions.
its good to have some short term fun, but not much more.
you will be bette off playing steep or descenders.

It has an enormous open world and an nearly infinite amount of tracks for all kind of ""rides"". Also i cannot confirm that the gameplay is bad like some people in here said. i find it very cool and fun, also turning off all the auto ""help"" functions makes it sometimes pretty hard to land some tricks and the tricks you can do are also amazing and there are plenty.

The genre for these games is very dead, there hardly very few of these Sporting rides games and then even less of these extreme sports games.
--I HAVE PLAYED STEEP FOR A UNHEALTHY AMOUNT OF TIME--
Riders republic does a lot of things right;
* massive races (player numbers)
* a lot of different and fun locations and areas
* good graphics, try indulging just free riding without HUD
* a lot of players at almost all parts of the map, you don't feel alone
* this game just scratches my ick of massively multiplayer open world where people could just ride around or just doing tricks, falling over.
* a bunch of different sports and rides to choose from, some behind a paywall (UBISOFT)
* these games just get me in the vibe, i wanna be on a rainy saturday afternoon.
* I WANT MORE OF THESE GAMES!!!

Now, it has good graphics but not much has changed since 2016, when steep came along and now it's not a disrespect cause steep to this day holds itself up so well and is very pretty, but thinking the difference that'll come between 5 years would be a lot but it's not much.
The snow part, there is not even a disscussion that steep handled snow and snow sports so much better than RR, i mean ofc it was just a snow sports focused game but still.
The Biking is a new sport added here and tbf it's a cool addition. I like the fact that this game gives me the option to try out more varied landscapes and sports, like atleast i have the option if i need it.
RR has much more complexities to it, i am all welcome to the various skills and tricks but this game is just very complex and grindy.
The one thing i loved the most in Steep was just freeriding and doing tricks and skills amidst free riding, everything felt so natural, in this game the natural aspect is less felt and kills my immersion sometimes.
I am nowhere saying this is a bad game game, instead it is a very fun game and super bang for your buck at sale.
I have played this game on console and now here, I love this game and man do i adore Steep so much, i want more of these titles and games like these.

Riders republic is an awesome game for pure fun and chaos, and also to escape from chaos to just freeride with HUD off and just feel the calm.
With it feeling more arcade in controls (switching to manual and removing assists helps a lot) and overly grindy, these sure are some negatives.

This is an Awesome game and few of the fun ones that ubisoft has made in the past couple of years.

TLDR: Save your money, the game is hot garbage.

Coming from Descenders, this game is literally unplayable. Controls are horrible and stiff, I feel like I'm sliding along the ground in a cardboard box, and not riding a mountain bike.

A friend of mine called it ""The Crew of extreme sports"", but this controls a lot worse than The Crew does compared to sims or even Forza Horizon.
