I'm on a 2-week break from university with time to kill and in the week I've owned this game, I've put almost 70 hours into it.

THE GOOD:

- A lot of freedom to run your businesses and set up intricate supply chains how you see fit.

- All building types can be customised with a vast array of furniture and equipment and if you want to put a salad bar in a clothes store then you do you.

- Uncle Fred sets you up with a clear progression path from running around doing everything, to kicking back and running your empire from your phone with a well-set-up head office.

- You get to manage EVERYTHING from warehouse imports to shop deliveries, to sale price, etc.

THE BAD: (note that the game is in Early Access)

- In the late game things start to get a little unmanageable because a lot of the UIs lack much-needed QoL features.

- Large stores can cause long load times on entering and exiting them and suffer low FPS inside (probably due to the amount of stock calculations that need to be made).

- UI can sometimes suffer momentary freezes while doing things like setting a store to open/closed in the late game.

- Occassionaly all my owned vehicles including ones assigned to a warehouse will disappear and I'll have to rebuy all the vans and take them 1 at a time to the warehouses. It's a pain but didn't appear to be a problem until late game.

CONCLUSION:

This game is honestly awesome and I've had a lot of fun playing it over the last week. But due to among others the issues listed above, the game becomes tedious in the late game when most of these issues seem to appear. I'll say that I like the direction the game is going in and the dev is still active in the game's community and seems to be taking on the feedback given so I'm confident that Big Ambitions will only become even more feature rich and fun to play further down the line.",1708828834,1709062537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Perhaps you remember your childhood days, playing football with friends, engaging in games of cops and robbers, or even pretending to run your own shop, trading shiny rocks for leaves from nearby bushes. If the latter sounds familiar, then you might just find the Big Ambitions game intriguing, where you can build your very own retail empire.

Let’s delve a bit deeper into what this game offers without diving too deeply into its narrative or campaign elements, as my approach typically involves jumping straight into sandbox mode with difficulty settings cranked to the max. If you’re curious about the story aspect, I’ll have to point you towards other sources. However, if you’re interested in a bit of personal insight, read on.

Firstly, it’s essential to note that the game is still in its early access phase, much like many titles these days. However, it’s evident that Big Ambitions is in its fledgling stages, with players eagerly awaiting teasers for the next update. Despite its unfinished state and the need for polish, the game still manages to offer plenty of fun, especially for those with an entrepreneurial spirit.

You begin the game as essentially a nobody, albeit with the freedom to craft your own background and personality within the virtual world, limited only by the bounds of your imagination, right? However, nothing changes the fact that you’re broke. I’m particularly fond of such zero-to-hero storylines, as I always relish the challenge they present. So, one of your initial tasks is to secure a job at a local grocery store to cover your basic expenses. Once you have some cash in hand, you can venture to the nearby bank to secure a small loan and kickstart your journey to becoming the town’s biggest tycoon.

The town is ripe with various buildings available for rent, each serving different purposes, from retail stores to warehouses. But before you rush into leasing your first space, take a moment to strategize. What will your business focus on? Will you sell flowers, jewelry, or perhaps dive into the fast-food or grocery market? Or maybe you’re keen on launching an office for a team of web developers? The choice is yours, but careful planning is essential.

Consider the competition and demand in your chosen location. Will there be a demand for your products or services, is there a even a small gap in the business around waiting to be filled, or are you entering an oversaturated market? Is the nearest warehouse conveniently located for restocking, or will you spend hours traversing the city for supplies?

Once you’ve secured your dream location, it’s time to invest in furniture and inventory. Shelves, desks, counters, and shopping baskets don’t come cheap, nor do the goods you intend to sell. And remember, as your business grows, so too will the need for additional staff and services. Will you hire employees to assist with day-to-day operations, or perhaps outsource delivery services to streamline your logistics?

But the journey doesn’t end there — far from it. As your empire expands, so too will the opportunities for growth and innovation. From opening additional storefronts to establishing your own warehouse and headquarters with hiring managers and tax consultants, the sky’s the limit. But do not forget about the ever-looming specter of taxes — a necessary evil in the world of business. Taxes are a real concern, and setting them in your sandbox settings too high or too low can have significant repercussions. But fear not, for with careful planning and strategic decision-making, you’ll navigate these challenges with ease.

In terms of visuals and technical aspects, Big Ambitions doesn’t boast cutting-edge graphics, but it doesn’t necessarily need to. It evokes a nostalgic charm reminiscent of early GTA games, which adds to its appeal. Despite being in early access, the game runs smoothly with minimal bugs or crashes, making for an enjoyable experience overall.

Big Ambitions is shaping up to be a fantastic game, albeit niche, with the potential for deeper features as updates roll out. So, if you’ve ever dreamt of running your own retail empire, this game might just be your ticket to success.

So, are you ready to embark on the journey from rags to riches? Have you ever dreamt of building your own retail empire from the ground up? Do you want to start planning your strategies, scouting locations, and stocking up on inventory? The retail world awaits, and with determination and savvy business acumen, you can turn your Big Ambitions into a reality!

I'm having a good time playing this game so far, it has captivated me and at times feels very addictive, but as a few reviews have stated the game really still feel like a prototype that has some decent working components. 

As I started the game, it seemed to have a giant ocean of content and mechanics to master and understand, but about 10 hours in I feel like I see the same mechanics getting replicated in a more tedious fashion as you grow. There is tons of opportunity to improve this, many on the forums have made excellent observations on what could be done to make each type of retail business you operate unique from any of the others, but the gameplay loop is go to a wholesaler, buy products, rent a space, and then just stock the shelves/grills/displays with the product appropriate for that type of industry with the same mechanics for all industries. 

Logic also seems to be very absent from many of the mechanics, or the mechanics simply haven't been programmed/built into the engine yet; for example: you don't have to refrigerate food for restaurants, you just stock it on a shelf and even what doesn't get sold stays on the grill and can be sold the exact next time the business is open; employees don't call out sick or throw any wrenches into the schedules you provide, there is absolutely no element of randomness built into anything in this game, so it gets very easy once you understand the numbers behind everything.

This game could be great, and I would love to turn this into a recommended, but in it's current state I would only recommend if it is discounted and you are in between games and happen to really like time/resource management games.",1708206876,1708206876,False,43,1,0.722628116607666016,0,True,False,True

HUGE IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION FOR DEVELOPERS:
1- More building interior kinds and offices like with full glass outer walls (plazas offices) and penthouses maybe. 
2- There should be an option in interior design to build and destroy walls, adding glass walls for better offices etc. like sims. 
3- MORE RPG ELEMENTS: Like we should have some skills and be able to improve our skills with some sets of skill trees as well. For maybe negotiating with sellers and importers ourselves and when an employer asks for something maybe convincing him.
4- boost morale with events for employers and giving a day off
5- I know it is hard but being able to build our own factories or producing somethings and being able to export ourselves, maybe just being able to export ourselves from local producers.
6- There can be an online version to play with friends in the future cuz making a whole market with online players might be hard for a game like this.

This is more for tycoon game and business fans. Minor bugs aside, I can see putting in more hours. I'm already at 20+ hours as of this review and I'm just getting started. I did a custom game starting with only $500 and no tutorials, so I had to learn the hard way. But my old man is now a two-hundred thousandnaire.

UPDATE: After 50+ hours, I can definitely say this game was worth the price. However, I've now reached the point where my rich hobo is bored of making money. There are some minor bug and annoyances that I won't spoil for you, but the game is still pretty fun overall if you're into tycoon style games. I would describe this as a Sims 1-2 style tycoon game based loosely on a mini-clone of NYC, where a hobo like myself can rise from pocket change to multimillionaire. I stopped as a millionaire, because there isn't anything else money can buy beyond the millions to make it worth the grind. Overall, it was a good run for 50+ hours of fun.

In the future, I'd like to see major overhaul and improvements around investing, e.g. an actual stock market tied to businesses from the game, the option to list and sell stock yourself (go public), or to buy out public businesses.

I unfortunately do feel like you hit a wall sort of once you get the feel for the game and start getting to that $100,000,000 range. Buying buildings doesnt really provide anything. Revenue from a building is minuscule, so once you start investing, just leave the money there until you want it.  

A lot of potential for building designs, incorporating a sims-type building community to this game could be really fun and make your businesses more fun to design. (i am aware of the option to see others designs, but  because of the games early production, there is not a lot of opportunity for unique designs that also max out your businesses popularity)

i also was a fan of the market prices fluctuating with supply of goods. Not really sure why that was taken out of the game with the recent update as it made the game feel much more realistic. 

I am a fan of random games, this type of game specifically spoke to me in a way that i really enjoyed. Building a business and fighting the computer for retail space while balancing the real life needs of a person was way more fun than i expected.

-Better tooltips for employees. In some cases I can't see all the info when I need it (mostly HR management stuff).
-Pricing ""profiles"" to change the pricing of the same product in multiple stores at once. Maybe add a sales manager to unlock this?
-HR Management shifting helper to get my employees to the right health care level.
-Better sales statistics (product x sold y times today, z times this week @all shops).
-Better product tooltips. How many are in one box, how many fit in one shelf, etc.
-More slots for delivery drivers in warehouses.
-Stupid fucking purchase and warehouse managers forget all their shit when you fuck around with their desk because they demand some stupid fucking special aid desk. This needs to stop.
-Walls. More flexibility to set up storages, kitchens, meeting rooms.",1707611015,1707611015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It goes even deeper because you have to hire employees and hr managers. You even gotta handle all of your shipping until you hire someone to do it for you. It does a great job at showing us what owning a business is really like. I love almost every aspect of this game outside of the clanky driving controls and the customization. If this game was better optimized for controllers I believe I'd love the driving more. Also, it would be cool to build relationships outside of business connects.

I might say this game is more akin to an automation game than a business management sim.  You'll quickly automate your retail shops so much you'll no longer have to step foot inside your own business.

There are a large number of other types of businesses you can start.  Finding ways to make the most money with your expanding business empire is the mid-game I suppose.  End-game you take all the cash and find ways to invest it to maximize capital gains.  Real estate and stuff I guess.  I'm in the early-mid game right now.  Uncle Fred is taking off the training wheels and letting me take more control over my empire.

Let's talk about gameplay.

Think Sims controls over a Grand Theft Auto setting.  Driving does feel more like a GTA game, but while on foot it feels more Sims.

You will manage both your business empire as well as your personal life.  Buy groceries for your fridge or eat for free at your own fast food restaurant.  Maintain your happiness meter by watching TV, playing video games, and maybe enjoying a walk in the park.  Some of your employees need a ""Peaceful Work Environment"" which means you, their boss, must have over 50% happiness index.

Let's talk about quality.

There is some jankiness, but all in all I am impressed with how polished the game is considering the small dev team.  None of the glitches are so serious as to threaten my ability to enjoy the game.  The systems and UI are well designed enough to be intuitive and fun.  Like I said, I'm impressed.

Conclusion:

This is a good game.  It shows considerable promise as it is developed, but it is already in good shape for you to buy and enjoy it now.

I'm really fond of this game genre, and I feel that this particular game stands out. Expanding the city and adding more businesses could enhance it further, but as it stands, it's already quite impressive and more entertaining than many other business simulation games I've played. The 0.4 update significantly improved the driving aspect, addressing one of my primary concerns, along with the dynamics of office-based businesses. These improvements have made the game more captivating and enjoyable. The ability to develop various businesses, headquarters, and distribution networks offers a deeply satisfying experience.

Here are some tips for players:

The flow of pedestrians near a store is crucial. A large store is pointless if it can't attract enough customers.
Always equip your stores with enough furniture to accommodate the customer capacity you desire, as a higher capacity can increase customer inflow.
After establishing your headquarters, employ headhunters and hire employees at the lower end of the salary range. They don't demand pay raises, so training them in-house is a cost-effective strategy. This approach also helps avoid additional employee needs that complicate scheduling, like specific shift preferences. Most of my retail stores operate around the clock with a team of customer service staff and cleaners. Managing full-time hours cleverly ensures a dedicated, low-maintenance workforce.
Assign staff to Human Resources for passive skill development (adjust the training slider to 100% for maximum efficiency). Initial manual training is advisable for quicker skill acquisition, which directly influences revenue through customer satisfaction.
Retail ventures are highly profitable. In contrast, office jobs have become less rewarding. Electronics, jewelry, clothing, and gift/flower shops are particularly lucrative.
However, there are areas that still need improvement:

The property market's current valuation system is unrealistic but is scheduled for a rebalance.
User interface enhancements are needed, especially for mouseover menus in shelf setup.
The employee management interface could be more efficient. A feature to select unassigned employees for bulk uniform assignments and training would be highly beneficial, especially in the game's later stages where managing a large workforce becomes tedious.",1705877356,1705877356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game is well detailed, has a lot of features and fills a gap of real state management in the simulation genre. The total ammount of reviews and positive review ratio (6,932 and 93% as of now) for an early access game also speaks volumes of the quality.

I also expected far less from an early access title of this scope, but this one is pretty solid for a 0.4. Devs are communicative, there's a countdown/estimative of next big update, plus in the 0.3 and 0.4 updates there were 3 bugfixes a few days after each, so it does seem like a dutiful team.

This grand slam from Hovbaard is an EA title that grabs you by the wallet and doesn't let go until the sun is peeking over the horizon, reminding you that work awaits.

In the hustle and bustle of Big Ambitions, Hovbaard has struck gold. Starting small, you find yourself at the cashier's desk, handling transactions and dreaming of something bigger. Then, the pivotal moment arrives when you take a daring leap, secure a loan, and launch your own business empire.

The beauty of this game lies in the gradual progression from mundane tasks to empire-building excitement. Just as you think you've mastered the art of running a shop, the game throws in a curveball – automation. Hire employees to handle the day-to-day operations or optimize your supply chain for efficient deliveries. Suddenly, you're not just a business owner; you're a strategic mastermind.

At around 6 hours in, I've already set up my second business and am on the verge of achieving the coveted automated dream. Nightclubs and casinos beckon on the virtual horizon, promising a world of excitement that I've yet to explore.

But here's the twist – it's not all about work. Big Ambitions introduces a crucial element: maintaining your character's morale. Endless work can be as damaging in-game as it is in real life. So, remember to take a break, hit the town, and revel in the nightlife. After all, even in the virtual world, all work and no play is a recipe for disaster.

And a word of caution to all you GTA-style drivers out there – your in-game car is not immune to the perils of reckless driving. Repair bills can pile up faster than you realize. Drive safe, park correctly, or risk fines from the city – it's all part of the immersive experience in Big Ambitions.

I don't want negative reviews to badly influence indie games, this one has a lot of promise, but I'd withhold from playing it now as there's a lot that is lacking, looking forward maybe 0.5 will solve some of the QoL issues. 

Mainly:
- Insights are not helpful, since you don't have historic data of previous days and weeks
- Competition doesn't really pay off. I've opened a big law firm with highly trained lawyers, made the prices way below the market, you'd expect people to come to you, but that's not how this game is designed, so basically just losing money, even tho all bars were high, including customer satisfaction
- There should be a way to collect feedback about businesses without visiting them with more in-depth details
- Contracts shouldn't be signed in person, this is a digital world, I want something to be delivered to my business or sign a contract with provider, I should just call them
- Single HR must be able to hold different healthcare tiers, that's how it works in a real world
- Keeping your character happy is harder than running a business. I get good income, but the effects of TV and games are short-lived, tho just visiting a park will stay for like 5 days
- Food delivery should be an option, running for fresh food bags is annoying
- A bug when manage inventory randomly disappears on items/stockpiles/cars/fridges and you can't use them
- The per neighborhood demand is changing too frequently, it will take you more time to open a store, than to catch the wave, not how it works
- Gift Shops for some reason are the only ones that are selling well, everything else is crap (didn't reach high end stores)
- Amount of customers per hour should not be defined by location size or foot traffic. There are shacks in the world where they serve hundreds of people depending on the service, staff skill and popularity of the place
- I think if you can bite the bullet and put some really low prices, your competitors should suffer customer loss and even potentially go out of business
- Painting walls and floor should not cost you a fortune!?
- There needs to be a paid service that will ""decorate"" your business, loading 4 items at a time and placing them manually for a new store is very annoying. At least make the delivery go inside, and let the player use all items and placement like in Sims, as if it was already in the inventory, this shouldn't be such a dreadful task
- Selling multiple product types in the same store (as per Help Manual) didn't do it for me, nobody bought the ""extra"" items apart from soda cans. I should be able to sell, e.g toys in a gift store too

Thanks for the efforts tho, really cool concept, really want to play it when it's more polished, I want to feel the progress and recognition growing with my businesses opening, currently it's not satisfying, many times than not I just sleep through days to get something opened, done, etc..",1704576598,1705547871,True,0,0,0.370750486850738525,1,True,False,True

I had low expectations but the reviews and the premise of the game convinced me that the mechanics and systems would dig their claws into me if the visuals obviously weren't going to. I was pleasantly surprised with the tutorial and fidelity of the simulation. However, once it became clear that I was going to have to control the player character for every interaction, including physically placing the avatar at the locations of places and items to interact with them (ie stocking the first shop from the car, back and forth), I began to have a sinking feeling about where this was going. Anticipated upgrades were going to consist of moving more things better and faster. Boooorrrrrriiiinnnng.

I loathe the movement, controls, camera, and UI most of all. I despise the way windows/buildings are interacted with on the map and otherwise. Considering all this, I could tell that I was going to have a mediocre and time consuming experience. 

I respect the project so far, but at the moment it's a little tedious for me and the issues I have with several systems make it impossible to tolerate for $20 without way more polish.. I can't think of who I could convince to try this niche game but even so I wouldn't presently recommend it. The system of physically trucking stuff around and the arbitrary limitations of old adages such as 'inventory manager' meta-games is distinctly *not fun*, in case ya'll needed to hear that.

I personally would love to see more business options, grocery delivery / more food stock piling etc. And being able to hire assistants! who you can task to do certain things could also beneficial. That's just off the top of my head though and it is otherwise a near perfect game imo. I haven't experienced any bugs and I am only 20 hours in so i have a lot to work on still.

-----
- Kind of a Sims - Open For Business on steroids.
- Quite a few business types to play out.
- Tutorial is solid and gets you up to speed.  Maybe a bit long?
- Solid game.  I've only come across 1 bug to this point.
- Room for improvement/expansion for the developers.

Dislike ( nitpicking, honestly ):
--------------------------------
- NYC drivers.
- Odds/payouts at the casino are unrealistic for the different games.  If you're going to have a casino, make it legit.

Would like to see:
-------------------
- Fixtures on the ceilings keep getting in the way.  Would be nice if they would be only shown/selectable in Design mode.
- Would like to send new hires to training until they're trained, not just 10% daily improvements.
- Watching TV needs to be sped up.
- Watching TV, playing games, and exercising for hours on end shouldn't stack for days.  I mean, if I work out all day long, I'm going to be in the hospital!
- A short-bed truck can haul more than a box van?  ...and wouldn't your truck cargo last about 10 seconds in NYC before it's stolen?

To address the concern a lot of negative reviews bring up: Yes, at the start of the game, you are broke, you have to buy stock yourself and run around a lot to resupply after working at the cash register yourself. That's...the whole point of the game. To start from nothing and work your way up. As you progress, you get your own employees so you just take care of supply. After that, you get your own warehouse, purchasing managers (to stock your warehouse from shipping companies), drivers, and a logistics manager to manage the drivers (the reviews failed at this step). Once that's done, stores are more or less self sufficient and you can focus on expansion.

Tips:
- Foot traffic for a store is very important. No point having a high capacity store if you can't fill it up with people.
- Always build stores with furniture to customer capacity, even if you know you won't get that many customers. Higher capacity drives up customer inflow for the moment.
- Once you set up HQ, get headhunters and hire at the bottom of the salary band. Employees never ask for a salary raise, so train them yourself to get cheap labor. The other upside is training them yourself prevents most types from getting extra needs that make scheduling painful (e.g. 5 days a week, no afternoon shifts etc.). Most of my retail stores run 24/7 with 8x fulltime customer service employees and 2x cleaners. Anything between 30-50 hours counts as fulltime so 4 of my fulltimers run at 35 hour weeks, the other 4 at 49 hours. This way, I have a perfect employee base that is cheap, doesn't need anything and if I need to, I can swap them across stores.
- Assign employees to HR. They passively get training while on the job (make sure to change the slider to 100% skill, it is at 50% by default). I'd suggest training manually until at least 50% since skill level directly impacts your revenue via customer satisfaction. Manual training gets 10% skill per day while passive is more like 1%.
- Retail is very profitable, office jobs got a major nerf and are now my least performing businesses. In terms of profitability, electronics, jewelry, clothes and gift/flower shops (they sell the same stuff) work best.

Some things still need developing:
- Property market has unreal purchase values, due to be rebalanced (confirmed will be done)
- UI fixes needed for mouseover menus, mainly when setting up shelves (confirmed will be done)
- Employee management screen ability to select anyone not assigned to a business so you can assign uniforms and training in bulk, rather than selecting each employee one at a time every day. In later game, you will be training 50-100 employees at once and having to tick a box next to each one every single day is a chore.

You can run a nightclub, fast food joint, gift shop, or almost any store you want to. There’s no option to build entire new buildings or deal with multiple floors but besides that the interior design options are great and have potential. If mods/updates keep coming it seems almost limitless what you could do. Honestly in some ways the game is very comparable to sims, with much more of a focus on the tycoon/business aspect than the character creation/personality/auto-simulation(npcs)

Also the recreation of New York City is really cool and well done.

In its current state it’s pretty fun but the gameplay loop can be a bit repetitive. After finding your footing the only way to really continue making money and getting bigger businesses is to sleep through every day, do activities to stay happy, and then check some charts and shift some numbers/employees around.

     Everywhere you go inside you have a tool tip popping up right in the middle of your screen when your character walks by and another where your mouse is.  Let us turn that garbage off.  I don't need to have a light highlighted while I'm doing something.  Ever.  It's just annoying.
     The camera controls are kind of shit, i can change elevation and direction but not angle of camera.  And I can't change the camera at all in a car.  
     AI doesn't take into account where your stores are when they open theirs.  After opening a Jewelry store an AI opened their own jewelry store right next to mine.  Literally.  We share a wall.  That's  bad location research on their part.  I don't know if it actually affects my business any more than if it were on the opposite side of the district, but I've got to say it's aggravating.
     The happiness metric is pretty bad too.  It requires that you expand aggressively and if you don't then you get sent to a psychiatric ward because it's been too long since you... bought your last whatever.  I don't remember what affects happiness since i play without it enable, but it was a pretty bad mechanic when I last tried it.

You can customize shops, offices, and even apartments the way you want with all ready a large selection of items as well as purchase a wide variety of new vehicles with different stats that might help your play-style along the way. Taking care of yourself in the game can also be an important factor in order to meet some of your employees demands and also not fall in a depressive state that would disable you from entering your businesses. 

The most intriguing aspect of the game for me is the ability to play in whatever manner you desire, forming your own strategy and moving at your own pace. I'm sure some people could figure out how to make 60k a day in 20 days while others might want to take it slower and grow each of their businesses slower and only make 1.6k a day in 50 days.

The only problem I can see currently is giving the end game more of a challenge so that you don't become easily bored after becoming rich. The devs are on the cusp of fixing that dilemma though with their next update introducing rivals to the game.

As far as optimization goes, it is pretty solid and the loading times are extremely fast which is very nice to see. When you get bored with the game you can quickly save with f5 and exit. As well as jump back in your saved campaign in less than 20 seconds after launching the game. That's a very nice feature in my opinion.",1703965775,1703965775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First, incorporate the criminal industry. Setting-wise, choosing the criminal industry could result in higher loan interest rates, increased susceptibility to robbery and theft, and higher employee salary demands compared to other industries. Introduce a bail mechanism, where having a law firm would reduce the premium.

Second, introduce a stock or futures system. In the later stages of the game, when players have too much money and lose motivation, this mechanism allows them to invest funds. However, making incorrect judgments could lead to losing their own capital.

There are more ideas, but implementing all of them might transform the game into something entirely different. I sincerely hope the developers have the funding to create a second generation.",1703959347,1703959347,True,16,1,0.683379292488098145,0,True,False,True

This game has a totally different playstyle to other games I play and i'm in love! Very additive.

Anyway, I quickly found out that I cannot drive GTA style as my car will just break on me and I couldn't afford to fix it so I was legging it around this city on foot grabbing my stock for my first shop. Then I fixed my car and could not find a parking space, my partner was like ""Lol imagine if you got a parking ticket for parking there"" AND I DID. BLOODY PARKING TICKET. 
I may have overspent getting stock for my first shop, so my 2nd business (fast food) has been slow going, and ive had to just hang around for a few days (nice time skip mechanic with sleep, or even playing games in your flat) but its never gotten boring. Even running around getting my own stock hasnt been boring.
Ive just gotten a purchasing person who is meant to make stock and deliveries way easier. 

Its quite a chill game, addictive, good price for the game. You need to be able to drive a car in game without crashing every few seconds though haha.

My first game I started on v0.3. For an early access game, I had very few issues. On my first play-through I reached a 50 million net worth with about 45 stores or so. When 0.4 came out I decided to start a new play-through as I didn't feel like figuring out what items needed to be fixed across all of my stores. 

There were of course some bugs on the new version but the dev team has been awesome about fixing them as quickly as they could even with the holiday's almost upon us. They dropped updates on the 13th, 14th and 23rd addressing the worst of the bugs.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]
I personally love this style of game. A bigger city and more business would be great, but I think it’s already really good and more fun than most business sims I have played. 0.4 improved the driving which was one of my biggest issues besides the office-based businesses. Both were fixed which has improved the game and made it more engaging and fun. Being able to build out your various businesses, headquarters, and distribution networks is really satisfying.

[h2]Areas that could improve:[/h2]
[h3]Late game:[/h3]
I feel like I am mostly just sleeping and doing all the happiness activities. So, it would be nice to see more activities and things to do in the city. I realize you can be very hands-on and design all of your stores, do your own deliveries etc, but I think most of us agree that would just get very repetitive and tedious.

[h3]Character models:[/h3]
Currently not the greatest and maybe some love will be given to them eventually.

[h3]Headquarters:[/h3]
The ability to move your HQ employees to a new HQ without losing your distribution plans, HR assigned employees, Purchase manager orders etc. Maybe a moving company could be added for when we want to move our HQ to a new location or something like that. Writing everything down when I upgrade to a new HQ is a pain.

[h3]Add a Store Designer:[/h3]
One thing that would make life really great, would be having a store designer. It could be software you buy for your computer that gives you a new activity to do on your computer. It could also boost your happiness instead of having to game all the time. My thought is you could choose one of the floor plans and the business type. Then you could fully design and layout our store, save the design, and have the interior designers install it. This system could also be used to preview downloaded blueprints so we can get a better view of them before we waste money installing a design that we are not happy with. The current blueprint system makes it tough to see the designs so a designer could solve that problem while making it easier for us to design our stores before we open them. Having a lot of shipments get dropped off and grabbing them 4 items at a time with a dolly can be a pain and is time consuming. 

[h2]Closing:[/h2]
Overall, I love the game, though I do partially agree with a couple of the negative reviews that say there isn't enough variety between businesses as far as managing them goes.

Thanks to the dev team for being responsive and quick to fix major bugs. Thanks to the community that has made so many helpful blueprints that have save me countless hours. Can’t wait to see what Big Ambitions brings in 2024!",1703485533,1703486219,True,71,0,0.856279194355010986,0,True,False,True

Onward to critiques (made constructively)
Automating your resupply can be very annoying and you will need to long before you otherwise unlock the ability. For one or two businesses you can manage but if you aggressively expand not so much.
The ONE map is small and once you learn it it can dampen the fun of the game. Mod support or randomly generated cities would keep it fresh.
Markets behave without variation, they will perform as expected until the end of time.
Drastic income variation between store types, I'm not a fan of balance in games (because good balance gives you an illusion of choice) but come on now do that many people flood a jewelry shop? For all the hassle it is being a grocer, it is a poor way to make a buck.

I like the driving aspect, it's integral to the immersion of the manual labors of starting out from scratch (which I love),  but at the same time, it does get annoying late game because I feel the natural flow of the game tends to go toward less manual operation and more automation, i.e. delivery routes and such.  I found myself sleeping, eating, playing video games in the apartment just to pass time while nothing was going on and then having to leave to do some manual labor, such as opening a new business.

It's simple to figure out whats in demand but difficult to determine where that business would be the most profitable and that's a good thing. Lastly, longevity is great for a small title like this. Starting a business is easy enough but making one that's profitable and expanding into other markets is where the challenge comes in. I'll admit I'm at a point where I make $30K a day so it's very easy to go into new markets or open new stores. My hope is in the future, there will be more products / industries to enter and hopefully there can be more to do such as mixed stores, big box stores, real estate business etc.

I like the game and find it fun but I have a few issues & suggestions.

It would be nice to have the ability to detach the camera from the player. When the player exits a vehicle the camera should point in the direction of the vehicle and not flip around. When player exits a building the camera should face the player and not flip behind the building.

Some items are not found in logical places - Example shelving to store product is found in the appliance store and not the furniture store.

A few items feel pointless - In a small restaurants booths are useless because they only seat one customer. (This may not matter if you are not babysitting a restaurant)  The player can't rest on couches but can sleep on benches? What is the stove for in the furniture store I thought maybe for cooking frozen food but nope. Do restaurant boards have any impact on the business? It seems the only metrics that matter are cash registers, Product holders, employee skill and traffic index. 

The game should also have a metric for product pricing. I've played around with it but going much over a few bucks has a very negative impact on the business. 

After setting up a few businesses furnishing them becomes very tedious and some kind of blueprint system really needs to be added. When you order on the phone to have stuff delivered it should auto fill a blueprint. Also we should be able to upgrade the dolly to the cart you get in the furniture store that holds 6 boxes so you can move more stuff in one shot.

I want to be able to buy a box of fresh food and stuff it in my fridge at home. Or I would like to put an industrial fridge and storage in my apartment and have my logistics fill it for me. But you would need to allow the player to eat it right out of the industrial fridge without a bag.

I would like to be able to take out a specific amount of money from the bank on an investment and not the entire thing.

I don't like that you can't eat at a restaurant you own. (Food feels like more of an annoyance then a game feature).

It would be nice if you could purchase an upgrade to add auto park to cars and vans that don't have it which is all of them except the exotic cars.

A hide walls feature would be nice especially in smaller spaces.

Boats should have a purpose other then a prop that let's you relax especially because they are so expensive. Also they should fill your food meter because of the annual cost.

Fulfilling achievement tasks should not be a metric for your players happiness. Everything else seems fine for this.

Purchasing a building feels very underwhelming with very little return on investment. (You can spend 40 million on a building and only get $1,000 a day). Yet you can have a business in the smallest building and get $20,000 a day. You can spend $500,000,000 and only get $20,000 a day. And unless you exploit the casino or cheat it will take a very long time to save up to buy a building.",1682687988,1700675823,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

if you love business management games this is one if the better ones on Steam, rather than just being limited to an office or building like most games, here you can travel around the city with your persona.

For anyone who wants to take a shot at building up their own business, or a corporation of multiple businesses and locations, check this game out! You can choose to do this in your own style, name your businesses, decorate and use various items and materials to make it your own. There are several factors to manage and design including business function and paths to success, public opinion and response to your business as well as general supply and demand, personal and employee needs and happiness, employee schedules and store operation days and times, and much more. There is a certain resemblance to The Sims and GTA, with the ability to traverse and discover the city, exploring different businesses and shops that offer various things a player may use to develop their own business. As you further your own success and gain wealth, you can even level up your own apartment and style your home and offices however you like.

I am very much enjoying the game and look forward to future game development and expansion. The existing items are great and functional, and I'd love to see additional options come available as well.

I have managed to spend a lot of hours on here without even feeling like I have. I hope the developers read this as this game has so much potential and I wouldn't even mind spending £5-10 on future add-ons. 

Just some ideas of add-ons / game modes that I think would be great:

- Gangster / Mobsters add-on - We run legit businesses to grow... why not add a dark side so we can run different businesses which are illegal - make more money but risk of getting caught / fined etc

- Resource production + factory production - If we could expand the map to farmlands / big brown belt sites to start factories to cut out the middle man of importing to maximise profits. Start a lumberjack, to send to a factory to make paper bags to send to our warehouses to our stores for use... the scope of detail that could be added is great and if this can be done for all products would be awesome.

- Family - Maybe a little bit ""sims"" like, but could definitely explore the option of having a partner you have to keep happy and children that you can pass the game / business on to. If you have neither you risk the game ending so it adds a more realistic feel to the game. If you get married and you don't take the partner out, you risk losing a hefty divorce settlement!

- Online mode! I'd love to compete against other humans or have a co-op campaign on the go I can play with friends!

UI Features that could be cool:

- Add indicators to vehicles that users can use
- When the user presses F1 for help - allow us to move this window around so we can have it open on all screens etc and click other menus to navigate easier

Downsides:

The only downside I see of this game atm with any sandbox - once you have mastered the basics it can potentially become tedious. This is why I am hoping down the line future add-on and features can be added to keep us hooked. 
My main goal at the moment is to do all achievements and literally own the whole map!

If anyone read all this - I highly recommend!

Yeah, I already paid for this game. But I don't feel like playing it yet. Personally, I would like more choice in the balance between the economic component and the simulation. 
The very beginning of the game, with working in the store, buying the first items, etc. - is done very well. But further operational activity is too similar to the sims and if it will be possible to make it so that I can enable the option within the game, where I turn into a manager, not directly the owner of a small business and for example I can order how the furnishing will be made in a virtual copy of the room, and the next day will come delivery and the interior is automatically arranged, it will be very cool.

This surprise title is brimming with potential and incredibly addictive gameplay right from the start. But can it hold your attention while you work and/or gamble your way to becoming the next big business magnate?

The game starts quite realistically. You have no money, no car and no place to stay, which is a pretty awful thing when you live in New York City. Luckily, your rich uncle steps up to act as your mentor, tells you to grab a small business loan and to rent a place for yourself to live in as well as a property to open a tiny gift shop in. Right from the get-go, you can't help but be impressed by what the game is promising to be. You control your own character at all times, but can manage deliveries, staff and other things via your phone. You outfit your own store yourself, by purchasing individual furniture pieces, loading them into your car, driving down to the shop and then grabbing them one by one to place them. One look at the map shows you that nearly every building in the game is purchaseable and can act as either a home, a warehouse or a place to run a business in. This gets you hooked, makes you want to put in the effort to eventually own most of the city. Maybe you could control the entire liquor market and create artificial shortages to manipulate the demand... The possibilities seem endless, especially once your uncle tells you that demand for certain products fluctuates and is also different for each neighbourhood.

This is the part of the review where I finally tell you why it is marked as a negative one. The phenomenal early game experience simply does not last. After opening a couple of businesses, you quickly realise that you've already hit the end game. There is very little difference between running a tiny corner shop versus a gigantic jewelry emporium in the heart of the city, with the exception being that larger stores are a pain to furnish. It feels great to outfit your starter shop yourself, grabbing individual shelves from the back of your car and placing them with care, but having to do the same for a large clothes store that needs you to place over 40 clothes racks to satisfy customer capacity gets dull very fast. There are no options to automate the more tedious aspects of the game later on, which puts a dampener on the experience. It would have been great to be able to save a template for your stores that you can later apply to others you open, to save you some manual labour. Isn't being rich all about just throwing money at stuff so you don't have to do anything? Let me pay some muscle to get my store ready for me, thank you.
Even if you enjoy manually furnishing your businesses, you'll likely never even set foot back in them once they're up and running. Hiring and training staff is done through menus, as is assigning them to their work schedules. Once that's done, you automate the supply line using a warehouse and your HQ workers, the purchase and logistics agents. Again, you unfortunately cannot just tell the people you pay to handle your logistics to actually handle your logistics autonomously. You will need to set exact purchase limits and frequencies, as well as how much stock your stores should receive. Optimising this is a matter of watching the balance for a few days, then adjusting, then leaving it forever (or until you open another business that uses the same goods). It would have been nice to have an option to let some skilled managers handle this aspect as well once you're so rich that you really can't be bothered anymore.

The need for manual micro management on your part makes buying out other businesses more of a tedium. They do come pre-furnished, but often need a few extra pieces that you will have to lug on over. Then, you will need to integrate your new acquisition into your supply chain by adjusting the imports and stock levels and assigning HQ agents to it. Tedious!
Now, you would think that with such a heavy focus on micro management, there would be lots of things to actually manage. Tons of different products, maybe from different suppliers and/or countries. Rare artisan products with huge individual profit magins versus mass produced garbage that sells really well. Unfortunately, not really. Again, in the early game you are almost delusional at the prospect of running many different kinds of shops, but ultimately, there is only a handful of business types available. These are split into shops and offices. Offices are totally hands-off once you assign employees and maybe buy some marketing for them, they'll just start generating passive income. Shops are slightly more involved in that they need a supply chain, but you only ever have to worry about a handful of products. Gift shops for instance can only sell three types of goods: Cheap gifts, expensive gifts and soda cans. Meh. I would have liked more variety maybe. Same with the building interiors, these are the same for all properties and only vary by size and type of business. Some unique designs would have been awesome.

I believe the game is struggling with its own identity. It wants to be a business sim, but it has a bunch of life sim aspects in it that slow it down. But neither aspect is 100% fleshed out, so ultimately, they both fall just short of being great. This game is almost amazing. It's so unique and it conjurs up images of old-school business tycoons but it just doesn't reach that level of complexity. Once you have a comfortable enough passive income (which is not hard to achieve), you lack motivation to move on. From that point, it's closer to an AFK clicker game than a business sim, open another few stores to watch that number go up, done. Reaching the zenith of New York high society should feel like a rush, instead it is a sad realization that you've exhausted what fun you had in the game. Maybe that's a hidden message to us, the audience, that money cannot buy happiness?

I will say that the game is still in Early Access, so additional business types and goods can easily be added, as well as features such as auto-furnish or auto-balancing supply chains. However, I'm not sure how the actual end game can be improved with just more content.",1680962872,1697552759,False,197,7,0.891327977180480957,6,True,False,True

These are my issues:

- When you have a large list of bussinesses it's hard to find them in the open menus (you  have to scroll down, but they are not in chronological nor alphabetical order)
- It could be nice to have a button to speed up time, since there is not a bunch of things to do out of your bussiness. I find myself most of the time sleeping for 24 hours so the time goes by faster. 
- I understand the idea of calling to order furniture and reaching out marketing and recruitment agencies. But it would be nice to use the ""internet"" or some thing to place the orders without having to wait for the store to open.
- Ordering a taxi from your phone would be also nice, instead of just running around trying to catch one. 
- I would appreciate having a way of moving things internally, from a warehouse to another warehouse, from one store to another, without having me to go physically. It seems unrealistic that a guy with millions in his bank account would do that. Maybe a new worker: operations managers?
- It would be also cool that furniture had an impact in the likeability of the bussiness, not only walls and floor.

Let me say that my whole year up to August 2022, when the game was first supposed to launch, had me anxious for it. Six months passed by, and I got tired of waiting for the game and decided to give up on it.

March of this year, I was very hurt, and my resentment just wouldn't let me give the game a go. Fast forward to about half of the year, and my cousin lent me his account to play the game with (or at least test it). Today I have at least 100 hours of gameplay and gave, for the first time, a go for my much-awaited game.

Let me just say that I already love the game more than I already used to. The amount of details, furniture, cars, city structures, and the inside and outside of buildings, even the BizMan UI is perfect.

Trust me, it is worth your money and, most importantly, your time.

At first, everything was a bit overwhelming bc I have not played this intense of a game before, BUT that brings me to the most pleasant surprise!

The tutorial was fine enough, but with that much of a resource, I found I preferred to figure the game out organically. I will add though that it took me a little longer than Im proud of to figure out the headquarter's function or really how to use it, but I might be a little slow on that.

For me this is about as close as a 10/10 game could be, so this isnt meant as critique, but more things that need some tweaking in my personal opinion. Right now the driving option is kinda not the best. It seems like the goal is to set it up to be one of the better transportation options in game, but for ease alone I prefer walking/using the subway. I think a couple things would fix that. It's a little outdated, but I wonder if having a slightly cost prohibitive option to purchase alongside the car that could offer sat-nav type thing where you could open the map and then pick a spot and it would autodrive you, I think that could make cars more attractive. Or having something like a bike available, either for purchase or rent to lend a middle ground in ease of use/availability.

I also find it a little frustrating that all companies use a handtruck, with a storage capacity of 4, when the god tier ika flatbed w/a storage capacity of 8 exists. I understand it wouldnt make sense in all locations, but somewhere like AJ Pedersons or the wholesalers, I think it would make sense to have there instead of running over, stealing a flatbed and then trying not to leave the lot without it.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

My initial impression of Big Ambitions was immediately positive. The game offers an extensive and realistic experience of entrepreneurship in an open world, setting it apart from other business simulation games.

In Big Ambitions, you have the freedom to establish and manage various types of businesses, from gift shops to jewelry stores. What truly sets the game apart is its ability to allow you to respond to the city's demand and adapt your businesses accordingly, adding depth to the gameplay.

One challenge I encountered was managing the inventory of my stores. In the beginning, I had to keep an eye on my stock and make purchases manually, but later in the game, I invested in an office building and warehouse to better manage my inventory.

One of the highlights of Big Ambitions is that the developers actively listen to player feedback. After I expressed a desire to see the option for part-time and full-time employees, it was quickly added in an update.

An achievement I'm proud of is successfully managing multiple thriving businesses and paying off all loans at the bank. This allowed me to generate even more profit and continue expanding to new businesses, office buildings, and warehouses.

I would definitely recommend Big Ambitions to gamers interested in entrepreneurship. It provides a playful yet realistic glimpse into running a business and is ideal for those looking to experience what it's like to be an entrepreneur. Big Ambitions is a fantastic opportunity to pursue your entrepreneurial ambitions, albeit in a virtual world.",1687944535,1695560332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has some features I wish other economy games like American Truck and European Truck Simulator had, mainly the ability to own your own home and upgrade it over time as your wealth grows.  It is similar to the Sims in that regard but at it's core of the game it is a well crafted business model simulator.

 It would be fun to see it develop some of the Sims style social interactions where you can meet and make friends and start relationships, etc. 

Fun game that scratches some itches other sims in the genre aren't with an addictive game play loop.

It has some great elements and while it can seem very micro-management in the beginning, you can quickly grow to to automate things. There are still some QOL updates that need to happen, however, each update they improve many of those things. 

The biggest complaint I have with the game is it needs to stop trying to be The Sims. It really kills the game having to get back to the apartment to sleep, and then trying to manage happiness and hunger. There is already a game that does this, The Sims, no need to add that to this one. There should be a way to toggle this feature on or off, so those that want to use this as a Business Builder can do just that. 

QOL updates I would love to see (EA as of 0.3)
- Toggle on/off the Sleep, Happiness and Hunger
- Ability to request a taxi from anywhere
- When items are delivered, have the pallet delivered inside your shop (or an easy way to move the entire pallet into your shop instead of 4 items at time on the hand truck)
- Pause time when making adjustments inside of Bizman (lost an entire day when I was optimizing a few things)
- Ability to quickly look inside of a building without having to travel to it
- Ability to turn off damage on vehicles (I avoid driving because driving is so bad in this game, and the vehicle gets damaged so quickly. Instead, I scooter or taxi everywhere) 
- Multi-select racks/shelves for moving together easily OR changing product type. (Takes forever to change each clothing rack in a set of 8, and then to do all 64 of them in your store if you sell all 8 clothing products)

Had a blast playing this game on initial release, stopped after 38 playtime to wait for more gameplay updates. Went back to play again after a few decent looking updates, seeing that the devs had said that you could update your save or leave that save on the old version. 

Started up the game and I was greeted with a message saying there had been an update and asking if I wanted to update my save, which I clicked yes. Then clicked 'Continue' and I was greeted with another message, with my only options being to delete or move the save file, or close the dialogue box. Neither of the first two options actually did anything, so I just closed the game. 40 hours I'll never get back, I guess.

What bunch of A Holes (Developers) the best money earner was Clothing now you get less from Clothing Stores (Fk'n Why ?) so it takes longer to mass wealth (Idiots), secondary products now don't sell as many items too, I feel sorry for people who supported this from the beginning new players wont know how easy it was to get rich an explore everything the game offered and the worst thing about this useless update is all previous saves before this Fk'n Nerf update don't load even though they've got a Skip Update option in the Menu, Can I get a full refund & reimbursed for the 550+ hours I wasted on this or even a reply as why you thought this nerf was a good idea...Probably not, I said I was going to change my positive review to a negative one in the comment below so I've just done that now I'll just delete this an install a game that doesn't s h i t on its customers.
   
April 15th...Fix loading save MC can't move, Player can't interact with menu or objects only pause/live option working but all NPC's still move around only way to fix is close game via Steam Library an try to reload last save (489hrs in an I'm regretting giving this a positive review), this latest bug hasn't happened this often until usually once or twice a week since release but today this is the 4th time I've tried to play an now it's just annoying.

Fix the Age selection at the Employment Agency ...Can I have 3 Customer Services 18 - 30, 31 - 50 please, first  txt Age 57 second Age 64 WTF developer !

(1st review after2.5hrs)There's that many things showing up on the screen telling you what to do....telling you what to do is what this should of been titled, Do this Do that...Any fk'n chance I could make up my mind an choose where I want to go instead constantly trying to get me to follow your Uncle constantly trying to run your life, we get it start a business, make money rinse & repeat....Get a job Quit your job Start a Gift Shop make some cash start another business...I hope this constant hand held game quits being so pushy an lets me decide my future...Oh an using a controller sucks too...How the fk do you pick an item (cash register) up to move it once you've put it down ?

(2nd review after 383hrs) This is a fun game to play but FK me is it annoying hiring staff to work in your business, 1st of all Employment Agencies meet the employers demands (full or part time) constantly getting low percentage part timers who tell you what there going to work an how often or what time of day they prefer...I'm paying them to recommend a suitable employee not a bunch of lazy dumb a ss useless morons expecting me to pay for them to train to a better percentage an let them tell me that there only working mornings 4 days a week...£500 to get garbage, can I open up an employment agency an show them how it's done properly, obviously the developer spent most of COVID lockdown furnishing empty buildings and adding annoying info panels that pop up on every single building your not interested in instead of working on the annoying parts, hired a 50% full timer trained her twice now at 70% customers say ""Rude not coming back here"" the two other full timers in before her are 43% & 47% no customers call them Rude...customers telling me to wear a Uniform where's my comeback ""get the fk out my business you a sshole I own the company I'll wear what I like your barred"".

 A few tips for new players don't bother painting or tiling floors in the whole shop just add 1 stripe of paint on 1 wall stops ""Ugly floor & Walls"" comment,

Don't waste $300 on a loudspeaker there's a small $80 speaker on the computer desk further into the furniture store,

Buy what you need even if you don't have room in your vehicle an leave outside the store/warehouse it doesn't despawn an go an pick up later,

 Rent Uncle (Annoying) Freddy's friends apartment for 1 night pick up & pack bed leave an rent a shop terminate your tenancy with the apartment an live in the store room of your shop you'l get your $1300 deposit back to spend on the business when you have the cash rent a better place with parking outside instead of that annoying building Freddy wants you to rent were you can only park at the end of the street...cheap rent my a ss there's the same building in the next street for $800 deposit an it's only $26 rent a day the developer thought you'd do this so you take -50% happiness don't worry it's only for few days.
 
The loading screen saying ""After you visit various locations you can call them"" it lies you have to find the person sitting behind the desk in each building to start an order/account, heads up talk to the useless Employment Agency before you take the Basic management course you can call them straight away after you complete the course as long as it's before 5pm.

Ordering multiple deliveries (10am - 2pm) to the same location at the same time doesn't work there's only 1 drop off point outside buildings so if you have a delivery at 10am clear it away before the 2pm one turns up an don't order multiple deliveries outside at the same time, warehouse deliveries get delivered to storage inside so it doesn't effect those,
 
Don't think every Start has the same buildings to rent leave an create a new Start you might get better buildings (1000sqm buildings, better buildings with higher traffic), If you want to make cash quickly open up a clothes shop (8 clothes racks & soda) in Hells Kitchen with 72 Traffic (look by the right side near the Ramp) it will make $30k a day after a few days of opening...Don't wait for Freddy to tell you when to start a business do it on Day 2 (if you do a 24hr Advanced Management course is needed to start a 2nd business if you want to follow Uncle Fred's tips later on)...Enjoy, Oh an eat twice quickly it stops your food going down until you sleep again...low food = energy dropping faster.",1678484936,1693838391,False,0,0,0.470316141843795776,0,True,False,True

The ideas behind it are sound, and I wish I could persevere with it, but as it stands it's virtually unplayable. The mouse is alternately unresponsive or massively over-sensitive. It is almost impossible to enter buildings without finding the exact correct place to click, and as they do not tell you where to click, it can take almost all one game day to get inside. Then, it's often past  game bedtime (sleep, and planning it, is crucial to success) before you can actually do the things you're supposed to do.

At least not in any meaningful way that adds any layer of fun, as of yet.

I loved it at first, but the further I progressed, the less I cared about piloting a little toon around an empty, static city full of indestructible road cones. 

It's not a terrible game, by all means, it's quite addictive for a while. 
I tend to leave these games paused a lot on a side monitor, so my steam ingame hours are inaccurate. I would guesstimate I got ~40-50hrs out of it, maybe a bit more, which isn't too bad overall. But once the game loop feels like it's getting stale, it's suddenly steep downhill from there.

You have no friends, no family, not even a pet. Driving boxes around stops being fun. The game suddenly feels very repetitive. 
Once you're done setting up some different shops, you have some cars that are mostly crap and some yachts that are glorified beds. 

The sports/luxury cars either slide all over the place, are ridiculously expensive to fix, are too big for the narrow streets.. I didn't find myself enjoying them much. Some of them are ok, but ultimately I just felt like they revealed the weaknesses of the car portion of the game, more than feel like an upgrade. 

They are adding stuff, but so far the DJ booth, the gym, they are the same simple mechanic as the TV/PC etc. They've added some animations so that helps make it a little more visually appealing, but it's still still just gloss and cosmetic variation.

The concept is great, and it's early EA, so this may, or may not, change in the future.

Negative review? Mostly because I feel they use very bold language for selling this game. 
The devs seem quite active, and do a lot of things right, but I've never heard them mention anything other than cosmetic variations of what's already in the game.

Original review here;

As of now, it's an EA title with a good foundation, now the devs need to start drilling for some depth.

I could tell you what's wrong or right with the game at this point but instead I'm going to throw out some ideas about how the game could improve, in hope the devs will pick up on it.

First, creating a business is a chore, clicking multiple times to place 1 item at a time is not fun.
My idea; implement a shop layout/blueprint mode where you have free choice of items to use and place in a blueprint. Then allow me to order everything I used in that blueprint from the stores. Allow them to place it all on my doorstep and allow me to call a move company to set the shop up in the exact way I have put it in my blueprint. 

Second, employees need more details. All employees are the same entities and don't have any skills or traits besides being either a worker or a cleaner. The only difference is a worker can clean but a cleaner can't work the cash register. Once you trained them to 100% they will be as good in a gift store as they'll be in a restaurant.
My idea; Add cooks to stand behind the pizza over or burger grill. This way it's not 1 person taking the order, making the food and packing it up. Add traits to employees, e.g. socialy strong (more friendly towards customers), focused (makes more burgers an hour), etc. This adds more tactics involved in selecting/hiring employees.

Third; Hiring people should be way easier. 
My idea; More filters. Make me select if I'm looking for full/part-time workers. Ticks for traits/specilizations, which cost more money to recruit and also more money to hire.

And lastly, the whole business model needs a rework. I was having a ton of fun until I realized my clothes shop made 45k a day and my restaurant was only making 150 bucks a day. I turned my restaurant into another clothes store and by the 2nd day it was already making a profit of 25k a day. No use in setting up anything else but clothing stores as of now. Even the jewelry, which I tweaked a lot, ended up making a merely 14k a day profit. This bummed me out and made me write up this review.

I hope the devs have a use for this review and this game will eventually reach its full potential. Untill then I can't recommend it in its current state as its just too shallow for a business sim.",1680646121,1693419367,True,0,0,0.604150652885437012,0,True,False,True

But the game is well made and didn't crash and so I'll recommend it those who are not as lazy as me.

I did enjoy setting up my first three businesses but then the game decided I wasn't ""happy"" unless I did pointless things like exercising and watching TV that I didn't have to do before and it all became a bit of a chore.  

So I decided my three businesses are making me enough money to retire on, and I win!

A: Yes, I hereby absolutely recommend this game.

Q: Can you give us some detail about this game and why it is worth it?
A: Well, you often hear about an early access game which is really well developed despite the fact that it isn´t completed, but BIG AMBITIONS has so many aspects already implemented, it took me 26+ hours and I´m still not fed up. You start with little money and your uncle gives you some advice on how to start businesses. It is clearly a tutorial, but it doesn´t feel like you are following dull how-to-play-instructions. We are just at 0.2 version, but there are already several business types, a lot of diverse furniture types, a nice variety of cars to buy etc.

Q: Is there any aspect you would love to have improved by the developers?
A: Of course BIG AMBITIONS is far from perfect. For example I would love to get the chance to interact more with my surroundings like other citizens or create a network of people who can help me out or I could help them out. Finding a partner would be a nice addition, too. Getting kids, move into the suburbs etc.

Q: For those fellow steamers who have no clue what to expect, what is BIG AMBITIONS like gameplaywise?
A: Good thing you ask (I am clearly not asking myself!)! BIG AMBITIONS is a mixture of Plutocracy, GTA 1&2, SIMS, The Guild and - this one hurts me the most - Project Zomboid.

Q: Wow, that´s some fruity salad of games. But why does the last one hurt you so much?
A: Project Zomboid decays since 10 Years in my Steam-Library without fullfilling it´s initial promise. Why is a game like BIG AMBITIONS everything Project Zomboid apparently can never be? You got the top down view, the furniture, the cars, the npcs, the buildings, why is it so damn difficult to develope a story which includes clean scripted encounters with non-playables? What do you need a dacade to program the minimum while Hovgaard Games achieves more in a year? Why are there...

While relatively new and not as widely known, this game proves that even small titles can pack a big punch in terms of enjoyment and engagement.

Expanding Horizons:

From the moment I started playing ""Big Ambitions,"" I was drawn into a world where my dreams were the limit. The game's diverse range of objectives, from building an empire to achieving personal milestones, truly encapsulated the essence of ambition. Whether it was expanding my business empire or mastering a complex skill, each accomplishment felt like a step closer to realizing my in-game dreams.

Diverse Gameplay:

One of the standout features of ""Big Ambitions"" is its diverse gameplay. Players can expect a variety of challenges that cater to different interests, from strategic decision-making to skill mastery. This diversity keeps the game engaging, ensuring that there's always something new to tackle, no matter what your ambitions may be.

Navigating Challenges:

""Big Ambitions"" doesn't shy away from presenting players with hurdles and obstacles. From managing resources effectively to making tough choices that impact the course of the game, every decision felt consequential. These challenges added depth and substance, making my progress all the more rewarding.

Rising Above:

The sense of accomplishment in ""Big Ambitions"" is genuinely satisfying. As I worked my way through the game's objectives, I felt a sense of pride in overcoming the challenges it presented. This journey mirrored the real world in its portrayal of setbacks and triumphs, making it both relatable and enjoyable.

Conclusion: Aspirations Unleashed

""Big Ambitions"" may not have made waves in the mainstream gaming scene yet, but it certainly impressed me with its potential and depth. From tackling strategic decisions to honing my skills, the game provided an immersive experience that resonated with my own ambitions. In a world where dreams seem limitless, ""Big Ambitions"" offers a virtual space to chase after them, reminding players that with determination and effort, they can achieve anything they set their minds to.",1692820832,1692820832,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,True

Your investment will yield great returns in enjoyment, and you'll also be backing the developers to make this game a real blue-chip""

The trailer had me worried it might be too liquid and shallow, but as I audit the game, I'm thrilled with the compound interest of challenges and gradual learning (I'm diving straight into hard mode for my first financial venture).

Of course, there's room for a little market correction in terms of polish (just skim the discussions in the game's  community hub), but my portfolio of fun is seeing some impressive growth.

If this game's prospectus catches your eye, consider it a capital gain to buy. Your gaming portfolio will thank you.",1692818628,1692818628,True,4,3,0.543859601020812988,0,True,False,True

I would love to see my staff move around e.g. the cleaners should actually be seen walking around to clean. Additionally, the AI drivers who roam the city need to be improved, you would be reversing or simply changing lanes and they will just completely smash right into you regardless of how far you are. In general we need more leisure activities to do, and the actual ability to sit and eat our food instead of eating everything from a paper bag. The walking animations should of been worked on ages ago, even before release, how can you be content with a life sim game where the person walks like an alien. The UI needs to be improved, including making certain actions more clear like when training your staff. A tip or small tutorial feature would be helpful (myself and others included needed to do research on the internet to figure this out). I've noticed when visiting stores that the line would get ridiculously large because the game kept spawning people without knowing the speed of the cashiers. (e.g. i would enter a cafe, I'm first to enter generally, I then take a look at the menu for a second, next minute there's like 30 people lining up for ""coffee""). It would be helpful to have a feature to customise where the queue begins and ends. I know others probably agree with me as well, but there needs to be a way to check the ""current"" sales throughout that day and total earnings for that day. Instead of a weekly estimate of what items were sold, a daily would be more helpful since the business is constantly growing and it would be more useful to know how many burgers are being sold today with the stat being counted.

When I first launched this game I didn't think it would be any good. The options to create an avatar were very dated and limited and the graphics looked awful in the menus. However, in the game, things are much better. After playing the story mode for the game (don't just try playing it on your own as you will struggle), I've found this to be an amazing game. If you have ever wanted to start a small business, this is the game for you. You find yourself running to and from the cash and carry in your clapped out car, trying to park in awkward spots without getting another dent. Running the stores yourself until you can afford to hire staff and getting by with just the bare bones until you can afford improvements. You even get an apartment to furnish as you have spare cash to do so. It's actually a pretty compelling game and there is soooooo much to create and do in it, I don't think you could quickly get bored!

As far as gameplay, I found the first 8 hours to be engaging, playing in stints of 3-4 hours at a time. I really enjoyed the element of being able to drive to locations, rather than just pointing and clicking and I also liked that it's a legitimate challenge to keep your needs taken care of while also pouring the time you need to into your business. My two biggest gameplay suggestions would be to expand the number of items available for sale in various shops and to add more options for interacting with customers and employees.

I love the graphic quality and was pleasantly surprised at how realistic objects and buildings look. The people need to have the same depth applied  as currently they basically look like sticks in the midst of an otherwise realistic world. The world itself is big enough for my taste, but I'd suggest adding a few more types of buildings that can be explored in free time. 

I noticed many reviewers saying that it stops being fun after approximately 10 hours. I haven't noticed that yet personally, but will update this review if I find that when I've played a few more hours. It would appear to me that replayability would be high since you can play in a non-story mode where you make all your own choices rather than following quests. More development of how to use your free time (and how to have more of it) would improve replayability as well. Obviously, I can't say for sure yet, but I expect that as you are able to hire more employees, free time might increase.

Overall, I'd give this game a B+ as is. I expect that by the time it's ready for regular release, I'll be updating that to an A.

I hope more types of businesses are added in the future.  As well as maybe police so if you speed you have to deal with them or  they actually check if your parked legally.

The feeling which you have of starting on your own with very limited supplies and help available and when you see first money come in is really quite unique. Definitely would recommend to buy and play and I will happily revisit it once it progresses a bit down the development roadmap.
Currently at some point it becomes a bit tedious when progressing above certain level (I am easily bored by tediousness relatively to most players) - the way to improve it would be:
- improved hiring / recruitment - currently only available via text messages which is a bit tough when you need to hire more than a couple people ([i]on the dev roadmap[/i])
- interior blueprints ([i]on the dev roadmap[/i]) / interior designer - moving 50 boxes from the street level is a bit tedious. Also potentially it would be much easier if you could unpack in an easier way from the trolley as there is too much clicking to do it
- some more interactions when it comes to buying / renting buildings - otherwise these are just money storing devices to protect from inflation
- ability to change colour of the items placed
- some benefits when it comes to buying a better furniture for your own apartment - otherwise there is not much to work for
- some rationalisation of the cost of repairing cars - when you get a more expensive one the costs become crazy! :)

Starting off is fun, it's an incredibly tedious process of trying to stay afloat and build your little empire. However that makes it fun. I started off with a wine & cigar store, progressed to a gift shop, built a massive law firm (* huge waste of time don't do it *), before finally blowing a million hard earned dollars through careful stock flips on a ""five cups"" coffee shop which is nothing more than a tax write off I can not make a profit nor keep employees. 

The problem I have is that you're going to hit a part in the game where there's really nothing left to pursue. 

That bad business I blew a million dollars on? I can't sell it. I didn't even know it was a failing business, all this game will let you do is make a proposition to the business owner and he says yes or no. You don't even get a due dilligence packet showing you the finances of the business and whether its going to be a good buy or not. 

The stock market is pretty limited. You're enclosed to two banks. Jensen capital (* a shady bank *), and a bigger bank deep in the city. Each bank has 3 stock investments you can buy. That's it. Very slow moving. The more money you pump into a fund the more volatile your gains / losses will be, but it's pretty fatiguing watching that. Granted, that's not the point of this game - it's to build a business empire to gain wealth, not work the stock market. But, freedom should be in the player in how they want to play this. The stock market mechanics need work. We need more investments. 

We should be able to sell businesses. Also, wheres the moving service? The process of moving a business is incredibly painstaking and tedious work. Even with a freight truck and a handcart,  you'll be putting in upwards of 30-60 minutes just to relocate a business to a bigger office. I would rather pay a hefty fee to have all the furniture packed, boxed, and shipped to the location of choice.

Also with the import / export service in this game, it's bugged. The person I hired to manage that part of my business so I could establish contracts, doesn't really do anything. Despite being scheduled, and the import/export business saying they would continue negotations. This is a drawback, as the warehouses I built can not deliver very cheap goods to my businesses - increasing profit margins and reducing supply bottlenecks.

There's a lot to the city that just feels empty. This game has big ambitions right now but delivers short. It needs a lot more work. For the price I guess it's a fair investment, but if you look at the roadmap of where the game is in its progress it looks like they have one more milestone? Definitely needs years of more work. So do I recommend this? Sure, if its on sale or the developers have pumped in a ton of more content. It kept me entertained for a little bit.",1691974234,1691974234,True,164,2,0.909366011619567871,6,True,False,True

It's a lot of fun if you like a little less detail on the shelf stocking part of your retail building empire. For example, you can open a gift shop. Instead of having to fill shelves of numerous types of items, you just drop a shelf and assign either ""Cheap"" or ""Expensive"" gifts and it will refill automatically if you have backup storage.

The city is nicely laid out and you will have to drive around it in 3rd person to buy furniture and supplies for your businesses. That's a whole another world to deal with, which can be both fun and frustrating.

Graphics wise, it looks really good (1440p). I'm running over 197 fps (according to the AMD software) with the a rare stutter here and there. So optimization seems very good.
The game hasn't crashed while I've have played so far. I had a couple of minor bugs (one which I reported) but nothing that will spoil your day.

Being able to spin up new businesses at a whim without having 10 hours of 'be a worker' style gameplay is actually a great idea. Instead of having to save money to start the meat of the game you get right into it fairly early, and the build up into a larger and larger experience is great. Starting with just a store or two, manually restocking, to eventually having a whole warehouse and logistics network to handle it all is just fabulous.

The only problem is after HQ/warehouses are set up, you don't need to go anywhere and in fact the game punishes you for stepping into any of your businesses by emptying the place of any active customers and starting the lines over again (more noticeable in food/cafe because they actually serve more in simulation than they can in rendered gameplay)

I think that one thing that could help the feeling of wasting time is if phone calls/online management actually kept the clock running imaging going through a restructure of the organization and needing to break for lunch on Saturday or Sunday rather than changing everyone's shifts and benefits in the snap of a finger on Tuesday night. would mean less time doing 24-168 hour sleeps at least while waiting for enough capital to start the next business.

Something that would actually pull you out of your apartment at higher levels is if you had in-person meetings or interviews at your headquarters or with lawyers for aquisitions or at banks for loans/investments. the fact you can phone everything in might be convenient, but it stretches the suspension of disbelief at times and pulls the scope of this game into a spreadsheet simulator.

Overall this game deserves a positive review because of the complexities of building up your first few businesses, I mean I already have sixty hours from doing that twice and trying to go deeper, but I am hopeful that these ideas are in the back of the developers minds and just not big enough to put on their roadmap, because there's nothing there to indicate that they see more time in the menus the longer the run goes as a problem, and after exploring the map I think it would be a shame to see them add a private chauffeur service in the future only for every player that reaches that level of wealth to see no need to use it other than to buy groceries (if they even want to keep up that level of realism).",1690389433,1690389433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Also, I wish there are more fun and rewarding ways I could spend my hard earn cash. The casino is great start, something different from the every day. Sometimes I just want to sleep through the entire day just to see how my finance is doing from the micro adjustments I have done the previous day.

Is it a walking/driving simulation?
Is it repetitive?
Is it a stripped-down Sims?
However, I needn't have worried, the game quickly lets you automate chores so there is less running around and you can hire staff  to manage staff, inventory and other repetitive chores etc. The whole Sims decorating your apartment and shops side of things is generally optional and can be ignored (it is not a major part of gameplay).

I played for about 45 hours and had a blast. A lot of fun and interesting, addictive game play. But there is not much new to do in the late game other than ""rinse and repeat"". There seems no clear goal other than to accumulate money. I could make my stores and offices more efficient and perfectionists will love this aspect, but for me, I think I will park this until  new features roll out. Though I am not sure I would want to play the game all over again from the beginning (I am not sure how much replay value it would have). For me this meant I stopped playing after about 45 hours.

I was the kid in school who loved playing those lemonade stand & stock market simulator games in entrepreneurship class. They were fun ways to teach basic business process and you could inject your own creativity. Big Ambitions takes this same feeling to a new level. 

You start in New York City as an ambitious 18 year old looking to grow a business empire. Uncle Fred gives your some cash to get started and you are then off to rent your own apartment. You have plenty of places to choose from, yes all with different deposits and daily rents. After a couple days working, you can get a loan to open your new business!

The control you have over your business is unlike any other game I've found. The developers to a great job at not shying away from important business concepts, but making it fun and easy to understand. From hiring employees, to managing contracts, Big Ambitions covers many parts of the business process.

In addition to the management parts of the game, you can decorate your business in really fun ways! I hope the developers continue to add more items to the game that we can purchase. It would be cool to see a managed content library of thousands of items we could purchase and decorate with.

I just moved to the NYC area and so finding this game has been really cool. They great job at representing the city environment and I hope there is a chance for the map to continue expanding and more businesses to be added.

Worth buying in its current state though!

Less than 20 hours in I generate $30,000 every day by just sitting in my home and playing video games (if only it were that easy). Once you've made shipping contracts and automatic deliveries there really doesn't seem much to do other than decorate what businesses you own and keep your happiness up. Every now and then you can buy a new business, spend maybe a week hiring new people, training them and decorating the place but then you are back to waiting to generate more money. The game certainly did what it set out to do but it's a very empty game play loop of mostly keeping your happiness up by either playing video games, exercising or walking in the park. Aside from keeping your happiness up you also have to manage your sleep and hunger. Sleep is easy enough to take care of as you need to keep it up to prevent going to the hospital from passing out. Hunger however just slows the game down as there is no fail state if you don't eat. Reaching zero hunger just increases the amount of energy that is used when doing actions such as exercise but once you are at the stage where you don't have to leave your home hunger becomes insignificant. There is also the issue that regardless of whatever you call your burger joint or however you decorate it the food is the same quality of the burger joint down the street. It's like having two vending machines next to each other with the same snacks but different names. There's no drive to pick one over the other as it's the same product. The amount of customers that are drawn to the business is already predetermined by the location and not what you have to offer. 

There are a few things that could help give a little more life to this game such as more character customization, optional mini-games to increase happiness, a social life system, food buffs from eating particularly good meals, product quality based on skilled workers, custom recipes for restaurants or random encounters such as customer complaints that you have to deal with which can positively or negatively effect your business. These are just a few ideas. 

All in all Big Ambitions isn't a bad game. It works, runs well and gives you something to do. If you're looking for a way to burn a few hours here and there give it a go but it's not something you'll be sinking hundreds of hours into. It is early access so I can give the game a break.

Review:

""Game is Good"" presents an intriguing concept of business management, but it ultimately feels somewhat one-dimensional. While the core objective of running a business is engaging, I believe there is room for improvement in terms of depth and dimension.

One area where the game could benefit from expansion is the inclusion of more jobs and educational opportunities. It would be fascinating to have a broader range of professions and the ability to invest in the growth and development of our employees. This would add a layer of complexity and realism to the game, as we navigate the intricacies of managing a diverse workforce.

Moreover, exploring life management aspects beyond business could significantly enhance the overall experience. Incorporating elements such as personal finances, leisure activities, and character control would broaden the game's scope and provide players with a more comprehensive simulation of life itself.

Speaking of character control, implementing traditional control schemes like the WASD movement would greatly improve the gameplay. Many players are accustomed to this control style and would appreciate its inclusion in the game, allowing for more intuitive and immersive interaction with the virtual environment.

Additionally, considering the introduction of families as a new aspect within the game could be an interesting avenue to explore. Managing a family alongside a business could offer fresh challenges and decisions, adding a new layer of complexity and emotional investment for players.

Expanding the variety of businesses available to manage is another avenue to consider. The inclusion of additional ventures, such as running a bank, factory, or car dealership, would not only diversify gameplay but also cater to different player interests and preferences.

In summary, ""Game is Good"" lays a solid foundation with its business management concept. However, to truly captivate players, it would greatly benefit from more depth and dimension. Incorporating diverse job opportunities, exploring life management aspects, improving character control, and expanding the range of businesses would elevate the game's overall experience. I encourage the developers to consider these suggestions as they continue to refine and enhance this promising game.",1689063786,1689063786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its refreshing, i don't think this has been done like this. Maybe i'm wrong. But this game has big potential to be a very successful game. 

I like the idea that you can walk into almost any building. I really like the idea that you can even buy out other businesses or your competition. Haven't played it long enough yet to give a full in depth review, but what i can say is, i'm quite surprised how good this game is. 

Now for the not so good news. When on foot & trying to get somewhere quick, i found that sometimes your character stops for no reason, or sometimes would enter into a building. Early access, so its bound to happen.
Though i will expect this to be addressed in the final version. 

Conclusion, for those who like a challenge, this is a great game for a challenge. 
This is kind of like Sims-like micromanagement with the energy bar & Hunger bar etc, but with business Tycoon spin. Can't wait until the final version comes out.",1689015030,1689015030,True,1,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,True

For those who post complaining about not liking it due to the need to restock constantly i fully recommend playing the story to get through the tutorial and learn about warehouse management. Getting a headquarters and warehouse set up can save a lot of time and tedious trips, Also I may not be far enough into the story mode to know but from looking through the menus going to the right car dealership can get you a cheap cargo van (around 6,000) which can transport 20 boxes at once compared to the 8 from the starter vehicle.",1688599478,1688599478,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The best way I can describe this game in a few short sentences, is kind of like a top-down SIMS game with direct control over your character, with the useless waffle cut out.

Something I personally appreciate, is that the game doesn't instantly overwhelm you with all of it's features, unlike a lot of other management style games do. It eases you in, and you've time to learn one mechanic before having another dropped in your lap. 

In short, It's fun, and I'm looking forward to putting more time into the game whenever I'm free.

Big Ambitions is so addictive. In early access, it's already smooth as butter, has tons of content, and very in depth game mechanics. Countless store types, products to sell, furniture and equipment choices, vehicle selection, etc.

After reading the dev/update logs, it's clear that they are passionate and committed to delivering a polished and refined product in roughly ~1 years time.

I am thrilled to join for the ride and see what Big Ambitions turns out to be down the line. As of right now, I'm very happy with my purchase. 

If you like management/sims, you will thoroughly enjoy this game. It reminds of The Sims, but better (in my opinion)

I am impressed. Hats off to Hovgaard Games.

I've played the game for 24 minutes and ran into two game-breaking bugs right off the bat: 
[list]
    [*]The first time the game froze the map while trying to tell me to get a loan. Escape menu didn't do anything so I had to shut it down manually. 
    [*]Secondly, I was soft-locked right after that when you start your own business. The game tells you to rent a retail spot, but seemingly wants you to rent a specific one without telling you, because when I did rent it out (as per instructions made, I didn't rent some huge building) nothing happened - I opened up my business but the game didn't progress and still wanted me to pick a building where I'm going to start a shop.

Wait for a shop to open? I'll just wait in my car. - minus 25% happiness for the day

Hire new staff? You have to pay the employment agency to find you someone, then regardless of the quality of the staff, whether or not they want to work full/part time (you can't choose lol). Don't like the person they found? Well you still have to pay them $500. Awesome. Oh, and new hires set their own salaries apparently.

Day two, regardless of job performance staff start texting you with demands. How about no, just do your damn job.

Your character is manic depressive and unless you have them watch TV, play computer games and go for walks in the park daily they start sulking to the point it affects the work performance of your staff city wide.

Driving is a nightmare. AI traffic constantly smashes into you, and there's no game mechanic for swapping insurance details and having them pay for the damage so you just have to pay for the damage.

Deliveries are bizarre. You have to place a weekly order for stock, but that isn't fixed. Sales are variable, and I don't have infinite stock space. So...I have to manually check the shelves in all my shops periodically to make sure the deliveries are right? Why can't I just order up to a limit?

I watched closely for a release window and jamp at the chance to buy during EA.1.0.

Beginning with the positives; this game has a LOT of potential and I am excited to see where the Road Maps leads them into 2024. I like the whole aspect, the management system, some graphics and music are very good, some not so much! It's a very ""lite"" game, maybe 30 hours of fun and then the boredom kicks in and the cracks start to show. 

As of writing a new hot-fix came out yesterday and effectively did nothing. I was being forced into unrealistic employee demands as early as 50% skill acquired. I was told it should be closer to 100%. I was 40 days in and I realised... listening to the tutorial is NOT recommended. I didn't realise it at first but I was spending all day just running back n forth mopping, it makes little sense as a business owner. Then I restarted and changed prices. I panicked when 1 out of 3 customers declined and restarted again. This time I bought cleaners, full-time, and watched 500 wages deduct every day for virtually no reason - the floors still filthy so - I persevered. I had no idea I was up against an aggressive AI buying everything from under me. Bidding low and selling high. That's supposed to have changed as well. The final nail on the coffin following this tutorial was the delivery fees. £1000 a week just to bring over a few cheap gift cups. I was bankrupt and had to restart again. Well, I didn't... I uninstalled. It needs more time in the oven I think. I hope they fix and add and stick to their road-map. I will be back to change my review when it happens. 

Pro tip:- just ignore the tutorial and read some guides free on Steam before you begin your ""Big Ambition"" journey. And Dev's... if you are reading this, please for the love of god, fix the cleaner system! There's so much wasted potential there. Many others have flooded the forums with suggestions please listen to them!

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Big Ambitions is a game developed and published by Hovgaard Games

The game has some really beautiful environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out. The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all

Big Ambitions overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good open-world simulation game to play!

However a few problem points.

Not all business are equal (much like in real life) but in the game the gap can be quite jarring. Clothes shops seem at the moment quite overpowered in that they dont cost particularly much to staff and maintain, the supply is relatively cheap and the rewards are enormous (disproportionate to other businesses)

Second point would be a criticism over how you staff your businesses. You have little control on negotiating salaries, who the employment agency shortlists for you (typically part time or full time)  And employees seem to be able to max their stats too easily. Maybe if you could implement a way to interview the candidates that would be great. 

Third point is more a personal comment on the direction the game has gone down. I would like to see more depth in the businesses. An example would be a restaurant (not the fast food one in the game which is horrifically basic). 
Creating a restaurant requires lots of in depth actions. 
You need a manager, waiters, cooks and cleaners (not just the cleaners and customer service in the fast food). 
You need to have a place to store ingredients (not just a storage room, but industrial fridges and freezers)  
You could even use one of the food or fruit and vegetable shops to supply your own restaurant. Business Partnerships. 
You would need various different types of food, drinks, alcohol... Like have categories : cheap meat, expensive meat, cheap bottle of wine, high end bottle of wine. 
Have Customers complain if you run out of a certain food type or drink type. Not just complain about the colors of the walls and floor. 
Same for the other businesses. 
What i am asking for, if it is possible is even more depth to make the game a bit less repetitive.

The game sort of has something, but i can't imagine playing it as intended. I play it in the custom mode and I've been noticing that some businesses legitimately don't work or function as they are supposed to. One of the first shops i opened was a coffee shop because i would love to actually own one irl, nut strangely enough i have put everything into the coffee shop and it still doesn't turn a profit above essentially pocket change. It legitimately does not work. i also have a very flushed out fast food shop with maxed employees and it still gives me the least money of my businesses. I also have a clothing store, which, when stocked, is bringing in nearly 30k and supporting all the other businesses, even though i intended to have the clothing store be one of my less popular or lucrative stores. this is highly irritating for me because it just seems i can't play the game as i would want to.  The fact that i can have a fully stocked coffee shop with multiple spending points such as donuts, croissants, coffee of course, gifts, sodas, salads, and flowers that has maxed employees and employee satisfaction (i also have an HR department, but we'll get to that later) along with having a marketing campaign and the coffee shop still turn next to no actual profit tells me that it seems like all of that is down the drain. I am running the business perfectly, and i would argue i'm running it too efficiently, but because of how the values in the game are worked i am making next to no money. It's irritating that my hunger bar shoots down completely while at work to, as if i don't have a break or don't occasionally snack on my own product in general. Everything in my shop i paid for, so i'm entitled to my croissants. I am selling so many products i may as well be a 7/11 with higher standards. And somehow i'm going negative. My homes aren't expensive either, and definitely not enough to justify being put under by an obviously flourishing business. And as much as i love driving around in the game, not being able to turn the camera or even zoom in enough to get an idea of what's coming is a huge nuissance, even when i'm driving like a normal citizen. IT has been this way since release and It isn't really justified when you look at the map and realize you aren't going too far either. Also, i know i'm technically still early into the game but the fact that certain  residences aren't available because they are ""occupied"" is pretty annoying, especially when you're stuck in a progression loop and can't unlock more options yet. Because i did notice that more options slowly became more available, but when i first started i wanted a place by the park so bad. There is one available to me now but it's facing a plaza that seems ripped right out of 28 days later. I'm not trying to look out my window only to remember why i wouldn't want to rejoin society. I want to see the sprawling park. My next issue is that the WASD function only work for the vehicle, but completely cease all functionality the second you leave the car. Why would i want to play the spam left click game or click the scroll wheel and get annoyed when i start bumping into or circling around things until i get my character to stop when i can very precisely control the movements with keys. Oh yes, how could i forget, the customization. There are like 3 customization options in the character creation screen for every section. 3 hair styles, 3 skin colors, two face, etc. Then when you get later into the game and start to design uniforms for employees the options are incredibly limited and not all that enticing. The one thing that had the MOST customization in the whole game seems to be the logo for your company, and even then a majority of the options are just pooled business representations and slightly abstract designs. I also went out and to celebrate my business i bought some clothes, only to get home and realize i have no idea how to use a bag of clothes. I've gotten a pretty good grip on how to move everything and how to properly interact with items and yet there is now a useless bag of clothes sitting next to my couch that i SPENT MONEY ON, mind you. this has not been changed or updated despite numerous updates to other features and countless references available for choice. Speaking of my house, why am i even buying furniture if i can't use it? Can't cook on the stove, can't prepare food at a table, can't sit on my sofa, can't even sit at my dining room table or chairs at all for that matter. The only option i can do is use a computer or watch tv, and all that does is skip time and boost happiness. Also please for the love of god, listening to the same 5 song EVERYWHERE i go starts to become worse than clipping parts of my ears off with toenail clippers after a certain amount of time. Just add some royalty free music or something. At least some piano. Listening to pop rap or whatever the hell that middle school kid-with-speaker-in-backpack shit is the most excruciating part of walking into my business or just taking a joyride. Give me some dahm bach or mozart or royalty free synth wave or something. I'm not spending over 20 hours listening to the dog shit audio tracks that play everywhere except the streets my helpless little human runs down out of sheer terror of having to hear the song i skip every single time. As i said before, when i play this game all i see is room for improvement. I don't hate this game. And i would really look to playing it as much as i can in the future, but if these things aren't improved on or just get ignored then i don't see a point. I love EVERY single other aspect of the game, but i feel the need to highlight the blaringly obvious things that could see this game tumble and fall flat.",1679923918,1685849803,False,2,2,0.454953491687774658,0,True,False,True

I really hope the dev introduces an annual mandatory wage increase or even a perk system for your employees. Perhaps employee variety could be a better justification for wages, other than training level. Morale is tied to wages and leaders in real life, why not in the game? Employees can be head hunted in real life, people leave, ect. The point is to maintain the investment that has been made into all personnel. Perks and traits may allow the player to have an emotional attachment to the simulated person. This is much closer to how life is. Traits could be simple like 5% increase to foot traffic, 1 more item sold to each customer, ect.

Then you can train your employees. Thats it. Thats pretty much all you can adjust to make the business sucessful. When the business makes enough money, you are able to open another store and do the same thing, adjust the same 2 screws and you are set. All that is left are chores, you will drive 100s of time with your car to buy your products. Yes, you dont have to do that anymore once you become wealthy, but there is literally nothing else to do.
Thats the gameplay.

Here are more shops and the available products:

Florist: cheap flower
expensive flower

Gift Shop: Cheap Gifts
Expensive Gifts

Liquor Store: Bottle of Wine
Cigar

Even worse are Web Development Agency and Law firm.
You literally cant do anything. How can you double the income of a law firm? Yes, Just double the amount of the employees. You are unable to change the product at all. You are paid for every hour an lawyer sits at his table. Place workstations, hire lawyers. Done.


Big ambitions calls itself a ""role-playing business simulation"". The whole part of the simulated business of a lawfirm is sitting the god damn lawyer at this table. No negotiations, no contracts, no patents, no laws...no nothing. LET YOUR LAWYER SIT AT HIS TABLE and the business simulation of your law firm is complete. That´s ridiculous.

You start off with a sexy $15,000 loan from your uncle Fred, the dude in the Blue suit red tie. ""He's one of the good guys."" Then you buy your store set up merchandise then hire someone to run the cash reg or run one yourself. You get tired and need food, so you gotta get food from the stores all around the world.

Bigger moves are made, more people depend on you. Ohh, Hi boss how are you today Errrr. ""Stop KISSING MY ASS NO RAISE FOR YOU!!!!"" =(

The lowdown when you get to mid game....

You train employees, set up commerce routes to stores from warehouses. You order from Big Shipping companies in bulk to your warehouses. You have logistics to deal with so you have an HR office which you hire people to constantly order same products. You have drivers that you can train and drive your wares around to sustain that paper, Boo.

Upgrade your apartment with all sorts of furniture items.  Upgrade your car too, or just take the taxi around. 

The developer of the game is really active in the forums. Your voice does matter. That's some solid loyalty and they have my respect. I've submitted many bugs. They do get addressed. And they update this game regularly.

Very basic and linear gameplay. Dumbest game in this type. Has no in-depth mechanic. I'm gonna count the mechanics:
-Rent a store
-Rent a warehouse
-Find a chasier
-Find suplier and someone to deal with them
-Find driver for distrubing the goods.

pros
- a fresh look at the RTS genre 
- fun to learn and master
- easy learning curve

cons
- this is a game of numbers, figure out the best math, and things get extremely monotonous
- the world is dead....the NPCs are not even data points, they are window dressing at best
- hopefully, furniture, appliances, decorations, etc...will all increase in selection in future builds, not enough right now.

neutral
- balancing issues will be worked out in time
- too easy to get loans, real estate is not a good investment, neither are stocks....
- buying/using boats/yachts is underwhelming

If this game had a better developed world (think any big open world game like RDRII or Cyberpunk 2077), this game would be incredible.  Unfortunately, the dead NPCs & vehicle traffic let down the rest of the experience....and I don't see anything on the roadmap which will fix this in the future :-(

The game is great, but really needs to focus on adding more things to improve the actual game play, UI and management for later in the game. Also, my save file was wiped in the update- so I'd hold back until things are less chaotic to invest time.

pretty sure this game will end up like Coca-Cola and in 10 years we'll all find out there's cocaine in it.

absolutely ruthless addictive experience from sleeping on park benches to gambling away millions in company assets just to feel.

I could play just ONE shop with the amount of logistical detail involved and be happy, but expanding it to a city where every building is an opportunity (or six) is unreal. One of the best tycoon/sim/business management/strategy games I have played in a very, very long time.

But only after 3 days, it is super easy to get a loan and start a very profitable business from just that, without any skills, without any story, without significant difficulty. It looks like it is automatic, it looks like this option is here for everyone. So the realistic low money start is gone. With this the sense of achievement for the first successful business is gone. Too easy start is bad BOTH for the RPG side, and the business sim side. 

Mixing RPG elements and Tycoon elements in the same game, same campaign is possible, with many different kinds of gameplay. But right now the problem is with the [i]campaign[/i], having the option to start a successful business (without any consideration) from loan after very short time spent working is bad story wise. Starting a side hustle from your hobby (drawing, etc) at recommendations from a friend, would be good, and could realistically lead to creating enough merchandise for your own gift shop. It would be easy to add more challenge, and more story.

But lets speak about the gift shop... If I would visit a gift shop in a foreign city, I would expect to be able to buy T Shirts as gifts, but I wouldn't need a changing room for that. In addition to ""walk in business"" we would often see ""mail order"" or ""online"" business, maybe cooperation with celebrities, intellectual property (maybe for our own designs or designs of others), etc.In the game we have only cheap gifts, expensive gifts, and we can't even sell T Shirts without a changing room. We don't have to think about which gift will be popular, we don't see how different retail businesses can be very different.

In our fast food chain there are no option to create a value menu, and our option to sell cheap toys (gifts) like McDonalds did with Happy Meal (huge success) has no effect on our profitability. Selling some items to differentiate, to draw in more customers (and sell other items to them), upselling, etc. are all ignored in this game. In our burger shops we can't even have a 2nd kind of burger. 

We can't have a normal brand (like Toyota) and a premium brand (Lexus) as we don't see market segmentation. 

We have a game mechanic that checks how much time we have spent in a park, which shouldn't be that relevant to the game, and not all business owners would like this (so a game mechanic that reduces player agency) but the developer avoids providing many meaningful business decisions, and we can't enjoy the good decisions, and the good reviews, feedbacks from customers, etc...

Unlike the others, Dimmy's Nut Max of Mid Town, is a spacious and inviting space that boasts everything you could want. From doughnuts to fresh-foods – clothes, coffee, or a quick gift for the misses, you can find it at Dimmy's.*

Vord Pony had engine issues, delayed start/stop. Sold it and gambled with the money.
Would love a house on the map with a garage, even if it's 'spensive as hell.
Maybe a system for chains - where I can link my Dimmy's Doughnuts? (not sure how) 
- or a ""swap"" system for when I move a business to a larger location - same district.
The Furniture shop 8x pallet cart can't go in the trunk and it makes me sad.
I know it' not gta, but I'd love to get into a chase here or there and buy myself out of it.

I love the game so far although I expect it to develop far more and the developers will for sure have to add far more decorative items, textures and so on. But the basic idea of the game is great and now comes what I love definitely most:

It has been just 2 days ago that I was posting about some major bug I have with a game called ""Stranded: Alien Dawn"". I did spend around 30 Euros for that game and can't play it, because it crashes on my Linux thanks to my graphics card Radeon VII ( it a very expensive seldom used card the developers might have just not tested for their game). However I tryed to talk to the developers 3 times with 3 different posts there.
Each time with no answer at all as long as I was still super nice and begging for help. Only thing they told me was to send a report with files from my computer. I did. Now the last time I was complaining a bit more aggressively and said that I felt pretty ignored after waiting 3 month for any help. They asked me then for my computer specs and I know that means on steam forums trouble for the Linux users, because we get always treated like idiots, as if the mistake would be always on our side, if anything doesn't work (praise windows that spys everyone out and will soon charge you for every little programm extra). Of course the people there started to call me a troll, because the developers also treated me like that.
Yes yes I am already coming to the point! *grin
You like reading stories, don't you? Otherwise you wouldn't read anymore ;)
However those developers here are the absolute contrary from what I usually experience. At the forum of ""Stranded:Alien Dawn"" the answer of the developer was: Oh I was trying to help you, but now that you say you are playing on Linux ...blabla Mr Freemen ..just get lost customer, we are not responsible that steam posted that this game runs on steam deck and who cares that steam deck uses Linux!

The developers here were just super kind they reacted very polite and nice to the problem of crashes on Linux. Did send me a link to a post some other players that use Linux already did and said ""We are investigating to fix it"".
I mean that is unusual and even if you are a windows user that reads this now, just imagine you would have to use a different system on your computer and get for that reason constantly treated like a troll.
This is like being different in any way in society, you just loose either all attention and help or you get treated like an alien or idiot. That kind of intolerance and narrow-mindedness seems to be very common nowadays.

I love those developers just for this, but also for some other reactions. They put their heart into this game, you can easily see that and they care a lot that the players are happy! They read reviews and posts in the forum and pick up ideas. This is awesome and so rare nowaday!

It's super addictive, extremely well paced and gives just the right amount of guidance to get you started. Obviously a few things missing here and there in early access but there is always something you can be doing to continue expanding your business. You can be as hands on as you like or you can leave everything to your capable staff whilst you go out looking for the next venture. 

The missing: character customisation is severely lacking. I personally would like more ""life sim"" features. Hang out spots, interactions with customers or staff or even the people you walk past on the street. Even just a basic one line greeting would make a huge difference with wandering NPCs on the streets and maybe a ""well done"" for your employees. I think having contract negotiations with your staff would add to the immersion too. 

This has become rambly which is why I don't write reviews generally but overall I recommend this game. Everything in the game so far is great and even in early access, it is already worth the money. I'm really excited to see what will be added in the future!

Not any chance I would need a refund for this game!  Nor much of a chance I want to spend a lot of time writing a review when I could be playing it instead!  So here it is, short and sweet.

This is a business/management simulation.  Because it's in EA many features might change, but the roadmap is listed here: https://www.bigambitionsgame.com/roadmap

You might notice there is no technology tree - that's the only feature I wonder that might be something I miss.  But there is a school and you can't do certain things like hiring people until you've completed certain classes.

Otherwise, unlike other business sims, this one requires running around on foot or driving in a car to get around town to manage time and bring all the pieces together that make up your business(es).

I love this idea!!  I'm a horrible driver too.  It adds just that extra bit of humor when you're trying to race to buy some furniture before a store closes.  People honk their horns when you cut in front of them too.  Hahaha!

The forums have a HUGE list of ideas people keep submitting as feature requests.  So I think the sky  is the limit for what this game could eventually offer.

Do I recommend it?  If you like business simulations absolutely, but you have to understand that it's in EA and some edges are still a bit rough.  I have noticed some bugs where I have to Alt-F4 to quit the game and reopen it to continue, but I imagine that will be addressed eventually since this is still EA.  Full price for the vast range of different businesses available is reasonable I think.

This reminds me a little of Capitalism, but this is a very different game which (at least currently) doesn't have any supply chains for manufacturing, but it does have imported goods.  It would not take a large effort to implement supply chains though... but for now the emphasis is very clearly on retail.  This game has another obvious emphasis on ""painting"".  Just spend leisurely time decorating your business in the way you want it and can be proud of - this can be extremely casual and relaxing.

It costs money whether or not the player hires the candidate or not. I can choose what AGE I want the candidate to be, but not whether or not they are full or part time. That makes no sense and it is left completely up to RNG as to which one you get. I ended up having to spend a ton of scarce early game money going though tons of people just to get two suitable employees. Also, you pay the same price regardless of how qualified they are...I got so tired of the RNG I hired a horrible customer service employee for almost $50 an hour to run my cash register!

This is an incredible business simulation game that’s still in Early Access. 

Whether you just want to manage a small Mom 'n' Pop's coffee shop, or have bigger dreams, this game has you covered. Turn that coffee shop into a successful franchise, or take over and run the next big clothing retail chain, or maybe spread that market risk and manage a mega-sized business conglomerate. Work at your own store, and/or hire staff as your empire expands.

And if your business isn’t successful enough and demand is too low, just buy out your competitors and shut them all down and reassign the staff to some other business, or fire them with zero consequences. Create your own monopoly on goods or services and jack up the prices to help pay for your expensive boats and cars.  

Unfortunately, there are no meaningful social elements in the game. You can’t, for instance, get married or anything like that. 

The game is also very management heavy, sometimes to a fault. For example, if you run multiple businesses and want to hire cleaning staff for them, you have to buy cleaning supplies from a store, put them in your vehicle (which can only hold so many packages), drive to each location, put the supplies in the building, then call and hire a cleaner through the recruitment agency. 

It takes a long time to set up stores and offices, but it does pay off as you’re kind of forced to decorate them by hand. And while it’s possible to just buy an already established business and improve upon it instead of starting your own from scratch, these unfortunately do not come with cleaning supplies. So, towards the late game it does become a bit silly – surely you should be paying people to figure some of this stuff out for you while you go chill on your yacht or something? 

All in all, the game is fun in its current state, and has a lot of potential. 
It’ll be fun to follow the development of this.",1682852237,1682852237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I started my new business McBearPig's, a fast food chain with a difference. My signature burger, the 'Half Bear-Half Pig Tower' was the speciality and I was hoping it was going to attract customers in their thousands.

There were initial complaints about the high prices and drab interior, but I ignore complaints. The customer is an idiot. You gotta remember that. 
Soon enough, there were concerns about the cleanliness of the floors. I was prepared for this though and responded, telling people that we cook our food on the grills, not on the floor, so it wasn't an issue.

Over the following weeks McBearPigs ran at a loss. I even became a full time driver for the company. My days were spent picking up and delivering burgers, and my nights were spent drinking wine and wallowing in self hate.

I even tried getting a job at the local store for some extra cash to support the business, but that only led to a small gambling problem. I was a fiend for that casino boat. Every friday I would take a big wad of cash in and leave with nothing, each time believing 'tonight was the night'.

I had to close McBearPigs. I was in the hole, it was in the hole, and to be totally honest, the burgers were abysmal.

The worst thing about all of this. Uncle Fred was disappointed in me.",1682840140,1682840140,True,7,23,0.622252762317657471,0,True,False,True

Honestly, it's just not that fun of a game. After a few hours, you're really just going around doing the same tasks over and over again. It could be a great game if the developers:

1) Fixed the driving experience. It's just plain not fun. 
2) Give the players the ability to hire an office manager. The office manager would purchase things like desks, chairs, computers, shelves for stocking, cleaning stations, etc. and have them delivered to the new location. All you'd do is decide how it would be set up. Truly, going to the wholesale stores time and time again made starting up a new business repetitive and feeling like a chore. 
3) Completely rework the stores that the player buys items from. I really tried to like this game, but this was the nail in the coffin for me. There two different wholesale stores. They sell almost the same stuff, but not quite. So if you start a new business you have to drive to both of them. Or, you could drive around the IKEA-esque store, which is logistically a disaster. Really poor job here.  
4) The happiness system needs some work. Realizing that I actually have to go walk in a park every day or two or else my employees will quit was just plain absurd. Not sure what you guys were thinking here.

Then the Tutorial , or ""Mainquest"" seem to suddenly make a super time jump, where the mission basically is ""Ok play now for xx more hours until you have an insane amount of money"" where it feels like they just ran out of ideas how to guide you on and introduce more mechanics to you.

The game is quite fun and have high replayability value. Performance is decent, although it can be sluggish in certain area like the park. Most of my complaint already listed on their roadmap, so I don't think it worth mentioning the drawback (since it's an EA anyway).

I do wish some QoL improvement that's not mentioned in the roadmap to be added:
- speedometer.
- toggle to hide occupied workspace and assigned employee (not just cleaner) in biz scheduler. Since it's currently a nightmare to manage business with more than a dozen employee due to excessive scrolling and inconsistent color coding.
- Piggybacking the above; option to adjust/ set default shift length in business settings.
- Color-coded map based on lot layout, so you can easily spot desirable lot with proper size and layout rather than hovering on each one.

First thing is the click to move functionality; It feels bad, like really bad. It feels like running anywhere for anything is sluggish and annoying. The auto pathing is also really just...not great. 
The driving feels confined and like a chore, which you have to do almost constantly, especially early game. 

The core mechanics and functionality are pretty good, I can see where tons of depth could come from the game. The main critique is you can kind of short cut a lot of progress by simply taking out 5-10k loans as you need them to start turning a profit pretty much off the rip.

The cleaning/business maintenance is honestly awful and completely not enjoyable.

GOOD
- Lots of variety to get at least 25hrs out of the game in its current state, I still havent finished the ""story"" but i feel i am in the gameloop now 
- Systems are good, really deep
- Graphics and perspective is great, it takes some getting used to the camera quirks
- Plenty of replayability, seems like cities load randomly and companies come and go in neighbourhoods
- If you like management games you will like this

NOGOOD/LOVETOHAVE
- The UI needs some customisation options or at least a revamp with tile windows that are tied to things in the world, e.g each time i come out of a property i have to manouver the camera to see the pallet and do that 5x to put away everything
- would love a bigger map to play within and a little more variety of layouts of properties
- the progression ramps up quick and then slows once you are released into the ""wild"", would love to see some random events or deeper systems to play with e.g dealing with complaints or refunds and that affects satisfaction depending how you deal with the issue with the customer, something for when you get too big you can hire someone to do CS for you (but they sometimes make mistakes, depending on skill)
- would love to see a property manager role for purchasing properties
- more cities to start in or expand your empire into with new competitors

Basically, you make one of TWO main choices at the beginning...  follow the guidance of Uncle Fred, or go it alone.   For me, the guidance route was painful (despite it acting as a decent tutorial at first with 3 levels) but the requests seemed to arrive out of sequence and put the business in trouble when you try to comply, so the GO IT ALONE option on my later efforts showed that it allows you to play the game at your own pace, even when starting with ZERO capital to make it more difficult.

From there, you need to build a few businesses of your choice before making the move into a head office where lots of the work can be automated through teams of managers and warehouse delivery drivers.

Once you get some intermediate success, it becomes a bit tedious trying to replicate that a few dozen or more times in other businesses, sometimes with their own manager and warehouse for separate industries to give you more of a challenge.

I'm still hoping there is more to come from this fabulous game, but after 300 hours, I am finding it more challenging to find a challenge, having bought the biggest yacht and parked my Rolls Royce beside it before enjoying a night on the Casino boat.   

I am hopeful that other businesses like bars and nightclubs can be added, with agencies booking showbiz acts for their venues, and giving us somewhere to relax for a few hours after work.  We could also buy and operate those venues as part of our organisation, balancing drink sales and ticket prices with the costs of products, staff and entertainment acts in different sized venues with a stage, bar and possibly food sales in larger ones.   Sure there are many ideas being floated at the moment.

Great game though, and everyone will find their own threshold for how long they want to play it, but watch out for more developments on BIG AMBITIONS from the team at Hovgaard.  Brilliant start.",1682366186,1682366186,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The drip-feed incremental gameplay is barely rich enough to make me want to stay in the game, but just satisfying enough to keep me coming back.

It has a big focus on automation, vaguely like Factorio, but unlike Factorio there's nothing to do in between. I find myself sleeping away most days just to save up money, which feels wrong; the unique 3D-represented player character hurts the game more than it adds.

I have no desire to explore all the various business types because they are essentially just re-skins of the same thing, and I can't be arsed to furnish them again. I also have no desire to move out of the starting street (Garment District) because it has everything in close proximity, unlike other locations. The starting area should've been the furthest distance from all important busineses, so that there is a logistic reason to move to a more expensive area.

After 11 hours, I've done everything I wanted to do in Big Ambitions, and had quite a satisfying time doing so, but it's not enough time to justify the pricetag.

Competitive multiplayer could potentially make the game more worthwhile (and add some much needed difficulty), but sadly only cooperative multiplayer is found on the official roadmap.

Buy the same furniture to increase interior, make sure you've got enough equipment to serve as many customers as possible, etc.

You rent a building, fill it with the right amount of shelving/displays according to the size of the building. Building sizes create a hard cap of customers per hour, which isn't very realistic. You then tediously have to get that product to the building using a wholesaler, or setting up a warehouse with importing those goods using a purchaser at your headquarters that you also have to set up, and then hiring a delivery driver to get that product to your store. 

This is all well and good for the most part, but it doesn't really feel much like a ""game"". It is more about time management. It challenges you to see how fast can you become a millionaire. If you rent a place, buy shelving, stock it, and hire workers for around the clock shifts, you will make money. Do this again with a larger building. Rinse/repeat. Once you figure out the game loop, there isn't much reason to keep playing. You're setting up infrastructure so that you don't have to do the manual things yourself. 

Adding to the negatives of the gameplay, the controls and camera are frustrating. Why do I use WASD for a car but not for player movement? Why do I use a mouse for player movement, but I can't in the car? Also have fun mis-clicking your vehicle when you are trying to load/unload it and keep entering the vehicle instead.

You start a business and it seems automatically profitable, you start another automatically profitable business, wait until you have more money, start another business and so on. I only have 4 businesses right now (All in the small 75m buildings) so I'd say this probably still qualifies as the early game. Maybe this changes in the mid or end game, but the game as it is seems pretty easy, almost like you can't fail unless you specifically try to fail. 

I think it's fun, but I'm probably going to stop playing for a while so I don't burn out on it. I'll let some more updates come in and see if that makes it a little harder. (I have 8.6 hours as of the time I'm writing this, so now you know if I've played it more since writing my review!)

That being said a lot of the bugs i am encountering are directly related to a cheat engine i'm am using. Some may say this ruins the fun, I personally think it adds to the realism as in real business in America cheating is the prominent method of achieving success. I know this isn't the place for suggestions but hey the game is still in development so here's a few any away:

- Add an 18 wheeler semi truck with a huge storage capacity allowing user to grab everything needed on one swoop.
- Add ways to increase the traffic index of a location.
- Add some Corruption and subterfuge options.
- Add delivery's to offices i'm sick of getting my programmers coffee 3 at a time in the Porsche and im not cutting about in  a van in front of the staff its de-motivational.
- Speaking of motivational, allow the hiring of motivational speakers for productivity bonuses
- Truck decals with advertising so i can self promote, and advertiser people dressed as hot dogs handing out flyers would 
   be nice to, whats that Andy don't wana clean fine get in the hot dog outfit.
- Employee conflicts and squabbles.
- Business Liability, suing and what have you.
- A truck with a forklift attachment or additional hand truck options.
- Wall placement and editing
- Outdoor seating areas for cafes
- Night clubs and bars (no DLC) Main game it.
- Drug Dealing, i mean whose doing all this business without a wee tute or two of the white magic.
- More in depth pricing and strategy options.
- Car accident claims lol we will all be broke real quick.
- Could probably fit a Mafia in for some stolen goods movement.
- IRS and police armed raids, police on the beat.
- More Clothing, (Include degradation of clothing over time, poor and rich styles)
- Status buys, Expensive watches, shoes, i mean i'm on a yacht without the Pepsi how am i supposed to tell time at sea?
- Networking events with unique bonuses, office parties for motivational bonuses (or de motivational if the boss cheaps 
   out
- They are probably already working on this but, competitive multiplayer, rust style, if you log out, your vulnerable, imagine coming back to a devastated business suing another player in multiplayer lol this game has a great future if the devs don't take them selves to seriously.

This is something like between sims and a tycoon game and I am a real fan of that. Furnishing your own shops is super fun. Profits in this game are really easy, maybe too easy though after you know how the menus work. This has a lot of potential be a really great game, but it is still early access and I would love to have many features in the future updates. Many features that are lacking are frustrating. 

I WOULD LOVE THESE THINGS TO BE ADDED: 
-Visit your own shops as a customer: 
The most frustrating thing to me is that you cannot really visit your own shops as a customer, there is not really incentive to own the whole city by yourself. It would be really cool to visit your own coffee shop or supermarket because you have to visit them anyway to buy food.
- Better looking shops owned by NPC:
The competitors shop look really bare and unrealistic and are all the copies of each other, so there is no incentive to buy them and furnish them at this point after you have done it once. It is far better to make your own shop from the scratch. They are also ridicilously pricy and there is not really point, because competition is not that hard. 
- Blueprint mode:
I would like to share and download other designs from other players so I would not have to individually design each shop myself and tediously drive multiple trips downtown for days to furnish them. 
- Custom led signs:
I see competitors having great signs but you cannot design them yourself.
- Filters in various lists:
When you own 40 businesses like I do, it is really time consuming to find a specific business menu, I would love to filter the menu. Same goes for workers, when you have hundreds of them. 
- More business types of course
- More fun offices:
More office furniture, like separators to each desks and beauty score that would affect the revenue of office and the happiness of the workers. It is not fun to furnish them, especially when you have to drag each chair, computer and desk separately. 
- Bigger deliveries:
It takes days to furnish a big department store, when you can only order 18 things at a time, twice a day. Even that is limited to 1 delivery / store so you cannot order multiple deliveries from the same store. 
- More gameplay when you own multiple businesses:
After you have set up your stores and headquarters, there is nothing to do, the whole thing runs automatically without any problems ever.
- Color picker:
I would love to have pipette tool for picking the colors from environment when customizing the color of the furniture. 
-Color option when buying furniture, not having the only option to recolor them for a price afterwards, although it is really cool you can do that
-Carts inside the offices too, it is really slow to use your hands only to move the furniture there one by one
-Working yachts so they would actually sail somewhere",1681569517,1681569517,True,20,0,0.728253602981567383,0,True,False,True

Pros
-Good Tycoon elements (such as short term, long term elements)
-Driving has good control despite not realistic traffic/traffic laws (a lot of players should be in jail, just saying xD)
-Running business is good for early access. (would like a lil more accurate details on how many days i run out of product)
-Good design options would like to see a lil more
Cons
-Needs more furniture options
-Needs more business dynamics (theft)
-Would like to see multi placement instead of single placement
-More happiness options (consume luxury goods, taking shower, attending classes (self defense, yoga?) Vacations?
-More business types to run
-Business balancing, clothing shops make an insane amount of profit while other shops like donuts shops and cigar shops make sad amounts. (my 24 hr clothing store makes me 400k a day vs other shops making around 1k-9k a day. If i were to make the small shops 24 hrs it'd be around 4k-27k a day)

Numerous times playing Big Ambitions, I joyfully exclaimed ""I'm Donald Trump, B****ES!"" A game where you can establish a business empire across four neighbourhoods in New York while other drivers constantly honk their horns at you for your poor driving skills and propensity to wander out in to the middle of 5th Avenue is naturally going to give you a bit of a power fantasy.

In a third-person RPG setuo, you'll start off as an 18 year old with a generous gift from your uncle. You'll then need to rent out a tiny apartment and get a simple retail job until you've saved up enough money/credit for a loan to start your own retail business. As your uncle, who is fully voiced and characterized, guides you through the basic operation of your store, you'll soon find yourself locked into the core gameplay loop. Trying to scale your businesses up requires learning and utilizing additional mechanics including importing goods, training and managing employees, renovating and designing your spaces, and coordinating operations with a headquarters. Repeat until you suddenly find yourself running all over town checking in on your dozens of businesses, or spend the day at home playing games and watching TV once you got things running like a well-oiled machine.

The game is, at heart, a time management game. You only get so many hours in the day, support businesses like ad agencies and supply stores have their own opening hours, and certain things need to be completed by a certain time or on a certain day. Although most may assume the game revolves around spending your money wisely, I've found the money side of things to be relatively easy and simple. Most of the time, your businesses are going to succeed as long as you are paying attention to the requirements and needs of the business.

Big Ambitions's greatest strength, coincidentally, lies in its potential. The game's systems are very modular, meaning it should be easy to add additional business types, furniture, mechanics or specialized support businesses down the line. Adding in official mod support is hopefully a major consideration for the studio as it could offload a lot of the work in that area.

This is where things get tricky, however. Outside of the core gameplay loop, the game is a little bare-bones which is completely understandable for an Early Access title. By no means is the game unplayable or missing core features, but after I finished my main headquarters and set up my logistics, there was little left to do other than open a duplicate business, buy a building that wasn't for sale, or play video games for hours, which made me realize I could play a different game at that point. While I have no concern that additional things will be added, I do worry that the studio might start suffering from ""Kickstarter Bloat"". They have previously stated this is definitely their passion project and, after receiving overwhelmingly positive support on their initial Steam release, they have stated that, essentially, their plans and goals have expanded. It will be interesting to see how well they manage their own expectations as well as find a balance from the demands of an ever-increasing audience.

Overall, Big Ambitions has an incredibly addictive core gameplay loop, similar to the studio's previous entry, and shows a lot of thoughtful design decisions to help aid further development. Everything implemented works well and the game looks and sounds great as well. All in all, the game has an incredibly strong foundation and it will definitely be worth keeping an eye as it develops if you're not already interested.",1681508513,1681508513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I had fun early on, when I didn't really know what I was doing. running around to keep stores running, getting sent to the hospital a couple times. Setting up a Jewerly store before I was ready for it, and watching my modest daily income suddenly turn into a red death spiral. XD

Even in this unfinished state, there's so many well thought out little details, and features you wouldn't expect so early on. Like being able to setup deliveries and campaigns over the phone, after you've been to a business. Being able to pay for inventory directly from your vehicle inside the big wholesale place, change the colors of most items, and edit the register line for the customers.

There's still a long way to go, but the foundations are mostly here. The gameplay loop of setting up stores, supplying them with stock at first, and later setting up warehouses and HQ's to help automate them, while trying to look after your own character, is fun. It mostly just needs more content.

You start from nothing, just like I did when I started my business empire. But as you progress through the game, you'll build your way up, reaching for the stars and achieving financial greatness. It's a journey that will test your skills and determination, but believe me, the rewards are huge.

And the addiction factor, folks? It's off the charts. Once you start playing, you won't be able to stop. It's a rush of adrenaline that will keep you coming back for more, day after day. You'll be so hooked on Big Ambitions, you'll forget about everything else in your life.

So if you're ready to experience the ultimate in ambition and success, then you need to play Big Ambitions. It's the game of champions, the game of winners, the game of people who know how to achieve greatness. Trust me, folks, you won't regret it.

I saw a buddy playing this and immediately started thinking of the Sims.  Little did I know, this is quite a bit better.  Instead of just being told ""You went to work"" or ""You got a promotion"", you get to see it all happen first hand.  You get to pick your business.  You get to pick your locations.  Almost everything is opened to you.  You don't really have limits on what you can accomplish, and that is great for these types of games.

If you love Sims, Cities Skylines, Sim City, or other life simulation games, but need a little something extra to it, this is the game.  I would have loved for the price to be a little lower, but whatever.  Is what it is.  I haven't felt this sucked into a game since Drug Dealer Simulator, and this has way more opportunity and options.

You're always learning new tricks so far, how to best manage your business, how to maximize profit, and it's just incredibly fun if you're into games like this. Yes, not everything is perfect, it still needs some small but important features like proper staff needs, more simulation of the competition etc. but there I see a lot of potential, which the developers surely know on. 

I have read a lot that later quickly runs out of content, so from 40-60 game hours. But when I see the roadmap from the developer, I have high hopes that this is still a real Gem. In any case, absolute buy recommendation. Let's see when the game becomes repetitive, but for 20 € to have 40-60 hours of fun, worth it all.

tldr: idle-clicker game with very shallow economic simulation part, which in many areas needs to bring significantly more quality-of-life improvements in addition to more game depth. At the moment, the game is not recommended. 

tldr: idle clicker Spiel mit sehr seichtem WiSi-Anteil, welcher in vielen Bereichen deutlich mehr QoL-Verbesserungen und mehr Spielteife benötigt. Momentan empfehle ich das Spiel nicht.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This review will be adjusted should anything change in the game.

It's pointless to ponder why this game is so hyped. As we all know, there is no accounting for taste. However, to call the game an economic sim is quite cocky, and when I read reviews that say it's one of the best eco-sims of the last few years, it says more about the reviewer's gaming level than about the game and it really needs some counter statements. 

Big Ambitions falls far short of an economic simulation. As others have reported, it is basically an idle-clicker. For the first few hours, you're just running around trying to get your first automation (warehouse, buyers, logisticians, drivers) up and running. 70% walking or driving, 20% annoying and cumbersome store setup, 10% EconomySim. After that, almost everything can be organized out of HQ. Only new warehouses/shops have to be set up manually. From then on, you virtually only drive a cab to a) gamble in the casino (boring, since exploitable) and b) to the tax office to pay your taxes. The rest is done via the HQ. Market analyses are so shallow that the term economic simulation can only be understood as an ambition, which the game currently fails at.

Deliveries from external companies to the own companies have to be moved manually (not the import). If this does not happen, no new contractor delivery can take place (because the pallet is still there and only one may spawn. This is easy with 5 companies, but not with 20 or more. The ability to interact with objects such as delivery pallets is really poorly solved: 

If you open a large store and then first order some 100 items from Ikea, the office supplier or the store supplier by phone but a maximum of 18 items per order is possible, it gets annoying. Because of this bootleneck you need (ingame) days to setup big companiers. And as I said, if this one pallet is there, the other (scheduled) orders of the facility are simply canceled  (because the delivey slot is occupied). 
At the first big store there is still a certain hype and you just do it, but at the fourth or fifth it becomes dull, at the 10 store it is unbearable.  An open-plan office quickly has 50 employees, which means 50 tables, 50 chairs, 50 PCs, 50 speakers, couch, coffee machine, cabinets and all the little gimmick stuff like carpets, Flowers, Plants and so on... every single item you have to move and setup by hand. - Dont get me wrong, I really like grindy games, but there is a difference between grind and chore. Big Ambitions' lategame is sadly the latter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diese Rezension wird angepasst, sollte sich am Spiel etwas ändern.

Es ist müßig, darüber zu grübeln, warum dieses Spiel so gehypt wird. Über Geschmack lässt sich bekanntlich nicht streiten. Das Spiel jedoch als Wirtschaftssimulation zu bezeichnen, ist ziemlich dreist, und wenn ich Rezensionen lese, in denen es als eine der besten Wirtschafts-Simulationen der letzten Jahre bezeichnet wird, sagt das mehr über das Spielniveau des Rezensenten aus als über das Spiel, und es bedarf wirklich einiger Gegenstimmen. 

Big Ambitions ist weit davon entfernt, eine Wirtschaftssimulation zu sein. Wie bereits von anderen berichtet, handelt es sich im Grunde um einen idle-Klicker. In den ersten paar Stunden rennt man fast nur herum und versucht, seine erste Automatisierung (Lager, Einkäufer, Logistiker, Fahrer) zum Laufen zu bringen. 70% zu Fuß oder mit dem Auto, 20% lästige und umständliche Ladeneinrichtung, 10% EconomySim. Danach kann fast alles vom HQ aus organisiert werden. Nur neue Lager/Läden/Fahrzeuge müssen manuell eingerichtet werden. Von da an fährt man meist nur noch mit dem Taxi (schneller als das eigene Auto) zum Glücksspiel im Casino (langweilig, da ausbeutbar), zum Finanzamt, um seine Steuern zu bezahlen oder eben zum Einrichten der Shops . Der Rest wird über das HQ erledigt. Die Marktanalysen sind dabei jedoch so oberflächlich, dass der Begriff Wirtschaftssimulation nur als Anspruch verstanden werden kann, an dem das Spiel vorerst scheitert.

Lieferungen von Fremdfirmen an die eigenen Firmen müssen manuell verschoben werden (nicht der Import). Geschieht dies nicht, kann keine neue Fremdfirmenlieferung erfolgen (weil die Palette noch da ist und nur eine spawnen darf. Dies ist bei 5 Firmen einfach, aber nicht bei 20 oder mehr. Die Möglichkeit, mit Objekten wie Lieferpaletten zu interagieren, ist wirklich schlecht gelöst: 

Wenn man einen großen Laden eröffnet und dann erst mal 100 Artikel bei Ikea, dem Büroausstatter oder dem Ladenausstatter per Telefon bestellt, aber maximal 18 Artikel pro Bestellung möglich sind, wird es ärgerlich. Wegen dieses Engpasses braucht man (ingame) Tage, um große Geschäfte einzurichten. Und wie gesagt, wenn diese eine Palette noch nicht leer geräumt wurde, wenn die nächste Lieferung termniert ist, werden die anderen (geplanten) Bestellungen der Einrichtung einfach storniert, weil Lieferslot nicht verfügbar. 

Bei der ersten großen Filiale gibt es noch einen gewissen Hype und man macht es einfach, aber bei der vierten oder fünften wird es langweilig, bei der 10 Filiale ist es unerträglich.  Ein Großraumbüro hat schnell 50 Mitarbeiter, das bedeutet 50 Tische, 50 Stühle, 50 PCs, 50 Lautsprecher, Couch, Kaffeemaschine, Schränke und all die kleinen Gimmicks wie Teppiche, Blumen, Pflanzen und so weiter... alles muss man von Hand bewegen und aufbauen. - Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich mag grindige Spiele, aber es gibt einen Unterschied zwischen grindig und lästig.

- All contacts should be categorized & visible without the need to scroll (bank, import, furniture etc.). Messages from employees should not clutter the contact list.
- Make it possible to automatically invest a percentage of your income.
- Make it possible to walk with WASD keys (was counterintuitive to use my keyboard for driving & mouse for walking)
- Furniture should be delivered into the building so it's less tedious & players can immediately start placing objects (maybe solved with a designated delivery area inside bigger buildings like in real life)
- There should be a 'build mode' players can switch to inside buildings so they don't need to walk around when rearranging objects that are outside of their characters view.
- When coloring furniture it should highlight which part the player is coloring & there should be more pre-prepared color options to choose from.
- Players should get a warning if there are not enough shelves inside a store to handle the whole delivery from the warehouse.
- Indicate in the description of items how much costumers they can handle.
- Make it possible to set up uniforms for a business instead doing it individually for each employee.
- Make it possible to skip more than one day or skip days faster, with the possibility to ignore warnings or to stop time-travel if a warning pops up.
- Bigger carpets : D

What I love about Big Ambitions is how it manages to balance the business simulation with the human element of running a company. The city feels authentic and immersive, and you can add your own personal touch to your store. It's refreshing to see a game that doesn't forget about the people behind the business and the impact they have on their community.

The game mechanics are solid and make sense, making it easy to get lost in the gameplay. The attention to detail is impressive, and it's clear that the developers put a lot of thought into the game's design.

It's too early to call it something like ""The Sims meets Grand Theft Auto except you are a small business owner"" since that implies *quite* a bit that isn't true about the game.  In reality it's closer to Harvest Moon than either, but again that implies quite a bit that isn't here either.  What *is* here is a day-to-day loop where you manage your life and, as the game focuses quite a bit on it, one or more small businesses.  This is also where it grasps at some uniqueness: you could easily run a single business by yourself and one could argue that is just as or even more satisfying that running multiple.

For example, you set up shop in a small building with limited items.  Over time you add new things for sale, improve the decor and save up.  Eventually you can move to a better/more profitable location, and so you pack up all your furniture and goods, haul them across town and set up your store again.  Like, yes you can run multiple stores but that's where the life sim swoops in.  Grabbing a cup of coffee before rushing across town to take a load of paper bags to a business running low, opening up a shop for an extra day because your hired worker won't run that shift and you want to make some extra bread, rushing to the store to buy some fake plants before realizing you haven't eaten all day and now the grocery is closed.  These are the moments that the game thrives under, and they feel organic and scale with your businesses.  There's something exciting about hiring a new worker to pick up shifts which frees you up to pursue other actions.

This is also where the game runs out of steam the fastest: the life sim.  Right now you have a couple of bars to manage but it's neither challenging, nor deep.  You have no relationships with your employees or other people, no hobbies to pursue outside of work.  Given *that* is what ultimately elevates the life sim and casts conflict into the business sim, it's absence is felt immediately.  It's good that investing in your businesses is fun since that offsets it a bit, but while I wouldn't expect a full The Sims-style social life I would argue that the game would be substantially stronger for it.  This is just blue sky, but being able to go play golf with some investors in your company would be fucking amazing considering on the other end of the spectrum is rushing to buy condiments you need for tomorrow's shift.  I don't think Big Ambitions will get quite that far, but for the price and the content on offer I think you'll have a good time with this one even in Early Access.",1681185670,1681185670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Asides from letting me live out my Succession fan fiction I have a few notes. There's plenty of potential for a bit ""more"" of everything... more products to sell would be nice to diversify the types of businesses we can run. More furniture/interior design options would be great. Foot traffic seems to affect office jobs such as law offices a lot more than it should compared to a retail/restaurant business. Inflation is weird in the game, simply the more cash you have the bigger hit you're going to take from negative interest. It incentivizes you to keep your balance as close to $0 as possible. The game's Help section mentions some ways to avoid ""inflation"" penalties for keeping a high balance... such as investing in stocks, investing in a new business or upgrading one you already have. It just feels a bit counter entrepreneurial to avoid a cash balance/emergency fund. Theres some minor customer pathfinding issues and some other quality of life upgrades I expect they'll continue to work on so I'm not too concerned.

The scaling of inflation is totally out of hand imbalanced and should be a much smaller amortized percentage each week. The ""inflation"" aspect, termed as ""negative interest"", while creative, as implemented is ridiculous on its face. Holding more than 50k? Prepare to get taxed about 10% per... year? per....quarter? Nope, per week. Or day, it's so frequent I can't even tell, and I have no wish to lose half my bank again to that nonsense. Currently it is sitting at 14,204% per year. Not good.

It needs quite a bit of other polishing and a lot of QOL additions, such as click-and-drag directional placement for objects in the world, and being able to rotate objects ""the other way"" rather than having to click the rotate button 8 times for every item. Populating a new retail location is tedious and annoying due to rotation-spam during placement.

Marketing seems to be underpowered for office building capacity, and foot traffic is too powerful. A law office shouldn't only receive 4 customers/day with max marketing because the law office has low ""foot traffic"". Seriously, what does foot traffic matter for an expensive and purely service oriented business? Do people walk down the street, walk past a law office and think to themselves ""huh, I'm gonna spend $500 right now for a quick consultation."" If anything, low foot traffic should be a plus, and there should certainly not be a cap for marketing's effect on customer capacity.",1681177216,1681177216,False,3,0,0.552727282047271729,0,True,False,True

- CONS -

- Can get very repetitive
- Can become a huge grind
- Can get and feel boring after a while
- Not a very good crime system, feels very lackluster such as you'll get fined and such but past that there's nothing more to it, would like to see this expanded and improved
- too easy for character to get tired
- can be difficult finding your way around the map even with marked stuff
- no player inventory, forced to seek out home or food stores which gets annoying
- food bar goes down way too quickly
- overly difficult to keep character happy
- need some other fun stuff to do for character happiness

= The game has some great ups but there's also a few downs, however, overall this game is fantastic in so many ways to give you hours upon hours of fun while playing it and is highly addictive!

Replay value is not at its' best, but there are some.
Game has huge potential, can go in multiple directions in more details, but it is too early for it as it has few bugs. Bugs are not critical, but I will still name few:
1. Sometimes when going outside from building there is only gray view, unable to save or load. Had to re-install game, because next time when I launched game I was seeing name-tags for buttons.
2. Traffic needs re-construction. I.e. when I drive next to other car, other car decides to move to my lane without checking if anything is there. Or the line, where you do U turn (next to retail or the first import/export point), AI does not understand how to make that U turn and smashes cars into each other.
3. We need more variations of life, like dogs, people jogging, people being busy too or being more important than me (i.e. building's that I am currently renting landlord). Well, hoping you get what I mean here.
4. Sound meter keeps re-adjusting itself after some time and game does not remember music bar setting as well, which makes me always adjust it back where I want every game session.
5. Daily income usually is being shown as 50% of what I am really getting.
6. Happened only once, but when adjusting import order - adjusted order just stopped being delivered. Yes, I have checked if I have clicked ""Order"", it was checked. Minimum price for order was in red, but had two of them like this, one worked just fine, other didn't deliver.

Other than that - game is interesting. Even made me thinking about being entrepreneur myself lol.

Devs, maybe you will read this, let me offer some suggestions for the game, what at least for me would make it better.

1. As mentioned in bug section (sorry if it is not a bug actually), city is dead, not many people and too less variation of life. I would love somebody be doing runs with full handcart like myself and trying to conquer city also. Feel other presence by their actions, for example, being stuck in a traffic would impact people in offices getting at work in time.

2. Not much where I can spend my earned money, I would love giving donations, then being invited to donation organisation to be honored as the main contributor (I think that would be not so hard to implement). Then, sometimes people in streets would recognize me and lead in some actions, like giving autograph, giving money (as they would be begging for it), or just saying back ""Hi"". Or ignoring (if in a rush), would result in popularity injury and would impact prices.
3. More cars (also, some cars drives strangely and runs out of gas too quickly). This needs to be reviewed and upgraded. Would be nice to have a personal driver (like free taxi) later.
4. I was thinking it is a huge world at the beginning, but it is too small actually. Having lot of money, I would buy villa or something even bigger in more remote place.
5. I would love to drive my boat.
6. Hard difficulty is too easy, custom game settings are too forgiving, I lose interest quickly... I would suggest more chaos within market, only really popular places should get stable earnings, well, IDK, think of something :) You already thought of this fabulous game, guys.

So far, love the game. I love uncle Fred's voice as well, his voice was the first hook :) Will wait what will come from this game and will hold high hopes!

It's still missing proper mid-game content. As soon as you have one business up and netting a profit, it's basically just a decoration sim for the next businesses you own. I would like to see some more tasks or some kind of sidequests while you are expanding. 

Despite being a game about numbers, those numbers don't really match. At all.
Even in hard mode, you have pretty much zero chance at failing your first business. Your shop opens its doors and the number of sales just skyrocket. Depending on the disctrict, the accepted sales price and your resulting profit margin per item is ridiculously high. Also the rent for the bigger offices, shops and apartments is way too low.

The game is very well done and will provide most people hours of entertainment. As it stands, the high comes to an end pretty quick after you realize there is little to do beyond sleep the days away to get achievements.

Highly recommend this game for the casual gamer who is looking for a good time sink. I don't recommend this if you spend 20+ hours a week gaming. At least not in its current form.

Here are the things keeping this game from the overwhelmingly positive reviews it currently is pulling in:
[spoiler] *The soundtrack sucks, you can't use your own music. The whiplash between the 30 thug rap and bubblegum pop songs makes my neck hurt.

* Once you go brick and mortar the game is over.

* Super. I have a Yacht, a mansion, and 50 businesses... What do I do now?

* I got bored, bought 100 cars, and now rule all the parking on every block I own real estate. Now what?

* I switched all my businesses to grocery stores out of boredom. Still making cash from my brick and mortar. Negative interest rates don't even hurt anymore. Investments are all fine... What the fuck am I supposed to do now?

I guess economical sims can't be widely played nowadays.
As some of the more in-depth reviews already have stated, it's not actually a sim. Not even close.
To me it feels like a simple and shallow clicker game.

No strategic decisions you make, nothing seems to matter. You plop down stuff in a cumbersome way and money keeps rolling in anyway. You can't really fail and there's no challenge whatsoever.

Pros: 
- Very realistic: there is no buy button that makes an object magically appear in front of you, want that desk for your office? Well drive to the furniture store and get the desk yourself, want groceries? Go get them at the super market, want a bunch of shelves for your business but don't want to drive? Call them and ask them to ship them next dayto your door. Like I said great depth and realism.

-Open world (ish): You can freely move in a part of New York city, it covers 4 neighborhoods working class/ middle class / middle-upper class/ upper class, which give different options to open business, it feels great to not be confined to your store space only. 

- Business management: It is very detailed and complete, you can go from creating a little store to managing an empire, setting HR offices, Importing stuff, Planning logistics to deliver merchandise to all your stores.

- Business Variety: you can open a gift shop, foods store, fast food restaurant, lawyer office and many more, you can combine most of them in any way you like.

Cons:
- Employees management: the interactions with your employees is non existent, you can't raise their salaries, give any benefit, nothing, they have pretty basic requests like having a part time or full time, or asking for the office to have a specific thing (like a fridge or a big table), it really feels very lacking compared to the depth that other aspects have, i read in a future update this will get polished.

- Real State: No real benefits of buying buildings, they are super expensive, even when you have several stores producing a lot of money it is extremely hard to buy buildings, and if you do the rent is very cheap to get any benefit from it. I also heard this is being polished. 

- Your character needs: it also feels very lacking, you have 3 needs: eat, sleep and fun. If you miss any there is no real consecuences at certain point it feels more like an annoying thing to complete rather than a fun one, you can buy stuff for your house and you can't interact with most of it, and if you do it is pretty basic like watching tv, it needs a LOT of polish to feel like it is worth it to reserve time for your character rather than in your business.

Pretty much those would be my only negative points about the game, out of that it is a great experience and if you like tycoon/ strategy games this will give you tons of hours of fun, keep the good work going!

This is going to be long if you want to read it but I'm going in depth here.
Long Answer:
I was very excited for this game for a long time. I've had it on my wishlist for almost a year. It was supposed to come out in August last year, but that got delayed. I was a BIG supporter of this companies first game, because they were so in touch with their community. I pointed out a problem, within 5 mins the developers reached out to me and pushed an update. And startup company was a great game. And as I mentioned, I had REALLY high hopes for this game. Despite not having the funds to buy it instantly, I decided to buy it now. Here is my summary.

Before I begin, I'm not a hater. This is just my honest opinion.
PROS:
-It's strangely satisfying. Something about trying to make sure you have everything you need and rushing around to get it all before you go into the red is fun.
-It takes a good bit of time if you're looking for something to do.
-It's pretty brainless, you can easily run it on the side as you're doing something else, but if you really pay attention, you can find some more success.
-There's a decent bit of customization you can do to your interiors depending on how you want and if you have the funds.
-It's a fun little thing to have running from time to time and seeing your success go up.
-There are some easter eggs if you explore a little.
-There is some variation in the AI businesses when it comes to what the same types of businesses in different locations do. For example, there are 2 marketing firms on the map, and they both offer a special kind of marketing.
-The driving is a fun challenge and racing to not hit someone is fun.
-This game has a LOT of potential to be something much greater.
-Every run can be different.
-It gets a lot more in depth in terms of the initial setup of your business once you start figuring our supply chains, warehouses, stock, employees etc. But after that, it becomes automated and there's not much to do.

CONS:
-A lot of people are saying this is sims meets GTA. It's not. You can't really interact with anyone unless you're trying to buy something or place an order for store managers to deliver directly to your business. This is the only interactions you get.
-There is almost no competition. Depending on which district you set your business up in, you may see competition for the same products, but there is no way to see who this competition is or even check what their prices are to be competitive.
-As I mentioned earlier, there is no interaction with anyone. No negotiating prices, no negotiating rent, no economies of scale, nothing.
-There is no real way to see what your customers want or what their expectations are.
-There's no dynamics to the world. Every AI business is fixed, they don't move or change, or really seem to compete with each other at all. They just exist.
-You can't interact with your own business. For example, if you open a cafe and want to eat at your own cafe to fill your hunger bar, you just can't. You HAVE to go spend money at your competitors.
-The jobs offer nothing in terms of actually working. All you do is skip time until the end of your shift and make money. That's all.
-The actual life sim aspect of this game is very mediocre. All you do is eat and sleep once a day to make sure you don't pass out and go to the hospital. That's it. No social life, no way to do much.
-The moving system is done by middle clicking so your character follows your mouse, or clicking where you want him to go. WASD would be a nice addition in the options to switch to. The mouse movement is annoying.
-There is no way to see a financial overview of each individual business. You can only see your profit margin, which I'm not sure if it's actually your profit or just your revenue, because the business overview page always shows I'm in the red despite making money everyday, but when you click on the business itself it shows a green profit margin. But there are no way to see your expenses or exactly what you're paying your employees.
-When you're hiring employees, the hiring firms just give you random part time and full time employees. You can't choose which one you want, which can get really annoying. You have to spend more money on more hiring campaigns just to find one.

In conclusion, I'm giving this an upvote because the devs have always been open, they have a very clear roadmap, though I don't believe it addresses many of the issues I pointed out, but as I said earlier, this game has GREAT potential to be something fantastic if they can add a little bit of life to it. Currently, it's a clicking simulator. You click here and click there, and all you're really doing is ordering materials and picking up equipment to place in your buildings for all your businesses for your employees to work. That's all it is really. Fun to leave in the background, but that's about it. 
I really hope they add a bit more interactivity for the player and between the AI in this game. It can go places. I have hope. That's the only reason I'm voting yes here.",1680949015,1680950569,True,10,0,0.616144180297851563,0,True,False,True

It runs well and i haven't encountered really any bugs. Certainly not game breaking bugs. The issue i have with this game is the lack of content for the price tag. This plays very much like an early alpha in terms of content. It's almost like a proof of concept.

The business selection is lacking but fine i understand it's early access.....but the assets are extremely lacking. There are 1 type of display for every single item you can sell. There is almost zero variance. I assume this will change with time, hopefully.

Content is extremely lacking as-well. You are forced to live through 24hr days but in reality you'll only utilize 1-2hr unless you're opening a business. You can get any business type up running and self sufficient in 2 days, maybe 3-4 for large operations. 80% of your time will be sleeping, eating, playing games/watching tv then sleeping for another 24hr. This goes on for days and days....until you get bored and open another business. This is literally all there is to do at this time.....i guess decorate your apartment/office but at a point your very limited by furniture type.

Early access is pretty much dead at this point. Think back to the last EA game that came out (especially in this genre) that lived up to the promises made(rim world?). There's so much potential here.....they should just open it up to modders and patch is official ports of popular mods. It seems thats the special sauce to these kind of games surviving early access.",1680919267,1680919444,False,1,0,0.491853892803192139,0,True,False,True

I spend most of the day sitting in my flat and skipping through until there's something to do. What fun would it be to open another shop at this point? It's always the same procedure. As an experienced sim player, you quickly figure out how to get the most out of it, and then? Open a law firm - sounds great at first, but I rent a room, put lawyers in it and vary the fee until I reach the possible maximum. That's it. That's it for every other shop.
 The lifeim part is also a great idea, but it's a minimum of possibilities. Investing in shares is advertised, but the reality is that I can pay money into 3 different shares and they go up or down by pure chance. 
There is also almost no furniture or anything else - which means I always buy the same ones. I think the developers are making a huge mistake by setting modding to sometime after release - a Steam Workshop would be the key thing for this game to generate unlimited content. And that's what this game is missing. 
Actually, the game can already come out of the EA now - because the sandbox, the basic framework, it all fits great. But there is just a massive lack of content (especially things to buy) and therefore you should really gear your game more towards modding.

Edit: The gameplay loop seems to stop being interesting after getting up to like, 15 or so businesses. I got the imports, I got warehouses shipping to sub-warehouses to support a growing web of businesses throughout the city, I got my hq loaded with desks, logistics and HR guys, all that's left to my gameplay loop is setting up new businesses and restructuring my warehouse web when needed. (Rent space, order furniture, place furniture, hire, train, schedule employees, rinse repeat) I need an option to make a template of some sort to start getting these businesses set up automatically. A service I'd be happy to pay in-game cash for. I never thought of a use for retail spaces bigger than 280sqft besides getting a bigger customer flow. The math seems to check out but it's not something I'd be willing to bet on or bother with until I don't actually need the money. Experimentation reqd.

I'd call it a feature that you can sleep an entire day, wake up for 2 minutes to set up a business entirely on your phone, then go back to sleep for another day, rinse repeat, without eating anything for a month, without dying. The bad part is that's not a super interesting gameplay loop. 

Also: If you use cheat engine to blow out a game after getting bored with it, DO NOT edit your cash balance to the billions and/or freeze the value, then try to buy every building in town. I think there's a memory leak or something that overrided something important in my OS, resulting in a bluescreen-reboot loop.

There are lots of different types of businesses you can run but ultimately it all feels the same as there are only 2 types of employees: Cleaners and Customer Service. No Cook for restaurants or Baristas for Coffee Shops. This means that the only different between types of business is the demand for the product they sell.

There's also a major issue with how pointless and manual your player character is. You have to manually move furniture around stores yourself by grabbing the object and moving it to the place you want it to go. At some point there should really be a more SIMS like system of just buying the objects from a catalogue and placing them in the store - having them delivered by the manufacturer: I don't like the fact that my CEO has to drive to IKEA and buy tables himself.

The Sleep - Food - Mood meters are also entirely redundant. Mood is impossible to keep up and is entirely ignorable, Food is easy to keep up and is entirely ignorable and Sleep will always be maxed out because you spend most of your time sleeping in your car waiting for something to happen.

I enjoy where the game is trying to go but it's completely dropped a load of basic functions in order to get there.
If you want to have a player character with wants and needs then you need to give us a reason to fulfil those wants and needs. Make the game a bit more SIMS - Increase the penalty for not fulfilling their needs and give us a reward for doing it. Right now it's just a slightly tedious task that I can just skip by sleeping in the car. Apparently my character is battery powered and just plugs in for the night (Or day since you can sleep for a week straight if you want to (There is in fact no reason not to other than it costing you real life time to do).

I cannot recommend the game in its current state. At first glace there's a lot to do but in actuality there's nothing to do at all since none of it matters and all of it is the same.

...but before too long, the economy ends up feeling as shallow as a sheet of paper.
The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of graphs showing how the different businesses were doing hour to hour/day to day/week over week.   Just two meager graphs showing total customers - one for the day before - and one for the last 7 days. Not last ""monday-through-friday"", but last 7 days... as if a Monday would play out exactly the same as a Friday, or a Sunday... 

Businesses fail to give the appearances of being bustling with life when the player enters... only to send all the customers in a single wave - causing the tills to be instantly overwhelmed. Which lead me to believe I had to add more tills... When in fact I was already wasting having too many of them.

Staffing anything larger than a small gift-shop is also an outright pain - especially if you want to exchange an employee (to fire, or train) - as one has to do this on a day-per-day basis. (Rather than having a ""shift"" which one then just staffs)

I hope the dev stays with it and fleshes out the systems that are already in - rather than adding new ones...

At my current playtime, I've about 'completed' the game. As a sandbox, there's obviously always more to do, but it's more of the same at this point. 

The main goal is to make numbers go up, and as others have pointed out, it's an effective (if debatably unintentional) critique of capitalism. Once you're making ~50K a day in profits, there's not much to spend your money on other than things that are expensive for the sake of being expensive. You can buy luxury cars and a luxury apartment, and fill it with expensive stuff to demonstrate your wealth, but other than the cars, there's no real impact on gameplay.

Interestingly, this does aid the role playing part of the game. You can customize your virtual space and fill the block with your own personal fleet of supercars. The cars are quite a fun touch, as each one drives differently, although I do wish the top of the line sports cars didn't constantly sound like an electric drill working overtime.

Lategame concerns aside, getting your first several businesses set up and automated, running errands to help keep your businesses afloat, delivering products, covering shifts, and eventually setting up a distribution network and a headquarters, is all quite fun. I'd say for 30 hours or so of enjoyment, it's worth it.

Just don't expect (at the moment) the type of replayability or infinite growth possible with a game like Factorio. The ""endgame"" is to do more of the same, and although there are some plans in the near future to alleviate the tedium of that (blueprints), once that tedium is gone I'm not sure what's left, other than watching numbers go up.",1680718031,1680718031,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Whilst the core game-play loop is fun for a while it becomes clear that the game is fairly shallow and the mechanics suffice to say aren't yet at a stage of real polish (such as marketing, decoration, layout of stores etc) basically there is some stuff to do in the game but at this point none of its really well fleshed out. One example is law firms. You can get a law firm and put it in an area that has the highest level of demand, give it marketing, and tick all the satisfaction boxes, yet, that law firm will only attract the same amount of customers as your tiny little one in another district with nowhere near the same demand, marketing or satisfaction. You still get to experience the game in its early access state but like I said its pretty flawed atm.

This game just simply needs... more but in saying that what they already have and what will be added will also need to go through some serious polish so I am not too sure of how much more they would be able to pull off in terms of scope.

It is worth it at the price if you like games like this and want to experience it now but if you only dabble in them or prefer to see how it turns out at the end of early access then either wish-list it or wait for a sale.

Now... It aint perfect. Biggest points that suck the fun out are assigning your new workers uniforms and placing objects in new buildings. It was fun at first... but like I got 20 businesses now... got old awhile ago. 

I have not seen any game breaking bugs but I have seen some minor ones, like a store being out of paperbags when they have 9000 on the shelves behind them. But, for a 0.1 version.... this is amazing. I have 50 hours in as I write this and after dinner I am going back to make more businesses and exploit some labor! 

Some notes for me are the options to micro manage your employees schedule and training... or just assigning them to someone to handle that for me. Figuring out the logistics is fairly easy to understand but iunno it seems pretty buggy sometimes. always running out of stuff. and again, placing more storage at the warehouses is blehhh. 

a mechanic like what quality of food in your establishment would be nice too. like is my place a mc donalds or a 5 star whatever. Is my clothes store seers or a... i don't know any high end cloths stores but u get it. 

more job options like chef, server, clerk, barista and so on would just make sense to me.

Right now the game mechanics are closer to a mobile game than an actual tycoon type of game. You keep grinding the mundane tasks, setting up retail after retail, warehouse after warehouse and so on. They all work the exact same so there's absolutely no variation in this at all. You also have your office businesses, which really are just you renting a space, getting a desk, computer and a chair and hiring a dude, or several dudes. That's it - nothing more to do there, ever.

At this stage, there really isn't any sort of role-playing involved in the game, apart from the cheap talking head of an uncle ordering you to go on a cruise or something. Eating, sleeping and ""fun"" are all just empty mechanics: you eat from your fridge before bed and all the ""fun"" meter does is it makes you ""sad"" so you have to sit at your home computer and play games (skip time) for a couple of hours.

Apart from building your businesses, there really isn't anything to do in the game. You can either not hire people to get full schedules (meaning you have to go to your retail and skip time by ""working""), or if you do hire, there really isn't all that much to do besides waiting to get enough money to open yet another retail.

So right now all there is to do in this game is:
1. wait until you get enough money (skip time)
2. work at your retail (skip time)
3. run tasks for your retails (drive from A to B, deliver items X, Y, Z)
4. open new businesses (works exactly like step 3)

So yeah. If you like driving around in an old GTA style city and skipping time, this game is right up your alley.",1680684954,1680684954,False,4,0,0.501547396183013916,0,True,False,True

Then shut your business down for a full day or more and hope you can get to the wholesale store, buy the resources (if you REMEMBER EXACTLY what you need), and good luck on getting back, stocking shelves, etc before the day runs out.

There are several businesses you can own anywhere from a florist to a law firm though which gives you some options on how you wish to progress in the game. There are several vehicles, and several ways for you to get goods into your business which adds it more into depth which makes the game even better. However, when you progress quite a bit into the game your options do become a bit limited of what you can do you'll typically just choose to start a different game though.

That being said, I suggest new players to read up a little bit on tips&tricks online since the game only teaches you the bare bone fundamentals. You might really struggle in the beginning to lift off from minimum income if you try to go fast and don't understand what things mean.

- Follow a storyline that teaches you basic fundamentals
- Hire employees from recruitment companies
- Schedule employees according to their requirements and train them up
- Start multiple different businesses (retail & office)
- Buy goods from wholesale stores until import becomes available

It's great that you can order stuff to your doorstep, but I didn't know that in the beginning and either the game doesn't tell you at all or not in a way that you learn it. Ordering items is also limited to 18 pieces, which makes sense with the pallet layout they arrive on but is arbitrary and hindering when you try to fill a big store. Allow multiple pallets?

Huge stores but no point in filling them. 8 shelves give you the maximum serving capacity in the largest retail buildings, which could fit 80. Why bother wasting the money?

It's a hassle to populate your stores with furniture, as (to my knowledge) you only have your handtruck (which holds 4 items, see also previous points) and placing those items is very tedious from a controls standpoint. You cant just handle the handtruck and place everything that's on it in one go, you have to enter the storage of the handtruck, pick up the item, press place on the item, place the item and then go back to the handtruck. [u] this is probably the one that stopped me from playing further [/u]

Not really a difference in how to run retail businesses regarding the type of sold items. Clothes? Flowers? Food? Sure it's different presenting furniture but that's all (and with food a prep furniture). I was intrigued by ""grow any business"" but in the end there are 10 or 20ish prefabs that all feel the same.

Sometimes very tedious to click the right thing. Especially in the starting alley where you live, depending on the camera angle I usually click the wrong house first.

Interior design is neccessary for customers but  it doesn't matter how it actually looks, as long as enough decoration items are present. I know ""looking nice"" is hard to quantify, but if I can just yank 10 plants and 10 rubbish bins in a corner and get to 100%, better not use that feature. Especially since (as previously mentioned) putting stuff in your store is very tedious and unintuitive.

If you start with story mode you still have lots of freedom when it comes to choices and you aren`t confined just to the story tasks.

The risk/reward is really good and you always have to keep an eye on the market demand to stay at the top, but also watch out for the competition in the neighbourhood.
Driving is fun and the music as soon as you get in the car is just a vibe ☜(˚▽˚)☞. Except when you get honked for no reason, but hey, you can block the traffic if it annoys you. Tho wish there was more visibility when driving under a bridge.

I or II, Bitlife or even The Sims for the business aspect will also likely fall in love with this game. In a sense I wish the two could collaborate and make the ultimate game. That said, I've had the game a week and have already clocked close to 80 hours, I'm obsessed! Presently I bounce between the objective driven and sandbox modes of the game. I would like to share first my ideas, followed by my overwhelmingly positive feedback.

Game play improvements Suggestion:

*Presently, I only receive ""alerts"" under the delivery tab for contracted deliveries from the Wholesale Warehouse. I would like for their to be alerts when entering our own delivery warehouse so we don't have to jump between the two screens to allocate resources. I think it would also be amazing to be able to show our own deliveries under the ""Delivery"" section where external contracts are presently shown simplifying the process.

*It is unclear to me how effective the marketing campaigns work, so perhaps tweaking this feature.

*Recruitment agencies offer you a selection of up to ten candidates for a store or business at a time. Beyond the specific skill there is little to go from. This leads to a number of candidates who may or may not want full time hours and have varying degrees of need for pre-training. I think it would be beneficial to tweak this feature to fold-in higher prices for more detailed candidates (e.g., $3000 for ten candidates seeking full-time/par-time work with at least 50% skill in cleaning/customer service/HR/Lawyer, etc.).

*Contacts: A city phone book to call taxis and limit the need to run around the world to meet vendors for future orders.

*Warehouse signs/ pallet & storage shelves assignments: Either automatic signs over warehouse stock shelves OR the ability to assign shelves for specific items for easier self distribution. 

*Mouse control: Drive the vehicle with our mouse opposed to keys

*Handcarts: Ability to purchase larger handcarts. (TIP: Travel to IKA to get 8 storage cart and then travel via taxi to locations to carry more stuff in/out OR keep one box on cart in locations to keep the cart from disappearing.) 

*Traffic

Dreams:

*Employees / Board: The ability to hire store / warehouse managers, executive leadership roles: CEO, COO, CMO, CFO, CPO, etc. (Their functions maybe to run the mundane tasks of proper stock and inventory sending requests for increased supplies or notifying if supplies need to be pared down in a dip // oversee the Headquarter operations and make AI suggestions // the board approving motions for sell, market share increase/decrease, fire ELT members, etc.)

*IPO, Acquisition and Mergers: The ability to go public to earn more money quickly and expand operations (struggling companies may be offered for purchase or buy-out other public companies). Purchase controlling interest in companies. Hostile take overs in either direction (AI to player or player to AI).

*Franchise: The ability to allow AI to buy a location or start a shop with our information and logo while we receive benefits (maybe we even supply their store for a profit). Also the ability to buy or open a franchise of our own (e.g., Five Cups, and other heavily advertised and multiple store front locations).

*Player driven multiple store fronts: Presently, if you want to run a large corporation you have to call them ""Store 1"" ""Store 2"" and so on to feel like you have the brand throughout the map. Yet, AI corporations have multiple store fronts such as groceries, coffee venues, and offices with the same name for each location. 

*Start ups: Put money into AI store startups or have AI business partner offers to open businesses opposed to only taking out loans. 

*Wealth: Purchase sports teams, donate to schools, more homes (with garages), families to take care of, donate and have buildings/schools named after character, more furniture, more cars, ability to purchase clothing and edit sim character.

*Bankruptcy: File for bankruptcy or have businesses foreclosed when unpaid debt is not settled. 

*Improved simulation: Families and children to pass business/wealth to, plastic surgery, lose/gain weight, ability to change clothes/appearance, ability to place/use e.g., gifts/wine/cigar, etc. that we purchase, more functions such as sitting while eating, working out, bathroom, interacting with pedestrians and employees, etc. Also the ability to buy from our own stores.

*Decor and Objects: More variety and ability to erect/destroy walls. 

*Businesses: Gas stations, distribution/whole sale warehouses, consulting, ride share, furniture store, car garage, dispensary, hospital management, etc.

*Basic politics: Monopoly laws, minimum wage, increased/decreased taxes, ability to support for or against candidate or law with money.

*Lawsuits: Sue a AI company for ripping of logo or brand name (may or may not win), be sued for forming a monopoly or cartel market (forced to shut down stores or re-brand or pay fines).

I wish the sandbox would allow Achievements, other then that its quite fun!

A few things that would be awesome or maybe for people who like it a bit more realistic, 

It would be cool if the employees would need to travel to the workplace as well and and go home as well, Not just vanish, very small thing but its still cool!

Being able to order food or furniture for more money and within a delivery date. Would be awesome.

Then as last, I would love to be able to see a bit of preview of stores what they are selling, Maybe its just me but its a bit difficult to see where I buy what, but its fine, Its super fun still!

Hire staff, HR , cleaners, floor workers.
manage stock, supplies, adds, ofc money flow.  All really well done in my opionion.
ablility to setup stores however u want.  


My 1 main issue with the game is how annoying the controls are to setup stores.  Only able to grab 1 item at a time and place it.  so say i want to setup table and 4 chairs.  i need to grab table, place it, then each chair individually, spinning it right way, and placing it.  If doing restraunt or something this gets old fast.

also the view, movement of the char is very limited-clunky.  point click to move.  and camera is stuck on ur char and only turns in 90* incremints.... limited zoom in and out.  

not game breaking things i get its not fps or whatever.  but it is for me annoying especially where early game u got to setup so many stores-items.  

hopefully these are things that get better in time.

If I could suggest two updates that I haven't seen yet...  
1.  The ability to sort employees within a location schedule.  I would like to be able to sort for just full time or just part time at the least,  It would be great to also sort special requests such as those who will only work nigts or 4 day work weeks ect.

So I did the tutorial story on easy. I made it till I had about 4M net worth. At that point I lost interest.

Started a new play-through on custom. Made the game harder. With all my previous knowledge I have 6 shops in the first district all 30 caps and I'm making 200k a day in about 1/3 the time. Once you understand the basic concepts it is impossible to fail and snowballs rather quickly.

I think my original play-through felt tense to an extent because the tutorial does not have you maximize your first business before opening your second. So it gets messy and those businesses aren't making you maximum profit because nothing is explained as well as the information I got from you guys here in the forums and in disc. (not saying the tutorial is bad). Also, I'd never waste my time on a 15 cap. Is it profitable? Sure is it worth it? Not really.

I feel like other than setting personal goals and chasing achievements I've kinda seen/did all I can for now. 10/10 EA game I can't wait to see what they bring to us next.

I'll continue my current play-though here and there. I'm shooting for having 6 businesses in each district and possibly getting the best apartment and doing the 2M decorating achievement.",1679929221,1679929221,True,0,0,0.463709652423858643,0,True,False,True

Game definitely needs to focus more on the gameplay loop outside of actually building businesses, but after reading the roadmap, I have no doubt they're aware of this.

I will say this game is still very early access.  Some of the ideas are well fleshed out and I see a lot of potential (hence the yes) but this game dies a quick death once you hit late game.  If your have a bunch of businesses and real estate you end up not really having anything to do but hang out and make money, which is a bit like real life I suppose, but as a game I feel like there's just no reason to play anymore.  There's a lot of potential in this game.  I give it a thumbs up for now because of how engaging the early game is, but it really needs work on mid to late game,

I am doing well, I hope you are too. Just letting you know how successful I have been. 

Lately I have been catching a taxi to the warehouse to buy my products. I load a handcart with 2 boxes of donuts and 2 boxes of croissants and run 3 city blocks back to my coffee shop to unload. 

This only happened because I crashed my van until it stopped working in traffic and was parked illegally. I couldn't afford to get it towed so the city was fining me every day for illegal parking. So I sold it.

I'm now so broke I fired all my employees and I'm now working 12 hour shifts... so I can buy the donuts and croissants. 

Having a great time, wish you were here.

Love
Tommy

And it delivers on that promise in a pretty fun and engaging way, you'll enjoy it if you enjoy sim-style games. And if that's all you want, read no further. But what Big Ambitions ACTUALLY is, is a molten-lava cake of scathing satirical commentary on late-stage capitalism. And I love it. 

Join me, won't you comrade? As we peel back the layers of the simplistic facade and delve deep into the comparisons of modern day America and the criticisms inherent in the game. You'll first be struck by the fact that employees are king in Big Ambitions. Yes, you'll be rising to the top on the backs of your hard working laborers, profiting from their struggle. More on that in just a second. But they actually hold a lot of the power. They set their own rates, based on their skill, and you have to pay it or they simply won't work for you, and if you don't give them the hours they want, they'll just quit, putting you out of pocket to hire their replacement. How are you supposed to get the feel of running an enterprising business in America without the ability to underpay and overwork your employees? Simply unrealistic! But counter to that, they will work, happy as a clam, provided you meet all their demands, until they die. You never have to worry about investing in their training and them up and leaving you for a better gig, they will work for their entry-level pay no matter how skilled you make them, as long as all their needs are met. Imagine that. Happy workers being consistent and loyal? Paying a living wage and still being able to turn a profit? What an absurd flight of fancy this game is!

That right there is the chocolate cake exterior of the molten-lava cake. Warm, crumbly, amusing and comforting. But as you delve past that moist commentary you'll eventually strike the hot, decadent, truly over-the-top, gooey center of this lambaste of the American Dream. 

In the beginning, the game gives you limited (but free, care of a wealthy businessman uncle) resources, and requires you to husband them while eking out a meager profit, all the while tantalizing you with prizes that could eventually be yours, if only you hustle, including fancy cars, palatial condos, and even a Mega Yacht. If you're careful with your free car you can move inventory without incurring undue costs, like logistics laborers and vehicle maintenance costs, but be careful! Those parking tickets are costly! And if you work some shifts in your stores that's salaries and hiring costs you can avoid. There is no need to buy luxuries like a TV when a walk in the park is free and makes you just as happy. 

Eventually you've scrimped and saved enough to really break out. You hire employees because your time is better spent on other things, like establishing your corporate offices, or expanding your budding empire with new business locations. And if you balance everything just right, your efforts pay off big time. You'll find your profits are more than enough to not only sustain new expansion, but also to provide some sought after comforts. A big bullshit truck (after all, it carries more inventory), a big screen TV, maybe just a small yacht. 

But as you shift your focus from hours to days, and from days to weeks, you find your little businessman avatar has less to do, day-to-day. You've set up import agreements and all the logistics to keep your businesses stocked, your employees are happy, your HR managers are doing the training you had to manually manage, all that's left for you to do is ensure the weekly purchase amounts are increased as you wait for enough money to accumulate to either buy out another business to add to your empire, which will come with [strike]firings[/strike] restructuring tasks, or blow it on an opulent display of wealth (what's the most you've ever won in a game of black jack?) What do you do til then? You might find yourself in a loop of waking up, checking your daily earnings, and playing video games or watching TV until it's time to go to bed, not because you need the happiness boost (you have years before that modifier ages off), but because you CAN be your best basement dwelling self, playing games until dawn and sleeping well past noon. Maybe you leave the house to do some grocery shopping, because the game is only early access and they haven't modeled in Door Dash just yet. Maybe you restock the warehouse on paper bags. Not because you have to, you could have set up a purchasing order weeks ago, but because it gives you something to do. Something to use that big bullshit truck for.

That's when you start to notice certain things. You drive a little more recklessly, time is money, after all, and you can afford the repair bills if it means you can bully people out of the way. You don't even shop yourself anymore, you can order everything over the phone and have it delivered. You don't even think about the delivery fees you once thought were extortionately high. Where once a warning about low-stock in your burger joint would send you into a panicked rush to their nearest CostCo to buy a handtruck full of French Fries, now you ignore out of stock warnings for days from the very same store. It's small-time, barely makes you $10k a day. How much was that interior decorating? Oh who cares, I want the wallpaper that looks fanciest. You long ago stopped looking for free parking, who cares about parking fees when you're making hundreds of thousands a day? Hell, you might even park illegally and just eat the ticket, if it offers a modicum of convenience.

Then it hits you, like a steam locomotive riding on rails built by wage-slaves. You see a quote from Final Fantasy Tactics in your minds eye ""If the penalty for a crime is a fine, that law only exists for the lower class"". But the lower class pays your tickets, they pay your delivery fees, they pay your repair bills, they pay the rent on your 8 penthouses. You're free to do what you want, it's just a matter of how many workers you need to build your tower to extravagance, thus always the end-state of late-stage capitalism.

A central cleaning company would be a useful solution here (either under the company's own control or bought in externally).Removals are not yet possible. If you no longer need a warehouse with the products, you can manually transfer the goods or sell the entire warehouse with contents. Here a move function would be a great idea.One point I still have to address, but here it must be noted that it could also be an isolated case:The concept with deliveries via the department stores, doesn't always work flawlessly. Sometimes the products are not delivered at all, even though the department store is full and the stores' warehouses are empty.

I feel it would benefit from an option to adjust the speed at which time passes to the preference of the player.- There is a in-game help menu, which tells you what goes where, but if you are following the story/tutorial, it seems like the pace isn't consistent and then you end up with businesses you don't necessarily want - inevitably making you want to start again, at which point you then might give up.All that said, it is still early access; there is plenty they claim to have in the pipeline, so it's worth watching - also, it's well priced.",1679780423,1679780423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game does not really supply you the means to scale up these processes and so the methods you was using at the beginning to employ people, furnishing and import goods for your single small local business are the same methods you use to run a huge holdings company with a dozen businesses. Getting 18 items a day delivered to your business and doing a trip to the furniture store for 60 items (the most any truck can hold) is okay when it's your first business and you only need a few things, but once you start buying huge stores that may need hundreds of furniture items it becomes an absolute painful chore.Calling an employment agency to hire a few people is fine when it's a few dozen people. However, once you're hiring hundreds of people having to hire them in batches of ten via a phone becomes mind numbing. Especially when you start receiving text messages from your employees about why they're unhappy and you have dozens of employees sending you complaints. The game really needs a way to automate or, at least, speed up the process of furnishing stores and hiring people, because until then this isn't really a business sim, it's a interior decorate sim and most of your time will not be spent making a fortune, but instead running back and forth to the Ikea and decorating buildings utilising the most tedious tools possible. Just for a concrete example: Suppose I wish decorate my business with exactly 60 clothing racks. To do this I need to get in my truck, go to the appliance store, stock up four racks, buy them, take them to the truck and transfer, go back into the store and repeat. This will take 15 trips in and out the appliance store. Then I need to drive to my business and begin unloading, again, only four at a time and this will take another 15 trips - then I need to place all the items down myself. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it really is and just doing this alone can easily take hours, because you also have to manage your characters hunger and sleep on top of all this. Now suppose I need 50 employees to run this store on all the checkouts for 24hrs (in-game), well, now I need to ring the employment agency and ask for a maximum of ten applicants, so I need to do this 5 times, I wait 24hrs, get the applicants and the need to read them all for specification and accept/deny. Again, this is all fine for your first few business, but now imagine you need to do this 80 times, which, yes, is a mission in the game. So, I'll change the review if they ever address these issues, but for now this is a big thorn in the game that seriously changes it from a business sim to a micromanaging interior decorator sim.",1679748387,1679748387,False,205,4,0.861111223697662354,0,True,False,True

my only gripe, and i would hope it gets worked out. once you get everything automated, everybody trained, frieght trucks, etc.. you dont have anything to do. like, at all. go to the park and walk around? and from what i can tell you have to actually walk. cant run or stand still. play video games and watch tv to maintain happiness. you can get a job at the super market i suppose, beats just clicking on the bed for 24 hours, eat, bed, go buy fresh food, watch tv, games, bed, eat, repeat this really really boring cycle. but, your just banking money. you get charged at 1 million, so as long as you just invest all your money to stay below 1 mill, you actually make money. but i am at the point i am doing this to save up and buy property. is this going to open up a whole new part of the game? i hope so. the amount of time, boring time. spent to get to that point, is a problem. and all i can hope for is a decent reward. but i have a feeling all its going to do is eliminate my rent fee's. maybe make some extra money on the residential and any other stuff on the property? that would be cool. or is it only one business type per spot of land? 

so thats my rant on my only issue(s) with the game. which are small. it is not a game meant to be played as the main staple. its a filler game. approach as such and you will certainly enjoy it!

pro tips: never buy a warehouse with only one vehicle bay. 
              only buy large 8,000sq/ft offices for lawyer, web, and your HQ. 
              hire HR managers ASAP and get your people training. slide that bar to 100%. 
              pay attention to logistics, if it lists an item you dont have in the store as a delivery item, you
                  need to start selling that item!
              the market insider is kind of a joke. just open the map and select the business' you want to start
                  in whatever area. start a business that does not have competition. (nearby similar stores)
                  i notice this has been far more profitable strategy than following what the demand says on 
                  market insider.
              never do a donut shop. the price of the food is just not high enough to cover cost of labor, 
                  equipment, etc.. even if you raise to the highest point before pricing& drops. 
              last but not least. allways keep raising your prices every 3-4 days until the % drops in insight. than 
                  lower is .2 at a time until 100% again. this is insure your getting the most money per product for 
                  the area your shop is in.

This game has VERY LITTLE BUGS and plays smoothly at high frame rates a major +

Suggestions and serious improvements needed for the game I have spotted:

Customer NPC path finding after picking up items in stores could use drastic improvements I always see them go straight for the exit doors rather then straight to the cashiers so that's my only negative I have found.

I believe the next bits is already known by the devs which they will be fixing within 2 months based on their road map.
https://www.bigambitionsgame.com/roadmap.html

The cars parked in the parking spaces DEFINITELY DO NOT leave you a lot of space to park unless you are far enough in the game to get a very nice medium to high end car with AUTO PARKING SUPPORT. so something to think about.

QOL Features such as a VARIABLE SPEED UP and SLOW DOWN TIME button in the UI is definitely needed
(This is known they are working on this) Take inspiration from Stellaris if you want.

This last bit feels a little more nuanced. But I do feel that the ENERGY and HUNGER gauges are going down a bit too fast in my opinion. 

Though on the flip side I would agree on the basis if the hunger gauge runs empty then a penalty of rapid energy decline should take effect.

All in all? A few more touches here and there along with more map expansion? 

The game is definitely worth the £20 during early access.

If more content and MOD WORKSHOP SUPPORT IS ENABLED to ALLOW THE COMMUNITY TO MOD THE GAME? 

Price point can be £25 to £30 :)",1679578389,1679578389,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

+ game mechanics
+ Has a lot implemented for EA
+ Good complexity and variation (number of types of businesses, geographical spreed suppliers that makes you plan ahead)

+ still a lot to discover
- graphics (come on, please try a bit harder on polishing the game - character creation must be considered a placeholder for what it is now. some textures are very basic with little to no feeling of material aspect - plain colours)

If you like the idea of the game and want to support and give feedback based on an incomplete product then buy it.  This game is very much in the category currently of ""Good idea that needs A LOT of work.""

My main complaints are that it is seemingly extremely easy to pull back the veneer of the game and see the inner workings.  Once you've seen the inner workings of the game then it becomes extremely formulaic.  To start a new business you just have to check off these boxes every single time.  You're just stamping out businesses.  The only gameplay after a while is the tedious running back and forth to bring objects 4 at a time into your store to set it up.  You know exactly what you need to do before you even open the store, you do these things in an extremely slow tedious manner.  Then rinse and repeat. 

I think the game needs a lot of balancing on the back end as I think the difficult part of opening a new store should be reading the market, targeting a demographic, and getting customers in your store.  Not the tedious loop of running in and out with your handtruck to physically set the stuff up over and over again. 

I think this has a possibility to be a great game, but currently it's way to easy to ""Get"" and once you ""get"" it it's very difficult to find a way to have fun because there is no further challenge.  The biggest positive thing I will say after the success of the Early Access launch the immediate reaction from the development team was ""How can we use this money to make our plans for the game bigger and better?""

Honestly this game came across my radar completely randomly and I have been hopelessly addicted ever since.

I also love that its not like the sims where you're just purchasing and pasting furniture from a magical catalog. If you want to furnish your business (which to get excellent customer satisfaction you're going to have to) you get your butt to IKEA and get to haul that shit over.

However, the balance is not quite there within the shops. After making every shop, maximizing them, and doing my research, I will say that the developers need to look at this as a number one priority. It feels bad when the effort you've put into certain shops just don't perform as well as others. Also it is odd how the largest shops in the game require you to put very little points of sales in to get them maximized. The store just feels very empty.

Certain steps in the gameplay can be rather tedious.
Your characters' ""fun"" meter is super annoying to maintain

I preface with this so that you know there is no bias in this review, it is about as objective as one can be considering to this day I am still banned from the DIscord.

The usual mantra in this day and age would be to damn the game out of spite or simply find something negative to highlight and feel like i got my own but did it truthfully ...

On the contrary if Startup Company was the prelude to this masterful piece of game design then what happened had to happen.

What you have here is an amazing mix of genres and ideas both new and borrowed to create something truly unique.   So many ""life sims"" have come and gone in the past few years and none of them delivered anything more than a time management game with lots of clicking ... this is like a business sim done from the POV and  gameplay style of GTA ... you are not a picture in the top left of the screen, you are an ingame character with needs and requirements to sustain your health.

In doing so you can then use your business skills and he tools the world gives you (courtesy of uncle Fred) to start building your first business, and you RUN this business this is a living breathing thing that exists irrespective of whether you are ready for it ... and then you conquer that challenge and you automate by hiring staff and training staff, you spend cash to further enhance the appeal of the premises to customers.

Every shop, is a physical building in the 3D world the player plays in.  You don't use an order form (at first) to get your stock you physically drive to a wholesaler and carry boxes of items you intend to sell to the trunk of your car ... in time you will hire delivery vans, rent a warehouse and automate all this within the simulated world ... hell you will skip the middleman all together and start shipping contracts direct from the suppliers.

The scope and potential for where this little masterpiece can go is measured only by the desire Jonas has to realise it ... honestly this is an Early Access title you don't just buy, but you support because you want to provide the means and feedback and benefit for just how far this rabbit hole can go.   

If you love tycoons and you love management games but you are not impartial to a bit GTA or something similar you would be absolute crazy to not give this a spin given it has a very reasonable pricetag aswell.

This game could well be on its way to a Capitalism Plus tier game if it plays it's cards right, with so much more. It has GTA vibes somehow, sims vibes, it has so many vibes but carves out something that hasn't been seen before. While most games will let you manage one business in this detail, this game lets you manage as many as you want. You can kit out each store how you like it (although, in my opinion this is quite limited in purpose at the moment). The fact you at least initially need to drive around and talk to people and will be doing this the whole time is a very interesting addition to bizsim, sometimes it's just better to take the soda there for today and up the daily delivery. The survival aspect is interesting too, and I think they've made it work really well. Although once I had money coming in I spent an awful lot of time playing video games until enough came in for the next store which seems probably quite realistic if it was a golf course instead ;)

There's a few bugs and only one major bug I encountered so for early access this is a good sign. There is simply so much more that can be added to this framework to make this mind bogglingly good.  At the moment the game is quite easy and would benefit with some real Capitalism style competition trying to beat you out of the markets forcing you to change up your businesses. A nice DLC for resources in a few years is a no brainer. Driving and parking - this was absolutely a masterpiece, so simple but such a part of the game. For me personally, I can't wait for the full release of this and see what other features are coming as this game deserves years more development, all the way into the sun.

I'm kidding (kind of). I love tycoon sims because I like to watch the stonks go zoom and there's something to be said about the repetition of a satisfying gameplay loop. This game scratches that itch up to a certain point, but setting up stores feels way too clunky especially late game. There needs to be a way to pay more in game to streamline this process. Something like a store editor where you can just take the items from an online marketplace, plop them into a miniature model of the store, and have them automatically ordered and moved in by people that you hire.

Hiring also bogs down the gameplay in later stages, I should be able to filter employees by skill level upon hire, again paying extra. Generally in the late game it feels like I have a ton of money but I can't use it to buy time, which is what you're supposed to be able to do when progressing in a game like this. The game attempts to balance this with real estate purchases but it's not satisfying enough to have me spend hours of my life on the frustrating tedium of setting up stores, which gets exponentially worse the more stores you open. I understand the point of the game is supposed to be the magic of ~doing it yourself~ but that magic quickly wears off. I came here to role play as the bootstrap-theoried, hyper-efficient capitalist existing in the fantasies of yesteryear.

Speaking of, if I'm roleplaying a capitalist, I expect to go all the way with it. Let me store money in offshore bank accounts. If I hit a pedestrian on the street I want to get a lawsuit that I settle out of court. I want to hire a PR agency to deal with the fallout of 30 hit and runs in my Ferrari every year. I want Uncle Fred giving me advice on which sleazy hedge fund is about to commit insider trading so I can cash in too. I want to gather with other rich people in the forest and make sacrifices to Canaanite gods.

I'm kidding (unless...?), just throwing out ideas to give the late game more spice. Now that I think about it, the reason I was hesitant to buy this game in the first place is because this developer's other game, Startup Company, had many of these same issues (though to a much more severe degree).

I still give it a thumbs up, the early and mid game is great, and the roadmap gives me a lot of hope. In the most recent update they announced that because of the game's success, money is no longer a restraint. With that being said I fully expect to be able to bribe city council members for future tax breaks. Happy stonking!",1679301412,1679301721,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

As the capitalist chad I am, I can stroll into the bank and ask for a 15k loan and they give it to me on the spot, no questions asked. I'm just like ""hey i've got a great business idea. you know my uncle, right?"" and they are like ""sweet, have some cash, nobody is regulating us anyway lmao. lemme know if you need some more, we've got piles just sitting back there.""

So i use my skills as a natural-born *ontrapanure* to use someone else's money to rent a place for my new business. I buy 3 things: a grill, some burgers, and a cash register. That's all a business genius needs to run a successful restaurant. BOOM. Efficiency. That's a minimally viable product, baby.

Oh right, and I almost forgot, I had to hire some unskilled labor too. I hire a 63 year old man, and I call him at 11:05am to let him know I've decided I want to open the restaurant today, and I've just scheduled him for a 12 hour shift that started 5 mins ago, so he better hustle over here or else I'll fire him.

So he walks into an empty room with a cash register and a box of frozen burger patties. I hand him a spatula and tell him good luck while I prance out to spend the rest of my loan money on blackjack and hookers.

The game is quite entertaining, but after a while it does become amazingly grindy, specially when you move into larger businesses due to the limited amount of items you can carry / wheel / order... So the blueprints are a must down the line.

Same way I imagine it will reach a point were you will become stale, so random events to deal with might be intreresting but hopefully in a proportion that it does not become all you do in the day (or at least something you can set (like a scale)).

I can see room for maybe a few DLC's too, not necessarily more cities, because lets face it, thats the same thing with diferent skin, but extending the production chain from the raw materials up instead of just selling the finishing products could be a way to go. Also relationships / rivalries could be interesting, oposition that would buy the buildings were you operate with the ability to boot you and vice versa..

Either way, already worth the price tag, so all to be added (regardless of what it is) is a bonus.

I haven't read through other reviews, but I imagine I am not the only one that wants a certain system to be reworked. Since most people read negative reviews to get a sense of common issues, if the below puts you off until some updates have landed then my review did its job. If you still want to play the game and shoulder through the build system, you will enjoy this game and you will have gotten your monies worth. That said, here comes my nit-picking review on the single negative thing that makes me want to wait 71 days until the update: 

There are a lot of good things in [b] Big Ambitions [/b] but the item placing system is not one of them. In fact, the item placing system is so badly built/unintuitive, it ruins the fun of opening a retail store from scratch once you have done it a few times. It is better to just sleep your way to profits and buy retail stores that are already established, furnished and staffed. 

Allow me to demonstrate the item placing system by using the number of actions required when placing something down (let us assume it is on a hand truck): 

[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The item is selected. 
[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The 'place' button is clicked on/P is pushed on keyboard. 
[i][b]-----[/b][/i]:- The item is [b]not[/b] rotated (to keep number of actions at the minimum). 
[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The item is placed.  

Seems fairly simple, 3 clicks minimum and you have an item placed. But let's assume you want to furnish your retail store with a row of 5 counters for the checkout tills - the clicks required change since you now need to add 1 more:

:: After placing the first counter:

[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The Hand Truck is clicked. 
[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The counter is selected. 
[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The 'place' button is clicked on/P is pushed on keyboard. 
[i][b]-----[/b][/i]:- The item is [b]not[/b] rotated (to keep number of actions at the minimum). 
[i][b]click[/b][/i]:- The item is placed.   

You now have 4 clicks, minimum, per item you want to place if it is more than 1 (which it almost always is). 

Let's use an actual situation you will encounter to show the tedious system at it's best:

I rent a warehouse, I order 18 shelves (the limit per delivery). 

The next day they arrive, and I load them up on the Hand Truck (I am going to skip the clicks required to enter and exit the building and to load up the hand truck - this alone is 5 trips with 6-7 clicks per trip):

First shelf is 3 clicks, each of the 17 remaining is 4 (without rotations), totalling a fun-killing [b]71[/b] minimum actions required to place down 18 shelves in a warehouse (you need more than 18, much more, and more than 1 warehouse). This is excluding the horrible necessity of moving the camera every single time you want to place another item.  

Want to build a large capacity restaurant with 16 tables, 4 chairs per table, 8 storage shelves, 6 checkout tills, 18 counters, 4 hotdog grills, 4 burger grills, 4 pizza ovens, 4 friers, 4 salad bars, 6 drink fridges, a cleaning station, plants, speakers, pictures, tv... Can you see the issue with the item placement system? If you haven't played the game or seen it being played it is understandably hard to imagine why the system is such a pain, but trust me and my 30+ hours, it is a pain. 

Now, if there was a system where we could order furniture, have it delivered and then access it in a building-specific inventory to make multi-selection/placement easier, great! But right now there isn't. Hell, I don't even mind the Hand Truck loading, that bit is actually fun, but individual item selection and placement is not.  

----------------
---------------- 

That said, this is a great game that you should definitely play if you enjoy business-type games with a little life sim thrown in for good measure (you can turn hunger and energy off in custom games), if you can handle the Early Access tag and all that goes with it. 

----------------

Speaking of Early Access: [b]BUGS[/b]:

Although, if you have read through the stuff above then perhaps you don't really value your time or you just have too much of it. Or, maybe you like to be thorough before purchasing a game... Are you though? If you can sit through my repetitive review, nit-picking a single system (albeit an annoying system), and you are STILL reading, then you are more than capable of dealing with the item placement system and should absolutely get this game. If you're still reading, I would like to thank you for being you, and would like to wish you only the best in life. Still here? Buy the game and **** off already. <3",1679153583,1679247117,False,16,5,0.672919631004333496,0,True,False,True

I loved Startup Company, and have been following the development of this game for a long time.

Initial impressions are great, it's an early access game so I'm looking forward to what the future of this game will bring.

Here is my issue with it: The fact you play a single person in the game is at detriment to what the game could be without it, after only a few hours of play, I found myself just stacking up meals, and literally skipping days in order to generate enough income to do the next thing. In my opinion, you should have the ability to play as more than one character, but also, have those characters automatically managed (auto purchase food etc) so that you can skip forward a few days without it feeling so painfully slow.

You should be able to play as the delivery driver,  the programmer etc, or chose for those people to be automatically managed.

I guess I'm sort of asking for Startup Company but at the big ambitions scale...

I'm honestly looking forward to the future for this game, the core game is clearly there, it just needs expanding on.",1679244747,1679244747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Absolutely incredible game!
You get to be a part of every single parts of an entrepreneur's life! There is a true sense of satifaction starting from nothing, creating businesses, optimising them, creating supply lines, and making them truly autonomous in a large detailed lifelike city! I would say quite realistic too! Gives a great insight into the world of business! 

Obviously this game is is brand new to early access. But that doesn't mean its lacking in content. There's already more here than a lot of newly fully released games. At the moment the game falls off once you get to the point of opening businesses and being able to recruit and buy all staff, furniture and appliances all at once. There are currently limits on how many you can recruit and buy at once. And you still have to micromanage business schedules and bring in new furniture manually.

Once these barriers are broken, the later parts of the game will become a lot more fun.
- I would imagine being able to hire business managers that work with HR managers to deal with staff schedules, would deal with micromanaging schedules.
- Being able to task your delivery drivers to bring new furniture into a building, not just leaving it outside. That would make setting up offices much easier. As well as adding office blueprints / templates. 

I'm so excited for where this game could go, and that's not even including the possibility of modding support! As it stands this is the best business simulator out there. And it can go sooo much further.

The driving around part is well made, and the map looks nice.
 
But I like deep business sims that offer challenge to the point that you can even go bankrupt. Gear City and Mad Games Tycoon 2 are good examples of challenging and really deep business sims. 


The game is missing concepts like brands & brand popularity, competition, customer loyalty, rivalry, negative events (now sometimes a worker gets sick but really it doesn't matter), worker relations, overtime extra, etc. There even could be a health bar, so crashing full speed could put you into a hospital for a while. 

You can abuse the system easily. For example, you can have a single part time worker clean your 24/7 business every 7 hours to keep the cleanliness at 100%.  In reality no one would do that, because it would mean less than 6 hour continuous sleep. 


I hope the devs will work to add some challenge in the game.

Few Thoughts and wishes after  15+ hours in.

Customisation is very bland from custom character to Employee outfits. (Please add separate work outfits from main character in later updates)

Intense Frame drops at Night time. i go from 144FPS (Locked) during the day to 40-60 FPS at night.

Please add in a Blue Print System/Online Delivery system later in the game story. When you reach a point where you can open up numerous Businesses it becomes so tedious driving to one store grabbing 4 items loading it up over and over again, drive across the map and then unloading it over and over again per new business. There has to be a better system in play, because this system right now is driving me up the walls. 

I've noticed my Employee section getting insanely long. Please categorise all the employees a job tab their working at so i can manage them a bit easier.

It's nearly impossible to park the Semi on the road let alone find a space to park it near your business. Roads need to be slightly bigger as well a slight reduction on parked cars near businesses.

There's just not enough Businesses to open. Let alone shortly my businesses are going to be competing at each other. I'd love to see some huge Expansions to businesses as well. Possibly opening up various Game studios, Developing games and owning MMO's that generate income overtime or stepping into the Industrial side of things. i'd love all the businesses to expand in that sense. give us some more playing room and things to do within each business.

Please incorporate a Business Chain system where i can open up the same Business across New York. Got a few coffee shops with the same name with numbers in front of them. Would be cool to link them altogether for warehouse drop offs.

After another 15 hours ill edit this again, but I can't wait to see where this game goes. So Far it's a 6/10 in my books and i imagine it will expand beyond that after a few good updates. Thank you for creating this Game!

The only thing I can do it discard it and just completely waste that 10 grand. Another thing is that I should be able to sell my businesses. Valuation of each individual business should be input into the game so if I ever do not want a certain business anymore, I can just sell it for the valuated amount based on the income of it instead of just ""shutting the business down"" with no compensation.

In the beginning you open a small shop and manually stock it by driving around, carrying each individual box painstakingly to its destination. You then progress, hire employees, set up automatic deliveries to buying your own warehouses with your own trucks and drivers and automatic deliveries. The progression is quite nice. 

There isn't much late game, once you have a few shops that are profitable money just rolls in automatically without having to do anything. And you can spend it on yet more stores, but to what end? The employee system is very barebones, each one is only a slider with no personality. Cashiers will stand behind the counter and that's it. You don't see cleaners, they are just passive attribute. You have part time workers and full time workers but it only has an impact once you have multiple stores, as early game a part timer will easily and willingly work 70+ hour weeks if you just change their schedule every now and then. 

The stores themselves don't take layout into account, so whether you lay out your restaurant efficiently with short ways for the employee, or rather dump everything down brainlessly makes no difference. In fact, being present in any of your stores will drastically reduce your store income due to how customers are spawned and counted.

[i]Big Ambitions[/i], upon first look, seems to reach out and touch the empty place that demise of 90's business management games, such as Pizza Tycoon or Transport Tycoon left in modern gaming landscape.

You have a whole city, you have properties to rent or buy, you can start a business, you can set up a logistics chain to supply the business, so forth. Sounds epic, right?

But it's 2023. Developers have no effin' idea what they're doing. Modern Business management games think that business is about sweeping floors, picking out wallpapers and moving furniture (also see: Gas Station Simulator, Chef, etc), instead of min-maxing expenses and revenue and living a story. Such is the sad case here, as well. The focus and effort went everywhere, but none of it into actually simulating a business.

Thus, you end up running around the city with a handcart, trying to commute and maneuver godawful traffic model in super narrow streets -- where everything, from other cars to simple trash cans -- each weigh as much as a freight ship and thus, stop you car instantly. You keep sleeping on benches, while looking at a clock, because opening and closing time of supply stores was [i]for some unknown, never gave-a-thought-about-it, player-unfriendly reason[/i] fully simulated.... basically 99% of the time you do everything than manage business. Big Ambitions works better as a super annoying parallel parking simulator than an actual business simulator. 

Once again, it's just insane, non-excusable waste of time. The city didn't need free roaming at all. Yes, it's nice to be able to walk around, but it's [b]not what the game should be about[/b]. What should have been just a cool feature, turns out to be absolute majority of the actual game loop.

The actual ""business simulator"" is so bare-bones, pathetic and boring as anything can be: you buy a shelf, and some other pieces of furniture (via painful and dumb logistics task), fill them, get an employee and wait. That's it. That's all. Until stock runs dry, so you get to exercise frustration in navigating the city again. And yes, you can do some of those things via phone, some sort of shortcuts exist, but they feel like a band-aid on what was terrible game design decision to begin with.

Sure, ""it's Early Access,"" you say. ""Things will come."" 

Looking at a roadmap, I don't see ""turning the game an actual business simulator with actually simulated customers, market changes, variety of product types, accounting and such"" anywhere. Just more cosmetics. Electric scooters, whoo! That's what's missing, right?

Not the workers getting sick or stealing, not the rivals and opponents, not the actual simulation of customers (which modern computers can now do) so you'd really fight for each and every one, not any of the things that would actually make a business management interesting.

Why. Just why? What a waste of effort.

But ""wait"" you say. ""One shouldn't review a game based on what it's not or one wished it would be"".

Okay, but what's Big Ambitions then, at current stage?

I am genuinely blown away by Big Ambitions, having played previous games like Startup Company by the same team, I knew roughly what I was getting into and what to expect but I am amazed by the level of depth from such a small team.

The level of depth and intricacy for each business type as well as the delivery & import setup is great and adds multiple levels of micro management while giving the option to add more autonomy as you become successful.

I'm very conscious the game is still in beta and only just released to the public so I'm reluctant to criticise but there are some thoughts or ideas I'd like to share:

Hotkeys/Shortcuts for the UI - It's not a big deal but it'd just make the game feel smoother and a little less clunky if I could have a shortcut for phone contacts or BizMan for example.

Favourite orders - Let me 'save' an order for repeat purchasing, for example every time I want to add an employee I have to add a desk, PC and chair separately which can get tedious after 100-200 employees! Let me save my order of 1 x desk 1 x chair 1 x computer and quickly reorder it as/when needed.

I am only approx. 15 hours into the game at the moment but feel like I'm progressing well, I don't want to say too much more on the game until I've seen 'end-game' but I am overwhelmingly impressed so far. Keep up the great work.",1679155434,1679155434,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You are a sole proprietor, creating a shop with a tiny amount of cash and a dream, while keeping yourself fed and relatively happy. If your boss is ever upset with you, that might be why. However, I think that the game desperately needs modding support, and that should be a much higher priority on the development roadmap. Without it, the game will never feel fully fleshed out, because you can tell that it is in beta. Also, I hope that the devs will refrain from adding new cities to the game, because that just sounds like a time sink. Maybe they could new neighbourhoods to NYC, instead.

This game has a pretty long period of being a low level store manager style game which isn't that fun but as soon as you get a logistics train setup for you business empire it immediately switches to more high level management which is way more fun.
All the while still having the interesting feature of having to control a character who is managing the whole thing, daylight hours are precious, early on you would scoff at paying $250 to deliver furniture to one of your properties, instead driving it yourself, but no real CEO has time to be a delivery boy. Similarly if one of your employees calls in sick early on you'd just cover the shift, like any small business owner, but a true executive has HR managers to hire temp workers for that, you're busy talking to the bank to get another loan or setting up your next burger joint.

One major criticism  is driving around the city, following traffic laws just doesn't work given the time constraints of the gameplay loop, but the AI vehicles are very erratic in their driving and every bump and scrape on your vehicle is money and time going down the drain while you get it fixed.

There is the germ of a truly outstanding game here, and I definitely enjoyed my time with it. So, on that basis, yes, I recommend it.

However, if you're here for a classic Tycoon game, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, a few hours of scratching the surface will reveal that there is very little underneath, it lacks dynamism and simulation in most aspects and the longevity suffers as a result.

It is possible to set up a successful business and never have to touch it again, while watching the money roll in. As a critique of capitalism, it works really well, as once you get beyond a certain size there is nothing to do but waste your money on trinkets and status symbols.

Some fundamentals of retail simulation are missing:
There is no modelling of staff needs - while the player needs food, rest, and happiness, staff are automata, and a full-time staff member will work 50 solid hours in a row without complaint.

While staff have a preference for how many weekly hours they are scheduled, this only serves to turn scheduling into a sliding box puzzle, and as the game doesn't keep track of how many hours someone has worked in a given period, you can shuffle the board to keep them happy without penalty.

Once you've set up a schedule that works, no matter how unrealistic, it stays working.
And no, having random absences doesn't address this.

There is no simulation of customer behavior, the maximum number of customers per hour is the result of a formula, and this formula does a poor job of modelling the realities of the store.

This can be demonstrated by comparing the number of customers per hour your business serves when you're in the store with when you're not.

The game doesn't keep track of how many customers are in the store, nor how long an order takes to fulfill, and if you walk in and out of the store all your customers for that hour will disappear and take their revenue for that hour with them.

Finally, competitors appear to be static. Rival businesses will open and close, but this seems like randomness for randomness' sake, to alter demand for products, rather than as a reaction to anything the player has done.

Their businesses don't appear to have their own revenue, staffing, or stock requirements. Maybe they are modeled under the hood, but given how few of the game's mechanics are systems-driven, I doubt it.

Thankfully, it's just launched in Early Access so there's plenty of time to improve it, and the road-map addresses a few (but not all) of the issues I have.
The developer seems really open to suggestions and keen to make it the best they can, and I truly hope they succeed.",1679097368,1679097368,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

- Change delivery schedules (once, every 3 days, every week) to a day slider 
- Driving mechanics are maybe too fleshed out to be fun (legally parking, getting gas for, and repairing my car is realistic, but not fun)
- Like above, item carry limit (for both character and car) becomes tedious when you need to transport things en masse. Making several trips to the furniture store to future-proof a HQ isn't fun, nor is spending 10 minutes stocking up on food over many trips
- The whole furniture buying experience could (and imo should) be done away with and absorbed into the ""Interior Designer"" tab. Add the chairs, desks, etc into that tab and add a delivery fee. Appliances should remain in-person purchase only though

The game provides a great simulation of what it's like to start from scratch and build a successful business empire in New York City. The game is complex but easy to get into, and there's a lot of freedom in how you approach building your businesses.

I love how the game allows you to start small and gradually work your way up to owning multiple businesses, including supermarkets, law firms, coffee shops, and more. The real estate investment aspect of the game is also a nice touch, and it's satisfying to watch your empire grow as you buy more buildings and expand your operations.

One thing I would like to see in the game is the ability to own and manage hotels. It would add a new dimension to the game and provide more opportunities for players to diversify their businesses. It would also be great to have the option to own a car dealership, as well as more customization options for signs and homes.

Additionally, I think it would be cool if there were more things to do at the owned apartment, such as inviting guests over for social events or throwing parties.

 Overall, I'm really enjoying this game and I think it has a lot of potential for even more immersive gameplay with some of these new ideas.

Overall an amazing base for future development and I think even if the core systems aren't drastically improved and made more obvious/intuitive to the user, (I expect they will be in many areas however) even just expanding what's already here would be a good value proposition for the game. Already happy I invested in its future development, and I'm probably still reasonably early on in the game, with more concepts to be introduced.

The pros:
* Excellent scheduling system for management of opening hours & designing employee shifts
* You can customize uniforms and logos for each business, and there's already a reasonable bare bones level of logos and clothes types available
* Managing employee needs already has bonuses and penalties, and can cause employees to quit. This feels like it might be reasonably expanded further in the future, too.
* Logistic support integrated, or early on you can drive supplies around, and this mostly feels like an engaging part of the simulation.
* Many systems are immersed in the game world through actual businesses, so while you have a lot of control you could conceivably exercise through your phone available in menus, you still have to physically visit areas to set up relationships with other businesses, make orders, etc, which makes it feel very grounded in the world and enhances a sense of place- the game very clearly IS New York, it's not just hypothetically set there.
* The licensed soundtrack is already really good and feeds into the sense of place, it has track fast forward, and it actually plays through speakers you place down or your car radio, excellent use of gameplay mechanics. Could possibly do with pause and track rewind/fast forward too at some stage, but it's already really good as-is.
* All tasks involving waiting can be fast-forwarded or time-warped through, whether it's working a shift, playing games in your game, getting a proper sleep ingame, or snoozing on a bench while you wait for a store to open.

Mixed/improves with gameplay:
* The car driving system feels very clunky at first, but this is mostly because more expensive cars are more responsive. This is a good reward for succeeding in business so should stay, but it would be good if there was some minor auto-assist on keeping straight in a lane to stop you from constantly having to fine adjust, and if there were audio cues on traffic lights, as driving and walking are big parts of the game. There's a trade-off between sticking with the very cheap vehicle while you learn how to drive and upgrading to a very expensive one where you'll find it easier to avoid bumps and crashes. I absolutely recommend trying a middle-range car before dunking on the driving controls.
* The sense of integration of place makes you feel like you're in a top-down driving simulator sometimes, but this may ease as apparently there are dev plans to add a chauffeur mode? (You can also flag a taxi if you don't need to pick up large amounts of goods at your destination and just need to talk to someone on the other side of the city, which fast-forwards the driving)
* Some mechanics feel very story mode only, like taking courses in business school. I'd like to see that actually do things that affect your character in game in the future.
* Service businesses (offices) don't offer anything to the player at the moment. It would be cool and enhance that integration of sense of place if you could self-market to a degree with web design, that you might want lawyers for negotiating contracts and dealing with your competitors attemts to undermine your business, dealing with HR disputes, etc...
* A lot of places are parked out at various times making it very hard not to damage your vehicle, which is good as it means you can't always expect to park right outside your destination and may need to weigh up large volume of purchases against ferrying items to your car by hand truck, but it would be nice if there was a bit more scope for coming back later if you want to park a particular car in a particular place. Often once a car is parked in an area it stays for the whole day. Very commercial areas should empty out late at night, and residentials ones during work hours. It would also be good if some rental or purchased apartments came with a reserved park.
* Some of the mechanics are not yet well tutorialized, such as walking in the park, so this needs further work. (which also in reality is also more like ""sleeping on park benches to get happy,"" haha! I'd like to see the counter actually increment faster if you walk rather than sleep so that there's more of a tension between energy and happiness, rather than going to a park bench for both)

The cons:
* The UI is a huge mixed bag. Some elements are great, others are hidden in particular businesses' menus and extremely unintuive to access even if they work well while you're there, hopefully more things get top level menus in the future.
* Banks are completely separate and don't impact on each other- would like to see a greater loan cap at any one bank, but that they take into account your loans with other banks before agreeing. Right now each bank can give you $40k if you qualify.
* Full time and part time employees are strict desires and you can't advertise your expectations of a full-time or part-time role when making a vacancy available at all, you just get randomly surprised with them. This should happen to a degree but it's too far out of your control at the moment.
* The happiness mechanic doesn't seem fully implemented yet, as there's no way to max it out day-to-day, only by hitting side-goals and story goals simultaneously. It feels like there's one more method to increase happiness still under development or in the to-do list.
* It can be hard to see where you need to clean when doing it manually, it'd be great if we could have an overlay that made it a bit more obvious where the dirt is after picking up a mop.
* Loans feel way too powerful and should probably be more of a double-edged sword, at least in the early game.
* Products and businesses currently feel very bare bones and samey after you set up your unique equipment for each business, so will likely benefit hugely from further development and small mechanical differences being implemented for more businesses. This may also be because a lot of the actual variation that's there is too subtle and not obvious to the player- for instance some businesses are much more impacted by employee skills like customer service, but unlike with not employing enough sales staff or not supplying enough interior items, customers won't yet complain that the staff member wasn't skilled enough as far as I can see, hopefully this is in a future patch.",1679089216,1679089216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-More businesses types, 
-More models for cars and characters, 
-Nicer furnitures should give a bonus to happiness (that way we would need to decorate our apartment not just for cosmetics - and this should be true for businesses as well, especially offices!),
-Interactions with NPCs - New York feels empty and shallow, people only appear in stores when you go in, if you leave and go back in, it will be empty again. 
-More places to visit and spend money, like Dance Clubs, Country Clubs, and if we are able to interact with NPCs, maybe add a few unique NPCs which we can befriend/romance, and a few rivals as well,
-And if we do get more stuff to do on our free time, we need a slower timescale. Sure, the timescale is fine right now, but once we get more things to do, it's going to be a struggle to do everything we want in a day.

And even with all those 'flaws' and suggestions... The games already feels good to play, it's hard to stop, I'm always like ""Just one more day so I can do this last thing"". I've played 10h on the same savegame, and I feel like I'm so far away from owning a big yacht (which are in the game by the way, though I don't know how they function, since I'm too poor lmao). And I mean it, a yacht costs millions of dollars, and I'm making like 13k a day (and spending a lot restocking my warehouse).

If you like tycoon games, you'll definitely love this, especially if you also enjoy life sims. Granted, you only need to eat and sleep, and like I said, there's no interactions with NPCs, except with store clerks, but the tycoon part of the game, managing your businesses and making sure your warehouse is always filled with enough products to deliver to your stores is pretty damn fun.

Did not get any crash, that's a big plus for EA game. Storymode was nice, but started hard custom game afterwards. Much harder than storymode, but when playing with head it is worth it.

At some points you want to skip for few days and content still lacks some features, like, when placing object in shop or caffe, it would be nice to be able to choose color etc. But I really hope that they will come and there will be more variety of content and actions to do, when you have settled business and wait to get autoordering of goods in place.

I really would like to configure some triggers, like in caffe there is less than x donuts or something like that, that would allow me not to micromanage things even when purchase agents and logistics managers are getting autoorders. HR schedule autofill does not work. it does not take into account things like peak hours etc, which would be nice if, let's say 80+ experience HR would do better than HR with less experience. for now it is just mathematical calculations and in most cases sundays are without workforce :)

Big Ambitions expertly fuses the engrossing gameplay of Grand Theft Auto, minus the crime, with the streamlined life management reminiscent of The Sims series. The game's business mechanics closely mirror my most favourite expansion pack to The Sims, Open for Business. Set in a faithfully recreated New York, Big Ambitions offers enthralling day-to-day challenges for fans of business simulation games.

There's immense promise here, but there are areas that could use improvement based on my initial gameplay experience. The addition of WASD movement support for character navigation would greatly enhance playability. While the focus on running a business is engaging, the game could benefit from more diverse activities to fully utilize its beautiful rendition of New York. Expanding the options for exploration and leisure, allowing players to become virtual tourists, would truly elevate the experience.",1679048835,1679049352,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Go from nothing to the biggest entrepreneur in New York by opening small businesses or slowly building huge corporations any way you like."" I say... This game is really entertaining and addictive! As a business building sim, you get a lot of management tools and AI workers to help you start and build up your businesses.

My NGR (New Game Release) (after playing over 20 hours), review is during early access at 2023 03 17 (build 1714), and I think things can only get better from here on in. The game has already surpassed my expectations with its complex and in-depth gameplay. You have a lot of control over your businesses and can make strategic decisions to maximize your profits and grow your empire.

The game has a beautiful cartoon-esk cityscape that creates a sense of immersion and charm. The soundtrack is also fantastic, providing a calming and atmospheric backdrop to the gameplay. Additionally, the music is specially written for the game and is DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) free of copyright, so Youtubers and streamers can leave the in-game radio music on if they wish! Double-check this before you use the music though!

One of the things I really like about 'Big Ambitions' is the small variety of business types already available, and I'm sure there will be more to come. You can upgrade your buildings, hire more workers, and expand your reach into new territories. The possibilities are endless, it's fun to do some experimentation and creative problem-solving in the game.

Overall, 'Big Ambitions' is an excellent game that's well worth your time and money. Whether you're a fan of business sims or just looking for a fun and engaging game to play, this one definitely delivers. I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for future updates!

At NGR I’m not trying to cover all the New Game Releases for every new game released, just the ones I like to play. If you get to know me and trust my opinions, I’m sure you’ll love to hear what I have to say about the next game you are thinking of buying, when you’re reading the review of it below the game. I only review a game if I like it, so it's mostly going to be a positive review, and only after I’ve played either the whole prologue or demo or sunk at least 10 hours into the game.  NGR.

My favorite aspects of the game:
- You can rent an apartment
- You can own AND DRIVE all types of cars!!!
- Driving is tedious but fun! and you want to drive safely as your car has a health bar that lowers when you crash into things, but it gets you places faster, lets you load up more supplies and furniture, and you can buy really nice ones. You have to be careful where, and how, you park because there are legal and illegal ways
- You can pick out your business building
- You have to go to different stores to buy products and furniture for each specific business. My favorite part about this is you have to go into the store, pick out what you want and go up to the cashier to buy it
- You can name your business, design your logo, design our sign, and set your prices
- Hiring employees and scheduling them is detailed and strategic
- You can design the interior of your business and apartment
- You have to clean your business (you can hire employees for this)

I'm just getting into the game so far, I've only put 4 hours into it but it's highly addictive. The gameplay loop is satisfying and I appreciate all the details.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+ A lot of realistic things are simulated very well in this. Notably, warehouse management and minimum orders are very life-like, though some would say that's an inconvenience. Customer service at retail vs F&B places is also realistically different in efficiency, which is a nice touch.

+ Performance is decent, I won't say it's amazing, cause I had to turn settings down a little on my 3070 and i7 2.3GHz, but it runs just fine.

+ Content is at a good level, for early access. Most early access titles suck at delivering enough content so by simply being decent, it gets my seal of approval.

+ Overall you got a lot of tools to play around with. Automation of supply chain, customizing of homes and business interiors, vehicles, even custom games with preferred settings.

+ Gameplay loop isn't boring, unless you're a sweaty gamer and are just trying to earn fat stacks by day 100.

+ You can pretty much buy any building or business in the map currently with the exception of the IRS. If you're a completionist like me and wanna take over every business and property, this is great news.

+ Tutorial is good, and is played out like your hip uncle helping you get on your feet. Also good voice acting there, which is a nice bonus.

+ Things about the world change as you operate. Putting up billboard ads for a business actually shows your business logo on billboards across the city.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
- The game map is a little small right now. When they state ""New York"", it's really only like half of Manhattan at best.

- Balance in this game is kinda wack. F&B gets dunked on by every other type of business, and there seems to be no way around this due to how sales work in this game. Inversely, you could say that clothing stores and law firms are ridiculously efficient, seemingly being unrealistically so.

- Driving makes me want to eat drywall and acquire extra chromosomes. It is just so poorly implemented. Cars handle like crap with no smooth turning, and your camera is locked facing forward even though you don't use your mouse to do anything while in a vehicle. You gotta constantly tap left and right in order to go straight due to how jerky the turns are. Last but not least, PARKING. Attempting to parallel park on a busy road is the primary reason why I bring my vehicle for repairs once a week. The veterans out there will say ""buy a car with auto-park"", but auto-park literally doesn't register a parking spot as valid if it is TOO BIG. Auto-park only allows you to park squeezing between two cars that you'd not be able to realistically parallel park between.

- AI drivers in this game are programmed to destroy your vehicle with killing intent. They do not give you any room to manoeuvre, and constantly inch forward until they are like half a meter behind you. Why is this a problem? Because if you get stuck, or are in the middle of parallel parking, they're gonna box you in, up till the point where you got no choice left but to trade paint with them. They also have no idea how to move around obstructions, or even reverse. I tested this by blocking every lane of a major highway with a line of pushcarts and yep. I created a traffic jam that went on for like 5 city blocks.

- Highways do not disappear when you drive under them. Which means you have a 50-50 chance of crashing your car everytime you pass under one.

- You have the option to travel on foot with WASD, but it treats it like you're using a controller, rather than a keyboard, so it begins highlighting everything as you walk past it. It got so annoying that I went back to point-and-click movement. So basically, you cannot move using WASD, end of story. 

- I honestly don't know why they even give you an option to walk, but it creates a bug where after I finish working a shift, I'm walking again and have to reset my default run speed.

- A lot of mechanics are very esoteric and have little to no explanations given in the F1 menu. Things like minimum order are not explained clearly at all, and it took me like 30 minutes of creating and cancelling orders to figure out why it wasn't working.

[h1]Suggestions[/h1]
- There's not much for you to do on foot. I know it's a big part of the game, that you have to go do stuff yourself but it's all just chores and other insignificant tasks. I'd rather it just be removed from the game and we play it like a city builder instead with no player character instead. Managing things like hunger and happiness feel kinda boring and very few players would actually bother with those mechanics, since there is no incentive to stay at 100% happiness. All you do is stay above 0%.

- You can only have 18 packages delivered to your building at any one time, including from multiple stores. This makes no sense, since there's tons of pavement. Why can't we just fit more pallets? There's hardly any pedestrians using the roads anyway.

- There is currently no way to change Foot Traffic on properties. I feel like there should be a way to do so, especially since hotspots change all the time depending on what's going on in the area. The inability to affect foot traffic is like 50% of the reason why F&B sucks in this game, and every other business type dominates it.

- We need more business types in the game. There's not enough business types right now, to the point where if your goal is to take over every business and property in the map, you'll have like 5-6 of your own businesses competing with one another in every district.

- Investments grow too slowly. Honestly, it's so slow it barely even feels worth putting any money in. I'm currently trying to grow $50m which in real life would be a massive investment, and I'm doing it on the highest volatility plan. In the 120 days since I first invested, it has moved 0.02%. And that's not going up and down, it's been going up steadily the whole time, day by day. Pitiful.

- There is no taxi company, so you can't call a cab. While you can find cabs everywhere in the Garment District, there are like 0 taxis in the Midtown area, so you're kinda stuck. Give us a taxi company.

- There should be more options when putting out recruitment campaigns. If I don't want anybody with miscellaneous requirements like ""No evening shifts"" or ""Clean work environment"", or I just don't want part-timers, I should be allowed to specify that. After all, people already do this in real life.

- There needs to be more specialty buildings spread out across town. I want to move to a nicer apartment, but refuse to because the starting apartment in the Garment District is the closest to the Gas Station, Ika Bohang (IKEA), Square Appliances, wholesalers, and AJ Pedersons. I have literally no reason to rent another house except for the questline telling me to do so. On that note, that is only ONE Ika Bohang, and ONE Gas Station in the whole map. That is a huge problem.

- There needs to be a way to tell how many vehicle bays a warehouse has before buying it. This is critical information.

- After buying out two businesses, I'm no longer sure I want to buy any more. Paying $1.6m for a business that's only generating $2'000 in revenue daily is pathetic. Can we please get a rebalance on this

- I'd like the option to move furniture that is being used by one of my employees. I understand not being able to disassemble the set, but surely I should be able to just move the whole thing wholesale?

- A phonebook. We have gaming PCs and google maps, but we can't get the number of a business unless we physically drive down and talk to the manager. This is pretty dumb honestly, and it's clearly just there cause the devs wanted to squeeze gameplay out of it.

•More competitive with rival businesses. 
•Offers to buy parts of your businesses by competitors.
•Multifloor building to buy/rent
•Possibility of setting up a mall/shopping center.
•Even more business avenues such as more shops, office jobs, maybe bring in a gym option, sports facilities ie own a sports team....
The options are literally limitless with a game like this and with such a strong foundation to build upon. I'd be happy buying dlc for a game like this that's for sure.

As of this review its in extremely early access
Good Stuff
-Cool freedom, easy to get addicted... i mean... ""immersed in the gameplay loop"" :)
-Sights and sounds are good enough
-Business sim side isnt too micromangement heavy at all!  It may be a little TOO simplistic for some but for me the porridge is just right
-Tutorial is deep enough and offers lots of helpful tips. Definitely not a waste as some tutorials are!

Bad stuff
-Driving (moving in general) is annoying
-On this issue... dont see a way to fast travel either (but most of what you need is pretty close to you!)
-On that issue... the city is a bit empty (but it will likely fill out as early access develops!)
-The many different business options that seemed so numerous that it was too good to be true... maybe a little so far.  As I said running a business is pretty light in this game.
-The ""life sim"" aspect is extremely light.  May not be a bad thing based on your tastes... but it WAS pushed fairly hard on the Steam page with words like ""incredibly in depth"" and ""life sim on steroids"" being used.  I wont lie... the idea of playing The Sims with a much deeper business side was running thru my mind but that is not a reasonable expectation at this time. 
 That aspect needs a lot of work for those phrases to take hold and be true.  I'd say more personal relationships, entertainment, and skill based activities would be a great start, In fact any way to spend money and time in between work and sleep would be crucial but I'd be shocked if these changes are not planned.  

I've still got a lot to see and learn but I wanted to let those on the fence know its a solid start!

Few downsides to me:
One is that you just run out of stuff to do after a while. You eventually find a rhythm and can open store after store fairly quickly, and from there you're just stuck in this constant loop of opening stores with no end goal. 

A small thing would also be the management of workers. If I am in early game I want to train my workers customer service experience, I have to un-assign them from a business, then reassign them and their hours again manually. Also on the note of employees, after you begin to have a lot of employees, your MyEmployees app just shows you a large list of your workers with no easy way of filtering them, meaning you have to scroll through multiple employees to find the ones you want to manage. Perhaps there should be some kind of 'filter by business' option?

The next one is probably logistics. It gets real tiring having to micromanage what I purchase from partners when certain stuff gets low in just one store. I find that the stuff that sells quickly is cheap, so I have to fill my orders with random junk to meet the minimum spent to ship to my warehouses. Also, if I am paying somebody to do logistics and another to purchase stuff, why can't they understand when one of my businesses is running low on something, to just automatically buy more? Yes, there exists the setting to auto order stuff after 1, 3 or 7 days, but again, you will just fill your warehouses with stuff that doesn't sell as quickly as other products.

My last thing would be a little quality of life improvement. I want to be able to filter by full-time or part-time employees when hiring them. Do I seriously want to hire a full-time cleaner? or have to manage two part-time workers and one full-time worker for a store that I want to be open for weekends, evenings etc without having to hire an abundance of workers.

Other than that, the game is incredibly fun and I would highly recommend people give it a go. It's not too easy and it is a little tedious, but hey, this game more than makes up for it.",1678946807,1678959872,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,3,True,False,True

I bought this game and I forgot it running so I couldn’t get it refunded, that is the ONLY reason I am giving this  game a negative feedback, I usually don't do feedback at all if I don't like a game, this might actually be my first review!?

(I am comparing this to real life because that is the only thing I can compare this to)

This game will be garbage for anyone that loves logic and common sense, you're a multi-millionaire but you can't hire someone to deliver and place the furniture inside your buildings. You can't have any employees until you have finished a pretend business school, while in the real world some of the best businesspeople only graduates 9th grade before they became a hard working person and has made billions of dollars. (Warren Buffett)

if you want one single can of soda you have to use a cart and it is delivered in a paper bag, stop filling the pretend world with garbage, think about the climate. ✌️

You have millions of dollars but you can't hire someone to drive you around. 
When you buy the 99 million dollar mega yacht you learn that it's just an e-peen, you can't enter the ship, it just sits there and lets you speed up time, it's more useless than a first generation Apple watch

[b] The devs need to order the book: [u] intuitive UI for dummies. [/u] [/b]

 [b] Conclusion:  [/b] if you like the exciting things in life like watching paint dry, or you like being told by a game that you must use a shopping cart to buy a single can of soda, you have to pretend call a store to order stuff (no internet in this game so if you have to step back one step to double check your address the items on your list is deleted) this is 5/5 stars (perfect) for you. 

If you're not a boomer and don't care that your character is being controlled by an unseen force micro managing every move you make and that playing this game might result in brain damage you will probably love this game. 

PS; The UI in this game is literally next generation suckage!

I'd acquired my first business after discovering the severe limitations to what you can do in your apartment and around town, and working my first job in an experience that felt a little like a mobile game (watch as you just stand there while customers move past your till, or click a button to speed to the end of the shift - fortunately without some cost for doing so).  

I got my first car and did not enjoy the experience of driving to the store to furnish my business.  It was strangely difficult to get the car to go straight and the inevitable accident I got into did nothing.  When I got to the appliance store I was disappointed to see I had to buy each item on my list one at a time, heading to the cashier and then out to my car for each thing.  This was in spite of a UI that seemed designed to handle multiple items.  I might have missed the method for doing that, but I clicked on each item I wanted only to arrive at the cash with one and one only.  When I went out to my car to put the counter I bought in the trunk the store closed for the day before I could go back in for item #2.  Oops.  Time to go home and sleep for 15 hours until the store opens again, because I have nothing else to do in my free time except buy the single grocery item or grab a hot dog.

I explored the town on foot a bit.  Central Park is inaccessible and there are ""road closed"" barriers at the map edges.  Again, understandable.  There's little enough in the playing area as it is, so furnishing all of Manhattan would be pointless until the game has more content.

No part seems particularly ""draggy"", everything seems to have the right amount of drag and grind to keep it fun.

I am addicted to this game at 20hrs. I have restarted the main campaign 3 times because uncle Frank is not helpful. My advice is every time he suggests something, tick it all off and then minimize him until you have that milestone fully established and profitable. 

This game is truly a gem. I am loving the feeling of going from nothing to a big business mogul.

However, I do feel though that now I have a few businesses making a decent profit, that the incentive to continue to millionaire+ status is currently not really there. So I can buy a bigger apartment? A faster car? Why, when I already have a tv and computer giving me 75% happiness per day? 

The incentive I create for myself is that I want to own everythinggg, but I am sure more reasons to get bigger will come. This is only an ea game and the dev has already largely nailed a concept which hasnt really been explored before. Excited to see what comes of this",1678558262,1678922736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, this game offers little to no dynamics/depth further down the line and quickly runs out of content and falls into a simple gameplay loop of setting up store, delivieries, making sure it works well and going onto setting up another store.
To be truly successful this game needs more challenge, dynamics, depth, content and quality of life changes. 
Assuming devs do everything right, this game has really great potential.

I give this game a thumbs up because despite it being early access and seeming like early beta / late alpha, I have a lot of fun with it. 
However, if you expect polished and in-depth Tycoon game, right now this game is not it. 

[h1]List of changes I would like to see in the game relatively soon:[/h1]
1. Option to progress longer periods of time without micro-managing buying groceries and eating food. For example, going on a weekend/week/2 weeks/monthly vacations or whatever
2. More statistics and ""issue feedback"" (for example, don't tell me there is no product in shop. Tell my why it's not delivered from warehouse!)
3. Filtering employees and businesses
4. Separate threads in contacts for recruitment per each store; alternatively overhauling entire recruitment process
5. More analytics (could be implemented as in-game paid service or hireable worker) on demand, optimal prices etc. Also more clarity when set prices are too low/too high
6. When prices are too low, volume sold doesn't seem to increase. It should
7. Store managers to automate managing stores

For $23 bucks, the game is worth it if you're into a ""The SIms-Lite"" Capitalism simulator. The city feels alive, which is shocking, with only minor complaints (ie When you leave a store that's full of people then walk back in, it's completely empty and people start streaming in). But all of it is either something that isn't a big enough deal to matter, or could possibly be fixed later on in development. 

I'm going to play a lot more of this game, no question, but I also wanted to give a quick shout out to the quality of the radio in the game (Not a TON of songs but at least they are actually songs) and also: Whoever did the voice over for your uncle in story mode was not paid enough, he is an incredible voice actor!

This game is great until you get far enough in. Setting up a large shop once is all I could stand. I opted for a super large clothing store. This meant I ended up needing 48 clothing racks. That alone was a lot. There is no way to mass move items to the new store and orders from the appliance store only go up to 18 total boxes. I wasnt about to wait 3 days to get everything inside, not counting the other stuff like speaker, registers, storage shelves, etc. 

This forced me to buy the largest truck I could find and I didnt want to move things 4 at a time, so I took a hand cart from IKEA so I could move 6 things at a time. 

Only being able to hand truck 4 things at a time is a massive hassle. There's no system in place currently that would move everything off the street and into the building. It's even worse if its an office building and there is no hand cart to move boxes inside. You have to go to a nearby retail shop and steal one.

Purchasing agents dont seem to auto purchase for you either. I tried each interval for purchase but I always ran out and when an order was placed for me, it only came from a single purchasing agent, maybe two. 

Id still put this game as a buy for the early game up to when you get into law offices and web design firms. 

I'm not sure where this game is headed in the future. I just hope it includes an inventory for office furniture and improved purchasing agents. Place an order and it all gets put into the store inventory. Then you can enter a system like interior decorator mode, but for furniture placement.",1678879464,1678879464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- The camera needs a lot of work: no camera move in cars that i could find, and the angle is too steep. Would be nice for a first-person view, but that's just an aside.

First off, the game offers a lot of fun and engaging gameplay. You get to run multiple businesses and make all sorts of decisions, from importing burgers to hiring lawyers. It's a real challenge to balance everything and make a profit, but it's also very satisfying when you succeed.

However, if you're looking for a classic Tycoon game, you might be a bit disappointed. There are some missing fundamentals of retail simulation, such as running an HQ from an office instead of running around and customer behavior. And while the competition does open and close, it seems to be more random than based on anything you've done.

That being said, the game still has a lot of potential. The developer is very open to feedback and has already addressed some of the issues players have brought up. And since it's in Early Access, there's plenty of time to make improvements and refine the game.

I don't know why some people are eulogising about this like it's the second coming of Christ because, well, at the moment it's not. Certainly it's quite addicting but i don't see the challenge yet. It's a fairly straightforward mix of earn money, buy upgrades, make more money, with nothing really getting in the way or provoking real thought. Yes there are zones, and they're all slightly different, foot fall etc but hey, pretty simple stuff.

Now i'll qualify this by saying i did so much of the tutorial before i got pi$$ed with being told what to do time and again but it's important to learn the mechanics and the tutorial is good for that. I then started a new game, on my own, starting from scratch and am building up. Therefore you should know there is a lot more content in the game that i've not touched yet - supply chains etc - and for an EA game there is much more content that other EA games out there. which is why it's more of a positive review than negative.

There are a few annoyances such as the way shops are populated with insane numbers of people spawned in at the very moment you enter, and always immediately getting ahead of you in queues etc. Quite immersion breaking as well but hey, it's EA and i expect to see crap like that polished up in time so it is what it is. It's not  perceived annoyances such as this which form the basis of the review though - it really just seems like a very easy game based on the core mechanics, which is troublesome to see how that can improve over time but maybe it will.

There is the germ of a truly outstanding game here, and I definitely enjoyed my time with it. So, on that basis, yes, I recommend it.

However, if you're here for a classic Tycoon game, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, a few hours of scratching the surface will reveal that there is very little underneath, it lacks dynamism and simulation in most aspects and the longevity suffers as a result.

It is possible to set up a successful business and never have to touch it again, while watching the money roll in. As a critique of capitalism, it works really well, as once you get beyond a certain size there is nothing to do but waste your money on trinkets and status symbols.

Some fundamentals of retail simulation are missing:
[list]
[*]There is no modelling of staff needs - while the player needs food, rest, and happiness, staff are automata, and a full-time staff member will work 50 solid hours in a row without complaint.

While staff have a preference for how many weekly hours they are scheduled, this only serves to turn scheduling into a sliding box puzzle, and as the game doesn't keep track of how many hours someone has worked in a given period, you can shuffle the board to keep them happy without penalty.

Once you've set up a schedule that works, no matter how unrealistic, it stays working.
And no, having random absences doesn't address this.

[*]There is no simulation of customer behaviour, the maximum number of customers per hour is the result of a formula, and this formula does a poor job of modelling the realities of the store.

This can be demonstrated by comparing the number of customers per hour your business serves when you're in the store with when you're not.

The game doesn't keep track of how many customers are in the store, nor how long an order takes to fulfil, and if you walk in and out of the store all your customers for that hour will disappear and take their revenue for that hour with them.

Spoiler: [spoiler]Your business does far better when you're not there, which kills the fun and challenge of laying out your store to maximise throughput.[/spoiler]

[*]Finally, competitors appear to be static. Rival businesses will open and close, but this seems like randomness for randomness' sake, to alter demand for products, rather than as a reaction to anything the player has done.

Their businesses don't appear to have their own revenue, staffing, or stock requirements. Maybe they are modelled under the hood, but given how few of the game's mechanics are systems-driven, I doubt it.

BA has a great foundation and, performance wise, runs great at 4k max settings. The set-up is pretty basic as far as the story goes, but the management and quasi-life-sim gameplay loop works well, and has an addictive quality to it. Though, many areas are quite shallow in depth, even if one could spend tens of hours in the game already: character customization, building customization, business variety and product variety are all very limited in choice, which is something I really hope the developer expands on in each update. However, even though parts of the game are extremely limited, the gameplay mechanics, as well as gameplay loop, are tight and fun in its current rendition. Thus, BA gets a score of 10/10 for how well it executes a life-sim / tycoon management blend that works wonderfully in such an early stage in development.

But playing it, I realized that this game deserves the positive reviews. I managed to play over 14 hours within 2 sessions, which is big for me. Game is actually good. You go from working 8 hours at a supermarket to raking in over 10k daily by doing nothing and you actually feel the progress you're making throughout the game. At first you're painstakingly driving to wholesalers to buy goods from them and stock your store yourself while manning the counter; after a while you hire a HR manager for your headquarters and you let them take care of employee training and scheduling, you hire a purchasing agent to import goods for your warehouses and a logistics manager to stock your stores as well as handling warehouse drivers. There are expensive vehicles, property and furniture to spend your hard earned money which is quite enough for the current EA state.

Now as for cons, my earliest frustration was due to UI and camera. Camera can be unpredictable and you might end up misclicking on another building. The fixed camera you get while driving a car also causes you to crash into cars that you are simply unable to see. As for the UI, the mini window that appears when you hover over a building might stick around for a while and block you from clicking the building you were intending to click on. There are also some bugs, the biggest is when you are placing furniture, you might suddenly be unable to move. I got around it by entering and exiting interior designer or grabbing/packing a furniture. Another nitpick of mine would be is that there aren't enough pedestrians in the streets and the city is too quiet.

However, my biggest disappointment with this game is that there are some clearly good and bad choices for the types of businesses. Fast food restaurants and coffee shops had tiny profit margins for me. I opened them in districts with high demands for their items, diversified the available items they sold, rented shops with high foot traffic, maxed out advertisement, decorated the store, trained workers etc. Nothing worked. Whereas with an undecorated gift store that had 11% foot traffic, I was clearing 1-2k profit daily thanks to expensive gifts. I also listened to a comment I saw on discussions and opened a medium sized florist shop in a rich district with decent demand for the flowers and after maxing out my workers and decorating it nicely, I was earning over 10k daily from it. I didn't look into them heavily, but office businesses aren't that profitable either yet they do better than most retail businesses

There is a lot of depth to this game that allows you to interact with objects, etc., and the UI just gets in the way. Even if you look at your shelf from a certain distance, there is a fly out that comes out that covers a good portion of the screen.

However I would describe this game as being 90% a walking/driving simulator and 10% actual business simulation. You have to drive/walk around to do basically everything in-game. It's so tedious to have to spend all day going from one shop/agency to another to buy your stock, furniture, and to hire staff. If you forget something from one shop that's essential to run your business, you'll have to spend 2-3 minutes (actual minutes, not in-game) going all the way back, picking it up, checking it out, etc - very frustrating and not at all fun. In 2.5 hours of play I have still only barely scratched the surface of the actual simulation (namely, hiring two locations, with an extremely basic setup of one shelf, one product type, and one staff member each) because so much time is wasted just getting around.

Having a car to run around town does help BUT you are massively disincentivised from using it as each little bash into another car/bollard etc reduces its condition, and it will presumably eventually break completely. After one hour in-game my car is down to 30% condition! So I end up doing as much as possible on foot which takes AGES.

I'm hoping that after another several hours, you don't have to spend the entire time just running/driving around, but honestly I don't have the patience to persevere with the game to find out.

I have some other relatively minor gripes:
1) there's no WASD support when you are on foot, so you have to click and hold down in the direction you want to move in. Mildly annoying for most people, but for people with arthritis like me (yes people under 30 can have arthritis too) it's actually physically painful to play this game.
2) the female protagonist looks like she's been designed by somebody with no knowledge of female human anatomy. Enormous bolt-on breasts much too high on the chest, on a physique that would otherwise belong to a man.

However, there are a few quirks in the game that make it an annoying trudge such that I  can't recommend buying it at this time.  The biggest annoyances are the total lack of camera control and an impossibly woeful lack of zoom control.  The player is stuck with a fixed top down POV that has a bizarre field of view.  The FOV is so narrow that the player can only see what's going on in an approximate 10 meter radius. He can't look left of right without turninghis body 90 degrees.  You can't move the camera down for a more horizontal POV.  The game is supposed to be challenging but  poorly designed camera control is not a feature, it is a bug or just bad coding.  I'm leaning toward the latter because character tracking is also a mess.  The character is either permanently drunk or walking, running or driving a vehicle in a straight line is not possible.  The character yaws to the right when using the ""W"" key to move ""straight"" ahead.  If it were an aircraft I'd say the yaw damper has failed.

If the Dev fixes these issues I will revisit the review.  For now I'll thank Col. Failure for a humorous and entertaining series featuring the game but as for buying it - no.  I can't recommend buying the game unless the buyer enjoys poor execution of a game with a very interesting premise as a form of entertainment.",1678735922,1678735922,False,4,0,0.495691359043121338,0,True,False,True

Just imagine this game with a more in-depth life system and custom items and businesses.

THE REVIEW:
After many hours playing this game, and neglecting my wife and 6 month old daughter... YES BUY IT! This game is so addicting. I go to sleep thinking of ways to improve my business posture. I love it. The devs did a great job in EA. What is also cool is they have a road map with planned features and let you know when the next patches will be on the main menu! I would love more clothing options with every color possible. I would also like the option to actually change the color of objects that I buy to match the theme of my stores. Having more facial options, and hairstyle for black people too! Haha and why cant males have Chuck Taylor shoes like females? :( Why can we buy clothes in stores and put them in our wardrobe? haha just nit picking sorry. iPhones, iPads, laptops.. so many ideas to add into this game! I cant wait for the traffic/ticket system.. (Done ranting) Also having a multi store like Amazon would be cool also, or like a Walmart. Vacation options in other countries, or multi international business for global takeover would be awesome too! If the chance to have a family comes THIS WOULD BE THE SIMS KILLER! BUY THIS GAME!

The tutorial, called ""story mode,"" takes dozens of hours and offers little freedom.

In order for my office to function fully, I need 50 working desks and at least 50 lawyers. For one ""working"" desk, I need a desk, a chair, and a computer, which I have to buy from a furniture mall (like IKEA). There are two ways to purchase items: offline or online.

The offline way requires me to physically walk around the mall, grab the items (I can only buy 8 items at a time), load them into my car (which can hold a maximum of 20 items), drive to my office, manually pull them out of the trunk one by one, and then place them in the office. This one procedure takes about 10 minutes to get 20 items, resulting in 6 working desks.

The online way is a bit simpler, but the user interface for purchasing items is terrible, and I can only purchase 18 items a day. The items are delivered in front of my office, but I still have to move them on foot and manually place them one by one.

As a result, it took me well over an hour to fill my office with the required 50 desks, 50 computers, and 50 chairs.

Now, let's talk about the 50 lawyers. I can only look for new employees 10 at a time, and I cannot decide whether they work full-time or part-time, so I have to call my headhunter office more than 10 times since I want only full-time lawyers. The user interface for accepting/declining new employees is also terrible.

Next, I want to train my lawyers a few times. As you may have guessed, I have to manually click the check boxes of each lawyer to train them. There is a ""check all"" button, but it's virtually useless unless I want to train literally ALL employees, including the cleaning guy or the clerk at the hamburger place.

Lastly, I have to drag each lawyer to the working hour charts to set their working hours. There is no option to set all employees to work the same hours, so I have to manually drag them 50 times. There is an auto-assign feature, but it usually leads to mass resignation since your employees have demands and it is not smart enough to fulfill all the demands.

After all of this, I finally opened my law firm. But what was the cost? Two hours of useless chores. By the way, there is no real challenge or depth to the game. If you understand basic concepts of the game, and do as I said, you will 100% make 5 to 6 figures a day.",1678715102,1678721344,False,34,6,0.56205374002456665,0,True,False,True

At first I thought that this was a scam like Mafia City ads ( too good on vid to be true, turns out to be garbage ),   but then I saw that these are the same guys who made Startup company which was a legit great game, so I purchased Big Ambitions and was never disappointed. Amount of activities, buildings, vehicles and some tiny stuff to do is incredible. I'm definitely gonna LIVE A WHILE in this game.

Now as a small suggestion for RP purposes:

- add some indicators either to the UI or traffic lights when pedestrians are allowed to cross ( maybe a sound will do well? )

- add turn signals to player driven vehicle. Shouldn't be too hard as traffic already uses those.

- if you are planning on adding speeding violations, tweaking vehicle handling and acceleration to slower may be a good thing to do, but that's subjective to me as I mostly drive pretty slow IRL.

it has a good foundation and the devs know where they want to go with it, so once they put the feedback they get into use and work on the QoL stuff + some more content it might be just the time sink every ""numbers go big monkey"" wants

now to the ""current"" cons

- it can get super repetative very fast once you reach a certain point,
which i would say is around the 1milion mark. you do the same things you did in the beginning and it makes it feel like you are still just some nobody who needs to do EVERYTHING yourself

- a lot of QoL is missing... so much in fakt that it would be hard to even tell everything at once. but since most of the important stuff is already pointed at by many people in the community i have no doubt it will only be a matter of time until they are implemented.

Good ol Hovgaard delivers again!
As a huge fan of previous work ""Startup Company"" this purchase was a no-brainer. I will continue to support Hovgaard through development of any past/current/future products.

For Big Ambitions though, I will summarize this game briefly for anyone who may be considering purchasing this title until I progress further:

""Arcade-sim life tycoon""
-Game elements consist of buying/renting property and turning that into capital income. 
-Core game-play is solid.
-4 hours in, no bugs found.
-Soundtrack appears to be from royalty free websites (correct me if wrong in the comments) yet still good but needs more variety.
-Strangely reminiscent to the old ""Game Dev Tycoon"" days. (GDT the game fyi)
-Point and click movement is not my preferred control choice. I didn't find a WASD option in the menu that worked. But that is diffidently not a deal breaker.
-Car movement can be wonky. Sudden oversteers into parked cars when taking a too-fast-turn. Possibly happens during autosaves to cause the issue?
-Map is GREAT. Very detailed, easy to use/read.



I will further update this review in the near future. (Ran out of time)
Hoping for Steam Workshop support!

Its probably planned already, but I am not sure how to sell things you do not need anymore. Be ready to grind at the beginning, there will be a lot of driving back and forth to buy products to sell. Once you get a warehouse and truck for deliveries it is a little easier. For an early release, this game shows more potential than I have seen in a long time for an early release game.

Recent downsides are the fact you can't build dry walls to make offices/individual rooms(I have resorted to using wardrobes to make a wall..), there's no doors between rooms that open/close, the only doors that function are the ones you enter/exit the building from. There's no upper level/lower level function making the size of buildings a little disappointing, on that note the size and shape of buildings is pre-defined and there is no quick preview button, you have to navigate a couple menus before you get there making a quick look to find the perfect building tedious. Greater control over the building part, including the exterior, would be ideal, maybe acquiring the neighbouring building would allow you to merge them together to make a larger one.

Another thing I'd like to see is more functions to 'man the fort' say from your office you could sit at your desk and have something more to do yourself (you can't go to law school and be one of the lawyers at your firm, or a programmer, or as mentioned an HQ member), I struggle to have multiple cars cause there's not many car parks that we can safely store our cars at.

I have only been able to get a job at the supermarket.. would be interesting to get to the point you can work for someone else say a programmer firm.

For now, it comes across as more of a grind game, which is what you do in these kind of games, I know. 
I think, and hope, that the controls for movement and the camera functionality will be improved much more. For now it is a basic turn system with Q and E, press once and it turns to set positions. In the car it is fixed on the back of the car.
Walking around is with mouse, keep pressing the mouse button to where you want to go, or keep clicking a thousand times on the map till you are where you need to be.
When you have a car, which is pretty soon, you drive with WASD. 
Camera is also resetting when you enter or leave buildings, which made me walk in circles. 
Popup's are sometimes in the way for your purpose, like getting in the car by muoseclick but then there is the popup for managing the inventory for the car. I had multiple times the issue that I clicked to fast and entered the inventory instead of the car. 
It is silly things like that, which are slightly annoying but the game is very playable. 

The game itself is more of a repeating factor. You open a business, put together the inventory, earn money, hire people, earn more money and open a second business. If you keep an eye on your profits and inventory, you will do well very fast into the game. I've played for 6,4 hours when writing this review. 
I have my giftshop setup with 2 registers, 5 customer service employees and 3 cleaning employees. I have a fast food restaurant with 2 registers, 6 customer service employees and 5 cleaning employees. Both business are open 10 hours a day 7 days a week. I have a contract for my restaurant so the deliver goods (20 boxes). The restaurant has everything exept for the pizzaoven. Full storage and I still make between 2000 and 6000 profit per week (depending on me buying things). 
Still live in my first appartment and drive in the first car. It is an easy grinding game which I hope will be improved in complexity.

So why am I reviewing this title then? Because it is a concept of a game that I have always envisioned. Here me out. 

If you are like me, a console gamer and a pc gamer, who appreciated PC gaming due to the variety of games not found on console, mostly simulation and strategy, then this game is for you. 

This is what I feel like The Sims would have evolved into, if not bought by EA. I know, that's a gigantic claim to be made, but it's true. 

It doesn't have all the social needs that make up the Sims, but it's got the freedom and role playing down pat. I'd argue that the world even feels more alive. From the traffic that's backed up on the street, blocking you from a convenient parking spot near your business, to the buildings looking alive so to speak, being able to peer into their windows. 

It's the classic game where you think to yourself, I'll play just one more day, but find yourself an hour later, convincing yourself you need to go to bed. 
I found myself like this last night. I was only a few steps away from opening my liquor store, and I wanted to see it through. 

The balancing act of running your businesses, while also trying to expand your empire, and fulfilling your own needs, are all well implemented. 

The fact that this is Early Access, blows my mind. I haven't even looked into their road map yet.

Fabulous combination/invention of all the sim-management style games but in a new feeling, micro level scale. 

Now's the chance to truly TAKE OVER THE WORLD....once hot dog and coffee shop at a time! 

My only draw backs so far are more personal issue or wants/wishes. 

1.) I might be doing something wrong but can't get W/A/S/D to actually move my character (the car yes, person no), only the mouse's point and click will move them around. I don;t use a controller so haven;'t tried those controls yet. 
2.) The top-down view is too zoomed in for my liking, would live to be able to zoom out more (especially when running around/driving outside) but this isn't game ending. 
3.) Also when you go inside, the building top-down views are ""boxes"" with black wall boarders at the top/ceiling line, etc. Making it weird/difficult to see around. Something like a ""wall down"" button or the walls auto disappear depending on the direction you're looking would be appreciated. 

Besides the fact I can't drive in ANY game I play, the car damage meter seem really high so now I drive like a snail lol Again all of these things might be me doing something wrong I haven;t figured out yet but v\overall, if something can drop be down the hyper-focus rabbit tunnel for 12+hours stretch and still have a road map to go?

There are some bugs this early in EA. But the devs seem to be active. Bugs are like
-Unlimited FPS even when the game was VSYNC capped. easy to resolve with turning the option off/on
-Cash register, queue is a bit broken
-Customers put things in there basket at cash register instead the shelf after moving it.

Although you would actually need to travel to the store, buy the products you want, and then come install them in your home, this game enables you to be completely hands-on when it comes to stocking your stores and adding your own flair to their appearance. (Extra credit for this feature)

While the game is currently in V. Beta 9, the only thing I would suggest needs to be added is more character customisation. It would be fantastic if you could go shopping for clothes, then load your purchases into your cupboard, name your outfits and then you could do outfit changes.

Finally, it would be fantastic to have some shops you could go to on your days off, like a barber where you could alter your hairdo or a tattoo artist where you could get inked.

Not quite, but then again, to be fair, what is there is what one usually gets from a manager game. So even this Early, BA isn't a bad buy.

Currently, story mode plays in two distinct phases (as far as I know after some 10 hours). Phase One is the game start, when your toon lacks the money and the skill to have an organization. So you have to do everything by hand. That means, to be very clear, micromanagement down to the point, where you have to mop up specific stains on the floor of your businesses with your cleaning kit. What makes this phase a little dicey is that your businesses grow fast and irregularly. In other words, things go wrong and it is hard to say, whether that is current lack of polish of the game or something isn't set up correctly.

Simple example: The F1 key is your friend. It tells you, what you need. Necessarily. What it doesn't tell you is, what you should have, though. For instance, fast food joints need a trash bin (contrary to the patch notes, those are in office supplies, not in furniture). Also, when putting some music in your venues, all you need is the speakers. As a rule of thumb, loiter in your businesses and take the time to actually read the customer feed back. Reacting to the latter makes a difference.

Another important tip, that may not be obvious at first. Currently, no two businesses offer the same service. There are two ad agencies, one offers billboards, one net coverage. There are two recruitment agencies, one for retail, one for offices. That gets a lot more complicated, when buying supplies and furniture. Remember, F1 is your friend. Most of the time.

A third life saver. I get it. We like credit. Why work, when all you need is to go to the bank and get the cash? Well, currently, you can't pay off a loan early, so each penny you borrow sticks to you like the venereal disease. Don't say, I didn't wanr you.

Phase Two is organization. It's a simple fact that you can only physically carry so much in form of supplies. Unless you start a headquarter, I don't see how you can support more than four or five businesses without a glitch. Luckily, the story mode leads you there. And while there is nothing wrong with passive income, ultimately here is where Early Access puts up the wall. So now what? Well, I guess, we'll see. Eventually. I hope that long term there will be different incentives to open yet another business than buying a posh car or a skyscraper.

I also hope that when theft gets implemented, ""security"" will not be the answer (as the roadmap currently suggests). In retail, prevention is the last ditch effort, not the first. Theft is a simple ""cost of business"" factor, which necessarily needs an equally simple tool to cover per item profit. Which would, at the same time, solve the game's current problem of only providing access to vapor information concerning margin in percentages. Why that is so vital? Because making 6 percent selling a skyscraper is a lot more lucrative than making 100 percent on a t-shirt.

What it all comes down to is, adding a Sims factor to a manager was a fantastic first step. If it was indeed the first step of many to come.",1678629729,1678629729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

To me Big Ambitions feels somewhere in between Sims 4 + business expansion and Capitalism Lab. I love and dislike games for different reasons. In Sims, the life of the business owner takes the central stage, but the business mechanics are lacking. The economic systems that run Capitalism Lab are unmatched, but the human element is nearly if not completely absent.

Big Ambitions manages to create a good business simulator, while not forgetting the persons running the whole thing. The city feels real (which is an accomplishment on its own right) and you have the option to put individuality to your store.

You really need to spend time each game day studying the various spread sheets it provides in the interface in order to make each of your businesses as profitable as possible.
You also need the strength to say goodbye to a business that is not pulling its weight financially.
I do find the interface a bit clunky but I am sure that will be ironed out in time. The main issues seem to be a difficulty clicking on the right business to enter and if you use point and click rather than the experimental WASD movement mode then it is difficult to get out of the big wholesaler. I must have re entered that store about 6 times before I gave up and changed to the WASD mode.
I find the driving difficult but all game based driving is hard. At least with this game it is surprisingly smooth aside from braking. I ended up hitting the rear end of many cars before I learned to slow before every corner just in case.

Absolutely - Me and my friend have been wishing and hoping for a game like this for such a long time and I am so thankful a game like this has been developed. Honestly for an early access game it has been perfectly executed and has amazing potential! I have already poured a decent amount of hours into this game and I most definitely will be putting more into it.

The game-play is simple and easy to grasp yet the mechanisms and systems very in depth, who knew that starting a gift shop would be such a fun process! The game also hosts a wide range of things to spend your wealth on which makes you want to play that extra hour or two to get the nice sports car etc. and I believe that is what also makes it very enticing and addicting to play.

There is also no noticeable bugs or glitches which I have found yet.

Honest EA Review:

This game is a hidden jewel. Even being in EA, it brings me the feeling i had when i was a kid playing GTA 2 (yes, the one where the perspective was top-bottom). I rember trying to own my bussiness in GTA but it always ended in multiple cops firing at my ass.

Here, you start as a simple unemployed 18yo struggling with life in NY city, your uncle gives you some money to pay the rent and the rest is up to you; working as a cashier in a supper market to earn enough money to put food on the table and start your own little business is just the start of this big adventure.

The PRO's & Con's:

Pro's:
+ You get ""the sims"" + GTA feeling (without the robery and stuff).
+ A lot of mechanics in place in a big city for you to grow your business.
+ You control your character directly (not in the usual management way) which i like.
+ The base mechanics are very well fleshed out even being in EA, havent found any bug yet.
+ Nice music and sound effects.
+ You can even furnish your home in ""the sims"" style.
+ You have an IKEA! Even with the light arrows to follow the aisles (Lol'ed hard at this one, loved it).

Cons:

- Personally i think ""Big ambitions"" it's not the best name for this game, as it really doesn't give a clue to what to expect from it, leading to an auto-self-harm marketing (it almost passed unnoticed to me because the thumnail and name).
- Controls are not very good (ie: mouse click instead wasd when walking but then suddenly wasd for designing, cleaning also is very janky).
- Housing, missing construction of walls, doors, remodelating, etc.
- Even if the city feels big, it still feels empty with very few people and meaningful interactions.
- You cannot sit at a restaurant and eat stuff (like the NPC's do).
- No many options to interact in your home other than eat - sleep - watch tv.
- Going to restaurants or coffee shops feels very similar, maybe adding more customizations to each ones would make it more diverse, also more interaction options.
- Lacks some indications, for example if you break your car, how can you fix it?

It's been a while since i saw an original idea like this one and it really is a ""big ambitions"" game with a solid foundation to build something incredible over the time. 
Devs, keep going with this one, market it a little more and evaluate a name change over time to attrack more people.

I give it a solid 8/10 as of now, but it could easily go up if they really work out their roadmap and keep evolving it.",1678542034,1678553998,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game’s totally unique. It’s a life sim in which you run businesses. Any business in the city, any business in the game.

I’m about one in-game week in, worked about three days for the man, took a loan, rented a tiny retail space, slapped a cheap bed in my stock room so I could skip on an apartment and I’m now running a bodega. Right now I’m selling food and soda, looking to expand to coffee too in the near future, maybe donuts.

First, buy the game. It's great. Now I can explain why. 

I have watched, as of the first day of issue, every video I can find of the gameplay. This includes Colonel Failure, Britto, Charlie Pryor, and Kanzalone and several others. About 30 hours' worth.

I have only played the game for about 3 hours, but this will increase rapidly over time. I love being retired!!

Game starts in New York City. You get a little seed money from your Uncle Fred, and you get an apartment, and a request to start a new business. This is in story mode. I'll address the sandbox mode here in a bit.

The story mode serves as an extended tutorial, and will last MANY years. Over time, you will get exposed, fairly slowly and with no time pressure to additional concepts and in-game requirements.

The game is great. Buy the game.

This game is a cross between the Sims, and an RPG, and an economic game like Capitalism 2 or C.E.O. There are about 20 different types of stores, and 50+ items you can purchase and stock in your stores. You set the price, store hours, and interior decorations.

Employee management is an entire mini-game. Training, taking care of their needs, assigning work hours, and managing the cost of hours is all a pretty hefty part of Big Ambitions.

Stock management is a MAJOR time sink, at the beginning, and is quite a challenge to get into a routine, to avoid running out of product when your store is open. You're given an old car, which you can upgrade to a much higher capacity panel van. There are various wholesalers to get your product from, as well as appliance stores, an IKEA-like store, and many others.

Personnel agencies, Marketing agencies, and Financial companies are all represented. You can absolutely borrow, and BORROW to set up your businesses. But..and this is useful, you can only borrow so much. Loans have to be paid back, and you can't cheese the borrowing process to overwhelm the game.

Buy this game. The game is great. As of this writing, the game as 100% positive reviews. For a reason. Peace. Out.",1678483987,1678483987,True,3,0,0.468609869480133057,1,True,False,True

It seems some real care and attention has been put into the micro details... down to the smallest details like if you need to pay for parking on a certain street, in such a short amount of play time ive said to myself wow thats a cool detail so many times. How does a team of 4-6 people with a limited budget create such depth... if i was to complain about anything then perhaps the camera could receive a pass in the interest of QOL, its a little limited on range, id like to be able to zoom out more and have a little more adjustment to see further away when driving.

I wouldn't be afraid to say this is bad if it was but it just isn't, its a solid 8 thus far, well worth a buy.",1678483618,1678483618,True,2,0,0.533450722694396973,0,True,False,True

The devs regularly update the game and provide youtube vids showcasing everything added in each update. The game is a little buggy and lacking in some areas, for instance currently, you can buy cigars from liquor stores, but you can't do anything with them, so there's no point.  The management sim is absolutely addictive, and although the game starts out really slow, it really picks up once you get one or two businesses under your belt.",1678483001,1678483001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You have to set your business hours, buy stock, hire staff (or you can work yourself) train up and learn courses, there are also many businesses to interact with, coffee shops, wholesalers, car dealerships all with little set ups, products and stock to buy and consume. 

Shops have opening hours, so if closed you cant go in. You can see what is doing well, what is doing badly so you know what sort of business to open. IF you are in a shop you have to wait in the Q and the staff will go to the areas and get your burger/salad etc.

You can buy apartments, new cars etc and do them up sims style with like furniture, computers and tvs.

Yes it is a little rough around the edges and could do with some polish but I will defiantly be playing this more and hope it gets the attention it deserves.

4 things
I would like you being able to control player with WASD
I would think traffic laws to apply or consequences for crashing etc not just some damage
Having to deal with shop lifters and cirme I think would really add to the game.
Certain items ie fridges should need to be delivered, and also pizza should be in a box not a bag.
