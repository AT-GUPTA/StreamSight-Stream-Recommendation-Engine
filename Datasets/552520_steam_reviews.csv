Far Cry 5 can be fun if you're looking for a 2-person, co-op shooter game, and that is what my friend and I did.  Mechanically, it is easy to pick up and play.  Graphically, it is quite beautiful as well.  All missions are enjoyable with a moderate duration.

However, I would have not played it as a single player game.

Negatives:
Story is utter garbage.  What starts interestingly becomes worse as you make your progress, and you gradually find the game's storytelling disjointed.  The ending is simply appalling.  Dialogues and cut scene animations are often out of sync.  Some aspects of game play can become repetitive.

Plot however is nice, you come to arrest a cult leader, only to be betrayed by your reinforcments/dispatch, and overrun by them, it's sort of copy pasted (Every far cry game has you alone, or you with an incredibly weak resistance team fighting against a dictator, island leader, or just a higher up with an army).
Not that big of a fan of the takedowns, but the ledge/underwater takedowns are really nice and straight to the point, unlike in 3 and 4, you drag them, and then kill them underwater, the death from above/height takedowns are also pretty nice, they don't forcibly snap your camera like in far cry 3 and 4, i also don't like that they removed the abillity to completely exit your wingsuit, allowing for insane DFA takedowns, in 3 and 4, you could hold E on pc (I don't know what the button is for consoles) to completely exit your wingsuit, and if you were above someone, you'd instantly get prompted to a DFA takedown, i think you can still do these wingsuit takedowns with a parachute since you can exit the parachute completely, but it's not the same though.
Healing is a bit different, not a big fan of it too, but i like it's realism.
However, speaking of realism and the healing system, i don't like that they removed healing syringes like in 3 and 4 (I don't think 1 or 2 had them), and you're limited to medkits, which are fast, yes, but can be bought for 300 bucks at shops, i don't like this because  (Call me an ign journalist or say i suck a,ss) they really stepped up the enemy/AI difficulty, it feels like they really go for headshots (Or they actually do), and their guns are on steroids, like they hurt twice as harder than in 3 or 4, Maybe i'm just stupid and never noticed/looked through all the skills for health upgrades (Or if they exist), but yeah, having limited medkits that can be bought in the shop (or rarely found in free roam) and no healing untill you start regening is sort of hard, not too hard though.
The wingsuit is also a tiny bit different from what i noticed, unlike in 3 and 4 where you have to spend basically a millisecond in the air to be able to activate it, you actually have to spend more time in the air to activate it.
Anyways, not a bad game, maybe a 7/7.5 out of 10.

Updated review after a couple of hours of playing more: Actually can't stand this game.
-Money system is terrible, you barely gain any money from anything other than hunting, and you can't even loot dead bodies for their random sellable items like in 3 and 4.
-XP is non existent, skills are instead replaced by perk points, which you gain by doing glorified geocaches (couldn't come up with a better word describing it than this), you can also do challenges, but once you've done the basic ones (SMG kills, shotgun kills, AR kills, etc), You're left with other ones that force you to do glorified guns for hire/resistance member challenges
-Perks/skills are too expensive for no reason
-Game focuses too much on the Guns for hire/companion bullschit to the point where it's like an actual fhetish 
-Stealth is too hard in this game, enemies literally have echo location, and i tried liberating the fang center over 20 times in stealth and just gave up, because the enemies got alerted for no reason (Didn't see a dead body or anything)
-The game has a citizen rescue and property destroying system that increases your ""Resistance points"", and gives you xp for the region you're in in order to have the final confrontation mission with the family members, meaning you can do every side mission/citizen rescue/property destruction in one region, and either fully unlock the region/kill the sibiling in that region, or do all of them and have 80/90% of the region complete, with only having to do one or two story missions in that region, which is the weirdest thing in this game.
-Enemies that are high on bliss are literal super soldiers, i blasted an enemy high on bliss with 3 shotgun shells to the face, and only on the third one did the enemy die.
-Back on the money system, guns or other stuff can cost up to 5k or more, and you'd have to take multiple hunting trips to sell your inventory and go back, or, forcibly (because the game forces you to spend perk points on stuff you don't want to) buy the inventory upgrade (which probably costs alot, never looked at that specific perk cost) just to hold more pelts and other stuff to sell.

I could go on and on, but i really don't like the game, the money system and xp system, the expensive perk points, the glorified geocache magazines, and other stuff really makes this game unlikeable, i'll still finish the main story all the way to the ending, the game isn't physically or mentally unplayable, but i really don't like it.",1708799757,1708830943,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually, Far Cry 5 is impressive. I have tried the demo of Far Cry 6, and 5 has better graphics in my opinion. The game's environments are detailed, from the sprawling vistas of the Montana wilderness to the eerie interiors of the cult's bunkers. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the game, from the realistic character animations to the lifelike wildlife that populates the world.

I loved Far Cry 3 for the crazy characters (""Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?"" is the best scene in the history of video games), and Far Cry 4 had a fascinating world-building, but Far Cry 5 is a very memorable game, too, not because of the characters, but because of the overall impression.

That's about the only good part I could find regarding this game.  It's filled with extremely irritating cutscenes and set-pieces that rob you of your agency as the player of an open-world game.  It tries to tell a pointless story that is all at once boring and pretentious, when all you really want to do is shoot some fundy rednecks and not have to stare at the face of self-important ""bosses"" that capture you about a million times, only for you to make a narrow escape each time, and just get pissed that you are again robbed of your primary weapon and have to rely on whatever cheap crap you can pull off of the corpse of an enemy you've battered to death when he wasn't looking.

I haven't finished it at the time of writing this review, but good grief, this game has the same disappointment factor as Rage 2.

That is one of a few characteristics that make up a new installment of the Far Cry recipe. The rest of them - a psycho leader of the bandits, rich wildlife, hallucinogenic plants and a big arsenal of weapons are also here and they are truly fun.

Графика приятная, не скажу что прямо уж невероятная, но чуть выше среднего и достаточно приятна глазу. По эффектам и анимация, почти вопросов нет, за исключением некоторых багов, дёрганий и т.д.

It's majestic, immersive, almost feel like home; aside from occasional dead bodies lying around. 

One feature that always keep me coming back to the game and that is companionship. Each has their own perk and unique personality as a character. The animal companions are the fun ones.

I also love the soundtrack that plays during loading screen with lovely imagery for each chapter/region you're in. It's a very beautiful touch, I just couldn't get enough of it.

While the story and villain have their moments, they fail to truly engage, leaving players craving depth. The game play loop is a repetitive grind.

Game itself is fine, really enjoyed flying, driving, running, shooting and looting all through the first Far Cry countryside that isn't in the tropics (because that was getting old). Missions are fine, sidequests fine, plenty of stuff to do and different ways to do it. You can smash through most main areas fairly fast by following the plot quests which give hefty Freedom points, or you can take longer by grinding out the side missions and taking strongholds/killing convoys. Fine. All solid and good enough. The perk system is a bit of a pain because I don't want to be forced to kill X enemies with every single weapon type in the game just to get my skill points, but whatever.

But the story. Sweet Jesus H. Christ the story. It's *bad*.

3 areas. Each area has 4 'chapters'. So 12 chapters in total. In pretty much every single one you get magically kidnapped by being shot with drug bullets, tranq arrows, or just get super stoned and fall over all by yourself, *even when you're 2000ft in the air flying a plane*. Then you're taken to the boss of that area, stuff happens, you escape. This happens 12 times. 12. I kid you not.

And the story itself is the kind of thing that weird IQ 80 incels will think ""Aww man, this is so deep"" but actually offers nothing worthwhile. It's just the usual brutality-porn clad in am-dram Bible clothes. I tried to watch the cutscenes in the first area but after the first 3 chapters I just mashed Esc all the way through the rest of the game and didn't feel like I missed out.

And the ending. Urgh. Here, listen closely:

- If you tell a story, and that story ends with ""Rocks fall, everyone dies"" then that's a *bad ending*.
- If you tell a story about a hero spending 26 hours of game time fighting to the end of a long campaign to defeat a villain, and the only alternative to ""rocks fall"" is to *not* defeat the villain, and just walk away to leave him to continue slaughtering innocent people, that's a *bad ending*.
- Any story that ends with no resolution, or with both options being negative is a *bad ending*.

There is a *reason* that none of the classic great stories that have survived for millennia feature endings like these. Because they suck. Do better. Normally in games like these I'll finish the story and then go back in and wrap up some more quests or collectables or whatever until I get bored, but that ending has killed any desire to do so because it's utterly pointless.

So if you want to spend ~30 hours messing around in the countryside, go right ahead. Get it on sale and it's value for money, no doubt. Just don't invest anything at all in the plot, and only do the final mission when you're happy to put the game down for a long long time.",1708377672,1708377672,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The cinematics are like that out of a movie (as always) and the story is riveting right until the end. I was wondering how Ubisoft would top Far Cry 3 and 4, but they did so in my opinion with villain Joseph Seed the companies' greatest ever creation to date. The game feels like three games in one as you must first defeat Joseph's two brothers and one sister before you get your final showdown with him. The gunplay is awesome with a wide array of guns available alongside multiple accessories such as grenades and molotovs. The twist ending solidifies this game as an all-time great in my book.

I tried it on release and just got bored, putting about 10-15 hours into it. Now coming back to it, after about 35-40 hours I have 100% completed the game, and I'm really glad I returned.

FC games always look good, and this one continues that trend, with the environments being incredible my only complaint being they are not varied enough. I played in 1440p Ultra and got 140+ Fps consistently (5800x3D & RTX 3070) and It was a joy, no bugs, no problems, no performance issues, but obviously this game came out a long time ago and it should be in that state at this point.

The Story and mainly the voice acting from the main cast is top tier and falls off as you go down the tiers of side characters, again as usual for a FC game. But the story and arcs are overall interesting and enjoyable. The soundtrack is incredible, and adds so much to every part of the game, sometimes comforting, sometimes chilling, often both.

The first time I played I got stuck early on, wondering what it wanted me to do. There is a lot of freedom here, and that can feel like a lot of nothing if you aren't sure why you're there. There are also strange restrictions on things like how many weapons you can carry. But it appears these systems sort themselves out as you ""level up"" and build towards what's important to your playstyle. The world also reacts to your actions, which feels like progress. I can see a bit of The Division in this game (or vice versa).

There's definitely some weirdness because it wants to be an MMO, but it isn't. You might die blowing up a silo, and the game will save that you've blown up that silo, like an MMO would in a persistent world. But then it'll respawn you right next to the burned silo and instantly recreate enemies you'd killed, so you die again immediately. It'll also spawn in enemies around you when it feels like that's required, but it's sort of random. Try to do something sneaky, whiff one arrow, and you'll end up with two dozen identical NPCs shooting at you because they're all psychic clones with teleporters. Or, do something sneaky and it will work right away and you'll complete a massive challenge no time so it felt like nothing. It's hard to tell what's coming, either way.

The game is ""always online"" I guess, and threatens to fill your world with other real life players. But it never has for me. It feels like a single player game with MMO failings and the constant threat of other people without the payoff of other people. At least there's no battle pass?

It has many good ideas but for every step forward it takes at least one step back.
A lot of my distaste for this entry in the franchise come from the setting and the lazy writing in the ending but there are also gameplay issues. 
Enemy variety and their threat level have been reduced, while they are now sent at you in ridiculous numbers.
This together with less refined and less varied mission design made the game feel stretched and monotonous in ways Far Cry 3 and even 2 never felt.
On top of that XP is longer earned by kills but by challanges - that is a fine system but it also means killing every enemy you come across becomes a waste of time and ammunitions.
Far Cry 3 and 4 have bombastic and exciting main and side missions. Here it feels like Ubi just gave up and cramped in as many second rate RPG side missions as possible. 

And then there is the premium currency - that you can buy for real money. Game breaking vehicles and gaudy weapon skins, all for your compulsive spending and purchasing. 
I have no clue why this game wants to be rural GTA instead of focusing on providing fun FPS missions and refining/expanding the Far Cry formula.
IMHO this is when far Cry started going wrong.

I envy everyone that can have unquestioning fun with this game but I just... expect better or at least something different.

I really like the villain and the fact that it takes place in Montana is both preposterous and intriguing. I suppose it's a more interesting location to have a Far Cry game than another uninhabited third world country, but all the same the premise makes no sense. Only after killing thousands of people does the plot give the option of walking away and calling the national guard, which would be the logical solution since you're playing as a police officer to begin with and there's nothing stopping the character from leaving and doing this.

Other than that, this game feels a lot less ""checklisty"" than the other Far Cry games. One stupid thing they do is group all of the missions into one big clump of 40+ missions in each region. You can't just check and see which missions you're missing. It's not necessary to complete all of them since you're only trying to fill up a resistance bar to force a confrontation anyway.

If you play this game on hard, the difficulty is all over the place. Most segments are easy but some are insanely hard. In particular the driving sequence at the start of the game is almost impossible. You're supposed to be firing at enemies while the car jerks all over the place. Then you have to fling dynamite sticks that need to be perfectly timed to blow up vehicles. Once you get to the open world stuff, the game is easy. You can still use an item to detect all the enemies and you also get a companion dog that can do this for you.

There is so much to this game that it's hard to really write a review under several pages, but some of the highlights are:

1. The use of aerial combat adding a whole new dimension to the game play
2. Tons and tons of side content
3. Each of the nine companions plays totally differently. One of them will actually call in an aerial strike for you, another will deliver a helicopter that you can take from that region
4. Lots of mission variety, objectives vary so much that the game never feels repetive. Even the fishing minigame is fun.

I only have a few nitpicks with this game. The variation in difficulty is really annoying since the game doesn't gradually get harder. It gets easier as you pick up the different perks the game gives you. Also, your teammates are supposed to revive you if you die but sometimes you just die even if they can revive you and I don't know why. Far Cry: New Dawn had a better teammate system, but it is cool that this game lets you have two different teammates at a time. It really makes the game feel tactical even though it's too easy for it to ever require actual strategies.

If you beat this game you can play through a new game + but you still have your perks so it's even easier on a second play through. Also, Jacob Seed's missions are very repetitive. Other than that, it's a contender for the best game in the Far Cry series and I love the nihilistic twist ending as well.",1707955119,1707955119,True,2,1,0.529127717018127441,0,True,False,False

Far Cry 5 is a thrilling adventure through the wilds of Montana, blending breathtaking landscapes with adrenaline-pumping action. Its open-world design encourages exploration and experimentation, offering countless opportunities for emergent gameplay. However, the game's narrative lacks depth, struggling to make meaningful commentary on its themes.

Graphics are very nice, weapons feel mostly really good. Performance could be better, especially the HDR implementation is lacking. But ill let it slide since its an ""older"" game. You get a huge map with lots of tasks / outposts / random encounters. Exploring feels a bit less rewarding compared to far cry 3 tho.

Story was okay, some of the boss battles were really goofy or just straight up dumb, especially the one against Joseph. The story is missing a lot of subtlety, most noticeably in the beginning (You essentially have info on the entire map, positions of antagonists and who the are).
What annoyed me most was the story telling ""devices"". I understand its hard to build a bridge between open world and story but using the same mechanic to force the player into a confrontation with one of the antagonists and then playing most of it as a cutscene is not only immersion breaking but also really comical.

I didnt play coop but you can tell the game really wants you to. The companion AI was mostly doing fine, with some expected jank. The revive animation is annoyingly long and leaves you vulnerable for way too long...

Worst thing was by FAR is the skill and weapon shop system. How they implemented the progression is fine.
Buy why would you remove the signature weapons from FC3 which needed special conditions to unlock and just put them up for sale in the shop (IG currency or real money)?!?! Takes the fun away completely. Also most of the weapons in one class are really useless since they often have the exact same stats.

Lots of the skill are really boring or useless. So is the skill tree layout. You can just get everything from the beginning (given you have the funds), with like a few exceptions. A real step down from the skill system in FC3. The take down mechanic used to be way more complex and layered in skills, now squased into a single perk. That opened up space for 6 individual perks for larger ammo capacity and like 10 for companion cooldown?!?! Really? Really?!?",1706741185,1707600658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Companion system is great, adds a feeling of ""you're not fighting alone""
- Cute and pet-able companion animals
- The visuals look great even for lower graphic settings
- No actual ""Good"" ending, works well for the kind of story that Ubisoft wanted to tell
- Kinda fun with co-op

Cons:
- John, Jacob, and Faith - who cares about these guys
- You can't visit Jacob's mansion/fortress after defeating him
- The easiest game of my life; play at hard or the game is not challenging at all
- Silencers, which can also be attached to shotguns and and LMGs, make the game even easier
- Special ammo can just be ignored the entire game
- Flamethrower just sucks ass; you're more likely to kill yourself with it than kill enemies
- Lazy and lame boss fight for Faith
- Lazy and repetitive scripted scenes for Jacob
- No replay value
- Not being able to go far from your co-op partner at the Nuclear ending makes the race against the clock lose all sense of urgency
- Not fun playing by yourself",1704725850,1707412459,False,5,0,0.530436992645263672,0,True,False,False

First person  - I struggle bith first person but got there in the end - I am also not a good FPS person so there you go.

The cutscene didn't play.
i revived all my allies, shot Joseph Seed in to face with my Repeater, the screen went dark. i leaned back in my chair to watch the cutscene, and instead found myself driving a car, with fire everywhere and screaming allies.
I had been waiting the whole game for that scene, and it skipped it. I did not hold Esc, I had removed my hands from my desk entirely, the game just decided to not play the scene that the game had been building up to, and now if i want to actually see it, either i watch someone else's recording of it on Youtube, or replay the entire game.
So i replayed the entire game... in new game plus mode. And it was worth it.
The cutscene bug i had did ruin my initial playthrough, but I had so much fun in new game plus.

Why I purchased this game:
A friend and I were looking for a FPS to play (with Co-op), and this was on sale.

The good:
- Great graphics
- Gun customization
- Good antagonists
- Arcade: Solo with custom maps is a great mode, haven't tried out the Map Editor
- Flying Planes and Helicopters feels great
- Good music

The bad:
- The linear story is fine, but having little control over some actions of the player feels too limiting
- SPOILER: [spoiler]Set interactions with the antagonists after gaining points feels outright stupid[/spoiler]
- SPOILER: [spoiler]There is a little variety of enemy NPCs - was starting to become bored after liberating one region[/spoiler]
- Co-op has a lot of delay, sometimes the players/NPCs rubberband in Co-op, connection also drops (in spite of having a fine network connection)

Now, I don't know if this is just me, but I feel that this game is a bit too hard, in some spots. Maybe it's just because I simply suck at it, or maybe because I'm not used to it. I raged quite a few times at a few sections, which I feel would be common, and it's been a while since i got pissed while playing games, so perhaps that's why I think so. 

Though, the variety is spectacular here, there is so much to do, and sometimes, I just get stuck at what to even do, as there is so much stuff to explore. You can easily play it for 50 hours, and not even get remotely bored. The developers really paid a lot of attention at making the game as good as possible. 

Soundtracks, on the other hand, are just so great, I'm even thinking about adding some of the tracks to my playlist, and this stuff ain't common. 

The particles, and effects are pretty realistic, and it's wild that this game was made 6 years ago. Character models / Entity models were highly detailed, and the voice acting was top-notch.

Sadly, most story-driven missions end right away after you have maxed out the resistance points for their map(the reason to stay also disappears), so you need to pick what is the most fun for you, otherwise you may miss out. It is a very easy game, so this isn't a game for those who do not care about the story and only wish for a challenge. Only a few missions were a bit challenging.

It is very sandboxy and restricting, and you never feel like you have to do something right away. I went treasure hunting and wildlife killing; the main mission was just a way to keep going.

Far Cry 5 is the fifth main installment in the Far Cry series. Set in Hope County, a fictional region of Montana, United States, the game revolves around the Project at Eden's Gate, a doomsday cult that has taken over the county at the command of its charismatic and powerful leader, Joseph Seed. Players control an unnamed junior deputy sheriff who becomes trapped in Hope County and must work alongside various resistance factions to liberate the region from the despotic rule of the Seeds and Eden's Gate.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Far Cry 5 has a beautiful environment. This game catches that Montana look so well and it’s pretty impressive. I always wanted a Far Cry game based in the US and Ubisoft picked a good location for this. I will say though that even though the map is beautiful, the diversity in it is pretty low. A lot of areas look the same and can get repetitive at times. The animations are really solid in this game and the cutscenes look really good! The amount of detail this world provides is also really immersive and just overall a gorgeous game and still holds up well to this day.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is pretty fun. I can tell they decided to have a little more fun here with the weapons than previously Far Cry games. Seeing boats, planes, and helicopters is a welcome change and the controls are actually pretty good. The vehicles are also really cool and a step up from previous installments. The companion system is really cool! Every companion has a unique set of perks that make them unique from each other. Seeing a weapon and vehicle shop is also really cool so you can put attachments and by new weapons and vehicles. The world has so many quests to complete and helps keep the game interesting and fun. The animal hunting is pretty useless in my opinion as I never seen myself needing to get them. You can create these temporary buffs from hunting and getting ingredients but I never saw myself using them since the game is pretty easy. Speaking of easy, the AI are pretty dead in terms of intelligence. Sneaking is pretty good in this game. The game even rewards stealth if you clear camps without being detected or causing the alarms to go off. It’s pretty fun to do and adds some challenge to the gameplay.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is actually really good in this game. The villains are all unique and have their own personality, the side characters feel important and don’t have this feeling of them being an afterthought. I enjoyed the characters in this game. This is probably one of the better Far Cry stories in my opinion, the only problem I have is that the progression in the story is so slow at times and can feel like a drag. The endings are actually really nice to see and I enjoyed the story overall.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer is fun and can be a great way to add more time into this game, but for me I always had issues here. My framerate would drop from 60fps (singleplayer), to 30 fps on multiplayer. I don’t know if it’s connection related, but it’s a first for me (I never had this issue in any game). Besides that it’s a fun experience if it ran well. You can do quest together and clear camps, level up, and do some pretty funny stuff in this game with friends. It’s a good time, just wish my performance wasn’t destroyed when playing online on this game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With many sidequest and a long story, you can easily add up to 30-40+ hours if you explore and take your time here. It’s a great world with fun action, especially with a friend. You also have many challenges and can reset the enemy camps which is really cool so you can continue to play and clear camps and just have a blast even after beating the game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is pretty good. All from hearing dangerous animals in the forest, to hearing a battle in the distance. It’s all pretty good here. The voice acting is really good as well. The guns have a good punch to them that makes them sound really powerful and addicting to shoot. The planes sound really cool, especially in the distance. The music is pretty decent and fits the game pretty well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]The AI are absolutely brainless at times. I’m not sure if it’s a bug or lazy scripting, but they are not much of a threat at all in this game. The multiplayer performance has to be a bug because I never experience something like that on any game before. It could just me on my end though but you are warned.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]I did play on max settings and the game ran pretty well with no crashes as well. I do get some stutters but not that frequent. I did play on max settings and the game ran pretty well with no crashes as well. The multiplayer was a mess for me though. I averaged like 30fps all from high to low settings so it has to be a possible game breaking bug. If you buy this game test the multiplayer first so if it runs bad you can refund it.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Far Cry 5 does many things right that I’m really happy to see in a Far Cry game. With some missing features from the older games, but bringing some newer features that makes the franchise feel fresh again. With a good story and a beautiful world to explore with friends, the amount of joy and chaos you can unfold is well worth the purchase.[/td]

EDIT: after playing this game more and actually thinking about the story I have to change my recommendation to a NO and here is why !!SPOILERS!!






basically no matter what you do after the first cutscene of the game changes nothing, you can fight and kill everyone under the sun but joseph still wins in the end, but the only change is whether you are in the bunker with him or his cult are the ones with him (hint: thanks to new dawn we know for a fact that the canon ending is you, the deputy, being locked in the bunker with joseph), so in reality the only way to truly beat the game is to not play it, because either way, whether you let joseph go at the start of the game, the end of the game, or you kill his brothers and sisters and try to kill him, everybody in hope county except for a few people die

the games story is horribly written and the gameplay starts feeling as bad as the story after a bit. at least in FC3/4 you could actually have some sort of impact on the ending depending on what you chose to do, either everybody lives or everybody dies, or it takes a bit more fighting before you save everybody...

FC5 is not like that. no matter what, everybody dies, the world essentially ends, and the cult lives on just in a different form afterwards. the message is apparently to just give up and let bad people do what they want because even if you fight them they will win. bad message, bad game, 3/10 would not recommend.",1691763962,1706619385,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First Ubisoft Forces you to use their launcher. I have Steam! I don't need your B.S. launcher to connect 100% of the time with my info telemetry that has nothing to do with game play. You say you have Offline mode..... It's NOT. In offline mode it's still connecting and sending packets. So I use software to block your B.S. connections 100% of the time. It DOES NOT EFFECT GAME PLAY. Despite the warnings it gives you.

UPC.exe
uplaywebcore.exe

Are constantly connected whether you are playing or not. Not counting farcry5.exe that is connected as well.

Now the game play!
I admit I am an older gamer, but It should NOT take 60 plus hours to play through on easy; when it's less than a 20 hour game.
The repetitive B.S. timed trials, and the constant pull you out of the game to play mini games that disrupt the flow you are playing.

What controller support....
How in the hell do you make a game without setting up controls for reverse/descending. ie ***Left trigger*** You get into your chopper you can do everything but go down.....Lazy programming.... Or no reverse in a vehicle. How many times do you get stuck by a tree or structure. You have to use a keyboard to move back or down.

But UBIsoft in it infinite wisdom used the x button for pickup and loot. So if you try to loot a body you are consistently picking up unwanted guns and dropping your nice new .50 cal with suppressor, extended mag and high power scope! Constant super frustration.

Example: Your headed to an unsecured outpost, and for no reason at all ""VERY POUR STORY LINE"" Lazy writing! Your taken away by magic to a B.S. timed mini game that you have to repeat over and over and over.... NOT counting this happens several times in the game. There not even different, it's exactly the same. This disrupts game flow, and is super annoying  That has no bloody purpose other than content filler.

I don't know about anyone else, but I had back to back pull outs of the game to ""boss fights"" for both HOPE and her brother. 2 Lieutenants. I didn't have a way to re-gear, I was stuck in this endless loop. Can't save, can't nothing... I had to play it out repeatedly or lose all unsaved progress.

This game was stupid annoying, filled with B.S. fillers.... Oh I almost forget. In settings I had shut off the music in the audio options. What the heck UBIsoft.... That did nothing. The stupid game still played all it's music. What's the point of having the option to turn off music if your are still going to play it anyway.

UBIsoft: ""Oh, umm umm We paid for all the expensive copy rights, so your just going to have to listen to it......"" UBISoft is a joke.... That's coming from a guy that has supported UBIsoft for years with all the Ghost Recon games growing up. until Wildlands. What a FUBAR peace of S*&% Show that was. Third person only...really....

Oh something else. Your flashlight comes on and off automatically.... It is annoying but not that big of a deal. Until you actually need it. ""In a cave with acid"" and it never works.

Funny thing is, it's still 60 bucks. It's how many years old? Don't pay full price. Its not worth the aggravation and all the annoying frustrating.... You get the point. Wait for it to be under 20 bucks or less.

I will never pay for UBIsoft again. Too many resent games of $^#&.

The story is just boring at times and doesn't offer any innovations or clever surprises. It's enough for a picture-perfect but generic shooter. The potentially interesting scenario in the rural province of the American Northwest moves too much on the well-trodden path of its predecessors and gets lost too quickly in main and side missions, which can hardly be separated from each other and (with a few exceptions) always play the same. You won't find an exciting, thrilling story with meaningful NPCs, a cleverly devised plot and charismatic ingenious villains à la Vaas Montenegro. If you buy a helicopter with the appropriate arsenal, you can master the game in the last third with almost no effort. But probably the strangest features of this game (maybe in the entire series) is the ""Resistance Barometer"", which fills up after e.g. hostage rescues, damage to cult property or other actions that harm your enemies. When it's full, a mission sequence starts, sometimes completely skipping story missions and making them unplayable. The skill tree is also completely inscrutable and illogical. Ironically, the game proves the ridiculed prepper scene right, which is also somehow quite amusing. With FarCry 5, Ubisoft has milked its cash cow way more than it should have and delivers a visually beautiful, but half-baked ill-conceived game. Why so many gamers are now self-satisfied with (expensive) lower mediocrity is a mystery to me.

In a few more words. Some fun is indeed here to be had in that - turning your brain off and playing on auto pilot - kind of way. Graphically it looks okey-dokey though the colour scheme is mostly a drab blur with a touch of green. The setting is righty-ho though I never knew the countryside in fictional America was as densely populated as downtown Tokyo and with more Pickup Trucks per capita than the average Trump rally. The gunplay and weapon variety is just peachy, though largely pointless, because you are handed the best weapons right off the bat if you get the edition of the game with all DLC. 

The thoroughly overused Ubisoft sandbox (litter box?) is, as usual, as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. Full of inconsequential busy work that is constantly interrupted by hicks riding around in their pickup trucks, eating crackers and giving each other blow-jobs, insulted by you interrupting them. You are constantly assaulted by cultists, battle music, cougars, quest markers, side objectives, calls from your allies, etc. never letting you breathe or take the world in. This I assume is on purpose, since the developers obviously think of their customers as ADHD riddled 2 year olds who will immediately lose interest in the game, the second the key jangling stops.

Usually a game company creates a great story with great protagonists or antagonists to complement the ""litter box"" they have created, but that too is questionable here in Far Cry Mambo no. 5 edition.  

The biggest eye roll for me (as in my eyes literally poping out of my skull) is this franchise's obsessive compulsive need to oversell their main antagonists in face to face meetings with the player. You are, as usual, forced into multiple scripted and unavoidable cut-scene encounters with them, (through the use of magic .50 cal bliss bullets, invisible unbeatable hunters or just bliss drugs) where they pathetically spew their sewage level exposition garbage straight to your face. ""OMG I look so cool when I say this Bible verse, don't I??"" ""I am so quirky and unique, if you leave me, you will never find another antagonist like me!!"" ""Colour tinted glasses, never used before by a villain, am I right?? So radical"" ""Ahh lol, you totally thought you were gonna die here right.. riiiight??, But I will give you a mentally deficient, contrived way out, because I am both stupid and because the plot demands it."" - You know, the 'Hot Topic' plastic junk ""dialogue"" from Wish dot com. 

Even after having met the antagonists 3x3 times, I forget their names - was.. was one of them José Dweeb? I dunno, the game doesn't even sell my main allies well enough for me to care to remember them, or the people I am supposed to rescue. One exception is Boomer, because he is a good boy <3.

AAAAnnnd.. Enough.. 

** Edit after completed playthrough - Momma didn't raise no quitter (TM)

I stand by every word in the review, though there is one thing I need to add after having completed the game. I will not spoil the ending(s) as you should experience them yourself, though I will say that the level of contrived BS is off the charts with either, no matter what you ""choose"" to do. Much like the game, all in all, it is an exercise  in futility.

My biggest gripe, however, is the overall lack of agency you have as a player, the constant forced rail roading where the game takes you out of the game and forces you to sit back watch predetermined cutscenes, all of whom are connected to a lack of meaningful chioces with real impact, which is rooted both in all endings of the game and of the narrative itself. Everything is predetermined, there is no way as a player to impact the narrative. Any game, that can claim to be great or just good, has exactly ONE or maybe two instances where agency is stolen completely from the player and we are forced into situations that we have no chance or choice to fight our way out of. This game commits this gaming sin more than a dozen times and all of them are contrived beyond belief. For this sin, and others, I hereby forswear the FC series and it is the last FC game that I will ever buy. 

Play the game for the missions and the gun-play and whatever else fun you can find in the litterbox, but for the narrative, just watch an abridged Let'sPlay.  ",1705958966,1706285905,False,2,0,0.512482583522796631,0,True,False,False

Far Cry 5: Holy Moly in Hope County, Where Bliss is Trippy and Freedom Comes with a Shotgun (a Far Cry fangirling review)
Buckle up, sinners, because we're taking a trip to Hope County, Montana, where the air is thick with religious zealotry, the sunsets are explosive (literally), and the wildlife's got a taste for trespassers (looking at you, Mr. Moose). You're The Deputy, a fresh-faced recruit thrown headfirst into the Seed family's twisted paradise. Daddy Joseph might preach peace, but his methods involve fire, brimstone, and enough Bliss (a hallucinogenic concoction brewed from local flora) to make Woodstock look like a Tupperware party.

Story? Buckle up for a wild ride. Joseph Seed is the televangelist on steroids you never knew you needed. He's equal parts charming, terrifying, and utterly unpredictable. His lieutenants, the Heralds, are just as messed up, each with their own brand of crazy (and fashion sense that would make Liberace blush). You'll team up with a ragtag bunch of locals, from Hurk Sr.'s explosive enthusiasm to Nick Rye's stoic pragmatism, as you fight to liberate Hope County outpost by outpost. Expect mind-bending Bliss trips, moral quandaries that'll make your preacher sweat, and enough plot twists to leave you dizzy like a skydiver on Jagermeister.

Gameplay? It's a Far Cry buffet of mayhem. Shoot, stab, grapple, wingsuit, ride bears and tractors into enemy strongholds – the options are as varied as the Montana landscape. Need to scout an outpost? Tag enemies with your binoculars and rain down hellfire from a stolen plane. Out of ammo? Throw a shovel, because in Hope County, even your gardening tools are deadly weapons. The world's your open-ended playground, and the only rule is: ""spread chaos and have fun, just don't get caught singing Kumbaya with the Peggies.""

The world? Montana, but on acid. From rolling farmlands to remote mountain peaks, Hope County is a stunning backdrop for your descent into madness. Every barn, every church, every outhouse holds a secret, a hidden stash of weapons, or maybe just a confused badger wondering what all the fuss is about. You'll spend hours hunting elusive animals, customizing your arsenal with redneck ingenuity, and discovering hidden prepper stashes while wondering why your therapist never suggested a vacation here (seriously, don't).

So, perfect? Nah, honey. Bugs the size of John Seed's ego, driving that feels like navigating a potato on roller skates, and a story that occasionally gets lost in the explosions (and the fishing, because who can resist reeling in a prize-winning bass while dodging cultists?). But here's the rub: Far Cry 5 is pure, unadulterated fun. It's a Montana fever dream with more laughs than a squirrel convention and enough chaos to make a televangelist blush. So grab your shotgun, channel your inner yeehaw, and get ready for the wildest vacation ever. Just remember, in Hope County, the only guaranteed souvenir is a tantrum from Joseph Seed (and maybe a moose encounter...you've been warned).

P.S. Special thanks to my trusty AI co-pilot, Bard. They may not know how to wrestle a gator, but their knowledge of Far Cry lore runs deeper than the Mississippi River. Plus, they kept me from writing the entire review in redneck slang (y'all wouldn't understand a word I said). So yeah, give that AI some love too. Maybe a few extra Cheeseburgers in Paradise or a shiny new algorithm upgrade. They deserve it.

Now go forth, liberate Hope County, and try not to get baptized in Bliss.

Sincerely,

M***o ♡",1706255130,1706255130,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set in a modern, current day climate in rural America with weapons and vehicles reflecting the setting, Far Cry 5 already takes the cake for its set and setting compared to any of the other games. No gimmicks or weird textures for weapons, everything is modernized and very close to reality.

The storyline is very intense and captivating for me… it may be one of my favorite stories of all time. The cutscenes are really just cinematic injections into the gameplay that make it feel like you’re experiencing something more than just a video game. The dialogue is masterful… Far Cry games have always had this strength, but 5 is currently their peak in leaving things ominous, intriguing, and extremely intense - always making you crave what is going to happen next. I never want to skip a cutscene, and I will mute everything else I’m doing on my computer to watch every single one.

The gameplay is refined and clean. Outgoing bullet damage is fairly realistic, and incoming damage shares the same qualities on “infamous” difficulty. All gameplay mechanics work flawlessly in my opinion. I struggle coming up with ways to describe it or find flaws in it, because in the famous words of Todd Howard… “all of this just works.” Except in this case it genuinely does.

The performance is very reasonable. I have a mid-high end gaming PC for 2017 standards, over a year before its release. It’s pretty outdated nowadays, but I seldom ever have performance issues at 1080p with high settings and the frame rate is always over 60fps, typically hovering around 90fps.

All in all, this is the peak of the Far Cry franchise.  If you haven’t played any Far Cry’s, start with this one. If you have played other ones but not this one, you’re missing out big time. If you’ve played it on the console but not the PC, you’re also missing out big time on the smooth experience you can get with 60fps+, it truly does make the game even more of a beautiful work of art.

- Графика красивая, даже на сегодняшний день.
Из минусов:
- Почти полное отсутствие постановки сюжетных и доп. заданий.

F-ck you, have a forced walking sim ""story"" moment, all your progress in the puzzle is gone and you get respawned halfway across the map. Hunting animals to unlock gear? F-ck you, have a cringe cutscene and go spawn in another random place halfway across the map. And so on, on repeat. The most glaring issue of this game is that it does not, at-f-cking-all respect your time and your choices. So much for a fun open world sandbox where you can approach things at your own pace.

Aside from that, all of the issues sice Far Cry 3 remain - cringe characters, story written by angsty teenagers - this time by Timmy who did not want to go to Church with his parents on Sunday morning (previously, we had one by Billy who did not want to go to a summer vacation with his parents and Raj whose mother cooks crab rangoon way too often for his liking), mediocre gunplay and combat, bad AI, repeated technical bugs even after several patches, and so on.

Far Cry 3 was a good game. Not great, but good. Far Cry 4 was good, but it was slipping towards mediocrity as it again had the same issues and it was also largely just a reskin of 3. 5 is again the same thing - a reskin with only minor changes. If you are going to charge AAA price for a game + extra for DLCs + microtransactions, you better deliver AAA quality, or something groundbreaking. Far Cry 5 has neither AAA quality, nor does it bring anything groundbreaking - or rather, the only groundbreaking thing it brings is groundbreaking levels of frustration as your gameplay gets interrupted in the worst possible moments by the least interesting story in the series so far. If they wanted to put bigger focus on their narrative, they should have made a linear narrative driven game, instead of f-cking up the only somewhat fun part of the game - the open world activities.",1705943725,1705943725,False,2,0,0.512482583522796631,0,True,False,False

It is made super frustrating by the fact that the outposts don't show up on your man automatically, and you can't even buy maps that would show any collectibles, treausre places or outposts (To my knowledge, I might've missed it). Animal hunting is useless, cuz all you can get out of it is money, which I literally never needed to use, so fishing and even looting was useless, I couldn't find anything good to spend my money on.

The developers had MANY games before this to iron out a lot of these kinks, but simply didn't put in the effort. I often find my self feeling immersed, only to get yanked out of said immersion with the punch of a heavy weight boxer because some very stupid little thing happens that completely ruined what I was planning or trying to do with me yelling a visceral ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?"" for a millionth time.

I play a lot of dark souls, I understand the 'git gud' mindset. And I got very good at these games, often playing them on hard right out of the gate because it was so much fun. But then #5 comes along and spits in your face at almost every opportunity. I'll play through and finish the game and come back and update this review if the game manages to redeem itself, but I have gotten very good at seeing the programming on the wall, so I'm doubting much will change.

Edit: I have completed the game. Nothing got better. It all stayed dog shit.

The devs felt like it would be a cool twist to take away all player choice in a open world game. None of your choices matter, and not in a good way. You will either predict what's going to happen ahead of time and be really disappointed when it happens, OR you will get blinds sided and STILL be disappointed. My ratings listed below should give you and idea of how bad this game is comparison to its previous iterations.

Far Cry 3  8/10
Far Cry 3:Blood Dragon  9/10
Far Cry 4  8/10
Far Cry Primal:  8/10
Far Cry 5  3/10

The game gets 1 for good music, 1 for good graphics, 1 for awesome side stories/characters, but nothing for anything else, because anything else that was good at one point will gets soured by something absolutely, mindbogglingly, fucking stupid.

What ever the devs were trying to get at with the over arcing plot of this story just falls flat in every conceivable way. The reason? Pure laziness. Its clear a lot of work went into a lot of this game, but none of it was where it needed to be.

The game's cooperative play is an absolute blast, allowing you to team up with a friend for an even more immersive adventure.

The diverse range of activities is what sets Far Cry 5 apart. Whether you're liberating outposts from the menacing cult, casting a line in the serene rivers for some fishing, or stalking wildlife in the lush forests, there's always something exciting to do. The variety in open-world activities adds depth and replayability to the game, making every moment feel fresh and engaging.

Montana serves as a fantastic backdrop for the game, providing a unique and captivating setting. The attention to detail in the environment, from the sprawling landscapes to the small-town charm, adds an extra layer of authenticity to the overall experience. The freedom to explore this open world at your own pace is a testament to the game's design, encouraging players to forge their own path through the chaos.

The main campaign is gripping, with a compelling narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The charismatic and sometimes eccentric characters you encounter contribute to the immersive storytelling. The blend of intense action, thought-provoking themes, and unexpected twists creates a rollercoaster of emotions that make Far Cry 5 a standout title in the series.

In terms of technical aspects, the game boasts stunning visuals and a well-optimized performance on PC. The cooperative mode seamlessly integrates into the single-player experience, allowing you to share the thrills of the campaign with a friend.

Far Cry 5 is not just a game; it's an experience. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer, the captivating open-world, dynamic gameplay, and cooperative features make it a must-play title. Ubisoft has truly hit the mark with Far Cry 5, delivering an unforgettable journey through the heart of Montana.",1705775485,1705775485,True,1,0,0.512295067310333252,0,True,False,False

Things I've noticed are that the game QUICKLY updates the environment from the fog of war. Like I just opened the settings/menu or I just looked at the other side of the area, and the vehicles are immediately gone. 

As compared to Far Cry Primal, there's no taming feature, and since it's kinda a countryside story, I was expecting for crocodiles or probably river sharks. The swimming feature is kinda disappointing as well, and you might want to keep your feet above the water always. 

Crafting is also boring since it doesn't require much gathering to get items you need to craft. You can easily keep on looting animals or enemies and you can buy them.",1705768784,1705768784,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
NPC-s aren't ugly like in the new dawn
More outfits than new dawn, but not enough
Enemies are not bullet sponges
Weapon models are nice
Some weapon modifications

Cons:
Map is extremely tedious to traverse. It's hill upon hill, river upon river, your running speed is slow and vehicles are slow. It's teeming with cultists who you have to take out otherwise they keep chasing you with a car. And when you do take them out, another one comes straight at you.
Story is beating a dead christian apocalypse horse and getting bible verses showed down your throat by a bunch of psychopathic cultist killers.
At certain points you get kidnapped, multiple times in every three regions of the game. It's a glorified get-kidnapped-simulator. It can't be avoided, and it interrupts whatever you've been doing at the time.
Frequent FPS drops and freezes for the game to load at certain points, even though it's installed on m2 SSD.
Don't like much anything about the game, even though I've beaten it

Як я розумію, ця гра є приквелом до New Dawn, який я ще не пройшов тому в данному огляді зроблю на це поправку й судитиму лише власне сам продукт. 
Отож ми маємо дійсно красивий опен-ворлд, він не стільки цікавий для дослідження скільки гарний сам по собі - й літання на місцевий авіатехніці приносить дісйне задоволення від споглядання місцевості. Ставлю від себе жирний плюс лвл-дизайнерам які так чудово передали дух Американської природи, не зробили його монструозним а рівно таким по якому хочется просто проїхати автомобілем без використання фаст-тревелів й не затягуючи при цьому гру.
Також не можу не похвалити актерів що зіграли сім'ю місцевих злодіїв. Дійсно якісно зроблені персонажі як в плані візуального так і наративного. Гра справді викликає бажання піти на НГ+ для того щоб в контесті кінцівки краще зрозуміти що ж цими хворими виродками все таки коїлося) 
Також сам сюжет є шикарним втіленням як іронії так і пост-іронії над цими всима апокаліптичними реднеками, як ми - не американські жителі за межами Хоуп-сіті їх собі і уявляємо: пушки, пікапи, прапори та відчуття звязку поколінь та землі на якій вони живут) За тонку іронію та як міні особисто здається любов до америки- також жирний плюс.
Що до технічної складової: в грі я зустрів не так багато багів, деякі навіть були забавні, але більшість фіксилися звичайним рестартом місії тому технічний стан яб назвав цілком собі задовільним. Думаю на користь цього можна віднести й також відсутність в данний момент всім відомого античіта, тому навіть мій ноут зміг тримати нормальні фпс при цілком гарній картинці.
А от щодо геймплею... Ну поперше фізика руйнування, аварій, зітнень - ну це крінж для ААА гри, чесно. 
Виглядає ну дуже топорно, наче збиралися зробити файно - зрозуміли що не встигають до релізу й залатали тим що ми маємо зараз. Цеж і стосуєтся катсцен. Там де ми взаємодіємо з головними персонажами: все на рівні, А от всі інші моменти де вони є - виглядають абсолютно сиро й зробленними наче просто щоб щось було. Глобальне враження нібито весь бюджет пішов на Головних Боссів і Опен-ворлд, а все інше робилось десь нашвидко перед обідьною перервою. Теж і стосуєтся сайд квестів й сайд же - персонажів. З тих що запям'ятались - це лише син місцевого губернатора, такий собі чувачок з базукою, дуже веселий тіп. Й на цьому все, в більшості випадків нам намагаются продати якусь трагедію, й ми нібито маємо проявити чи співчуття чи то ненавість до злодіїв - але взаємодії так мало що пройнятися відносинами з ними практично не можливо. Здебільшого ми виконуємо тільки роль виручалки для всіх підряд, чуємо постійно ""thank ю rocky"" й на цьому все, тому особисто я навіть маючи запас ресурсу щоб перейнятись чиєюсь долею, через те що релігійний мотив гри мені близький, всеодно не відчув зчеплення з персонажами. Що доволі прикро, бо є враження що гра могла б легко дати більше.
Також можу відмітити непоганий арсенал, всі пушки цілком збалансовані. Стільба приємна, приємно й сама зброя виглядає, й по різному відчуваєтся. Про те їх не так щоб багато, скоріше сказати взагалі мало. А гра проходится спокійно в одній звя'зці зброї, що для ""шутеру"" хай навіть 18го року якось так собі.
 А ще під кінець гри, я дійсно був радий що вона скінчилась швидше ніж моє бажання чистити фар пости. Й це скоріше плюс гри) Зроблені вони по суті однаково, пес тупо імба, й тактика спочаку розрядити снайперку а потім добити виживших із любої фігні середньої дистанції стабільно працює всю гру. Тому наче немає що пожурити, але й хвалити теж нічого. 
Отож під кінец можу зробити висновок - вся гра слугує виключно бекграундом для хорошої менй сторі, не несе нічого революційного чи хочаб свіжого геймплейно, а додаткові активності в вигляді аркади чи ті самі дивні длс на марсі чи зомбі режим не викликали жодного мого інтересу. Тому й оцінку загальному продукту більш ніж на 6 поствавити булоб неможливо, якби не цей шалений стьоб з фанатиків і їх апокаліптичної релігії. А тому від себе ставлю тверду 7, й можливість колись ще повернутися щоб сплатити парочку церков під бодрий наспів Slayer :)",1705648399,1705648399,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

[h2] Overall Rating: [/h2]
6/10 ⭐

[hr][/hr]

[h2] Introduction [/h2]

Embarking on a journey through the sprawling landscapes of Hope County, Far Cry 5 attempts to weave a tale of resistance against a charismatic yet sinister cult. However, as the dust settles on this expedition, the experience falls short of the series' high standards, resulting in a game that is visually striking but marred by various shortcomings.

[h2] Graphics and Visuals [/h2]

[✔️] 🎮 Scenic Beauty: The visual presentation of Far Cry 5 is undoubtedly a strong suit. The landscapes of Hope County, from lush forests to serene lakes, are visually stunning. The game's attention to detail in capturing the Montana setting is commendable.

[✔️] 🖼️ Artistic Direction: The artistic direction complements the game's tone, enhancing the overall atmosphere. The cult-dominated landscapes, eerily beautiful in their own way, contribute to the sense of unease that permeates the narrative.

[❌] 💔 Technical Inconsistencies: While the scenery is picturesque, technical inconsistencies such as occasional texture pop-ins and minor graphical glitches detract from the immersive experience.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

[✔️] 🎮 Open-World Exploration: Far Cry 5 introduces an expansive open world, encouraging exploration. The diverse environments provide a sense of freedom, and the variety of vehicles adds to the open-world experience.

[✔️] ⚙️ Familiar Mechanics: The gameplay mechanics, while familiar to series veterans, offer a mix of stealth, gunplay, and vehicular combat. The seamless transition between activities keeps the experience engaging.

[❌] 💔 Repetitive Mission Structure: The main storyline and side missions often follow a repetitive structure, leading to a sense of monotony in gameplay. The formulaic approach to objectives limits the variety in mission design.

[h2] Story and Narrative [/h2]

[✔️] 📜 Cultic Intrigue: The premise of battling a religious cult led by Joseph Seed sets an intriguing stage. The charismatic yet malevolent nature of the Seed family adds depth to the narrative.

[❌] 💭 Lack of Impactful Choices: While the narrative offers moments of tension and drama, the choices presented to players don't always feel impactful. The sense of agency in shaping the story is somewhat limited.

[h2] Audio and Sound [/h2]

[✔️] 🎵 Atmospheric Soundtrack: The game's soundtrack effectively enhances the atmosphere, capturing the tension and intensity of Hope County's struggles.

[✔️] 🔊 Voice Acting: Strong voice acting performances contribute to the portrayal of the Seed family, instilling a sense of dread and conviction in their characters.

[h2] Settings and Customization [/h2]

[✔️] ⚙️ Decent Settings: Far Cry 5 provides an array of settings for players to customize their experience, from graphics options to controls.

[h2] Content and Replayability [/h2]

[✔️] 🔄 Abundance of Content: The game offers a substantial amount of content, including side activities and challenges. However, the repetitive nature of missions may affect long-term replayability.

[h2] Pros and Goodness [/h2]

[✔️] 🌟 Visual Beauty: The scenic beauty of Hope County, coupled with strong artistic direction, creates a visually appealing environment.

[✔️] 👥 Cultic Intrigue: The Seed family's presence adds an element of intrigue to the narrative, creating memorable moments.

[h2] Cons and Drawbacks [/h2]

[❌] 💔 Technical Inconsistencies: Occasional texture pop-ins and graphical glitches disrupt the immersive experience.

[❌] 💭 Repetitive Mission Structure: The repetitive nature of missions can lead to a sense of monotony.

[❌] 💭 Lack of Impactful Choices: The narrative choices don't always feel impactful, limiting player agency.

[h2] Overall Summary [/h2]

Far Cry 5's journey through Hope County offers glimpses of visual brilliance and moments of cultic intrigue. However, technical inconsistencies, repetitive mission structures, and a lack of impactful narrative choices prevent it from reaching the heights of its predecessors. The game, while enjoyable in parts, struggles to maintain the high standards set by the Far Cry series.

[h2] Why Not 10/10? [/h2]

Far Cry 5 falls short of perfection due to technical inconsistencies impacting immersion, a repetitive mission structure leading to monotony, and a narrative that doesn't fully deliver on the potential of impactful choices. While it has its moments, these drawbacks prevent it from attaining a higher score.

The game looks nice, even if you need to set everything on normal because your hardware can't deal with this 6 years old game. (Ryzen 7 3700X, RTX 2070, 32 GB memory & Windows 11). To be fair, my hardware is around 6 years old. :)
It kinda find to explore the nice looking world and send some bad NPC's to hell.
What came to my attention, during my ~5 hours gameplay are some bugs:
- I felt through the ground, because I tried to use the parachute
- I need to reload a checkpoint, even I solved the mission but one of the NPC ran from the compound and left the mission area and I was not allowed to leave the mission area 
Not that much, but can't remember a game that annoyed that much in this short time. Really stupid bugs that are not fixed, even if the game is 6 years old.

If you can ignore all the USA cringe and get past the antidrug subtext, it might be a fun experience.

The gunplay is fun as hell, and blowing up shit is just absolutely satisfying. Don't expect anything else: a good story? Nah. Good characters? Meh. Just pure gameplay, son. No mental effort. Just pew pew pew. All you need is half a braincell and a pair of hands to play this game, my friend (although I'm pretty sure someone might've finished it with their feet at this point...).

So why is this a negative review? Well, to put it simple: this game aged like milk, in every aspect of it.

After the first few (fun) hours, you'll start seeing a pattern - and every encounter in the game will follow it. Sidequests are bland and useless, just like the exploration, which isn't rewarding at all. Exploring feels like a complete waste of time, and capturing outposts is just... meaningless. Characters are completely forgettable (even the boss ones), history is predictable and full of clichés, locations are uninteresting, and the list of downsides goes on... It's a game where appearances matter more than anything, and the magic goes away pretty quick. It has no substance, no charisma. It's like eating McDonalds except with no taste.

With so many excellent first person shooters out there, I would never recommend wasting your time in a mid tier Ubisoft FPS. That would be insane. Life is too short for mediocrity. Peace out.",1690329080,1705500595,False,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

My first thought going from Far Cry 4 to Far Cry 5 was a disappointed ""oh"".

What a downgrade Far Cry 5 is! I mean the music is stellar, especially the cult music, I liked the villain and his lieutenants, but somehow it just didn't come together. The removal of animal skinning animations is a little example of the things missing from Far Cry 5 that bring it down. The vehicles in this game are a downgrade as they each have much less personality then the rides found in other Far Cry games. This game is by far the most tedious Far Cry yet. Sometimes I would die and respawn, only to have Adelaide get insta-ganked by some peggy with a plane. Sometimes I would fly a plane, die, then respawn FAR away from where I died, but without the plane! Sometimes I wish I didn't start playing Far Cry 5.

I had some fun here, but damn I've got no intention to play any Far Cry after this at all.

Also got to add that the plane controls SUCK. Yaw and roll is the same button and you cannot remap them! Don't bother adding planes if you can't be assed to add proper controls! And one more thing, why have a custom character when all the face options blow? Hell let me just steal a random Peggies face, it'll be better then anything I can ""create"".",1705385766,1705386125,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 - The most beautiful environment I've played in so far
 - The sounds of the environment were just as amazing to hear as they were to see
 - Plenty to discover and do, but not too much
 - The weapons are very satisfying to use
 - More vehicles, and you can more easily call in a car or chopper when needed (instead of hunting for one)
 - The boss battles are the most creative in the Far Cry series that I know of (I haven't played FC6 yet)
 - The DLC is very fun so far, maybe a little more fun that the main game...

Cons:
 - The base missions feel very generic and don't really challenge you as you progress.
 - Although there are more vehicles, they seem to handle worse in this game than in previous ones
 - The story is kinda ""meh"". Some things didn't really connect with me until the end.
 - Parts of the story and general dialogue can be a little too disturbing 
 - Many of the side missions are just boring (go here, shoot this, come back, do it again)

Far Cry 5's picture of Montana was beautiful and made me want to run around in it instead of drive or fly. It's a good thing too, because the vehicles in this one just don't handle as well as in previous games IMO. The story is OK.",1705376955,1705376955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And not in the fun way, while there are AI moments that are genuinely hilarious and got a good chuckle out of me most are annoying and completely ruin the immersion and experience of the game.

problems i have with the game

1. The story:
While I enjoy Joseph seed as a character I just cant get over or am willing to complete the game when my character is constantly kidnapped in the middle of doing quests as well as being locked out of them entirely if you don't complete them in time. On top of that all the characters you meet are all bland and the player is given no time to bond or learn anything about them. While i only completed the first region and part of the second i cannot play any more due to the constant railroading the story does. You could be in the middle of something and be taken by the enemy to progress the story. Don't worry about that quest you stacked up cars on the road for to complete, were doing story stuff now.

2. Gameplay:

They removed the knife takedown and replaced it with way worse alternatives. Outright replacing all of the knives and only giving you a throwing knife. The stealth is entirely broken too, many outpost runs were ended because a cultist saw a body at the far end of the base through a wall. Then later I ended up with the opposite bug where the outpost wouldn't clear as complete even though i killed every enemy.

In conclusion DON'T BUY THE GAME EVEN ON SALE! it isn't even worth the price tag of free.",1705370333,1705370333,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In other words; exactly what I expected from this game.

The game also constantly screams for your attention. You discovered a new hunting ground, you received a perk point, you rescued civilians. Do you want to track this mission?
NO! bugger off, I'm trying to switch weapons while I'm being shot at from different locations.

Y'all, Far Cry 5's about as redneck as a lifted truck in a Walmart parking lot. It’s like they took every backwoods stereotype, threw in a case of beer, and called it a game.

Montana’s the stage, and it's like a country song come to life - more guns than teeth, and more freedom than a bald eagle at a monster truck rally. You’ll feel like the king of the trailer park, I tell ya.

The Seed family? Hot dang, they're nuttier than a porta-potty at a chili cook-off. Joseph Seed’s preachin’ like a televangelist caught in a bear trap - all fire, brimstone, and a side of crazy.

Gameplay’s like a redneck’s dream date - huntin', fishin', and blowin’ stuff up like it's the last call at the fireworks stand. And Cheeseburger the bear? That’s America, baby - fat, sassy, and ready to bite.

Graphics are prettier than a new set of mud tires on your cousin's truck. Roamin' Montana’s like being in a beer commercial - if the beer commercial had a high body count.

The story’s twistier than a pig's tail. It's like a conspiracy theory had a baby with a moonshine recipe - strong, confusing, and packs a punch.

Multiplayer's like a family reunion, but with more explosives and less awkward questions about when you’re gonna settle down and find a nice girl.

Sure, the game’s buggier than a swamp in July, and the ending'll split opinions like a debate over Ford vs. Chevy.

To sum it up, Far Cry 5’s like a deep-fried Twinkie - not for everyone, but damn if it ain’t a wild ride. Perfect for anyone who loves freedom, firepower, and a healthy dose of insanity.

For me, it’s a decent game, but nothing special in the end. This time, Ubisoft brought the setting to the United States, specifically Montana. And it is beautiful in any of the 3 main regions. This time, we’re fighting against a religious cult that took hold of the region as their own state.
The story is alright. This time, you play as a customizable, silent protagonist. In good Far Cry tradition, it has memorable villains, especially the leader of the cult. Too bad he doesn’t appear enough. Each of the 3 regions is controlled by a sibling of the leader, and they’re all twisted in their own way.
Speaking of which, the game gives you the freedom to play the story in whatever order you want. After an introduction, you have the freedom to play through the 3 regions however you want, since their stories are self-contained. The game suggests starting with a specific region, but you can leave that one for last, or even cycle through them and play them at the same time.
One thing that I didn’t like is the story progression system. The way it works is that you need to complete activities, like missions, to fill up a progress bar. Once you reach a certain point, the next mission involving the leader sibling is unlocked. So far, so good. However, once you reach that point, you are forced into the mission. I understand that it may make the game feel more organic, but I like to explore at my own pace and didn’t enjoy being forced into the missions.
The map is big, but not too big. The size feels appropriate, although it’s mostly mountains and forest with a few locations spread out. However, even in remote areas, things are always happening, like cultists taking prisoners or dealing with the wildlife. Unless you liberated a region, since most cultists disappear after that.
There’s no mini-map; instead, you have a compass similar to the newer Assassin’s Creed titles. Another way to make the game and exploration more organic. You can still access the map at any time, but it starts with fog and there’s no easy way to reveal locations. You’ll need to explore, rescue prisoners, find maps in outposts and other locations, or look for road signs. That I enjoyed; it felt like Ubisoft took some risks, instead of revealing everything by climbing towers and buying maps, littering the map with icons.
Gameplay is also alright. It does what an FPS should do but doesn’t innovate that formula. You shoot cultists and wildlife with weapons. Weapon variety is lacking, and while you can customize them, it’s limited to changing the skin, adding a scope, a suppressor, and a larger magazine. Some weapons also support different firing modes and ammunition, but that’s it.
Being an FPS, it’s much better to play on a keyboard and mouse, but I found that activities like driving and fishing feel better on a controller. If you have both, I suggest switching up. It’s awkward, but I preferred playing this way.
There’s also a standard progression with skill points to unlock perks, and a basic crafting system. My favorite element is the addition of party members. You can recruit allies to help you in combat, and they’re actually useful. Especially the 9 unique NPCs you need to unlock; they offer a solid selection of skills. There’s a perk that allows you to have 2 of them at once, and in a way, that can break the game with the right people in the right circumstances. They can even revive you.
While I played the entire game solo, there’s also a co-op mode and multiplayer with Far Cry Arcade, including a map editor. From what I saw, there’re still some people playing this mode.
The season pass also gives you access to 3 main DLCs. Hours of Darkness is a mini-campaign set in Vietnam, and in a way is an homage to the second Rambo movie. It’s a way to experience the main game mechanics in a smaller package. Lost On Mars has a similar structure, but taking place on Mars has futuristic weapons, more jumping verticality, and the enemies are alien arachnids. They are annoying and make combat much harder. It’s also longer than the first DLC. Dead Living Zombies is a set of 7 short levels where you’re fighting zombies, mostly at close range. It also has a score attack mode with some unlocks to the main game. Getting the best scores is hard, though.
Overall, I think the DLCs are a mixed bag, but if you enjoyed the main game, I think you’ll enjoy them for the most part. Time to talk about the Ubisoft shenanigans. Obviously, you’ll need to use Ubisoft Connect, which at this time has problems like not being able to see your stats and achievements in-game. Especially the achievements; they unlock correctly, and you can see them in the desktop app, but there’s no notification when you unlock one.
And of course, there’re microtransactions, although this time they aren’t too bad for a simple reason. Everything you can buy with premium currency you can also buy with regular in-game money. Of course, this means you have to grind that money in-game, but nothing is exclusively behind a paywall.
To conclude, Far Cry 5 is another Ubisoft open-world title, with only a few significant changes. It’s a good game, but not great. But it’s usually cheap when on sale, and I can recommend it at that price.",1705230110,1705230110,True,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Set in the fictional Hope County, Montana, the game immerses players in a world on the brink of chaos, with a charismatic cult leader, Joseph Seed, at its center.

One of the standout features of Far Cry 5 is the vast and open-world environment. From lush forests to serene lakes, every detail is meticulously crafted, creating a stunning backdrop for the chaos that unfolds. The game's dynamic weather system further enhances the immersion, providing a realistic and ever-changing landscape.

The storyline is both compelling and thought-provoking, tackling themes of fanaticism and the consequences of blind faith. Joseph Seed's charismatic yet menacing presence adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, keeping players on the edge of their seats. The game's characters are well-developed, each with their own unique personalities and stories that contribute to the overall depth of the plot.

Gameplay is where Far Cry 5 truly shines. The freedom to approach missions in various ways, coupled with a vast array of weapons and vehicles, ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. The introduction of new companions adds an extra layer of strategy, allowing for diverse tactics in the fight against the cult.

The multiplayer aspect of Far Cry 5 is equally impressive. Co-op mode lets players team up with friends for chaotic and entertaining missions, while the competitive multiplayer offers intense matches that keep the adrenaline pumping.

In conclusion, Far Cry 5 is a masterpiece that successfully combines stunning visuals, a captivating storyline, and engaging gameplay. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer, this game is a must-play that will leave a lasting impression.

The thing is mechanics are pretty good still but you know its 2018 not 2012, ubisoft. So basically, i didint play any far cry game besides 3 until 2023 and i gave a chance to Far cry 5. I can say im happy about my decision and its not just for the core mechancis of far cry, Ubi also tried to gave a exploration atmosphere into the game with little side missions and i like it. And they  added new mechanics, helis, new guns etc. Graphics are still convenient. But the main story, characters are sucks. There is no main focus in the storyline and in one moment you just say like f*** the main story, just kill people and have fun to the atmoshpere. Faith might be caught my curiosity but the others even joseph are very weak. In shortly, not bad, can be given a chance.

I rate this game a solid 8/10. It's strongest points are the soundtrack, core game play, side content, and some  interesting characters and possibly the best setting in the Far Cry series. 

However, the story and some questionable game play choices are ultimately what hold this game back from greatness. 

The perks and upgrading system is pretty good. Good variety of guns to customise and upgrade. Buying and selling system is really good and the fishing and hunting is fun enough and will be the main source of your income. The map is littered with a healthy variety of activities to partake in. In summary, most of the traditional Far Cry elements are here for you to play around with.

This game will keep you busy. I took my time and beat the campaign along with some side content in about 28 hours. I have probably another 10-15 hours worth of side content to complete which I may or may not do. The multiplayer is basically dead but there is a solo arcade option which can give you almost endless challenge. 

Overall, great game, but not without its flaws. Story could have been better. It's probably worth the price tag of $39.99 at this point in 2024. Been about 6 years since this game came out.",1704943727,1704943727,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What is essentially Farcry 3 with some minor improvements and flair here and there; in other words this is Farcry 3.5. Mechanically and gameplay wise it does feel like the most well designed of the Farcry games, but there aren't any surprises here. You'll roam about the countryside, doing side quests and liberating outposts; hunting for money to buy guns etc, etc.

The setting and the characters are the most interesting parts of the game by far. Though the game's statements are somewhat (understandably) superficial, there are things that it's trying to say. Joseph and the cult try over and over to forcefully convert the player in the same way they've been indoctrinated. And they'll go to extreme lengths to justify themselves and keep their moral superiority, all the while purging the countryside in rural America. It's a bit spicy of a premise, but in practice, the game waters it down quite a bit. The most cogent theme of the game I could muster is man's ever-burning desire for simple solutions to complicated problems. Joseph builds the rock of his cult on giving people simple solutions and a reason to lash out against the world.

It's a fun time. There are always going to be spots that could use more polish in an open world game like this. I was starting to get a bit tired of the game around the 20 hour mark. Though the gun roster isn't expansive it's fine enough. Mostly by the end my pattern recognising brain was ailing. These cultist types love their big coats, beards, scraggly white sweaters, and stealing every possible kind of vehicle in the county. You also get captured 20 to 30 times during the game. All of this with a factory model silent protagonist.

Overall I think this is a worthy entry in the FC series and worth a purchase (especially on sale which it seems to be often). However, in many ways I don't think it lives up to FC3 and FC4. Like all FC games it has its' issues.

Where FC5 succeeds:
This is the first FC game that felt ""next-gen"". It's a significant graphic and performance upgrade vs FC3 and FC4. It played well on my PC minus a few non-game breaking bugs. Hope County looks really good.

The music is great. Has some of the best music in the franchise if not the best.

The sandbox part of this game is much more expansive and open compared to previous entries. Tons of weapons, vehicles, and allies you can use. However, this leads into the bad parts of this game.

Where FC5 fails:
FC5 has an open mission structure. This means you can approach one of three main regions in any order to progress the story. From a sandbox perspective this might be good, but it breaks the game up and really hurts the story.

Speaking of story, it's...ok. The story itself is interesting especially if you dig deeper into it. However, it really fails in its presentation. All three regions basically capture you (several times each) to get to the next major plot point. The Deputy must be the luckiest person alive, the player, not so much. It makes the villains seem incompetent.

What is truly incompetent is the enemy AI. They aren't the worse in the franchise but they aren't improved from older titles. The difficulty in this game is odd. If you play on the hardest difficulty available at the start, the enemies hit really hard. This makes the few scripted sequences frustrating since you don't have control. However, due to how open the game is it doesn't matter how hard the enemies hit. With certain companions and weapons you basically play on easy mode.

The vehicles controls on m&k are pretty bad, especially the planes. This isn't unique to FC5 but it has to be mentioned.

A quick note on the DLC:
I really disliked the Mars DLC. It was a slog to get through. However, if you beat it before starting the main game, you'll get some Mars weapons right off the bat which makes you basically unstoppable.

The zombie DLC was also pretty bad. Just completely forgettable. I actually forgot this game had it until I looked it up.

The Vietnam War DLC is the best of the bunch, but not by much. It's very linear but at least it has some replay value. The issue with this DLC is you can just run straight to the end and beat it. I beat it in around half an hour on the hardest difficulty.",1704674439,1704674439,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Before I say anything about the game I just wanna make it clear that this is basically the exact same game we've been getting since FC3 but that is not my main problem with it. I still love this open world Ubisoft style of game, and even with Assassin's Creed (and Immortals to an extent) pivoting to the same style I am still not sick of it yet.

Another important note is that this is a Ubisoft game so expect overpriced and mediocre DLCs at best and terrible forced integration with their launcher to use their DRM.

With all that said, this is a fun game to me as a fan of other games in this style but with one major caveat that absolutely guts the pace of gameplay. Every time I get immersed in to the games open world and start enjoying exploring and messing around with the sandbox elements they send a ""capture party"" and make you watch ~30 minutes of cutscenes. Interesting concept, but poorly executed. I think it would be much more enjoyable if the capture party was a group of challenging enemies that you can actually fight off but NO. Instead the first time they hit you with a bullet the screen gets all fuzzy and your character blacks out. Even this system could be fine if there was a way to escape capture but even flying to the highest possible point (the capture parties never use helis or planes) you will eventually just be forced to black out. This is insanely annoying, don't see how this made it to release. At the very least New Dawn and 6 get this right. There are other ways to tell this otherwise alright story in a way that doesn't rip you away from the actual great part, the gameplay, for an extended period of time if you don't want to be.",1690679996,1704651024,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

* No insufferable radio tower climbing to reveal the map (there is still some radio tower climbing in missions)

Cons

* Extremely long unskippable cutscenes, even in New Game +
* Enemy grunts able to detect you from a single glance when they're passing you in a vehicle at high speed, because the player character is obviously so distinctive that you can't be mistaken for any one of the many neutral NPCs in the world
* Half of the named NPCs are inbreds who deserve to be killed but of course cannot be
* You cannot directly kill the bosses, they just die as a result of your actions
* None of the endings allow you to kill the big bad
* The ""good"" ending isn't

Far Cry 5 for me is like a movie in which, no matter how strange it may sound, I played. 
Wonderful outstanding photorealistic graphics. The wonderful atmosphere of America is conveyed in the game. A fairly ordinary plot, as it seems at first, but then...
I came across interesting and fun side quests. Large selection of weapons and their upgrades. A large, beautiful open world where you will immerse yourself in an atmosphere of constant action and joy. 
I played this game myself and enjoyed the roleplay, but I think it would be more interesting and fun in co-op.
Now IMPORTANT, Far Cry 5 itself is not enough to get the final pleasure. I advise you to buy a pack of two games at once: Far Cry 5 and Far Cry New Dawn. This way the game will be more interesting and cool. (In Far Cry New Dawn the plot of the Far Cry 5 is literally continues in the same place) Then it can be called a whole complete game.

Many people regard Far Cry 5 as a bad game. I think for new and casual players, it is alright: there is value in the exciting gunplay and beautiful scenery even though rapid despawning and frequent pop-ins can be annoying. But if you are critical about games, it is an mediocre game that you should steer away.

[h1]Stale Gameplay[/h1]
Since Far Cry 3, the series has become a sandbox experience, where the game provides tools and means and challenges, and lets players approach objectives however they want. A good example is outpost taking, my favorite part of the series, where the players can take on it in many ways, such as direct combat (with various weapons), stealth, sniping, etc.

With the success of the predecessors, Far Cry 5 follows the same sandbox design and mechanics, but adds a few things: companions that aid you with various skills, a bigger and easier-to-access category of vehicles offering new tactics like bombing; and more side quests and activities such as auto-generated events, fishing and arcade (warp to other maps to complete objectives), though at the cost of being overwhelming at the start.

(Control of aircraft and wingsuit is secretly terrible, except you mitigate by enabling aircraft mouse control, but you can't with wingsuit.)

In the sense of being a sandbox like the predecessors, it is a step in the right direction as it adds more means, tools and challenges. But after Far Cry 3, 4 and Blood Dragon playing exactly the same, these surface-level changes are not enough since returned players can quickly realize they have already done the same thing three times. I guess if you’ve never played any Far Cry game, it is alright. Yet the series was in need of revamping its gameplay to prevent things from getting stale, but Ubisoft failed to deliver.

(Far Cry Primal is a bit different in gameplay for it largely focuses on repetitive material gathering and doesn’t have diverse gunplay as you only have three weapons.)

[h1]Fragmented Experience[/h1]
The biggest change to the game is the mission structure, and it is not good - players must finish open-world content to accumulate main quest progression. Technically, there is a mission category called main quest, but most of them are just open-world content rebranded, and only a few are real scripted levels, like destroying the statue or escaping the bunker.

Far Cry series used to have these long, well-crafted and enjoyable scripted levels for main quest sequences, which are essential to the storytelling, character development and playing experience. With this change, they are gone in favor of players doing more open-world stuff, which are short, tasteless and hastily put together. Even for the few remaining scripted levels, they are short and you probably finish them right when you start to enjoy yourself.

I don’t think it is because they ran out of development time, but an ongoing trend for Ubisoft to replace handcrafted scripted level with generic open-world content, seeing other Ubisoft titles have the same change in design. It seems Ubisoft has become lazy and stopped caring about their games.

What’s worse, it is not just the scripted levels, but a large portion of missions in Far Cry 5 are short, even outpost taking somehow is briefer than Far Cry 4. I don’t know if many people notice, that many missions take just a bit longer, or even shorter than the time to travel there to finish. Essentially, players spend lots of time traversing whereas they should’ve spent more time in action, and this unreasonable time distribution makes the experience feel fragmented and dissatisfying. It is probably why a few players I talked to state the game feels weird yet can’t pinpoint why.

(Took me 32 hours to finish everything except collectibles and arcade in the base game, much shorter than 45 hours of Far Cry 4; there are lots of collectibles in Far Cry 5 to extend its playtime.)

[h1]Empty Story[/h1]
I see the above two aspects as flaws, but the story is the severe blow: it is lazy and sloppy, and the first time I feel the scriptwriters were incompetent while being self-absorbed in writing the story.

An evident example is that, as the progression bar is full, players will be automatically teleported to the main quest, no matter where they are or what they are doing. It is so hasty and hilarious seeing players get kidnapped/OD’d/hypnotized alone in a car, in a chopper, during swimming, or flying a wingsuit, but that isn’t the worst part yet.

Far Cry 3 and 4 are great in storytelling. Take 4 as an example, there are complexities in villains and heroes to convey a story about there is no definitive black and white, whereas Far Cry 5 only has a blank story with unrelatable characters. With story time has already been cut short because of the change in mission structure, that precious time was dedicated to four villains talking some mumbo jumbos that make no sense. I don't know what those monologues are for, because they neither develop the characters nor convey any constructive message, and they aren't even relatable or intimidating to audiences. It seems to me they are just there to dial the edginess of villains to eleven, to cover the fact that there is no substance in character and story.

Heroes only exist to give missions. So, despite a much larger cast of characters than any predecessor, all of them combined have no more personality than a piece of wood, making the story impossible to empathize with. Yet somehow, scriptwriters were fixated on making a surprise at the end - they wrote a deus ex machina ending(s) which may be offensive to some people, to impress no one but themselves, because the story is so empty that no one cares.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
As a Far Cry fan, it is sad and disappointing to see a great series end up like this. It is probably a good example of why Ubisoft is getting less and less relevant in recent years: always picks the tried-and-tested safe route and lacks love, care and creativity.

For recommendations, Far Cry 3 and 4 are the best if you are interested in the series, or Blood Dragon for something shorter. I heard even the latest Far Cry 6 is much better than 5, though I have yet to play.",1704474240,1704566211,False,48,0,0.634558379650115967,3,True,False,False

In the heart of Montana, you’ll encounter Joseph Seed, a charismatic yet enigmatic cult leader. While he lacks the iconic flair of Vaas or Pagan Min from previous Far Cry games, his presence sets the stage for an unforgettable journey. His motivations may be murky, but the story weaves unexpected twists, making it worth seeing through to completion. And for the first time in the series, you can choose between a male or female protagonist, adding a touch of personalization. Alas, your character remains mute, referred to simply as “The Deputy.”

Story: 
Far Cry 5 thrusts you into the heart of a religious cult that has taken over a sizable chunk of Montana. Joseph Seed’s Eden’s Gate cult has amassed weapons, influence, and resources, rendering it an impenetrable militia. As a sheriff’s deputy, your mission is clear: dismantle this dangerous organization. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of Hope County, where every corner holds surprises. From public executions to hidden secrets, the story keeps you engaged.

Graphics: 
The meticulously constructed world of Far Cry 5 mirrors the beauty of Big Sky Country—rolling plains, dense forests, winding rivers, and majestic mountains. However, it’s not on the same visual level as titles like Horizon: Zero Dawn or Assassin’s Creed Origins. The landscape density occasionally causes distracting pop-in, and load times can test your patience. But fear not; the overall presentation is solid, even if it doesn’t reach the pinnacle of graphical excellence.

Content: 
Hope County is a gigantic open world where things are constantly blowing up, wild animals are pouncing, and a never-ending supply of cultists lines up for target practice. Whether you’re sneaking through outposts, engaging in intense firefights, or encountering glitchy moments, the gameplay keeps you on your toes. The variety of missions, from serious to downright hilarious, ensures there’s never a dull moment. Just watch out for those magically appearing trees!

Overall Recommendation: 
Far Cry 5 delivers the most fully realized, player-driven entry in the series. It’s an awesome open-world action game that invites you to explore, strategize, and create chaos. So grab your weapons, rally some allies, and dive into this wild adventure. Montana isn’t just serene landscapes; it’s also home to some seriously dangerous folks.

However, I still have some issues with it. The AI is very strange, and sometimes you'll be minding your business when a technical shows up and mows you down in 3 hits. The gameplay itself is pretty nice to play, and very easy to control, I just think the health and AI aren't keeping pace.

The boss fights are actually quite good. My favorite has to be the dogfight with John Seed. Jacob's fight is a sniper hill, easily completed with 2 RPG shots, while Faith's fight was the most technical of the 3; kinda feeling like I was playing Destiny or Borderlands for a little bit.

The story is miles ahead of the previous entries. Joseph Seed is an absolute menace, and his siblings are just as frightening story-wise. You begin the game as a Deputy of the Hope County Sheriff's Department, executing an arrest warrant for Joseph Seed, leader of the Eden's Gate cult that has taken over large areas of the county. Shit promptly goes sideways and you're separated from your teammates, left to fend for yourself in hostile territory; the typical Far Cry experience. What's different is that the world is divided up into 3 parts, and you can tackle them in any order you desire. Once you're done, you take on Joseph and the ending begins. I have to admit, despite knowing about the next game in the series, I was still sitting there jaw agape as the credits began to roll and ""We'll Meet Again"" began to play.

Speaking of the credits, the music selection is actually very good. There are a total of 2 Creedence Clearwater Revival songs, and neither of them are ""Fortunate Son""; a remarkable achievement in my honest opinion. ""Only You"" is setup well in the story, and by the end you'll be joining the many other gamers who are now traumatized by that song.

The side missions, on the other hand, fell flat for me. One too many forced stealth missions rescuing hostages than I would like. As I said earlier, the AI is strange, and Far Cry AI has never been amazing in the first place. This turns those hostage rescues into a slog of resets until the AI cooperates. Just not a fun time. The Gun For Hire missions were on the opposite end of the spectrum, each and every one was enjoyable in their own right.

Overall, despite having it shelved for many years, I actually quite enjoyed what Hope County had to offer, and I kind of want to play Far Cry New Dawn just to find out what happens next.

The graphics are really good and I really like the setting in forests



[b] Gameplay - 8/10 [/b]

It was quite fun. You can blow up stuff and hitting headshots felt good.



[b] Performance - 10/10 [/b]

I had no issues whatsoever. I was constantly far over 60 fps.



[b] Open World - 10/10 [/b]

It's a big map with lots of stuff to do and I really enjoyed that. With a perk that allows you to use a wingsuit I would just go to high places and wingsuit around.



[h3] Overall - 8.8/10 [/h3]

I really enjoyed playing through it and I would definitely recommend this to people that have enjoyed other Far Cry games or just any singleplayer openworld fps.",1704373026,1704373237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay is peak Far Cry where all of the innovations from the previous titles work together to make combat fun and engaging. Stealth and going Rambo are both viable options to take down most levels and outposts with plenty of equipment and skills to help you play how you want. This also leads to one of the games greatest flaws in that unlike 3, 4 and Primal where there was an XP system, in 5 you have to do actions to unlock skill points. This involves playing certain ways that might not align with your style in order to get ahead such as getting X amount of flame thrower skills even though you want to stealth, hunt X amount of specific animals, take x amount of drugs, etc. They probably implemented this to try and get the player to try out all the different weapons and activities but instead it just hampers the fun if you like to play a very specific way since you get penalized for it. 

Montana is a cool if nonsensical setting for Far Cry, taking place in a rural American county under siege by an apocalyptic Christian cult that has cut off all access to the outside world. Apparently if you listen to the radio and read some notes it explains that the US and the world at large is in the middle of huge political upheaval and that is why no one outside comes to help but it is still a pretty dumb excuse that you have to actually hunt for and destroys the suspension of disbelief. 

Far Cry 5 takes the popular story dynamics of 3 and 4 and ups them to 11 but in my opinion fumbled it badly. 3 and 4 were known for their strong antagonists with extremely memorable dialogue. Vaas and Pagan Min were equal parts charismatic, humorous, and intimidating. However you only meet Vaas a few times in person in the game and Pagan Min is only really communicated with on a walkie talkie the entire game. To try and one up this in 5 they introduce 4 antagonists being the Seed family with the leader Joseph and his siblings. To circumvent the lack of face to face interaction the players had in previous title, the Seed family will abduct you at certain times in the game so they can have a scene with the player. It is incredibly poorly done being that you can be in the middle of a mission and suddenly you black out so that one of the Seeds can just insult and torture you for a few minutes to show off how evil they are. Unlike previous titles, the player character does not have a name and does not talk. This makes the scenes even worse as the ""Rookie"" goes through worse scenarios than even Jason Brody and Ajay but cannot say a single thing when the Seeds go on their annoying diatribes about the apocalypse, sin, natural selection, etc. The game basically makes the Seed family these omnipotent demonic entities that can kidnap you at any time just to let you go and insult you until next time. On top of that the game ends on such a terrible nihilistic note that it makes you wonder why you even bothered to play the game to begin with. New Dawn, the sequel to 5 makes it a little easier to stomach but barely and it still by far the worse story for a Far Cry game in my opinion. 

TLDR: 5 is a game with clashing gameplay mechanics and a story that can be annoying and hard to sit through. The core mechanics however, are better than they have ever been and the game can be extremely fun if not a little easy when played coop. Just be aware that if you do play coop, none of the coop partners progress carries over to their solo game.

to me, everything about this game just speaks to creativity.

Plus this game has an easy-to-understand system of mechanics such as driving, flying, shooting, hunting, fishing and so much more. as a bonus, the game has a fair difficulty slider leading it to be as punishing as you wish it to be.

overall I am going to rate the game a solid 9.5/10, The reason it isn't a perfect score is because some areas felt boring and some side missions didn't stick but the whole game does a good job recuperating from it.

 One more game from the Far Cry franchise. This time with massive anti-Christian and female supremacy propaganda. The gameplay is probably the best of all the Far Cry games that I’ve played, but the uplay launcher and political messaging ultimately ruin the game.

 As in other Far Cry games, the story is tipically short, unnecessarily brutal and nihilistic, with lots of lazy writing. This time the evil doers are a fantasy cult based on the Catholic church. Both possible endings are terrible and fit in with the poor overall story line.
 As with other Far Cry games, the open world is fun to explore and Far Cry 5 offers even more fun, with stunt challenges, treasure hunts, fishing and hunting challenges. Fishing is fun and easy, but not very profitable. Hunting is very easy, but is on the other hand very profitable if you hunt high value animals. Apart from cars we can use boats, aircraft and helicopters. I found them fun to drive and fly around, except for the aircraft, which has weird controls and a flight model that is worse than some 30 years old DOS games that I've played. The overall gameplay is arcade, as usual. There are only a few weapons but most have upgrades like silencers, different optics, increased magazine sizes, and color scheme options to choose from, which can be fun. The sights are a bit of a downer, as at night they glow too much. Gunplay is slightly better than in Far Cry 3.

 The game was enteratining, but after discovering most of the map (99.9%), finishing all of the challenges (fishing, stunt etc.) I feel there is very little more for me to do. It took me about 40 hours to do literally everything, except maybe going for some achievements hunting. There is Game+ mode which carries over perks, so this might be an incentive to replay and try for a different ending. Despite all, I find Far Cry 5 the best of the series that I've played so far (2, 3, 5 + New Dawn).

 I don't recommend this game because of the program needed to play, called uplay. Apart from it being a terrible program, on my second playthrough on highest difficulty (game+, 50+% completed) uplay got updated and deleted all of my saves and settings. I've now uninstalled this game and will never again buy anything from ubisoft. Thank you ubisoft, for wasting my time. Ironically enough my completed game for New Dawn save remains…

For some reason the default MTU of 1500 is too high for Ubisoft Connect to function properly on my PC, lowering it to 1452 somehow fixed it.

----------------

Update: It's now been over two months, and the support still hasn't managed to solve my problem with Ubisoft Connect. The responses in my ticket have been going back and forth between same troubleshoot steps, sfc and beyond. It was escalated for a little while, and then returned back to normal support for some reason. Will update again if anything changes.


--------------------------

Update: Apparently Redhorn error has been resolved, but unfortunately I am still unable to co-op due to Ubisoft Connect not connecting to the servers without using VPN. I have been in talks with Ubisoft support, but there hasn't been solution to the problem during the three weeks my ticket has been open, instead I have been asked to go through the same troubleshoot steps I said I have already done. 

I will change by review if/when the issue is fixed.

Hunting

Cruelty to animals

Players cannot join an existing session
*Co-operative campaign (No Shared Progression)
There is no controllable flashlight (the game turns one on for you when certain conditions are met)
Lack of any night vision equipment
Nighttime is far too long
Far too easy to accidentally switch your weapon with what is on the ground when just attempting to loot a corpse
No way to access certain weapons without visiting a Shop
No Steam Achievements
Denuvo Anti-Tamper DRM

***Final Thoughts***

I don't feel that hunting and fishing are cruelty to animals. However, some of the missions in this game are cruelty to animals and really serve no purpose other than for shock value and thus devalue the overall product.

The gun play is tight and the combat is satisfying. There are varying levels of intensity, with the Cult Outposts Liberation missions being the most robust to engage with.

The main story is fairly well-written however, the manner in which some dialogue is delivered is verbose and can be obnoxious at times.

Some of the side missions are poorly written or just stupid (not the ones that are obviously self-deprecating).

The lack of a controllable flashlight or some form of night vision capability is mind-boggling.

But it sometimes feels like there is too much content that´s why i have 38 hours because there is so much content and places i wanted to explore. So basically it took me 38 hours to complete just the main story alone! And i still haven´t even explored the entire map. So this game can be a little overwhelming cause the previous games took me like 10-20 hours to finish the main story.

*Сеттинг - для ярых фанатов культуры реднеков.
*Графика - вроде бы неплохо все, но свет отвратителен, в частности реализация засветов - какой-то HDR на стероидах. Если использовать HDR-режим то становится все только хуже.
*Баги - игре уже куча лет и она так и осталась полна багов, тысячи их. И животные внутри камней, и умирать вы будете без причины, и невидимые стены, и проваливаться сквозь землю - список огромен. 
*ИИ - туп до безобразия, к середине игры уже начинает выбешивать. Отдельных какашек в панамку разрабам за то, что NPC, с которыми ведешь диалог, могут сагриться на врага в километре от них и прекратить диалог пока этот враг не будет уничтожен.
*Персонажи - не интересные. Возможно потому, что из игры в игру убисофтом идет копипаста персонажей.
*Геймплей. Тут есть пара хороших моментов: убрали проклятые вышки, сделали гринд-задания не обязательными. Весьма разнообразны задания поиска сокровищ. Ну и на этом все.
*Сценарий. Идея хорошая, реализация посредственная. С каждым ""боссом"" все по одинаковой рутине - они ""воруют"" вас несколько раз, каждый раз сопровождая долгими беседами и каким-то магическим образом вы каждый раз от них убегаете. Отдельное слово про киднеппинг ГГ который тупо реализован через гаснущий экран - убисофт не заморачивались. Впрочем, нельзя не отметить, что один момент приятно удивил в конце разборок с Джейкобом [spoiler] появление Илая в конце было неожиданным. Но и тут фигня - не убить его нельзя, миссия стартует заново[/spoiler] . Ну и концовка вообще ни о чем, опять все происходит магическим образом.

Far Cry 5 offers players a mixed bag of experiences, and it's a game that has both its strengths and weaknesses. Let's dive into what worked and what didn't.

The storyline is, to put it mildly, bizarre and may only be fully appreciated by those with a penchant for the surreal or mentally unstable. The narrative seems to take a nosedive into the realm of the absurd, making it hard for more grounded players to truly engage with the plot. The events unfolding in the game feel dumb beyond dumb, lacking the depth and coherence that one might expect from a AAA title.

However, where Far Cry 5 excels is in its visually stunning world. The scenery is nothing short of breathtaking, with meticulously crafted landscapes that truly immerse players in the game's environment. Exploring the vast, open-world setting is a joy, and the attention to detail in the design of the surroundings is commendable.

On the downside, the whole Bliss concept feels forced and falls flat. The attempt to inject a sense of mystery and intrigue through this element ultimately comes across as contrived and unconvincing. It's not the kind of captivating narrative twist that adds depth; instead, it feels more like a desperate attempt to introduce an element of surprise that doesn't quite hit the mark.

Another perplexing aspect is the inability to pick up money directly, being restricted to exchanging it for items. This bug may frustrate players who enjoy the immediacy of collecting currency in other games. It's an odd bug that feels so stupid and limits the player's agency in managing their resources.

Despite its narrative missteps and quirky design choices, Far Cry 5 does have its merits. If you can overlook the oddities and appreciate the game for its visually stunning world, it might be worth a shot, especially considering its affordability. Far Cry 5 is an okay game for those looking for a budget-friendly gaming experience, as long as you can embrace the eccentricities and enjoy the beauty of its virtual landscapes.

This game isn't bad, but the plot is jarring and lost on me, the map is too big, the grind is real, and there are far, far too many enemies.

The world is so big that you have to fast travel or spend 5 minutes walking through the woods or on the road to a place across the street on the map. Or if you are willing to risk driving, you'll still take forever to get anywhere and only increase your chances of getting attacked since this game goes out of it's way to disincentivise driving. (The roads are actively patrolled where an enemy will pass by at least once a minute, there's active roadblocks preventing progress).

There are so many enemies between locations that I can't avoid any fights when travelling on foot from point a to point b. In five minutes you could face off against 15 enemies, an explosive tanker, a loot truck, a prison escort, and a truck with a machine gun if you travel on the road and encounter just 1 enemy. And that's at 0 Resistance level. At level 1 Resistance, they bring helicopters out to search for you, rocket launchers, water vehicles, and similar out against you. It's brutal and unforgiving, giving no chances to loot or breathe.

And if you take your time, start exploring, go back to areas you previously explored because you unlocked something that will help, or anything of the sort, then you're actively punished by the game with a forced cut scene that will magically teleport you closer to where your main mission is in that area. Needless to say, that's not a good or liked feature in my opinion. Extremely jarring. ""You are walking through the apple orchards by yourself, hunting turkeys, deer, and cougars for feathers and pelts to sell, then BAM! Suddenly you're treated as though dead or dying, are dosed with bliss, and getting waterboarded. When the cutscene ends, you're in the middle of a high-stakes action sequences halfway across the map."" The fluck?! Not cool!

My experience was completely disjointed, with jarring plot and non-stop action where you can't get a break unless you choose to grind. And even when you're grinding or simply fishing or something, you still can't catch a break because wildlife or enemies will spot and attack you if you stay in one spot for too long. Stealth is a must, and even if you are stealthy and disable all alarms, somehow reinforcements will still arrive.

I give this game 2 of 5 stars.",1703940464,1703940464,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is fun, lots of cool mechanics, fun to play either loud or stealth. You get to pet a goddamn grizzly bear.
The Bad:
Some minor UI control glitches. Bad, dumb follower AI (be prepared to wait for them to get in your vehicle).
The Ugly:
The story is great, but the last mission throws away literally everything you work for. There is a sequel: Far Cry New Dawn, that apparently addresses this, but a game should be self-contained and going by that logic, shit's fucked.
The Unforgivable:
Fishing as a major part of the game, because why WOULDN'T you have a badly made, *intentionally* time-consuming mechanic in your game?

I have to say I enjoyed my time playing the game, but I can't say I love it because of a few reasons which I think are pretty fucking important when it comes to games in general. 

First of all, the game is riddled with technical issues to the point where I think it'd be impossible for me to play this without mods. The game has this stupid bug where everytime it saves, it does a little stutter which lasts for about half a second. The problem is, the game autosaves for [b] literally anything [/b]. Saw a sign showing a new hunting ground for a specific animal? Save. Picked up some money from a table? Save. Picked up A FUCKING ARROW ON THE GROUND? SAVE. It's impossible to play the game for 5 minutes without coming across a stutter because of autosaving and that makes the game unplayable from the get-go. I think it's unacceptable that a game can only be played normally with the use of mods, and it's not just perfomance, a lot of simple features just aren't in the game and it really takes away from the whole experience. Lucky for us, modding the game is easy and helps a lot. If you are even thinking of buying FC5, the Resistance Mod is basically obligatory. Some mods that I recommend are: Autosave Stutter Workaround, which removes the excessive autosaving (you still get the stutters when it saves, tho), FOV unlocker (some interactions like climbing ladders reset your FOV to default while being performed, this fixes that), No Capture Parties to remove this very annoying feature (it spawns a mission instead which you can play anytime you wish) and the RP - Reward System which increases the amount of points you need to finish a region, usually you can finish a region without much effort, this mod increases the needed amount so you play the game more and complete more missions before the final confrontation. Some cosmetic mods are recommended too like Restoring Skinning Animations or Faster Parachute.

However, once you download the correct mods, the game is pretty good. It has a satisfying gunplay, nice first person features (which Far Cry is known for), and the characters are really well done. Joseph and his family are great villains and it feels very nice to fight them, I do think Jacob shines above all of them when it comes to having an impact on the player, but they all serve a great purpose on the story. 
That said, I do think the game is too non-linear for its own good, since anything you do helps to advance the story it never feels like you're part of a big plot, it does feel fun to go through each region getting to know the characters and the villains and the people, but I feel like the plot lacks a little personal connection to the player (the protagonist being mute doesn't help it either). The cutscenes when you get captured feel so out of sync with the rest of the game, like, you get captured, some bad shit happens and 10 minutes later you're back to the open world like nothing happened, basically you don't really feel the impact of things happening around you and that kinda sucks.
It also does lack a little bit on the ""Far Cry"" side of things, a lot of features that are franchise staple at this point are not here, there are no knife takedowns, you can't craft medkits and you have only one healing animation which is the player wrapping a bandage around their arm. Far Cry is about getting personal with the world and the protagonist, and so far, 5 is the one with the least of that.
But I don't think it's a bad game, fighting the enemy feels great, hunting feels really nice, and you can fish!
There are many weapons you can customize and many different ways to kill Peggies, you also have a shovel as a melee weapon which I gotta admit I used a lot more than I probably should and it was real fucking funny everytime

Overall, it's a pretty good game, even if it has a lot of technical issues I have to say I enjoyed myself, especially at the end while I was going against Jacob I really feel like the game shined and I had a lot of fun. Also the game looks pretty gorgeous but that's no surprise. Also also, the endings are probably the best FC has seen so far and I loved every one of them, super fucking metal, definetly left me speechless for a good 30 minutes",1703798891,1703799084,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The idea that Ubisoft would tackle a controversial subject such as religion aids to the unique feeling of this game and the world it build. Joseph Seed and his underlings is eerily reminiscent of real world cults, and helps build a gang of followers that could 100% happen in real life. The combat is smooth and satisfying, and the gun sounds and play are fantastic. Furthermore, this game is does not take is self seriously all the time, which helps keep the player engaged in story changes. Being able to maul cultists to death with a hillbilly and a brown bear never gets old. Because this is an older title, I do think that $60 is a bit much of an asking price.

- a completed boss fight doesn't feel like an acomplishment, especially when you don't habe a real ending, which doesn't feel satisfying 
- the keys you have to press for special takedowns can be seen on the screen for only a split second  
- the world feels to crowded NPCs and player often get attacked by animals too often, and many times a dialog gets interrupted because an hostiles drive by, even when they are not attacking. Also during a mission it can be annoying having to deal with hostiles, that are not connected to the mission

This is without any doubt one of the best games I have played in the last 10+ years and in terms of storytelling, world building and immersion it is among the very best of everything I've ever played.

The nameless silent protagonist and having the option to disable every single UI icon/bar/hint are two massive +'s for me as this made me never ever feel like the immersion or pacing got broken.

I played through the game once on hard and once on infamous and it was a pleasure, from start to end both times.

This one feels much higher in every detail of the open world, and the sheer depth of the gameplay mechanics, compared to the usual Ubisoft games. This feels like it was partly done by Rockstar North at times.

Pros:
1. Brilliant open world. Hope County, Montana is detailed. 
2. So much to do. Prepper stashes, the phone calls, voicemails left behind, all contribute to the brilliance and character of the open world. 
3. Antagonists. All 4 antagonists are well done. Jacob, John, Faith have their own character and, Joseph...Greg Bryk's portrayal of Joseph Seed is very much, in one word, surprisingly good.
4. Lore. The lore in this game is better than any Far Cry game till date, and I mean it.
5. Gameplay. It's smoother, well refined, and most bugs have been squashed out by now. Gunplay is extremely fluid. 
6. Optimisation. I ran it on an i5 650, R7 240, with 8gb RAM and I still get around 25 FPS on low. 
7. GFH. Guns for Hire are a welcome upgrade, thankfully.
8. The soundtrack of this game and thye music chosen is pretty solid on all fronts.
9. Graphics. With the HD texture pack installed, this is really a great looking game. 

Cons:
1. Capture Parties. 'Nuff said.
2. Classic Ubisoft issues. The basic enemies having very similar faces, having 3 recruited companion GFH with same name, and stuff like that.
3. Online matchmaking. On PC, it's terrible. Not sure about Consoles.

Notes:
1. This game is the most fun I ever had in a Far Cry game, or any Ubisoft game for that matter. Shovels? New melee weapons can be used as projectiles? Hell yeah
2. The setting actually worked.
3. The GFH at times has pretty shitty AI.
4. Likeable sound design.The in game radio is INSANE 
5. I kinda actually like the endings. 
6. The story is actually good if you dig up enough evidence and go into ''Conspiracy Theory'' mode. Otherwise the story may feel disjointed.
7. Brilliant level design.
8. Why the fuck is ''Leaving Mission Area'' still a thing Ubi?
9. The amount of story defining choices is limited. 
10. FC Arcade is extremely great, and it's sad that FC6 won't have it.

Is it worth the money? Well, I got it on sale, for 15 USD. Certainly worth it.

IS IT WORTH THE FULL PRICE TAG?

[b] The Negative's [/b]

[b] The Aspect Of The Game [/b]
[i] You play as Rook a new deputy working for a local police department in Hope Montana. You, a sheriff, a few deputies and a U.S. Marshall step into a cult ridden valley to arrest Joseph Seed a notorious cult leader in the region that spouts on about the end of times. [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] Now I have played this game many times in the past but just recently finally finished it with the help of friends. Couldn't bring myself to play the game by myself. The story line of the game is semi decent that tries to make you think if you are the good guy or bad guy in the story but it's obvious when you look around at what the cult has done to the people of Hope County who the real bad guys really are. You play a[spoiler]s the most kidnappable[/spoiler] deputy and go through three different regions of hope county taking down the cult by eliminating each part of the seed family. Each boss battle for the region is unique and fitting for them. Honestly the best part of the game is being able to play it with friends because doing everything by yourself gets boring dull after awhile since a lot of the game is rinse and repeat with each region. Sure they add a new enemy in each region but it doesn't change from what you normally do. The ending was what about what I expected from a doomsday cult and [spoiler]the best ending is really just to walk away at the start of the game and avoid all this from the start.[/spoiler] [/i]

[b] The Value Of The Game [/b]
[i] If you have a friend to play with and like the Far Cry games this isn't a bad one to pick up when it goes on sale.  [/i]

The Setting is brilliant and basically describes the regional USA version of an early 2025-style Great Reset with all its nitty/nasty details.
From Bioweapon-infected and completely drugged up, 5G-zapped Zombie-type enemies shedding mRNA all over the place, fairly credible cultists defending their suicide sect to the last breath, Bill Gates/Fauci/WEF-type contaminated Water, Plants and Animals all the way to a broad array of natural wildlife and scenery.
And yes, even a turkey can get angry and won't recognize the open brandishing of an M60 to settle a local dispute.

On the have-side everything from helpless hikers, hostages over to folks who pick up a gun after being freed, drive-by assistance by random 2nd amendment folks reacting to nearby gunfire all the way to ex Soldiers, Specialists and Preppers lending a helpful hand.

Compared to FarCry 4, where - by far - the biggest threat to you were local MiniVan NPC Drivers (anyone remember these? Oh the horror of these days...) or 90% of the local population seemingly perma-spamming for what sounded like a famous local Toothpaste Brand ( ""The Golden Path"" (tm) )...
FarCry 5 comes around very quickly as potentially(*) >very< immersive.
Bullet drop & TOF (time of flight) give you basic ballistic Gameplay rarely seen in games these days, so landing a long-range sniper shot on a moving target takes a little work.

Adding to that is the eerie Soundscape which I found absolutely awesome.
Nothing beats being a tad low on ammo and scooting around with one or two buddies you recruited through a forest at night and hearing that weirdo cult music from a far distance as you slowly move closer.
Especially on the Sound experience, that's close to a 10 out of 10 in my view (well, hearing).
FarCry5 Audio really shows off when played on good, loud speakers.
Getting bullet/arrow impact audio (emphazised) with natural range delay just adds to the Audio satisfaction.

Even NPCs chatting amongst themselves and your recruited special NPCs specifically reacting to each other individually in their own style takes quite a while before it gets old.

In all of that, humor isn't lost though and there's a serious number of Side-Missions or NPC lines that made me chuckle.
Comments on ""don't worry about Tower Climbing"", snarky self-reflection on FarCry Blood Dragon or admitting to using every conceivable cliché about Preppers... FarCry 5 has you covered ;)

----------------------------------------

(*) ...but there's the drawbacks on the immersion potential. And sadly, while they're a bit isolated, they are huge when they hit.

- Vehicles are bullet soakers for smaller calibres and yes, that includes windshields of even basic vehicles.., well not too bad and a .50cal or AP Ammo kinda fixes that
- the magic Bliss Bullets aka ""Story Bullets"" that hit you eventually during Story progression no matter what you do, allowing the bad guys to hijack you despite being surrounded by an army of friendlies smashing the hunting party chasing you
- maybe the worst of them IMHO, that magic Star Trek Teleporter Tech that even allows Story bad guys to warp you out of existence anywhere and anytime, even from a bunker. Just bizarre. If they have 25th century tech, why would any of their cult army or their regional bosses even have to bother to fight anyone?

Now I get that the Storyline Narration was intended to progress - but the way they did it (at least for me) was an absolute immersion-killer. A big shame.
IMHO one of the worst wrongdoings UbiSoft could have possibly done here, which is super unfortunate because it otherwise shines on immersion like few Games I've seen in the last years. The resulting Contrast/Break that creates is just way too big (at least I strongly feel that way).

No Spoilers... but the (most probable/typical) ending strangely follows that new path (Golden Path ??!?) of ""inevitable outcomes"" first seen to some extent in FarCry 4, which UbiSoft seemingly having dived into for some... psychological conditioning reason or something (?).
This kinda kills the entire Player Agenda thingy... I don't like that. But at least you get to keep going until the very end until you get screwed over one way or another.

-----------------------------------------

To make a long story short, FarCry 5 is a keeper and definitely recommended despite a few distinct shortcomings.
Replay value btw. is a thing here, as there's likely quite a few useful things the average Player only discovers a tad too late in the Game. Difficulty and another Weapon set/progression approach was more than enough for me to make a re-run.

PS.
I can't even explain why...

+ Far Cry Arcade

-  Preexisting glitch that prevents reverse/descend trigger controls on gamepad 
This doesn't completely break the game or prevent story progression by any means; However, it does beg the question how a title could release over half a decade ago and still contain a bug that prevents an action as simple as reverse in a vehicle or descend in a plane/helicopter.. Sloppy work on the devs part. Certainly bogged down flying segments

- Ubisoft Connect game launcher // uplay dog water

- Soap opera narrative. If Far Cry 4s try hard villain, Pagan Min , felt unconvincing.. The father has the symbol of a crown tattooed on his chest, reminiscent of 'king/queen' hoodies- complete w/ grade school desk carvings engraved across the rest of his body. The more you focus on the Fathers shallow tattoos, the less intimidating and more comedic his character/demeanour becomes. Leading to some cringe dialogue sequences
 
Repetitive mechanics & persistent bugs lead to a promising if not derived, frustrating experience. If you've played FC3 and any of the subsequent releases in the franchise, this instalment should feel hauntingly familiar. Far Cry 3 had soul, Far Cry 5 lacks soul & serves 'crown' example as the shell of a former self

Added note: Turns out you need to beat each boss solo to unlock the guns and perks in Co-op. This is a massive oversight and makes you feel like you play a glass cannon when your player one partner has the 300% health perk. You have to go back and grind solo to find a rocket if you want to buy it for later, you need to do all the resistance points for the M249 again even though you did all the missions with your partner.

Probably going to be my only play through, and I'm not even going to bother with the DLC. If you're aren't familiar with the Far Cry series, then summarily it's a choose your own playstyle first person shooter/stealth game. None of the mechanics are very deep, but what's there is fun and great for a mindless gaming session. The theme of FC5 is religious zealots in rural North America.

If you are familiar with the Far Cry series, then it is mostly the same. I noticed less towers to climb to reveal the map and less reliance on hunting animals for skins to improve equipment or skills. 

I give the game an 8 out of 10, and if it is on good sale, then go for it. As for the DLC, none of it seems appealing, so I think I'm ready to move on to another game before I tryout New Dawn and FC6.",1702943144,1702943144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it was alright. i enjoyed the setting and the parallels with real american stuff- though i would have appreciated if they dived into that a bit more, though obviously if they get too spicy and realistic you risk offending more people so eh what can you expect from a AAA game. i think the story left a little to be desired, particularly with the ending(s). i dont hate what they were going for, but in my opinion they werent executed the best. 

in general the story felt a little slapped together, with some things never quite adding up. (for example, bliss is ~one~ drug that seemingly effects people completely differently, unrelated ways depending on the plot which comes across as pretty contrived. sometimes its a tranquilizer, sometimes its mind control, sometimes its...telepathic? maybe i missed something but it left me confused.

on the subject of game mechanics its a bit of a mixed bag. to me the guns feel super weak and weightless due to the lack of visual feedback in the shooting animations. i swear the ai has a tendency to shoot you through smoke and trees and things that they shouldnt be able to see you through (because you cant see them). on the other hand the guns are still serviceable and still decently fun to use; unlike the animations the sound design on them feels nice and punchy like it should. takedowns are fun, bow and throwing knives are fun, and the cult music is...actually kinda good and i found myself listening to it way more than the other stations lol.

i like to play games for the story first and gameplay second, ideally both ofc. so for me the story being kinda mid hurts it a lot for me. and for goofing around in an open world sandbox, i will personally lean towards rdr2 or gta v, however there is still a decent bit to do. the gameplay still is decent if not a bit frustratingly-designed at times.",1702871871,1702871871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

outstanding! fluid mech with fun side missions & NPC chars,exhilarating action from battle, hunting, zipcords squirrel suits planes heli's boats explosions  overall  Ive NEVER NOT HAD FUN especially in co op infact id say this is 1 of if not THE BEST co op XP in a game ive ever played! Its just fun for all the right reasons.. 
End.

!!!!Caution!!!!
...FOR THOSE OF YOU THINKING ABOUT PLAYING FARCRY 6 My Advice is simple DONT!! It is the opposite of this game in nearly everyway, clunky, troublesome, restricted controls that wont even let you map any button more  than 1time over EVERY category! why?
The story does look interesting (especially El pollo jefe) but at the price of all gameplay! it hurts to play fc6!

On A personal note..
Iam severely let down by some of the deplorably unforgivable actions of ubisoft recently, stealing peoples money AND MORE IMPORTANTLY peoples joy in such shitty times as these! We are all very dam familiar with loss.. now people are loosing their accounts and having games that they had bought outright, fair and square STOLEN BACK and turned into monthly payments like we can afford to pay rent for games (rocksmith), or just cause they saw a chance to reclaim it. I would not usually mention this in another review but it is SO damming to the infinitesimal shred of piece of mind we have left right now that I URGE you UBIs These actions are more toxic than releasing bliss into our water supply!
Come on now unbisoft you want us all to rage quit you outright?? 
You promote calm and free feelings inside these games yet in real life YOU are John seed and co! This has to stop now!

All I know is gaming consumerism should not be equivalent to smearing yourself in ketchup and standing in a hungry rainforest or jungle!!!!!!!

Ok lets keep this short... ish [Mission Very verY Failed!]. there are a great deal of things to talk about but if were talking about the game it self this is a far cry pleasure to play all day everyday, unrelenting zealot smothering fun. utter elation explosive joyous addictive thrill seeking sky diving pyrotechnic ragnarock for stuntmen.

If were talking about the story oh.. oh dear. look I know its your job  to make the enemies hate-able to vilify them, it adds an unstoppable ambivalent emotive to the game play, however I think in this case ubi took it a lil bit too far. I mean I fucking HATE them in this game and not even cause they torture you, they kill your friends, they try and get you to live as their zoney bliss freak and they hert your dog, but if they only knew how truely annoying they where theyd know all theyd actually have to do to put the fear of god/anubus/dave the sacred guardian of spagetti or whoever in to us, is say ok i think its time we have a looooong sit down (DUN--DUN) so we can have a serious (uh oh!) heart to heart ...TALK! {NOOOOOO0o!} 
and every s.o.b in the district would be trying to microwave their own head if it ment avoiding the dull onslaught of religious sacra merd bibble babble ....whats that iam sorry did you say something i was busy gouging my skull out in to a functional gourd so i could drink my own Liquefied brains.

I followed all the cryptic clues of the cut scene animator into the desert where in a odd excavation site I found a somehow perfect representation of the artists sanity made intricately out of powdered mash potato, dont ask me how I know, I just do. that apart the recess was empty.. no skip key to be found.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2771411500
That said its mostly the beginning cuts u cant skip. I find ctl + esc helpfull here, turn off audio then just fill in the cut scene speech with something abit more interesting (nearly anything would work. in co op we took turns putting words in their mouths,our version was decidedly better.)

OK NOW WE GET TO THE WTF PART OF THIS GAME THE PART THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR SUCH A VERY VERY HIGH PRICED GAME!
THE BLOODY achievements DONT UNLOCK

<RANT IMMINENT rant imminent RANT IMMINENT rant imminent RANT IMMINENT>
and i know a load of you might be thinking why ? WHy THE CROCK GHOST OF PRESIDENTIAL STALE URINE SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS THEY DONT GET YOU ANYTHING, THATS TRUE ENOUGH IF YOU DONT COUNT EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE AND EXTENDED SKILL SETS cousre if you dont count these you have to kind of wonder how you got this far or if on a full moon your flesh tears asunder revealing a slathering accountant. If a game is good you dont need free stuff to justify it, (but marking out a line means you can actively chart your improvement, wich makes the game a more ideal ground to practice progressively.) ..if that where logic then no1 wouldve played any game ever. there was no stuff unlocks just the satisfaction of a game well played, wich Incidentally is the same satisfaction that humankind have been successfully utilising since always to achieve records and other general feats of evolutionary endeavour AND while I do see the need to argue with individual preference, just as i clearly see the need to shout the passing storms into submission I try not to waste too much time in these pursuits as sometimes it becomes a lil counter productive, like climing a mount without food then starting at yr own feet and munching  until your an ouroborus ball & spin A deadly velocity to the pointed bottom of rock jam mountain. (Last paragraph - case in point)

While it has its flaws, which I will try list fairly, there are other things in this game that makes it very special. Just to be clear, while I've only got 29 hours playing it on Steam, I've played it through Ubisoft for more than a hundred hours, completed it, completed the DLCs, and have come back again to it multiple times. What I love is:

1. This has got one of the most engrossing casts of characters, bad guys and towns people, you will meet. The pinnacle bad guy, Joseph Seed, is wonderfully fleshed out, and his ""kids"" have distinct, equally vicious personalities.
2. The ability to partner with named NPCs, some named animals, and occasional random NPCs is also a lot of fun and allows you to add a small amount of tactical play to your various missions and stalking efforts. 
3. Similar to Far Cry 4, you have a nice array of weapons available, mission types, the ability to conquer and bring to your side various outposts and installations.
4. The game allows you to enjoy some stealth play. You can lay down an awful lot of bad guys with bows, thrown knives, and silencers and enjoy a stealth like experience even though it's probably not the most challenging stealth you can game. 
5. The land is absolutely beautiful and has so much going on that you can use this game as a walking, hunting or fishing simulator from time to time. You can go animal hunting with bow or rifle with your trusty dog, or for a real trip, bring your mountain lion or bear. There have been times I've strolled into a camp with someone playing the guitar and a couple dancing, and the location is very chill and has nothing to do with the story. 
6. You can ""paper doll"" to you heart's content... there are SO many cosmetic options with complete outfits, but also hats, gloves, tops and bottoms... very fun and a lot of them fit well within the story context.
7. The Dan Brown soundtrack is brilliant. Imitating rural commune and religious folk music, the songs line up with the cult context the bad guys have created. The tunes are catchy, the songs and lyrics brilliantly original, and all in all it adds immensely to the immersion. In FC5, the music is not just background, it is part of the world you are adventuring in.
8. The scripted elements are excellently written and eventually become haunting with some brainwashing you can't avoid. Bewitching!
9. I'm not a puzzle guy, but the puzzles in FC5 are doable, intuitive for the most part, and fun... again... for the most part. 
10. You can fly airplanes and helicopters... a great way to see the beauty of the land and move about it quickly.

On the downside, Far Cry 5 has been heavily critiqued so you may have heard some of these already.
1. Perhaps the most significant complaint against the way the story flows it that there are scripted moments where you WILL be captured temporarily as an story element to detail Joseph Seed's boss minions--his ""kids"". Was always frustrating when I was owning Hope County and was totally armed for bear, but because it was scripted, it just happened. Still, the story elements in each case were very well done. 
2. The game balance gets thrown off by some of the weapons you have free access to. For example, in FC5, you can take a belt loading machine gun, stick a sniper scope on it and a silencer. Yep. You heard it. You may not use a more realistic weapon for the rest of the game. And it WILL throw the balance off... way OP. But then... if you have the space adventure DLC and you add the futuristic weapons to the game, fuggedaboutit! Surprise! Surprise! Earthlings have nothing that can compete with your Star Trek period weaponry.
3. The linear game flow is tight... there may be a couple of different endings, but in general, the game is gonna lead to an ending... but I guess in the Far Cry series, you're used to that by now. :-)
4. I'm not sure this is a downside, but FC5 is not as immense in geography as FC4. Especially if you're in the air, it doesn't take long to traverse Hope County. I find myself wishing it was bigger. Than again, I loved FC4. 

All in all, FC5 is a gorgeous game with a great storyline, and its characters and plot will get to you and stay in your memory for a very long time. It is open world despite the linear nature of the storyline and you can basically take on the game's challenges in any order, although the different regions and sub-boss storylines do vary in difficulty. I did them in suggested order and recommend it... especially for noobies.

Far Cry® 5 is an FPS (first person shooter) video game. The game is set in a rural area of Montana called Hope County. The protagonist is a deputy sheriff. The main antagonist is an apocalyptic cult called Eden's Gate, led by a fanatical leader named Joseph Seed. The game's graphics, sounds, music and animations are very high quality and realistic. The story of the game tells the struggle of the deputy sheriff to save the people of Hope County from the cult. The atmosphere of the game draws you in and you join a fiery resistance 😍

## 🌟 Pros of the game

- What I like about the game is that I can go wherever I want on the open world map, use various weapons, vehicles and animals, play alone or in pairs with a friend, do different quests, side quests, activities, fight with the members and leaders of the cult. These features make the game both free and fun. For example, I can find many places, mysteries, easter eggs to explore on the map, change my weapons and vehicles as I wish, befriend or hunt animals, cooperate with a friend by playing co-operatively, progress by completing missions and side quests, and engage in conflicts with the members and leaders of the cult. These choices affect the outcome of the game and offer me different endings. This makes the game more interesting and varied. 😎
- The game also has a lot of secret and extra content. This content enriches the game even more and adds new mechanics, levels, characters, stories. For example, in each chapter, you can find hidden bags, chests, plates and collect them to earn extra money, weapons, equipment, knowledge, find hidden caves, islands, regions and encounter challenging enemies or puzzles, find secret missions and complete them to get new weapons, vehicles, animals, unlock secret achievements and brag about them. I can also access the game's downloadable content, play through different environments and scenarios in the three-part storyline Hours of Darkness, Lost on Mars and Dead Living Zombies, play Far Cry® 3 Classic Edition, and try different maps and modes in Arcade mode. This content adds to the replayability and rewarding nature of the game. 😊

## Cons of the game

- What I don't like about the game is that sometimes it has too many errors, bugs, glitches, sometimes it is too repetitive, sometimes it is too ridiculous. When the game has too many bugs, glitches and glitches, it can be frustrating and annoying. The reason for these problems may be that the game requires too many system requirements or the game is not optimised. To resolve these issues, I can lower the game settings, update the game, verify the game files, or reinstall the game. I can also get help or share my problems on the game's support page or forums. 😢
- The fact that the game is very repetitive may not actually be a disadvantage, because I can get used to it, but sometimes I might want the game to be more varied and surprising. In this case, I can change the game by playing extra content. The fact that the game is very silly can actually be an advantage, because I can find the game funnier and more entertaining. But sometimes, I might want the game to be more logical and realistic. In this case, I can search the internet to better understand the game's story, characters and mechanics, visit the game's wiki page or forums, read interviews or reviews by Ubisoft, the game's creator, and try to find the game's hidden content. 😕

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Far Cry 5 delivers an unforgettable gaming experience that seamlessly combines intense action, an immersive open world, and a compelling narrative that keeps players on the edge of their seats. From the moment I stepped into the sprawling landscapes of Hope County, I knew I was in for a wild ride.

The game's attention to detail is simply outstanding. The picturesque Montana setting is brought to life with stunning visuals, capturing the essence of the rural wilderness and small-town charm. Whether soaring through the skies in a plane or navigating the dense forests on foot, every inch of Hope County feels meticulously crafted and ripe for exploration.

What truly sets Far Cry 5 apart is its dynamic storytelling. The game introduces a charismatic and enigmatic antagonist, Joseph Seed, whose charismatic presence permeates every corner of the map. The cult he leads adds an eerie layer of tension to the narrative, keeping players guessing and eager to uncover the mysteries of Hope County. The freedom to tackle the game's objectives in any order adds a refreshing element of choice, allowing players to shape their own path through the chaos.

Gameplay is where Far Cry 5 truly shines. The diverse arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and tools provides players with endless options for creative mayhem. The introduction of Guns for Hire adds depth to the gameplay, as each companion brings a unique set of skills and personalities to the table. Whether I was stealthily infiltrating an enemy outpost or engaging in a full-blown firefight, the gameplay remained consistently exhilarating and satisfying.

Multiplayer co-op is seamlessly integrated, allowing friends to join the chaos and tackle missions together. The cooperative experience enhances the game's already impressive replay value, turning every session into a new adventure filled with unpredictable moments and collaborative strategies.

Far Cry 5 isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey that captivates players from start to finish. With its breathtaking visuals, engaging storyline, and dynamic gameplay, it's no wonder that this installment in the Far Cry series has become a timeless classic. Ubisoft has truly hit the mark with Far Cry 5, delivering an experience that will keep players coming back for more.

I played FC3 and FC4 on Playstation and enjoyed both of them immensely. I recently replayed FC3 on PC and am currently FC5 on PC, using a PS5 Controller (I don't have a PS5, it's just my preferred controller).
Strangely, I can run FC5 at much higher settings than FC3, and get much better FPS. Better optimisation I suppose.
If you do want to play with a PS5 controller on the PC, I recommend using DS4Windows, as FC5 does not directly support the PS5 controller. With DS4W you can map the PS5 to a PS4 controller, which is supported by FC5.",1701844671,1701844733,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Overall is a fun and good game and recommended, not perfect but still good game.

Pros:
+amazing graphic
+amazing enviornment and atmosphere
+very good optimization
+Total freedom in exploring the map
+Amazing details on the map. I love game which shows detail, such as vibrant shops with this and that element, not just plain map laid open before you and put several properties here and there without any estetique.


Cons:
-Gun shooting effect feels very weak, it's like we're shooting peas and that worsened by the fact sometimes the gun does not deal high damage to un-armored enemies.
-still an easy game even in hard difficulty. 
-STORY ENDING RUINS EVERYTHING.
-stealth is not as OP/cool as Farcry 3! Not as cool as FC 4 too! The chain stealth is amazing in previous game. In here? NAH. None.
-Forced kidnappings is a joke. It's a lazy way to force a story progression in your character in a spesific place. Also a cheap story getaway. Shud've just kill the main character. It shows how easy, and weak and vulnerable our character is to a tranqulizing dart and got kidnapped in front of everybody. For the sake of gameplay technicality only, i will overlook this. 
-lack of starting weapons
-lack weapon variaties
-no more crafting using animal skin is a minus for me. it made me enjoy animal hunting, but not as much as in this game.
-No ingame chat!!
-Main character has no voice cast. Lame. Jason was much better. (FC3)
-Characters are shallow. In FC3, I know some characters with good voice acting and good story/scene. The final poker and the torture scene was aweosme in FC3.
-NO POKER GAME!!!


MILD SPOILER:
-That one music that can trigger mind hallucination?? WHEN DID WE EVEN GOT BRAINWASHED? I hate the force kidnappings. 
-For Faith Seed, is she even real?? Never mentioned.
-WHERE IS THE ARMY when the whole town is in litteraly war!?!? Is there no cop going in and out? AT ALL??? No one slipped out thru mountain cracks??
-THE ENDING SUCKS SO BAD. PLEASE CHANGE IT.

CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATION:
TBH Overall I recommend to buy at heavily discounted price. DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE A PERSON WHO CONSIDERS LORE OR STORY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE ENDING IS VERY DISSAPOINTING.

But it gets easy at times and theres not  much aspect of the game after it ends, also rarely my friends play this so it's hard to do things, even we got allies, the game gets way too easy. Just RPG em and stuff. Oh and the ending probably wont left you satisfied. The scenery is awesome. The main story and ending is a freaking let down! 

Do not take seriously on deep elements of this game. I think this game is made for more casual players, who loves strolling around gunblazing or stealthily.

Again, very recommended to get on heavy sale.",1595123921,1701830002,True,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The game isn't innovative and it's not that great. I personally found the story in particular very boring (other titles of this game series were better). The setting was also quite plain and boring and doesn't come close to Far Cry 4 or Far Cry Primal in terms of tension.

What's great is that you can shoot your way through the entire campaign with a friend. The fact that I was able to play the game with my brother made it quite entertaining. The coop is definitely the best part about Far Cry 5.",1701823811,1701823811,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Good gunplay
-You can shovel people
-Montana

-The amount of bugs 
-The fact that enemies stop spawning (or at least in lower numbers) after finishing a region

Pros:

Engaging Open World: Hope County is a stunning and expansive open-world environment that feels alive with diverse landscapes, wildlife, and dynamic weather, providing a rich backdrop for exploration.

Compelling Storyline: The narrative is gripping, tackling controversial themes with a fresh perspective. The charismatic antagonist, Joseph Seed, adds depth to the plot, making it one of the series' more memorable stories.

Freedom of Approach: Far Cry 5 excels in giving players the freedom to approach objectives in various ways. Whether it's stealth, brute force, or a combination of both, the game accommodates different playstyles.

Companion System: The game introduces a compelling companion system, allowing players to recruit allies with unique skills. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay, making encounters more dynamic and enjoyable.

Fantastic Soundtrack: The game features a diverse and fitting soundtrack that enhances the atmosphere. The music seamlessly complements the action, intensifying the gaming experience.

Weapon Variety and Customization: A wide array of weapons is at your disposal, and the customization options allow players to fine-tune their arsenal to suit their preferences, providing a satisfying level of personalization.

Cons:

Repetitive Side Missions: While the main storyline is engaging, some of the side missions and activities can feel repetitive after a while. More variety in the optional content could enhance the overall experience.

Unrealistic AI: At times, the enemy AI can behave unrealistically, leading to moments of frustration. Improved enemy intelligence could make encounters more challenging and satisfying.

Minor Technical Glitches: While not game-breaking, there are occasional technical glitches and bugs that can temporarily disrupt immersion. Continued patching and updates could address these issues.

Lack of Meaningful Choices: Despite the game's themes of resistance and rebellion, some players may find the lack of impactful choices in the narrative disappointing. More branching storylines based on player decisions could add depth to the overall experience.

Limited Character Development: While the main villain is intriguing, some of the supporting characters lack the depth and development needed to form strong emotional connections. More fleshed-out character arcs could enhance the overall storytelling.

Conclusion:

Far Cry 5 delivers an exhilarating and visually stunning open-world experience with a captivating storyline and excellent gameplay mechanics. While it may have some minor flaws, the overall package offers an engaging adventure that is sure to satisfy fans of the series and newcomers alike. The combination of a vibrant world, diverse gameplay options, and a compelling narrative makes Far Cry 5 a worthy addition to the franchise.",1701628648,1701628648,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

Here some points to convince you:
[list]
    [*]Graphics are very good. Montana looks stunning and I have used included photo mod for quite a few time just to capture some nice views.
    [*]The gameplay is solid. There is usually a multiple of tactics to use when completing missions (stealth, aggressive stealth, call in full-blown air support, etc.) and the game acts according depending on what you do.
    [*]The story, quests and villains are engaging. There were a few side quests that I would rather fast forward thru, but none of them overstays their welcome.

The Far Cry series is perhaps my favorite series of games to ever come out.

I've played almost all the Far Cry series, but this one is probably the weakest.

Even as a kid I played Far Cry 1 on my old pentium and enjoyed the relaxing game, but where Far Cry has reached today is really amazing how times change in this gaming world :)


❌
For this Far Cry, the developers decided to change the map, shooting, markers, etc. in a slightly drastic way.

The developers probably thought that players would get used to this novelty, but it caused rather negative reactions from people.

In general, until Far Cry 4, everything was fine, we always had great villains, maps, weapons, just a few hours of fun, but after this release of these new Far Cry series, it seems to me that this company is going down the drain. (of course now Far Cry 6 came out which had a great trailer, graphics and story I hope so too so hopefully when I play Far Cry 6 I won't have the same feeling as these Far Cry",1701375636,1701375636,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

I've played them all and really liked them. Then life hit me, kids, work, stuff like that and I didnt play them for around 1.5 years. Then recently I wanted to get into gaming again. But when I wanted to start up Far Cry 5, i didnt work. I corresponded with Ubisoft Support and they told me that they deleted my Ubisoft Account because of inactivity, even tho i had paid games on that account. If i wanted to play, i had to buy the games again. I found out they delete account after 6 months of inactivty.
That is a really crazy, greedy way to treat your customers and loyal fans. So i will no longer support Ubisoft and I've played my last game from them.

I do not recomend supporting the thieving and greedy Ubisoft.


Edit: Lots of people calling me a liar hmm. Why would I lie about this? What would I gain from it? I have no idea why some accounts havent been deleted and why some have. My experience is based on my own account and the correspondance with Ubisoft Support, which id happily show you, if I could upload pics on here. The only purpose of this is to warn others.

And since the games are tied to your ubisoft account, it doesent matter that you buy them on Steam. Mine were bought on Steam.

Heres is a Copy/Paste of one of the Emails I Recevied. Dont mind the different username. Thats what I use on my Ubisoft Account.

Hello Buchart94

Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Support

I understand that you are having an activation issue with Far Cry 5.

It seems that it was activated on an account that was deleted. This means you will no longer be able to play the game and will have to purchase it again on the current account that you are using.

We know that this outcome is not ideal for you and thank you for your co-operation and understanding regarding this.

Please feel free to contact us for any questions or concerns that you may have and we will be happy to assist you further.

Have a great day and thank you again for being part of the Ubisoft Community. Take Care!

Kind regards,

The typical open-world formula seen in other Ubisoft games actually works in this, meaning that the abundance of side-missions do in fact keep you entertained. Although GTA is in another league, Far Cry 5 still beats GTA in one aspect. After a certain time, GTA open-world starts to feel hollow and bland, THAT isn't the case with Far Cry 5. The characters are likeable, there's a good interaction mechanic with NPCs; it's not perfect or super-realistic but it's fun and that's where the game succeeds. You can also do bunny hop, Villains are awesome, Story can be finished at the first mission itself, Add-On(s) are cool and LASTLY, you can recruit a dog to play alongside you.

Money becomes a non-issue if you explore the game's content a bit more thoroughly. Many of the weapons have the exact same stats and many of the vehicle types are identical, so it just boils down to what aesthetic you prefer. You can make a lot of money by hunting and fishing; the latter being the more time consuming of the two. When you loot an animal you get bait, which can be used to immediately spawn in the predators which inhabit the your current area.Once you purchase the weapons that suit your play style, the money will begin to accumulate quite substantially.

There is maybe 1-2 hours of actual plot in this game, the remaining 45ish hours of game is spent playing the same mission three times. Each of these missions is split further into 3 parts based on your ""resistance"" in the region to make the game feel longer. Each of the missions ends in the Same. Exact. Way. and you know the ending of the game once you start your first play through. 

But what about those 150+ missions that you can go on? Every single one of them is a chore. ""Go to 'X' and kill 'Y'"" or ""Go to 'Z' and collect 'W'"" sometimes they get really advanced and make you do ""Go to 'A' than go to 'B' than go to 'C' follow companion '1' and than kill 'X' and yippie companion '1' will now be available to follow you"" and my favorite is the classic warcraft ""kill 10 'X' class enemies."" 

Well the companions you mentioned earlier they must be cool though right? Every. Single. Character. that is supposed to be a good guy is either a redneck because ""hahahahaha rural people with guns that vote republican are stupid hahahahahaha"" or a whiny looser with dyed hair because some of the devs probably spent more time on Tumbler instead of coding the game. All these characters got so annoying I clicked the ""walk away"" ending just so the bad guys would win and all the characters would die. And I couldn't even have this since if you click that ending it just puts you back in the game right before the final mission and you have to go through the actual ""Ubisoft approved"" ending

Also the game is riddled with game breaking bugs! Wanna just fall through the floor at random strips of road with no warning? You'll love Far Cry 5! Wanna have your companion just walk through a cliff side and get stuck behind the world? You'll love Far Cry 5! The best part about these bugs is that a hard reset wont fix them, checking the integrity of the files wont fix them, and heaven forbid you ask a forum how to fix them. The only solution that I've found is to completely uninstall and reinstall the game, and with my internet that takes an hour to two hours. 

Well are the minigames enjoyable? The fishing game is novel... but loses its luster after a couple hours. Hunting is just another chore while also being the only real way to make in game money other than giving Ubisoft actual cash. The Arcade? you couldn't pay me to play a game in a game.

Graphically the game looks good for the first 3 hours you play it but than all the scenery just blends together. Every interior is the same, and the scenery doesn't change. This combined with the level of detail decisions that the devs made should be a crime against humanity. Everything looks okay from far away... but objects will not spawn if you aren't within 200 meters awayof said object. Also if there are more than 10 moving things on screen everything looks like clay. I kept the game resolution on Ultra High, and other than making my PC beg to be put down, none of these graphical issues went away. The only thing that remains high quality throughout the game is the characters arms but having your arms be super detailed and contrasted to an actual clayscape makes you feel a little sick.

What is the good part of the game? Ubisoft finally figured out how to make a good antagonist. Also the decision to make half the games soundtrack gospel music was a bold choice... but one that works well.

The incessant game of catch and release they play is not immersive and takes away from the story more than it adds.
The map sucks, the NPCs suck, the guns and vehicles are boring and the perk system sucks (no crafting for upgrades?). 

It is amazing that this game has no massive pushback and actually received praise. I am so disappointed i stopped midway through the third region and just read how it ends. The only redeeming value is the compelling and somewhat sympathetic villains.

There seems to be scripted events that occur when you gain resistance points that cannot be avoided, this can be annoying depending on what you're doing but otherwise this game is a pretty fun installment in the far cry series. A change they made was the inability to gain bait from every kill, so the infinite kill and sell strategy that worked for getting funds in far cry 4 is gone. Thankfully the vehicles and weapons aren't that expensive so it takes banking resources for roughly 20 minutes to get that item you have your eye on. I'm only in the first area but for the price i bought it for it's a steal. Definitely recommend getting this while you can (autumn sale).

But when I wanted to start up Far Cry 5, i didnt work. I corresponded with Ubisoft Support and they told me that they deleted my Ubisoft Account because of inactivity, even tho i had paid games on that account. If i wanted to play, i had to buy the games again. I found out they delete account after 6 months of inactivty.
That is a really crazy, greedy way to treat your customers and loyal fans. So i will no longer support Ubisoft and I've played my last game from them.

[h1]🎮[u]Gameplay:[/u][/h1]
[b]Overall enjoyable but quickly repetitive.[/b]

The gameplay has some similarities with its predecessors (Outposts, vehicles, combat etc.) but has some major differences :

- [b]Far Cry 5 doesn't hold your hand as much as before[/b]. At first, you will find yourself lost and wondering the map not understanding the objectives and not knowing what to do first. Then, after some time, you will gradually get used to it.

- The combat system is very similar, you can hold up to 3 main weapons, 1 one-handed gun and 1 melee weapon. There's a wide variety of weapons such as revolvers, shotguns, rifles, snipers, explosives, rocket launchers, bow and even an alien weapon. 
[b]Unfortunately, there are no knives as melee weapons meaning no knife takedowns[/b]. Although the takedown mechanics are the same, the gruesome visuals of takedowns are no longer there.

- [b]Something I really hate in this Far Cry game are the ""forced missions""[/b]. Meaning that at several points, while playing, exploring, doing a side quest etc. you will be tracked down and forced to do a main mission. Basically, there are 3 regions each having a ""boss"" and there's a progress bar for each region. The progress bar is divided in three parts and every 33% you are forced to do a main mission. It is extremely difficult to NOT add any progression to the progress bar as everything counts towards its progression. For example killing enemies, freeing hostages, liberating an outpost or doing a side quest. So it is extremely annoying when in a middle of a side quest you reach the 33% and are forced into another mission. The worst is when you reach the 100% and the game forces you to confront the region's boss (only applies to Faith and Jacob Seed). 

- After clearing the first region, I found the game quite repetitive. Strangely enough, I have spent much more time on Far Cry 4 and haven't got that feeling. I'm not sure, but maybe it's not varied enough, the side missions are too similar to one another or something is missing.


[h1]💀[u]Difficulty:[/u][/h1]
I played the game on hard
At first, the game was quite challenging, plus with very few skills and few weapons I died quite frequently. But after grinding skills and also getting used to the game mechanics it was really enjoyable to play on hard.
Note: there aren't any achievements for completing the game on hard or normal


[h1]⌛[u]Game length:[/u][/h1]
[b]~70 hours[/b] without fast travelling and all side quests included


[h1]📖[u]Story:[/u][/h1]
Overall, the story is [b]quite good but I wouldn't call it amazing[/b]. Global plot felt a bit bland, basically the whole plot is about the protagonist who is charged to stop the cult leaders and save their friends
[b]Character development[/b], on the other hand, was [b]very well made[/b] mainly for the antagonists. The antagonists' motives are interesting and original, different from the usual bad guy that wants to be powerful, rich etc. Their personalities and background are very complex and adds very well to their delusion.


[h1]🎬[u]Cinematic/Art:[/u][/h1]
Although it lacks in the plot, [b]Far Cry 5 has amazing cutscenes[/b] with beautiful colors and lighting, nice shots, great acting and a heavy atmosphere.
Unfortunately, the protagonist never speaks.

[h1]🎵[u]Music/Sound:[/u][/h1]
[url=https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4X2Zc9rCTH8]Cull the herd[/url]

The sound effects are well done, especially environmental sounds where you can hear the birds chirping, water flowing etc. Exploring with the nice sound effects makes it even more enjoyable.


[h1]💸[u]Price:[/u][/h1]
Although the game has 30+ hours of content, it's mostly copy-paste and I wouldn't pay full price for it. 
I'd recommend to [b]wait for sale[/b].


[h1]🚀[u]Requirements:[/u][/h1]
Surprisingly, I could run it smoothly on [b]high on an old GTX 1050 at an average of 40fps[/b].


[h1]🐞[u]Bugs:[/u][/h1]
Nothing game breaking.


[h1]📝[u]Final:[/u][/h1]
Overall, a good, entertaining and enjoyable game but it wasn't extremely impressive.

far cry 5 as a game is definitely an interesting concept except the devs don't know what the hell they are doing since they are ubisoft and they suck. very mediocre game play. the game-play is just boring and requires you to go to different regions killing bad guys or cultists and liberating places for a resistance we don't even know jack shit about. the villains have lots of potential but to bad ubisoft is lazy and cant even bother making it believable literally, its not worth the full price considering how boring and how lazy the writing is. i haven't even finished the game and im writing this review after being pissed off to many times in a single player game. i wouldn't even call it single player since it feels like its playing coop on solo mode. this is the type of far cry that deserves to be ignored, in fact id have to say far cry six is better than this. some of the missions can get stuck or you have to take a break in the middle of the mission because the game doesn't give you the Molotov or the explosive or even a way of transport so half of the time your stuck boots on the ground. i love the concept and love the location its just one of those games that have a lot of potential but the developers are to lazy or just don't care. and don't buy this game if you get second hand embarrassment really easily or hate it when people look at you directly because the cut scenes are honestly embarrassing 

Overall 2/10
Open World: 3/10 they at least tried. 
Gun-play: it doesn't encourage you to change weapons or try something new so im stuck with an AR-15
Graphics: 6/10 they are decent but could be better.

[u][b]English:[/b][/u]

Far Cry 5 is another installment in the popular first-person shooter game series that transports players to the perilous lands of Montana in the United States. Released in 2018, the game garnered significant attention due to its controversial storyline and open-world setting. Here's my review of Far Cry 5:

[b]Graphics:[/b]

Far Cry 5 astounds with its graphics and the meticulous detailing of Montana's open world. The landscapes are stunning, showcasing a variety of terrains, from mountain ranges to rural areas and lakes. They feature realistic textures, lighting effects, and a dynamic day and night cycle. Characters and creatures have also been carefully designed, adding realism to the game world.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

The game offers dynamic and exhilarating gameplay, typical of the Far Cry series. Players step into the shoes of a character known as the ""Deputy Sheriff,"" who aims to topple a religious cult called the ""Project at Eden's Gate,"" led by the charismatic Joseph Seed. In the game, you can make use of various weapons, vehicles, and gadgets to defeat your enemies. The combat system is smooth and satisfying, and the cooperative mode allows for shared gameplay with friends.

[b]Story:[/b]

Far Cry 5 stands out from previous entries in the series due to its controversial narrative. The game confronts players with the theme of religious fanaticism and mass manipulation. While some may consider this a bold approach, others may feel uneasy about the subject matter. However, it's worth noting that the story is intriguing and full of plot twists.

[b]Open World:[/b]

Montana is an enormous, open world that you can explore at your own pace. It's teeming with interesting side quests, challenges, and mysteries to uncover. The abundance of available vehicles and weapons makes traversing Montana consistently exciting.

[b]Music and Sound:[/b]

Far Cry 5 features an outstanding soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's atmosphere. Ambient music, natural sounds, and character dialogues contribute to immersing players in the game world.

[b]Summary:[/b]

Far Cry 5 is another successful entry in the series, offering excellent gameplay, beautiful graphics, and an intriguing storyline. However, due to its controversial theme of religion and fanaticism, it may not appeal to everyone. For those who appreciate dynamic gameplay and open worlds, Far Cry 5 will undoubtedly provide many hours of enjoyment.

Far Cry 5 to kolejna odsłona popularnej serii gier first-person shooter, która przenosi nas w niebezpieczne tereny Montany w Stanach Zjednoczonych. Gra, wydana w 2018 roku, zyskała dużą uwagę ze względu na swoją kontrowersyjną fabułę i otwarty świat. Oto moja recenzja gry Far Cry 5:

[b]Grafika:[/b]

Far Cry 5 zachwyca grafiką i detalami otwartego świata Montany. Pejzaże są piękne, z różnorodnością terenów, od górskich pasm po wiejskie okolice i jeziora. Charakteryzują się one realistycznymi teksturami, efektami świetlnymi i dynamicznym cyklem dnia i nocy. Postacie i stwory również zostały starannie zaprojektowane, co dodaje realizmu świata gry.

[b]Rozgrywka:[/b]

Gra oferuje dynamiczną i emocjonującą rozgrywkę, typową dla serii Far Cry. Gracz wciela się w postać zwaną ""Zastępcą Szeryfa,"" który próbuje obalić kult religijny o nazwie ""Zbawiciele Edena,"" dowodzony przez charyzmatycznego Josepha Seed'a. W grze możemy korzystać z różnorodnych broni, pojazdów i gadżetów, aby pokonać wrogów. System walki jest płynny i satysfakcjonujący, a tryb kooperacji pozwala na wspólną rozgrywkę z przyjaciółmi.

[b]Fabuła:[/b]

Far Cry 5 wyróżnia się od poprzednich części serii ze względu na kontrowersyjną fabułę. Gra konfrontuje graczy z tematem fanatyzmu religijnego i manipulacji masami. Choć niektórzy mogą uważać to za odważne podejście, inni mogą czuć się nieswojo wobec tego tematu. Warto jednak zauważyć, że fabuła jest intrygująca i pełna zwrotów akcji.

[b]Otwarty świat:[/b]

Montana jest ogromnym, otwartym światem, który można eksplorować według własnego uznania. Pełen jest interesujących zadań pobocznych, wyzwań i tajemnic do odkrycia. Wielość dostępnych pojazdów i broni sprawia, że podróżowanie po Montanie jest zawsze ekscytujące.

Given this game's penchant for wasting your time and forcing things on you that you don't want, I decided I would look up the endings to see if the game would waste ALL of my time, and yep, turns out all of the endings suck. The only good ending is the one where you don't handcuff the cult leader Joseph in the beginning, meaning the best ending is the one where you don't even play. 

You know what Ubisoft? I AGREE. Don't play this game. Far Cry 3, 4, Primal, or any of the Assassin's Creed games are vastly superior to this disaster.

My final review is even more negative than when I left it. Oh and uh, the person who designed the ""Patriot Acts"" mission can shove sand into their eyeballs and glue them shut.

Original review below:


Oh, were you playing the game? Sorry, you've been kidnapped for 5th time in an unskippable event that pulls you out of what you were doing and forces you to do something else.

What's that, you're having problems ""tailing a helicopter""? Why that's a perfectly reasonable mission when you're on foot and the only vehicle you have access to is on a steep winding mountain making it impossible to follow. You didn't know you needed the wingsuit? Well at least you only have one single save and cannot reload and earlier save and get it.

Every single time you start enjoying this game, Ubisoft makes sure you loathe it. Every time you start to actually get immersed into the game world, they rip you out of it and force you to do something else, always something you don't want to do. The save system is beyond garbage, there's only one save slot, and reloading a checkpoint saves all of the progress you don't want it to (that's why people reload saves, smoothbrains, why do you do this in every game?).

I'm going to keep playing and so my review might change, I hope it does, but so far after 18 hours it's very difficult to recommend a game that is great one moment and completely terrible and frustrating the next. This is a relatively shallow experience under a top notch facade, with loads of atrocious design decisions but some good emergent gameplay.

Pros:
-Great, immersive world
-Great gunplay
-Nice immersive sim elements
-Lots of vehicles 
-A few terrific weapons
-Companions are good if a wee bit shallow
-Difficulty is well-balanced...when the mission design isn't horrible

~Mids:
-Some missions are fine
-AI is inoffensive

Cons:
-You WILL contend with the Ubisoft launcher, which initially prevented me from even playing
-Truly terrible save system
-Stuff is constantly thrown in your face every 100 feet never giving you time to just breathe
-A few really awful and incredibly poorly designed missions
-You are CONSTANTLY pulled out of this ""open world"" game, forcing you into doing something entirely different with no way of stopping these events or having any control over them
-Technical issues getting game to read my GPU, a common problem

I'm so tired of these issues plaguing so many Ubisoft games. Year after year players make it very clear they hate these very intentional decisions that Ubisoft makes games after game, yet they double down on them and pretend like they aren't issues. They are. They're major issues. They ruin what would have been great games and undermine the incredible work of these development teams. And everyone should be clear that these teams are not really to blame, it's the company itself. It's upper management, it's executives, some things are middle management, but mostly this is a very top down problem. 

I'm just over it. I'll re-review when I complete the game.",1700649133,1700730327,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just a reminder to me, from Ubisoft, that their games are forever chained to their absolutely redundant storefront and I should never have bought this game on Steam.

Game is great, but if you forget for one nanosecond that it's tethered irreversibly to Ubisoft's second layer of authentication you will be forced to log in to another account every time you want to play.

This game is easily 9/10 for me and 100% recommended. 
Buy it on sale since it is 5 years old now.

I went with Far Cry 5 Gold Edition which includes -> Base Game + 3 DLC expansions + a copy of Far Cry 3.

Let's start the review now ----------------------------------------------------

[PROS]

The initial atmosphere and beginning of this game lays excellent ground work for story to develop. I can't stress enough on the fact that this game got me hooked right from the moment it started. 

This is very important since this motivates me to see what else the game has to offer and how the story is gonna develop.

The characters of this game are filled with emotion and strong personalities. The cultist madness of antagonist and his minions is through the chart. They are trying to tell you a story where the end justifies their sickening means. From there you are brought in the world of classic far cry experience. 

The game mechanics have always been the strong suit of Far Cry with one of the most authentic driving experience in entire industry. There are added companions who serve certain roles according to your command which compels us to smartly execute the mission.

Stealth, outsmarting AI, cordinating with companions turns Far Cry gameplay into something more intuitive and interesting. This mechanic begs you to try the smart and stealth way instead of guns-blazing.

Story, characters, mechanics are top-notch but what's more ?

""CO-OP GAMEPLAY"" - I completed the whole campaign with my friend where I can't express enough how much fun we had. There's so much happening in the game when you and your homie start doing brainless stuff xD. I laughed hysterically for half the campaign doing crazy stuff and this experience was more than enough to call it a day even if sometimes we didn't feel like doing missions.

[CONS]

The only bad thing I would say about the game is and which is very critical to know before buying - The story only progresses for the person who is Host of the co-op party. Meaning the friend who joins has to complete all those missions back in his own world or you have to play campaign twice to help each other complete the game. My friend was generous enough to play 70% campaign on my world and 30% on his own world but we still had our fun.

There are still a few bugs here and there like you can get stuck inside a destroyed car or you can get stuck behind the wall where you basically can't interact with normal world. Considering game is 5 years old, it should be more polished by now.

Let's talk about DLCs now --------------------------------------------------------------

{DEAD LIVING ZOMBIES} -> This is basically DOOM but you can invite your friends in co-op for added fun. Gameplay is pretty monotonous across closed levels which give stagnant experience after a couple of levels.

[LOST ON MARS] -> This is like ALIEN ISOLATION where your end goal is to escape a space ship stuck on mars. Dark and poorly lit rooms for added horro with no other creature in sight where we solve door puzzles to progress ahead. Little boring but unique experience.

{HOURS OF DARKNESS} -> This is where a US army trooper has to reach evacuation point by going through deep jungles of Veitnam. You have to fight through their troops to reach evacuation spot. This is the only expansion with truly open-world map where you can do similar stuff like base game to ease out your journey or speedrun through forest while fighting enemies to reach your helicopter.

These DLCs expansion are good content especially when all of them have co-op enabled to carry the same outside campaign.

I loved playing Far Cry 3 due to its graphics, sounds, guns, and story. When I first played Far Cry 5, I hated it because of the difficulty I felt while playing, with the level upgrades and not enough supplies. Later, I found out that I was the one at fault for not knowing about its mechanics. The gameplay is really good, just like I remember from Far Cry 3. THIS GAME HAS THE BEST GUN SOUNDS I'VE EVER HEARD IN A GAME! It literally feels like I'm in the game when I hear the sounds. When someone shoots past you, and you're playing on full volume wearing headphones, it literally feels like someone took a shot at you. The graphics are really good, and the game is well-optimized. I had no problem playing on ultra settings at 4K. The story is about Project at Eden's Gate, which is a cult, including an armed terrorist paramilitary group led by Joseph Seed and his siblings. Our goal is to kill every cultist, take over their lands, and free the place. I had real fun playing this game because of the driving, and you could fly planes and helicopters in this game, which is really fun. That's about it; I don't really have much else to say.

The issue is that at anything higher, especially normal price, I simply cannot recommend. Even at $13, there was a lot of other games I could have played that would have been much more entertaining. 

Pros: 
Good Soundtrack 
Solid Premise 
Cool map 
2 play co-op

Cons: 
Very Repetitive. All three of the heralds basically just need you to destroy a certain amount of crap belonging to the cult, and then boom, the game is basically over. There are not very many actually unique missions, and the number of missions involving getting a truck of some kind back from a cult outpost, killing everyone at said outpost, and then driving the truck back is in the tens. 

Graphics are decent, but not what I would expect from a game of this budget and acclaim 

Story Lacks real meaning, and I could not get connected 

Characters are pretty copy and paste, and are very forgettable. 

Guns are unbalanced. Some guns are great, but some weapons will never be used because they are simply worse. 

NPCs are extremely stupid, and can be killed en masse with anything with a range longer than 10 meters. They will not seek cover, fire back with any accuracy, or anything of that sort. 

All of the boss battles and the final battles are extremely easy. Even with the game on normal, it is actually difficult to lose, and my teammate and I never lost a boss battle. 

Multiplayer exists, but is flawed. The secondary player never can actually unlock any new guns or perks, and so cannot really progress. The secondary player is also excluded from any and all game choices entirely, and is merely a spectator at times during the game. The secondary player cannot start missions and gets killed if he is more than a few dozen meters from the host. The secondary player's items can also be brought in from other worlds, making the game easier to cheese than it already is. 




All in all, an attempt was made, but the game falls flat due to it's repetitive nature and many problems it must work out.

As a veteran player of the series, I can confidently say that this installment doesn't disappoint.

The game's setting in the fictional Hope County, Montana, is both beautiful and haunting. The open world is vast and diverse, encouraging exploration and discovery. The attention to detail is commendable, from the dense forests to the serene lakes, making every corner of the map a visual treat.

What truly sets Far Cry 5 apart is its compelling story. The charismatic and sinister cult leader, Joseph Seed, adds a layer of depth to the narrative rarely seen in open-world shooters. The tension builds steadily as you work to liberate the county from Seed's control, and the unpredictable twists keep you on the edge of your seat.

The game's characters are well-crafted, each with their own unique personalities and stories that add to the overall richness of the experience. The addition of Guns for Hire brings a tactical element to gameplay, allowing for diverse strategies in taking down cult outposts.

Gameplay is where Far Cry 5 truly shines. The freedom to approach objectives in any way you see fit is exhilarating. Whether you prefer stealth, long-range sniping, or going in guns blazing, the game accommodates your playstyle. The vast array of weapons and vehicles further enhances the sandbox experience, making every encounter feel dynamic and unpredictable.

Visually, Far Cry 5 is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in the environment, character models, and lighting effects is outstanding. The game's soundtrack complements the action seamlessly, enhancing the overall immersion.

While some may argue that the ending is divisive, I appreciate the bold choice to leave a lasting impact on players. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering a memorable experience.

In conclusion, Far Cry 5 is a wild ride from start to finish. Its engaging story, dynamic gameplay, and stunning visuals make it a standout title in the series. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer, this game is a must-play for anyone seeking an open-world adventure filled with action, suspense, and a touch of insanity.",1700603206,1700603206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the fact that you now have a teammate of some sort to help you. The game has new stuff to offer when it comes to the customization of the guns and the fighting is better, but it stops there.
The main villain is not memorable, because you meet him in the beginning, but then don't see him until the very end almost. It is the same concept of destroying rode blockades, radio towers and bases, but the map is now split in three parts. You walk around destroying those to get the fast travel and mini map, but the story is to kill the boss in each separated area on the map, and then you have to start all over for the next boss. There isn't really any rewards for doing stuff in one part, because you have to start all over for the next part of the map. 
Fighting the main villain is not that big of a part to the game, so he almost just feels like any other of the bosses you have killed the rest of the game.
It felt like a New Game + for the other games without any story. It is almost just missions in this game.",1700598688,1700598688,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is pretty much shit from the start. 
Take a look back at other Far Cry games and realize this isnt it. It feels more like a big fat fuckin joke like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.

The protagonist is pretty much a fucking mute, so no real lead up to anywhere in Character Development.

The Story's [spoiler] Secret Ending(s) [/spoiler] are fucking dumb. 
 SPOILER #1: [spoiler] Having the main character go through all this fuckin shit just for them to turn on his/her friends.depending on whether or not you decide to try to kill Joseph. [/spoiler]
 SPOILER #2: [spoiler] Deciding to not answer and arrest his ass at the beginning of the game pretty much does what Far Cry 4 does and does a fvcking ""Nah fuck this"" and turns around to leave ending the game prematurely [/spoiler]

there is so much more to write but at this point i don't want to have to go through the entire game all over again to feel this much pain and hatred all over again. Its not fun. Grab it when it is 10$ not when it is at $59.99. Absolutely FUCKING HATED THIS GAME.",1522738162,1700558228,False,0,0,0.51140064001083374,0,True,False,False

Friendly bots are entirely useless. Hostile bots are only difficult because the devs didn't make them genuinely fun to fight, they just spammed so so so many of them. The overall movement in the game clunky and buggy. Planes have horrible controls. Helicopters are a joke. Hit boxes are random at distance. Bullets appear to drop, but don't actually fall as they travel. Environmental clipping is random. Sticking a gun through a solid wall will allow bullets to pass through and hit an enemy, but sheet metal roofing is bullet proof. Destructive environments EXPLODE. Quest-essential bots getting stuck on terrain and environment stuff. Side-quest related bots will despawn the second they go out of render distance, and bots will similarly spawn from thin air. Straight up, this game plays like a re-skinned/textured arcade shooter from decades back. It'd be acceptable if it was a 20 year old game,..but it's not....

It is not about the story, mostly. Maybe something could've been done better, but when it comes to the story anyone could say it is the ""regular old Far Cry"". The game, even though stunning, feels forced and blank with all the unavoidable encouters and pushes to play the story missions, rather than experience the world and play how you like. On top of that, your character is mute and there are no organic transitions from cutscenes to gameplay which ruins the immersion. The lack of animations such as ones for looting and skinning also ruin the atmosphere and life, Far Cry was renowned for. Some of the side characters feel robotic and the AI is, simply put, stupid. It feels like there was not that much care, nor thought put into this game after all. I could also add the fact that it is ""ruined"" by the presence of microtransactions, in terms of in-game currency of ""silver bars"", in the single-player! All in all, the game just does not feel right. I would not recommend this game to anyone, especially for its full price!

And the fact that I didn't want to be in this stupid cutscene anyway means I skip them and do not watch them.

Way to go, Ubisoft.  You put a ton of effort into producing cutscenes that aren't even watched on the initial playthrough because the player resents you smashing them over the head with them without asking.  If I had a dollar for every time I was trying to casually go from point A to point B on the map only to get forcibly hijacked way over to point Z by a cutscene that I just want to skip on the first playthrough because spite, I could afford to buy the game again.

Also, there is no depth to the game.  Every single mission in the whole game is EXACTLY the same: 1. Go to some point on the map. 2. Kill all the baddies there.  That's it.  That is a full and honest description of every single mission in the entire game.  Every.  Single. One.  They are all exactly the same.  Missions at the end of the game are exactly like missions at the beginning of the game.  The format doesn't change.

[hr] [/hr]

[h2] Advisory [/h2]
Being a longstanding player, having played through FC3, FC4 and a little of FC Primal and Blood Dragon I feel I have come to enjoy and hate this series over the years. I won't go into how Ubi-Shit make awful cash grab games, because. That would take away from this review and in all honesty this game isn't a Ubi-Cash grab it's a game with so much love, detail and attention to every aspect of it that I cannot not make a review of it. So, I will. Without a further a do let's go into it.

[h2] Graphics and Optimisation [/h2]

For [b] 2018 [/b] theses graphics aren't impressive, they're damn fucking amazing. The game is well optimised, having watched Benchmarkers on YouTube I can see without a doubt this can run on all kinds of hardware. Ranging from low end, to RTX 3090s everyone will see an equally amazing experience, this can also apparently run on the Valve Steam Deck, performance looks good and I've heard good feedback from people on the Console. I personally ran this on a Gaming Laptop with a GTX 1660 TI, which is by all means not low end. However Performance [b] never [/b] dropped at all. The game has out dated textures and some aspects of the visuals don't look amazing, models look last generation. However, the game more then makes up for it with its incredible lighting, the only downside is the SSR which do not look good by any means. However, given the games age this is of course excusable.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

The gameplay [i] can [/i] can get boring, it is the same loop. Liberate an outpost, do a mission/side mission, liberate some hostages, deal with a supply truck and blow up a gas truck. It's practically just a run and gun, type of experience with nothing really else to add. But, this a norm with FC. However, it does have VIP enemies and so on. The game, has an amazing open world. Allowing you to go almost everywhere with zero restrictions. It does try and guide you, however it won't force you to play how the game is intended. And you're completely free to take on the campaign however you like.

[h2] Campaign and Story [/h2] 

[b] This will be spoiler free [/b] the campaign has 3 separate difficulties: Easy, Normal and Hard.

The gameplay won't change regardless of mode you pick, I played on Normal and personally found it difficult to complete the game. However, I more then likely have a [b] skill issue [/b] and should cope. The game has issues with pacing, the story is interesting to say the least. Without getting to spoiler-some it's practically WACO siege if it was on crack Cocaine. I don't want to give any details, there is character development. As the game progresses you do feel attached to the people involved, and naturally you want to help them. I won't delve to much further into this, I don't want to give out any spoliers. The Story is incredibly interesting however, and had me hooked from the beginning.

[h3] TLDR [/h3]

Buy it, it's a great game. With lot's of fun, to be had. Everything about it screams value for money [b] (DO NOT BUY IT AT 60 BUCKS THO [/b]

At the ripe price of 8 pounds, it is truly an absolute fucking bargain. I give it 9/10

Specific things i hated in my hour of playtime

1) Underwhelming gun play. Mediocre at best
2) Enemy turns into sonic at times and just zooms around
3) Do this do that. Felt boring
4) Your character cannot talk. Takes away from the immersion. (I know voice acting is expensive but its a AAA studio)
5) The worst of all. Uplay. Hated it so much.

Pros-
-Game theme , and graphics are really awesome its so immersive for ex, when you're driving you just want to park your car besides a tree and enjoy the surroundings like birds chirping , insects , the scenery etc.
-Gameplay is smooth and rewarding as well its slick, you can hunt , fish and do tons of fun stuff tbh hunting n fishing is more rewarding in this game than rdr2 in that game it felt useless lol 
-Characters ??? The antagonist Joseph Seed is so f*cking awesome loved his voice , animations , and facial expressions , I also enjoyed playing different regions like Faith's region was one of my favorites <3 I liked going into deep acid trips with her :"") what a cutie xD
-Soundtrack/OST- Makes you float in the air
-Story/Lore HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE FREAKING BEST PLOT i've ever witnessed it gives you chills AAAAAAAAA Should be a movie :""D


cons- ?? NONE so far :DD and yes buy this game in its full price which is 60$ its worth it ,also Most underrated game I'm glad i purchased it . Also idk why people are giving negative reviews because of ubisoft launcher? tbh its def better than EAplay lol 

I'd rate it

[list]
    [*]Great gunplay and bullet impact on enemies
    [*]Soundtrack and audio design is exemplerary
    [*]Does well most of the things that previous FC games did, like the obvious outpost freeing. It improved some things like collectables having fun side stories around them, and not being as annoying to get. 
    [*]Apart from the crappy ending I got, the story's pretty good. Especially side missions and side characters are a lot more fleshed out than in previous games
    [*] The gun 4 hire / companions you unlock throughout the game are really cool. The have context-aware dialogue, talk to other NPCs in the game world and even each other, and *when it works* have dialogue that reflects your game progress. Apart from that they actually have some combat ability
    [*] They did a pretty good job at selling the US Montana environment
[/list]

[h2] The Meh[/h2]
[list]
    [*] The Living World events are not as annoying as previous games, especially FC4 and FC:Primal (thank god). It could however still be toned down a little
    [*]  I encountered some smaller bugs like falling through the map if you open your parachute too late. Or NPCs constantly stopping talking mid-dialogue, because they saw some enemy 10 km away. 
   [*]  DLC weapons are instantly unlocked and actually ruin the game. They are stupidly OP. I don't recommend using them
[/list]

[h2] The Bad[/h2]
[list]
    [*] Just as in previous Far Cry games the economy is terribly designed. In previous installments, you get way too much money way too quickly, and unlock everything long before the game is over. In this game, you get way too little money, and will never unlock everything unless you plan to grind ""fishing"" and skinning animals for days. The missions give practically no reward
    [*]  This is a big one. NPCs keep spoiling the story! Ubisoft for some reason couldn't get quest facts to work correctly in this game. They have tons of  progression-based dialogue like ""great job killing villain A"", and ""I'm so glad you took out villain B"", or ""aaawh it's really unfortunate you ended up killing ""friendly character"" - BEFORE you did it! Both random NPCs in the overworld and even your own gun for hire squad mates do this. It's incredibly frustrating
    [*]  The constant ""getting kidnapped"" mechanic is horrendous. It takes away all control of the player, places you in dumb unrealistic situations, and does so without giving you a choice or chance to fight back
    [*]  Weird microtransactions. There was no need for that
    [*]  Talking to NPCs itself is frustrating, instead of being able to repress the ""talk"" button to hear more dialogue lines, you need to move out of sight a bit, then back to the NPC, then press talk again. As I'm someone who wants to hear all the dialogue, this was an extremely frequent frustration
  [*]  The ending I got was really disappointing. Not because it was a bad ending, but because it was terribly unrealistic and just like the kidnapping, took away all control of doing what I wanted to do for no reason at all

Strangely, I can run FC5 at much higher settings than FC3, and get much better FPS. Better optimisation I suppose.
If you do want to play with a PS5 controller on the PC, I recommend using DS4Windows, as FC5 does not directly support the PS5 controller.  With DS4W you can map the PS5 to a PS4 controller, which is supported by FC5.",1699804451,1699804451,True,6,0,0.561654150485992432,0,True,False,False

Those long scripted sequences where you cannot do anything but aim and shoot are horrible, especially since you restart every time you die... and that's the begging of the game.

You play as a deputy sheriff who joins forces with the local resistance to liberate the region from the charismatic leader, Joseph Seed, and his family of zealots. The game offers a huge open world that is full of possibilities, secrets, and surprises. You can explore the stunning landscapes, hunt wildlife, fish, fly planes, drive vehicles, and use a variety of weapons and gadgets to take down your foes. You can also customize your character, recruit allies, and even tame animals to assist you in your missions.

The game features a dynamic story that adapts to your actions and choices. You can tackle the main campaign in any order you want, or ignore it altogether and just have fun in the sandbox. The game also supports co-op and online multiplayer modes, where you can team up with friends or strangers to complete challenges, create maps, or just cause chaos. The game has a lot of humor and personality, but it also tackles some serious themes and delivers some emotional moments. The game has a great soundtrack that matches the mood and setting of the game, and the voice acting and motion capture are superb.

Far Cry 5 is a polished game, though. It has some minor technical issues, such as long loading times, pop-in, glitches, and crashes, but they are not frequent or game-breaking. It also has some gameplay issues, such as repetitive missions, annoying enemies, and lack of stealth options, but they are not significant or frustrating. The game can also be too easy or too hard, depending on your difficulty setting and playstyle, but you can always adjust them to suit your preference. The game’s story is also bold, as some people may find it provocative, unrealistic, or unsatisfying. The game’s ending, in particular, is daring and may leave you feeling shocked or intrigued.

Overall, Far Cry 5 is a fun and exciting game that offers a lot of content and variety. It is a game that lets you play the way you want, and rewards you for exploring and experimenting. It is a game that has a lot of charm and character, but also a lot of violence and madness. It is a game that will keep you entertained for hours, but also make you think and feel. It is a game that is worth playing, if you are a fan of the Far Cry series or the genre in general.",1698306804,1699648085,True,0,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]

Buy it on sale, waste some time, if you get bored (and you will) you probably won't miss anything by putting it on the shelf.

[h1]The Writeup[/h1]

The whole game is ridiculously on-rails, to the extent that it's essentially a rails shooter with lots of space and stuff to do between the rides. You don't have any agency in how the ""plot"" advances, and the game essentially deus-ex-machina-s you into whatever situation is necessary to deliver the story before you are regurgitated back into the world so that you can flail about before getting browbeat again.

The plot is an excuse to build the game and is completely linear with no nuance. A fifth grader could deliver something less insipid. [spoiler]There's a vaguely post-contemporary quasi-Christian religious movement (Eden's Gate/EG) that owns an alarming (and convenient to the plot) amount of cold war defense infrastructure in some fictitious part of Montana. The members of EG believe that society will collapse and that they have been chosen to rebuild, and have been terrorizing their neighbors in preparation. This terrorizing has attracted the attention of The Government™, who send a poorly prepared an out-matched team to collect their leader. Things being as they are, the leader is not very interested in taking a vacation, and things go south. You, the protagonist, are - as these things tend to go - the only remotely competent member of this team, and[/spoiler] you must dispense with the three lieutenants, John, Jacob, and Faith before you can have a calm, reasonable discussion with the leader, Joseph. Each of the three are one-dimensional stereotypes: John is a smooth talking lawyer and high-class-bumpkin, Jacob is a PTSD case and army-surplus-enjoyer, Faith is a Manson girl. In the process of taking out the trash, you will - as one expects - liquidate an unending army of the same six or so bandits, all of whom are broadly incompetent yet capable of operating attack aircraft. Between avoiding and/or killing bandits, you advance the story by interacting with offensive and paper thin stereotypes (we're talking [i]Postal[/i] levels of character stereotyping), many of whom can only be transplants from other parts of the states, and by being ""kidnapped,"" which consists of being forced to play through repetitive and bland linear story segments that you will come to hate.

The characters and setting in this game live in this weird uncanny valley - it's as if aliens were asked to create a simulation of rural North America by watching Right-Wing Infotainment and reading satire. There's also this insidious stench of centrist all-holds-barred sociopolitical commentary throughout the whole thing.

[h1]The Shit List[/h1]

[olist]
[*] The game purports to allow for ""non-confrontational"" (not ""stealth,"" that's a little too specific) gameplay, and offers silencers, throwing knives, and takedown mechanics; however, it does not complement these features with other considerations such as allowing for multiple approaches to scripted missions (they are [i]designed[/i] to escalate to [i]very[/i] hot confrontations), sane NPC patrol behavior and placement, not having an air patrol alarm an entire encampment of bandits for unclear reasons even when you are undetected by the plane and bandits, and other such things.
[*] There's too much lens flare. Lens flare is not realistic, unless you see the world through a camera. For the record, lens flare is caused by internal reflections within an optical system, and should be accompanied by glare and reduced contrast. 
[*] Apparently one can just go to Wal-Mart and purchase a fighter plane with support for aerial bombs. Who knew?
[*] Ally NPCs are a liability in many cases. Don't travel with them, only call them when needed.
[*] Driving fast enough along a long stretch of road demonstrates how hard the game tries to create the appearance of a dynamic world, but it falls short as it quickly becomes apparent that the thing you just drove past will not persist once it drops out of range: for example, I can speed past a sizable conflict with multiple vehicles, and if I come back thirty seconds later there will be nothing there. It's a little silly.
[*] ""Functional requirement"" crafting system - I can make proximity mines, but I can't remove accessories from a weapon on the go.
[*] ""Homeopathics"" are a mechanic, and I don't think the writers did any research into what that term means, or the pseudoscience behind how they are supposed to work. They are totally irrelevant, save for one story mission.
[*] Bliss is pretty much ""universal plot solvent."" It is all drugs at once. It's a sedative, it's a stimulant, it's a hallucinogen, it's an entactogen. It exists to plaster over plot holes.
[*] If you are going to pick a plant to make ""Bliss"" from, Jimsonweed is probably not it. You probably want some kind of Acacia - those can be very spicy and exciting, and produce compounds that are actually useful building blocks.
[*] There's all sorts of stupid speculation, tantrum throwing, and flame wars about the ending in the community tab. In my opinion it borders somewhere between a cop-out and dark humor/irony. You can throw another layer on that cake by simply asking ""yeah, that was bad, but is Eden's Gate's vision of the future a humane one?""

However, the open world they tried to create is a double-edged sword.  Maybe it was too open.  It felt like the game had no direction and you were doing the same, seemingly endless quests over and over again.  

Combat didn't seem realistic at all - too arcade like.  When you got shot with a bullet, the only thing that happened is your health meter went down a bit.  It seemed like getting shot wasn't a big deal and had no consequences.

Oh yeah, then there's the install that includes ""Ubisoft Connect"" where you have to create an account and sign in.  Ubisoft Connect is of those Steam wannabes that could never gain traction yet ended up selling on Steam anyway.

For me, however, the story of this game is quite simple and DULL. In this game, your main goal is to free the territories while also eliminating the cult leaders, Joseph Seed and his brothers. For those who enjoy following a game's plot, you've undoubtedly discovered that this game has the foolish notion of making a story and repeating the same phrase till the finish. 

To clarify, the game consists only of freeing territories, being abducted by adversaries, killing them to escape, liberating regions again, and being kidnapped again until you reach the conclusion. This repetition is UNAVOIDABLE. It automatically happens to you, regardless of what you're doing. You may be fishing and still get abducted, or you could be going about looking for a good spot to grab a screenshot and still be taken. It is very annoying. 

However, the concept of a quest relationship appeals to me. In comparison to other open world games, the primary mission and side quests are usually unrelated. Almost every side mission you do has an impact on the boss's reaction and leads to the main plot.

On the positive side, there's a ton of content with loads of side quests and opportunities for explosive mayhem. The game's humor shines through in quirky missions like Testie Festie, and it boasts an interesting cast of characters. Clutch Nixon events are a blast, and the opening sequence is one of the series' best. The villains are memorable, and the inclusion of companions with unique perks adds depth to your journey, especially with loyal Boomer by your side.

However, Far Cry 5 has its downsides. I personally didn't like how the game integrated your inventory capacity with the games perk system, and the game's weapons feel rather average. Basic NPCs lack diversity, and repetitive voice lines become noticeable. The game often plays like your typical shooter, and the removal of radio towers might disappoint some fans. Additionally, the rush to gain reputation points can detract from the enjoyment of the story missions, and the ending makes you feel like everything you've done was for nothing.

This might suit some players, who just play these games for the gameplay. But I found the story to be lacking compared to its two predecessors. The character you play as is a blank slate. There are very few cutscenes for the NPCs, making your mission interactions with them seem very stale and robotic. There are some recurring characters from previous games, in which they often had story-important missions and side quests. In this game, however, only their voice actors are present, but there is no motion capture cutscenes or interactions with them, making your time spent with them as forgettable as the majority of the optional side quests of this game.

I think this game would suit many people who just want solid FPS gameplay. For those looking for more depth in other departments (Story, character progression), be aware of the differences between this game and the previous main two in the series. With your expectations changed, you might not be disappointed, and can enjoy this game for what it is.

Pros:
1. Open World: The game offers a vast open world with diverse landscapes, activities, and wildlife, providing a sense of freedom and exploration.

2. Story: The game's storyline is engaging and explores the theme of religious extremism, adding depth to the typical shooter narrative.

3. Graphics: ""Farcry 5"" features stunning visuals with detailed environments and realistic character models.

4. Gameplay: The game's combat mechanics are solid, offering a variety of weapons, vehicles, and skills to tackle the challenges in different ways.

Cons:
1. AI: The enemy AI can sometimes be predictable and not as challenging as one would hope for in a shooter game.

2. Repetition: Some players may find certain missions or activities repetitive over time.

3. Story Pacing: The pacing of the main story can be uneven, with occasional interruptions by side activities.

Overall, ""Farcry 5"" offers an enjoyable open-world experience with a compelling narrative, but it does have some shortcomings in terms of AI and mission variety. If you enjoy open-world shooters and are interested in the game's setting, it's worth giving it a try.",1698818641,1698818641,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I have played Far Cry 1, 2, 3, Primal, 4, 5, and New Dawn. As a FPS, I really have enjoyed them. I have liked the change in scenery from one to the next. Really feels like the developers found a niche, and stuck with it hard. Keep beating that dead horse til it stops spitting out money. Well, now it stops for me. I will not be playing Far Cry 6, and I shouldn't have bothered with New Dawn. 

Have you ever had a coworker, fellow student, friend or whoever, who you can tell is not very intelligent, but they occasionally grace you with what they believe is a nugget of wisdom? This individual, assistant-manager-type, will tell you something they seem to think is very enlightened and mindful, and all you can think while they're talking is: ""Yeah, I came to that conclusion on my own, with no help, at the ripe old age of 9. Why are you just now realizing this at 42?"" They like to tell you all about their rules for life, work ethic, or how they make decisions, and everything they say is either a really bad idea, or it is so basic, no one should ever have to have it explained to them, because its just something everyone figures out from living the bare-minimum of life outside your parents' basement. And you're living a better quality life at 20-some-odd than they are at 40-some-odd, so why would you listen to what they have to say? 

A large group of this kind of person is who wrote the stories for these games. 

Look... These are First Person Shooter games, taking place in interesting locations that have few, if any consequences for your incredibly violent actions, and include a scenario and hate-able villains that spurs on your incredibly violent actions. We take these actions in video games because we're not going to in real life. So we don't need these games to punish us for these actions, because we're not doing anything to real people, we're just killing 1s and 0s. I don't need to have some (very specific characteristics that probably violate Rules and Guidelines) pacifists judging me and punishing me for playing the game the way it was designed, and trying to convince me that I'm the ""real villain"" for trying to stop a cult of murderers, torturers, rapists, kidnappers, Geneva-Convention-breakers, thieves, liars, corpse-mutilators: all under the guise of being political and religious zealots. 

I've enjoyed hunting animals for their skins and using them to upgrade my gear (removed in Far Cry 5 for some dumb reason). I've enjoyed trying, and retrying, and retrying to take and retake outposts in all these games: the layouts have almost always been well thought-out and executed. I've enjoyed that you don't necessarily have to go everywhere on the map and finish every little thing, but I always do. I like that in Far Cry 5, Dutch tells you he's not going to ask you to go climb radio towers all over the county, because the developers had an uncharacteristic moment of consciousness. I have enjoyed the gear layouts, and especially in Far Cry 5, the choices of weapons and customization. 

What I don't like: 
They try to make you feel bad for, sympathize with, or straight up join the villain in most/all of these games. 
They try to make you feel bad for killing scum-of-the-Earth type individuals. 
There is ALWAYS a drug element. Primal, you're drinking bloody nasty stuff from a skull. 4, you're getting stabbed against your will by some druggies. 5, you're getting too affected by Bliss. I remember it being a part of 3 as well, but don't remember what it was. 
They ALWAYS railroad you into stuff that most likely wouldn't have happened, considering your character. You can go the WHOLE GAME without needing help, just destroying everything in your path with ease, but the moment the developers need the villain to be able to deliver a monologue, suddenly someone can just punch you in the face and knock you out, open a music box and make you pass out (automatically brainwashed after hearing the song for the first time, ever... yeah that makes sense), or someone just pops up in front of you and blows Bliss in your face, or you survive a vehicle crash with Joseph Seed and he's the only one who doesn't get injured or knocked unconscious. Really, truly lazy writing, and terrible execution. 

And the BIG ONE! What is up with these endings??? 
Far Cry 3's endings were disappointing, but I felt like one was bad and the other was okay. 
Far Cry 4, I have read about an ending that I think I wouldn't mind, but I haven't gotten it yet. But the main two options are AWFUL. 
Far Cry 5 has no good ending. 
Let Joseph go at the beginning? Why would I do that? 
Nuclear war, and 16 years in a bunker alone with Joseph? Miss me with that. 
Let Joseph go at the end and ambiguously fade to red? After all he's done now, of course I'm not going to do that. 
I get that they intended to make him a suuuuuper-lame part of Far Cry: New Dawn, so you couldn't just straight-up brain-pan the guy, but had that been an option, I wouldn't have even been mad about the nuclear war. The way the game ends, I saw the nuke go off, and was genuinely emotionally affected by that turn of events. Then drove for our lives, trying to save Whitehorse and myself, actually worried about the prospect of us dying. Then got to Dutch's bunker, and Joseph killed Whitehorse and Dutch and imprisoned me in the bunker with him, giving off some seriously rape-y vibes, and that ruined everything for me. That ending gave me this very unsatisfied feeling of ""What...? Did they actually just do that? Is that really the end of the game?"" 
Would have even been better if you, Whitehorse and Dutch ended up in the bunker and Joseph escaped with his life. Then you come back in New Dawn, reprising your roll as Rook, and decide then whether or not to finish Joseph. Has enough time gone by for you to forgive him? Or does your righteous anger still burn hot enough to convince you to kill the hermit? 

Man... This series. Great gameplay, great sandboxing, great weapon choices (excluding the sawblade gun... come on guys), great vehicles, great mechanics, great collection-completion. 
Piss-poor writing. 
Piss-poor railroading. 
Piss-poor guilt-tripping (attempts). 

These games could have been utterly flawless, if they had just forced all the bleeding-heart-writers' content to be filtered through people who actually like FPS games. If they had sat down with disgruntled veterans and current or ex LEOs, they could have fixed everything that was wrong with these games, and made so much more money than they did.

Game description key-points: Quality time to spent on a decently made AAA Game


Overview:
Honestly I dislike the FC3, mainly because of the GUI and inventory!

Starting FC5, after about 1 hour I was about to drop out for the simple reason of not understanding what`s going on and what to do!
Can you imagine that??

Well, I forced myself to sit and chew it up, for which I`m grateful.

Managed to explore, learn and discover everything around the map with a lot of joy and curiosity!

Good, story, characters and missions.
A lot of thing a repeating and appear boring, but got used to that as the World is quite big.
The most enjoyable travelling experience was not by foot, but piloting a Helicopter! :)

My spouse and I liked this game so much that we struggled to make it work for us, trying all of the recommended settings. It was frustrating and a lot of work BUT we did find an avenue that worked (most of the time) for us and that was IF ONE OF US USED A VPN thus ""disguising"" the fact that we were playing on the same network. In all of my searching I did not see this remedy but try it first if you're having this problem since it's a relatively easy fix. It would have saved us a lot of time.

Don't buy this game if you want to play in Co-op. It constantly boots out the person who is not the leader. If you Google ""error snowshoe far cry 5 disconnect"" you will see that this has been a persistent problem. Also, only the leader can do important things like talk to people, hire people and acquire pets. That wasn't a deal breaker for us. It took more than two hours to find this out because you have to play through the tutorial before you can even join a co-op and then we were hoping that it was a one time glitch.

It is an immensely popular hymn, particularly in the United States, where it is used for both religious and secular purposes.

Newton wrote the words from personal experience; he grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others' reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed into service with the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy. While this moment marked his spiritual conversion, he continued slave trading until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether. Newton began studying Christian theology and later became an abolitionist.

Ordained in the Church of England in 1764, Newton became the curate of Olney, Buckinghamshire, where he began to write hymns with poet William Cowper. ""Amazing Grace"" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have been chanted by the congregation. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton's and Cowper's Olney Hymns, but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States, ""Amazing Grace"" became a popular song used by Baptist and Methodist preachers as part of their evangelizing, especially in the American South, during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies. In 1835, American composer William Walker set it to the tune known as ""New Britain"" in a shape note format; this is the version most frequently sung today.

With the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, ""Amazing Grace"" is one of the most recognisable songs in the English-speaking world. American historian Gilbert Chase writes that it is ""without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns""[1] and Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that the song is performed about 10 million times annually.[2]

It has had particular influence in folk music, and has become an emblematic black spiritual. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. ""Amazing Grace"" became newly popular during the 1960s revival of American folk music, and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century.",1697901122,1697901122,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

It tackles this little area in my head that wants exactly what this game has to offer. Something about the American tradition mixed with a realistic setting and scenario makes this game amazing. If I had to put a scenario in your head that captures the feeling this game gives me it would be this:
Imagine you are sitting in a lawn chair in your Montana countryside house right in the opening of your garage door. The garage lights are on and you are looking out into the surrounding forest but you cannot see anything but black due to the light pollution coming from the garage. Surrounding your house is the sounds of crickets chirping and frogs croaking. Your 50's style neon sign for ""Bush Light"" hanging in your garage window reflects a blue hue onto the ground. With your gun in one hand and Bapple in your other, you walk out away from the garage. Looking up into the night sky you see the beautiful stars of the Milky Way. You walk further away and now that the light pollution from the garage is not affecting you, you look around your house. Farm fields and trees are all lit up by the moonlight. It reminds you of a simpler time when you were younger. When life wasn't so complicated and the only worry in life was what you were going to spend your weekend doing. 
This feeling I get when playing this game is why I return to it so often. With my time on PC combined with my time on PlayStation, I have easily 1000 hours in this game. Every time I play through the game I 100% it and make sure to play it in a different style and/or order every time. The best thing about this game is that I don't even need to listen to music. Most of the time paying a game I have spotify in the background or at least turn the music off. But not with this.

I actually like the standard Far Cry gameplay loop but this was the worst Far Cry that I have played (between 3, Primal, and 4. 4 is still my favorite). Driving controls are pretty bad, most of the boss fights are lame (a problem with most Far Cry games unfortunately), and all of the several endings are dumb (with the ""best"" ending being dumbest of all). 

Hunting also seems to be more de-emphasized from previous games. You no longer need to hunt and skin animals to upgrade your gear (that is all done with perks now). You certainly can hunt, but if you don't need cash then there isn't much of a point. There is also no longer a skinning animation, you just ""loot"" the animal and you instantly get its skin. This might be a minor nit-pick to some, but it bothered me. 

They removed the towers that you have to activate across the map from previous games. I'm admittedly a minority in this, but I like doing the towers. 

Before I played this game I read that the story beats rely on you being knocked out and kidnapped repeatedly. I thought ""What, does this happen three or four times? That's not too terrible. You get knocked out in 3 a lot, too"". But no, it happens ALL THE TIME. You are constantly being knocked out and kidnapped so that the story can keep chugging along. You can't really believe how often this happens unless you play the game yourself. It's almost unbelievable and some of the laziest writing I have seen in a game.

Things I do like: The NPC companion system is super fun, and I found uses for almost all of the companions. Just sitting back and ordering your team to take a base while you direct them to targets is some of the funnest things in the game (and it counts as an undetected win as long as you yourself aren't seen). And, even though driving isn't very satisfying, I do like flying around in the planes. Strafing and bombing targets is very satisfying. 

So, if you like Far Cry games then I do recommend you give this a try (maybe wait until it's on sale). Unless you want to do every task in the game it's not extremely long (it's tied with Primal for being my fastest Far Cry completion at just over 20 hours. Far Cry 3 was the fastest at around 12 hours and 4 took me over 40).",1697569356,1697582011,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The amount of death you cause, the pseudo imperialist overtones and rampant stereotyping, the repetitive mechanics, the 'map full of icons' to-do list and how it exemplifies the worst proclivities of sandbox games.

Moving to Montana has shifted some of this stuff into other realms that are designed to make people different people uncomfortable, and it toys with psychological concepts with far more depth than the previous games.

It has it's own problems, though. My biggest frustration was twofold: constant enemy encounters while transiting to objectives (literally every 10-15 seconds a truckload of armed cultists would roll up), and forced boss checkpoint missions that would drag you off your current goals at preset progress points. I did install a mod that allowed you to depopulate the map, which helped A LOT with the constant interruptions.

In other words, FC5's biggest issues lie in when the game interrupts the free-flow sandbox play. Which is excellent.",1697558926,1697558926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, I will start off with the environment created by the world of Far Cry 5, it makes you feel truly alone, and powerless as you go up against these cult leaders. Not only that but the visuals and the way that the terrain is built make it fun to walk or run places, and not just fast travel, because along the way you can find animals to kill and sell for money, but you can also find plenty of side quests to keep you engaged within the game.

Secondly, the combat offers a totally fun and puzzling experience, as someone who enjoys going in guns blazing and is the opposite of sneaking around, some situations force you to be quiet for a larger reward, and it is fun because there is always an opportunity to just start shooting like crazy. It is a fun and non-repetitive combat system that I think was synthesized well.

Lastly, the psychological aspect of the story line is beautiful. Without spoiling lots. I want to hate these people, and some of them, I did, some of them I celebrated the downfalls of. But at certain times I would be reluctant to feel too good about the game, because it left me questioning things, asking myself what the whole side of said characters' story was, and how they got there. Not going to spoil any more than that because it is something that I think you all should go find out for yourselves.

Stay safe...

In that perspective ,I say that Far Cry 5 ,has the best villan in the series ,not because of his definition of insanity or his overgrown ego ,but because of his ""vision"" of a prophecy ,of a world that could be clean only through sacrifice ,a thought that a psychopath may have ,but unlike a psychopath ,this man not only does he have lots of charisma to make a loyal army that would put some national armies to shame ,but he also has the power to influence people against him to do his biting.

He is crazy ,because of loss (I don't wanna spoil why ,you'll have to find out) and because of a false signal and a false way of viewing things ,which is a big problem even in our real world,Joseph is not that different from Extreme Christian /Muslim groups that come with good intentions ,but in time dig into sadistic and inhuman practices...So that's why I say he's good because he ,unlike other ones,may sound like a possibility /threat that may exist in our world ,""the individual is supposed to be weak ,but far from powerless a single person has the potential to ruin the world"" .

I recommend this game for everyone who wants to see this side of villany and to have fun ,because outside of the occasional glitches ,this game has content to keep you entertained ,from the sandbox open-world to the limitless maps form far cry arcade and co-op you will not get bored.

The gunplay is very good, and the driving is also competent. Flying at first takes a bit of getting used to, but then again that may have just been me. I've played thru this at least 5 times, and even after all that I've had as much fun as I did the very first time. To me, that's the benchmark of a truly great game; and anymore it happens so rarely that I take note with each occurrence.

Now, it is an Ubisoft money-grab title, so wait for a sale (still $60 after five and a half years? Really?). The story, and even the map (while smaller) blow the doors off FC6.

Also, the spawn rate of random enemies appearing and attacking you is way, wayyyy too high. The game offers an open world map with objectives to clear but you can't catch your breath for random groups of grunts constantly zeroing in on you and engaging with you. It's incredibly annoying.

It's a shame because there is a great game to be made here if they just stopped forcing you into unavoidable story events and calmed down with the enemy spawns. Those two things however are so oppressive that you cannot enjoy the game.",1697117660,1697117833,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Plot's janky, side quests range from meh to pretty good, guns are alright, driving's fun, but it's shackled to Ubisoft's insistence on using an inferior secondary community application.

SPOILERS BELOW:

This game really, REALLY wants you to care about its plot.  Like, the game insists that whatever gameplay thing you have chosen to do is no longer important once they feel like it's time to do plot.  A plot, mind you, that's deeply inaccurate in its intended message.  The whole point is supposed to be that ""sometimes it's better to let go and walk away,"" knowing full well that not only is your character (as a police officer) OBLIGATED to interfere in service to the innocent citizens of Montana, but both you and the character are actively motivated by every facet of gameplay and plot to dive in headfirst and save lives.  This ""message"" is delivered by a man who: openly admits to killing his infant daughter in his arms; regularly commands the kidnapping, brainwashing, torture, and execution of innocent civilians; is implied to have forced himself upon one of his ""apostles"" and force-fed her powerful hallucinogens until she was addicted at the tender age of seventeen; doesn't know how to wear a shirt; and willfully wears a man-bun.  The line ""not every problem can be solved by a bullet"" leaves the mouth of a problem that can be solved with a bullet, and all you are allowed to do is suffer through myriad cutscenes that never would have happened because a sane man would have shot this guy by now.  Even during the end of the game, as you careen through burning forest, you can't turn around and Marvin this man as you SHOULD -- you willingly brought him along with you, for no reason?

The siblings are individually kind of cool, though.

END SPOILERS

The gunplay is Far Cry 3's gunplay, nothing crazy there -- though the shovel launcher is fun.  Movement, vehicular or manual, feels solid.  Game looks good, sounds good, and any time you're not interacting with its horrible Ubisoft-based multiplayer UI or its painfully counterintuitive and ham-fisted ""plot,"" the game is fine.  Problem is, 3 and 4, as well as Blood Dragon and Primal, are RIGHT THERE.  If you're gonna get this one, get it on sale; otherwise, stick with the better games.",1697046269,1697046269,False,1,0,0.498125165700912476,1,True,False,False

Game has beautiful Graphics, fun gun play, story is kinda meh, and the cut scenes / dialogue drag out too much. But the main drawback of this game is that it doesnt have TRUE multiplayer. Meaning that if you try to play with a friend, whoever isnt hosting will not get story progression, and will not get upgrade progression. 

Also it kinda drives the idea of being a looter game but has many instances where it prohibits you from looting. You are limited to how many of an item you can hold, but the game wont tell you what that limit is, or which items have hit that limit, further more, when you clear out a base, all of the bodies you killed disappear, so you cant loot them. 

Can be infuriating for those wanting the joy of loot, and the sheer amount of cut scenes does make me come and go from this game. The gun play is where this game shines, some of the best ive seen.",1696841460,1696841460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The reason it is not at the same level as FC3 is, there are so many unused mechanics & unimplemented mechanics in the game. Big loss on potential for the game.

Graphics are great, music is really good. Hunting is not so great if you compare it to RDR2, higher value pelt instead of twice the no of pelts for arrow kills would have maintained some balance in terms of money earned.  

Weapons have too similar stats which makes it feel as if they are un-varied. Chain melees are not as smooth as in FC3. So many things which were done better in FC3 prevents this game from earning top rating!",1696696771,1696696771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I thought it was overheating, an under powered system, bad PSU, and so on. You may see Kernal-Power event 41 show up in Event Viewer after a crash. What I've found is that Adobe update, Dropbox Update, Razer Update, etc etc were the culprits. Any time a program updater would automatically launch, search for an update, or begin an update I would crash. Now. before every game I go to task manager and close all allowable updater programs (just the update background process). This has solved 99% of the problem with an occasional program triggering an update and crash. More often than not when you power back on and check task manager you'll see which updater restarted. Anyways, to the review.

Thumbs up overall because:

-Classic Far Cry running and gunning - headshots are rewarding
-OP air superiority via helos and companions
-Landscape is done well as usual


Thumbs down because:

-Ubisoft Connect (per usual)
-Weapon/Item unlocks aren't progressively better
-""Prestige"" weps are much more expensive, but don't do anything better
-Perks are meh
-Item swapping is a bit tedious in the heat of battle
-Story is ok, but cut-scenes and overall feel not as good as the last two FC
-Missions seem shorter, easier and lacking depth
-What's the point in clothing customization when you never see your character?
-FC going downhill.

Hello?  It's not a conspiracy if it's outright, observably true.  

It is super weird to watch main characters in a video game about fighting and war be fat, middle-aged women who are supposedly as capable as men in these situations. 
We get it, we're supposed to believe that women don't need men and we're not special - because even though it's delusional and we won't show it publicly otherwise we'll pretend women can fight men on equal ground - even when they're obese...  You can beat us in hand to hand fighting even when you're fat and beaten up.  Go feminism.  We'll pretend some more...

Ubisoft does it in all their games for several years now.  Trying to convince/manipulate the young and impressionable that men aren't special, women can do exactly what we can... Stupid, woke nonsense that's literally evil compelling boys and young men to question their worth in what was once our only ""safe space"" from this evil garbage.

Farcry has always been fun yeah... but Ubisoft is evil.  IDGAF people need to speak out about this a lot more than we do.  Acceptance is allowance.

Set in the absolutely gorgeous state of Montana, this game has some amazing scenery and some breathtaking graphics. The gunplay is improved from the previous installments. I appreciate the realistic touch of being able to switch from fully-automatic to semi-automatic for some of my guns.. Far Cry 5 also has an excellent gun variety, and an equally excellent attachment selection. Like the previous games, it has great sound design, as well as a good soundtrack full of 80s dad rock and gospel music to really immerse you into that rural Montana setting.

One of my favorite features of the game is the arcade. If you wanna take a break from the campaign for a bit, you can find an arcade cabinet or a poster, and play some custom maps made by developers and other players. You can play Bladerunner maps, fight in Egyptian pyraminds, hold out against zombies, or scale giant office towers. It adds a lot of uniqueness to the game, and makes it that much more engaging and worthwhile.

Like features that have been added, though, some have been removed. You still have the wingsuit and grappling hook, but takedowns are all different. There are no longer any manual healing animations, either, but they instead give you a slowly but fully-regenerating health bar, although you can expedite its process by using first aid kits. You also have more melee weapons, as opposed to a single blade, but they all function the same, though. It's just visual differences. You can also throw your melee weapons a short distance that instant-kills any human target it touches, which can make for some amusing kills. I'm sure a lot of people coming from 3 and 4 will greatly appreciate that there are no radio towers to scale in this game. Unfortunately, all guns still aren't unlocked at the beginning of the game. There are now no longer any hunting requirements to get bigger ammo pouches. You get bigger pouches through perks, and you gain those through completing challenges, rather than leveling up, compared to the previous games. Prices are also a pretty big difference in this game, too. Guns are more expensive, attachments are relatively realistically-priced, and you can buy vehicles and clothing as well. Cash isn't as easy to find in loot as in some of the other games, so they decided to make hunting the big money-earner this time around.

You can also go fishing.

And no sharks this time, so you don't have to have a mini heart attack every time you go swimming.

The story is good enough, but it is where most of the complaints about this game come from. It has multiple antagonists, but they aren't nearly as fun or as charismatic as Vaas or Pagan. They're all a little bland, really. Barely mildly interesting, and all of your special events involving them are only a little fun.

Is this game worth the full price? Maybe. I've found I got my money's worth, but I feel that this game has so much replayability, and so many features in it that contributes to its longevity that whether you pay twelve dollars, thirty dollars, or sixty, I think you'd have a good time regardless.",1619814753,1696444424,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Great quality game world, plenty to do.

Biggest letdown for me was being dragged out of the game to perform timed events (driving/kills).
The challenge of these events seems to have little to do with the main game, the last timed event I couldn't complete and can't exit.

Just discovered Resistance Mod, adds time to timed events (much easier)

pros:
good villains
good visuals 
the best far cry setting imo
gunplay is some of the best out of ubisoft 
fun open world 
hunting is really fun compared to 3
can pet dog
jess black

cons:
limted guns 
only allowed 4 guns and 1 has to be a sidearm(so really only 3)
planes are the worst thing ever 
far to many 1 shots, even on 200% hp im still getting 1 shotted alot
hit reg is pretty bad at range 
capture parties are annoying at best and horrible at worst 
pretty forgettable characters(other then the seed family and jess black)
stealth dosent feel as nice compared to 3 although its still okay 
far to many peggies on the road for middle of nowhere montana(this is a very tiny issue tho)

out of 10 rating 
8.5/10
its fun to just go around and hunt or kill peggies but thats about it, the gunplay is really the only thing that makes it worth playing

The concept is fantastic, but the execution is horrible. The guns feel awful, their stats and performance make no sense (like shooting a deer in the head with a .45-70, and then it just takes off into the sunset at mach 2), the vehicles are atrociously bad - especially the helicopters and planes that max out at about 55mph, not to mention their horrendous handling and physics, the enemies are all cookie cutter copy/paste scenarios, once one enemy sees you they all know where you are and will shoot you through a forest while sprinting with laser precision... 

The game has a wide variety of side missions, most of which exist only to frustrate you, and don't really offer anything. Any time there was a mission where you had to ""hunt"" something, I didn't even bother after the first couple. Spoiler, the best hunting weapon in the game is an M60 because you have to shoot predator animals a ridiculous amount of times to kill them. I'm the kind of person who usually finishes EVERY side quest before finishing a main story line, but in this case, I found myself rushing through the main story just to get the game over with as quickly as possible.

Not to mention, it gets REALLY annoying having to go back to base to get a new helicopter every 3 minutes because some random civilian stole yours after you saved them - AGAIN.

This is a thumbs up for the game, yes, but there's is  a _glaring_ thumbs down area of the game and it's choice to deliver a story. And that is especially apparent in the Faith region. Taking control off the hands of the player, when you are trying for an immersive experience, is a very shitty way of doing things. And it happens.... A LOT... A HELLUVA LOT. After region(s) are liberated from the horrendous writing, things pick up for the better.

Short review:
It's a fun game, the mechanics are nice and it very well might be my favorite Far Cry gameplay, visuals and worldbuilding wise. I think ""cult infested rural America"" is a bold and fun idea after ""exotic"" locations and is very welcome. Give it a go, it's often nowadayhs on the cheap, including the DLC's (which I have not tested though). Get over the awful storytelling (please note, not awful story as such, just the way it's often told) and you are in for a solid treat.

Again. Not having control over your character while he is drugged, yeaah, I get how they are justifying it but boy is it arrogant, sloppy writing and a horrible character (when talking about faith). So speedrun the horrible character and story bit and then enjoy the game.",1695565641,1695565641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The villains were great as is expected of a Far Cry game. Gameplay-wise it is quite different from Far Cry 4, There are less collectables which is great for completionists. The respawn & fast travel systems are further upgraded. There's lots of guns to suit the way you want to play.The greatest thing about the game though, is undoubtedly, the soundtrack. Dan Romer and the choir knocked it out of the park. I think it's one of the best soundtracks in the last 10 years.

While the villains are great, the protagonist is bland af. I didn't like the way they told the story and the ending is satisfying. I also didn't love the kidnapping mechanic in the 3 regions as I felt it affected the pacing of the story and reduced player freedom. 

The Arcade mode is bugged af and I get a lot of bookworm errors. An Ubi support is as helpful as you would expect. They didn't even reply to my support ticket and it's been two months.

It would be a 9/10 if the kidnapping mechanic was not present as It causes you to miss some main missions if you do too many side quests. Due to the 2 above issues, I removed 2 points from my rating.

Realistic. Interesting dialogues and characters. Great addition with the roster of allies that can accompany the player.
Engine is bomb. Enemies' kills are visualised the best in the series (e.g. how they react to getting hit,  the blood spatter, ragdoll mechanics, realism of all that - not super realistic unfortunately - like with RDR2 or TLOU2 let's say - but it will certainly happily do) And enemies are not damage sponges even on hardest difficulty which is a plus (FC6 I'm looking at you). 
By default I turn off 'taggin' (seeing enemies through walls, cause that's just a ridiculous proposition) but apart from that great default settings.
Shame it was later followed by a new approach to the same subject with New Dawn where everything is sugar-coloured, octan-spray-paint candy sweet bulls***. And they seem to have changed engine or some solutions, in FC6 + it's not not the same thing, with crocodile allies, over the top acting with poor-writing dialogues, etc. 
FC5 has the most robust and beautiful engine in the series.
Great bow & slingshot mechanic and representation of the hits on enemies.

There is some glitch showing up when you play PS4 controller on steam (whereas some functions of cars and planes do not have a button assigned to them) but you just have to turn off steam input, restart the game, and it plays fine.

Overall though, would love if the series continued in this tone - more serious, realistic (some solutions are a bit OTT, but it's just on the line without crossing it overall), ...normal-colours-coloured... and with an option to play a bit more creatively.

The difficulty level even on the highest level is a bit easy at times. But if the Ubi solution for that would be bullet-sponge enemies then by all means, don't do it, just leave it as it is.",1695297081,1695297081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase

Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around

I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think

3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.21 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

8 And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

18 And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;22 And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.31 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.",1695183610,1695183610,True,1,0,0.498516321182250977,0,True,False,False

The aesthetics, shooting/fighting, driving, flying, and open world aspect is way more fun than it has any right to be, as well as the arcade that lets you build your own levels. I even found the DLC to be a lot of fun, as well. The ONLY real complaint I have is the abduction mechanic. Without spoiling anything, you get abducted by your enemies (a lot), and there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. Yes, it progresses the story, but it's still supremely annoying. You can be flying in a plane a mile off the ground with no enemies anywhere close to you, and you'll still somehow get taken. I'd love it if you could somehow avoid it, but it's only a minor inconvenience in an otherwise awesome game. Highly recommended.

З першого погляду гра вражає своєю деталізацією відкритого світу, відмінною графікою і фантастичними пейзажами штату Монтана, США.

Однією з ключових особливостей Far Cry 5 є свобода дій для гравця. Ви можете досліджувати великий відкритий світ, виконувати різні завдання і вибирати свій власний спосіб вирішення проблем. Неважливо, чи виберете ви великі стрімкі бої, розглядаєте таємниці гри в справжньому детективному стилі, чи ж берете на себе роль владика зла, ви завжди будете відчувати себе вільним.

Гра також славиться своєю багатошаровістю та глибиною персонажів. У вас буде можливість спілкуватися з різними персонажами, вивчати їхні історії та долі, і це додасть велику глибину іммерсії до гри.

Боротьба з культом ""Врятувати Надію"" - це захоплююча пригода, яка спрямована на вивчення тем сучасного суспільства, релігійних вірувань і влади. Сюжет гри завжди тримає вас в напруженні, а вибори, які ви робите, впливають на подальший хід подій.

Технічно гра також вражає: графіка на високому рівні, реалістична фізика і динамічна система погоди створюють неймовірно живий світ.

Загалом, Far Cry 5 - це гра, яка точно варта уваги. Вона поєднує захоплюючий сюжет, неймовірно відкритий світ, багато різноманітних можливостей для гравця та глибокий сюжет. Ця гра точно заслуговує на місце в вашій колекції, якщо ви шануєте ігри в жанрі відкритого світу і шутери від першої особи.",1694944810,1694944810,True,4,0,0.546452045440673828,0,True,False,False

Entire game probably has around 40-60 hours of gameplay if you are aiming for 100% completion. You can easily beat it in 20-30 hours if you only pursue the main story quests. 

We set the game difficulty to ""hard"", as it is the highest difficulty setting, but hard is not difficult if you're decent at FPS games. 

There are no Steam achievements for this game. That is either a big plus or a big minus for some people. There are Steam trading cards though, so you will still get Steam XP for completing the game. 

On sale for less than $10, this game is solid purchase.

Sure!). What's atrocious about it is the extremely badly written story. The plotting is so forced and ridiculous, it is basically ""Shoehorning: The Game"". You know those cheesy old action tv series where the heroes get kidnapped by the baddies every time and always manage to escape after listening to the bad guy explaining his plans? This is basically the main story gimmick in this game, and it happens A LOT. Like, a dozen times or more. Endlessly rambling monologues by the evil dudes about their clichéd worldview that really make you appreciate the skip button after a while. Which is a shame because I think the voice actors are doing a very good job with the abysmal material they are given, but it's just so pointless and uninteresting, and nothing has any consequence. Then there is the fact that you have basically no agency whatsoever. I don't understand why they made this an open world title since you are so heavily railroaded and often deprived of choice, I seriously think this story would work much better as a linear shooter (apart from the out-of-nowhere ending that is just ridiculously stupid und illogical). It really feels as if it was a linear concept before being retooled into a Far Cry title. The plotting and gameplay mechanics get more and more annoying and ridiculous during the progression of the main story, at the end I just felt insulted on an intellectual level. Some missions and activities are over-the-top GTA-like fun, others are so serious and pretentious, it gives you extreme mood whipIash. If you want to make a silly shooter, go wild and crazy, but don't pretend that you are telling some kind of oscar-worthy story with real emotional stakes by wasting the time and talent of good actors. There are also some really disturbing undertones in the storytelling where I'm not really sure if the developers see the murderous cultist leaders as the evil guys or as admirable antiheroes?! The civilian NPCs get slaughtered and their corpses are defiled left and right, but every single one of the main bad guys gets their dying monologue that is set up like an honorable warriors death. It's so heavyhanded and questionable. 
In conclusion: It is a somewhat fun sandbox shooter that you can enjoy if you have nothing better to play, but if you are looking for decent storytelling or coherent worldbuilding, don't bother.

I'm seeing more games doing this, while making microphone communication the only in-game communication method.  Why?  There's nothing edgy or forward-thinking about doing away with something that should have a permanent place in anything multiplayer -- save for very unique circumstances.  No, using the Steam or Ubisoft overlay chat isn't good enough, and is frankly a hassle compared to being able to chat in-game.  

I did quite enjoyed playing this game with my brother on the co-op campaign, despite so-so writing and unlikeable characters (except for the main villain with the glasses, he was cool), but we're both in a state of disbelief that players with various reasons for wanting good, old-fashioned text chatting -- ie deaf people, or people who need to communicate quietly, or even just people who don't feel like talking on the mic -- are being given the middle finger.  Techland and a couple others do this as well, and I won't buy anymore of their multiplayer games, nor will I buy anymore multiplayer games from Ubisoft if they keep basically telling LOTS of us who pay good money for their games to go fuck themselves.  

One might say or think that mic-only communication is the future of gaming, but that's a VERY difficult concept to understand when players should be given a choice.  And yes, it needs to be in-game.  No overlays or third party programs.  Just simply chat box communication.   

Now, let's see some fake dev from Ubisoft respond generically in a tone that basically tells me to go read their Q&A or troubleshooting section -- which is basically their way of telling yet another paid customer to take my thoughts and shove them where the sun don't shine.

Compared to previous Far Cry games, the story falls short of expectations, with a disappointing ending (Jacob had the best story, and I wish he was the main antagonist of the game).

The crafting system is weak and mainly focused on throwables, the once-rewarding hunting for crafting improvements isn't worth it anymore, and the perk system lacks rewards found in earlier games of the series (you only need the grapple hook, parachute, and the wingsuit).

I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1694721258,1694721258,True,6,6,0.352920323610305786,0,True,False,False

while i enjoy the idea of shooting loony cultists, the far cry people can't tell good stories.  they just can't, they always do a bad job of it and leave you strapped to your chair and iv feed you silly nonsense while you do fun stuff like take a squirrel suit over a cliff face or fish.  granted, there's a lot of fun stuff to do (the flying mechanics are great) and a lot of space to roam, and they generally outweigh the little things like the gunplay not being all that great and the collect-a-thons coming straight out of european amiga platformers.

that ending tho...  that ending can go eat a discarded cigarette that's been stepped on by shoes with sewer grime from victorian england.  suffice it to say, i will not be purchasing ""new dawn.""

on a scale of big rigs over the road racing to dark souls iii, i give this game a disappointed, yet satisfied ""far cry 5.""

This review delves into the dark and twisted world of Hope County, Montana, where cultists, chaos, and carnage reign supreme.

""Far Cry 5's"" setting is nothing short of spectacular. Hope County, a rural Montana landscape, is both beautifully picturesque and eerily unsettling. The serene wilderness juxtaposed with a cult's iron grip creates an atmosphere that's brimming with tension. Ubisoft has succeeded in crafting a believable and captivating open-world playground.

The narrative, revolving around the extremist religious cult known as the ""Project at Eden's Gate,"" is both timely and disturbing. ""Far Cry 5"" pulls no punches in exploring themes of fanaticism, indoctrination, and the corruption of power. Players find themselves in the shoes of a silent protagonist, Deputy Sheriff Rook, sent to arrest the cult's leader, Joseph Seed. From there, the story spirals into a chaotic odyssey of resistance, making players question their own moral compass in the process.

""Far Cry 5"" boasts a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations, quirks, and flaws. The ""Guns for Hire"" system lets you recruit unique allies, adding an extra layer of strategy to game-play. Whether it's the charismatic preacher Jerome, the explosives expert Nick Rye, or the enigmatic ""Hurk,"" each companion brings a fresh dynamic to combat and story progression.

But it's the villains who steal the show. Joseph Seed, along with his heralds, are some of the most memorable antagonists in gaming history. Their fanatical devotion and unnerving charm leave a lasting impression, making every encounter with them a tense and unforgettable experience.

""Far Cry 5's"" game-play is where it truly shines. The open-world sandbox is your canvas for chaos, and the freedom it offers is staggering. Want to liberate an outpost with stealthy precision? Go for it. Prefer to ride in guns blazing with a bear by your side? The choice is yours. The game's dynamic AI and responsive gun-play create countless opportunities for emergent game-play moments.

The arsenal of weapons and vehicles is diverse, catering to different play-styles. The progression system, tied to challenges and exploration, encourages you to experiment and adapt to various situations. The game also introduces the ""Fangs for Hire,"" allowing you to recruit animals like bears and cougars as allies, adding an extra layer of strategy.

""Far Cry 5"" is quite a visual marvel too. The attention to detail in Hope County's environments, from the lush forests to the foreboding cult compounds, is breathtaking. Dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and the use of the Dunia Engine create a world that feels alive and ever-changing.

Sound design is equally exceptional. The haunting hymns of the cultists and the roar of wildlife in the wilderness immerse players in the game's world. Voice acting is top-notch, with Joseph Seed's performance being particularly chilling.

In conclusion, ""Far Cry 5"" is a masterclass in open-world gaming, blending a gripping narrative with explosive game-play. It delves into disturbing themes while offering players an unparalleled level of freedom and immersion. Its compelling characters, unforgettable villains, and stunning world make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. In it's chaotic realm of Hope County, Montana, your choices matter, and the line between hero and villain blurs. ""Far Cry 5"" is not just your everyday Ubisoft game; it's an unforgettable journey into madness that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",1694275437,1694275437,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't want to dogfight with your POS flying system, and I definitely don't want to have to shoot down an enemy fighter plane that requires roughly 200 bullets to bring down.  This would suck less if my plane's machine guns didn't overheat after 3 seconds of continuous fire.  This is not a good ""boss battle"" and the designers should have realized it miles ahead of actually putting it in the game.

Also don't love the amount of ground-to-air combat I'm expected to fulfill while just trying to navigate the map, especially given the lack of proper AA in this game. Maybe the designers felt a need to replace the intense frustration of eagle attacks from FC4 with this fresh new hell from above?

Another thing: either let me craft med kits or make them a lot more prevalent.  Why is this game so stingy with health?  It would be less frustrating if we still had the ""freebie"" healing like in previous games, e.g. pulling shrapnel out of our forearms or resetting broken hands.  Instead these fights feel a lot like COD with me needing to just cower and hide while I hope my dog doesn't get blown away (he often does).

""Just buy more health kits"" they're fairly expensive and I run out of money restocking them, kind of a lot.  ""Just hunt to collect skins to sell"" NO.  There's a cult enacting a secession that for some reason isn't being responded to by every element of the US army within 1000 miles, I want to shoot religious lunatics in the face not stalk animals with a bow that requires multiple hits to get the job done.

-Horrible story. This time you are under effect of drugs on almost every story mission
-When you die on a story mission it skips the part -_-
-In-game micro transactions (BRAHHH) Me and my friend played every side quests, killed every single animal we encountered for loot, scavenged so hard but still couldn't afford every weapons. Even 100% you will not able to test every guns with attachments. Wtf
-Not only weapons also most of the vehicles aren't free. Planes, cars, boats.. 
-Most of these vehicles have same accelaretion and top speed. The only difference is trash skins
-Talking about skins they also requries in game money
-Attachments as well, and they're crazly expensive. And you have to buy them again when you change the weapon. Forcing you to buy silver bars for real money
-Dynamics are garbage. Every single of them.
-You can craft some syringes but mostly you wont care about them.
-You will get bored quickly
-Guns for hire thing (supporters) hilariously bad. Usualy they dont care about your orders
-Stealth issues
-Lack of physics
-Co op sync issues
-There is no filter on map. Pure cancer, good luck finding your side quests on map
-Map is 3D but hard to navigate
-Broken uplay overlay like always
-No steam achievements
-No option to disable depth of field
-Huge downgrades from previous FC titles
-Arcade mode
-Many more, i tired of count


This is a bad FC game. If we consider it is not a FC game it's still garbage. Give people nice HD looking trash they will like it. Im not kidding this game is completely trash for me.

Far Cry 5 is the fifth installment in the franchise, and one of the first far cry games to overhaul the progression system. instead of just doing a story mission to progress, FC5 uses multiple story missions, multiple characters, and takes advantages of its open world by being able to liberate outposts, small or big and can also go towards your main story progression. Its sort of like just cause 3, just less explosions and more outposts.
Far Cry 5 is a title many should play, because of its interesting villains and their unique identities make the game a whole lot more interesting and more compelling to play. you play as a rookie saving regions from each of the seed children and confronting joseph seed in the end. Its such a great idea and makes it more interesting by adding 3 more villains you can meet, kill and learn.
I like this game, but theres definitely some improvements that can be made to FC5, one of it are the ""get meat/skin undamaged"" missions that could be a huge issue and halt your progress by a TON. the companions are really useless, i played through most of this game without one because while companions can fight, for some reason they wont revive me unless on special occassions, it drove me to insanity.
this is the best Far Cry game out there you can play, possibly better than Far Cry 3. It adds a modern and easier approach than previous games and its really easy to jump in and just play for a bit. for the full rating, id give this game 8/10. its a pretty good game but there are some features that i wouldve liked to be ironed out. thats it, cya",1693218940,1693219022,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
The map looks great
Coop is better than the previous games as you can stay together the entire time after the tutorial
The setting was believable, an religious extremes militia as an enemy seems plausible to me
Having 2 recruit slots lets you play coop and still have a gun/fang for hire which we found pretty enjoyable
Gunplay and stealth are fun
The stashes were an interesting way to get upgrades

Neutral:
Balance is completely scuffed in this game. Some guns are locked behind progress with map completion, but there are prestige and dlc weapons that have the same stats as locked guns that are available from the start, and some have bloated stats like the mars pistol with max power and accuracy with infinite ammo.
Adding the ability to order vehicles was a nice touch, but the vehicles without weapons are pointless, and the ones with weapons are also unbalanced. The enemy seems to have no counter for helicopters with guns/missiles and you could easily clear most open world content with those.
There are vestigial things from previous games, in FC3+4 hunting was used to upgrade your storage space, in this game storage space upgrades are a perk, hunting is still there but only for selling the skins for money, and in typical far cry fashion once you get a set of weapons you like there's very little to spend money on aside from refilling ammo.
Crafting as a whole is just tacked on in this game, you can craft some explosives and the boosting drugs (oddly the pipe bomb isn't craftable despite being a notoriously home brewed weapon) but this just adds steps, just let us loot the consumables directly and not bother with the extra clicking.
They changed the health system for the worse in this game too, in previous games you had multiple health bar segments and if they got too low you could use a weak heal that came with a rather impractical field wound treatment. In this game you have one bar and it regenerates if you go long enough without being hit, this really makes things slow down and isn't the best. There are medkits to heal instantly but I was constantly flipping between having 0 of them when needed, and being full so I couldn't pick up what I found.
Another far cry reoccurring issue is once you've captured enough outposts the map feels too safe, in the start you have to fight your way everywhere but towards the end you'll hardly see enemies anywhere and it'll just be a lot of traversing empty space to get to the next fight.

Cons:
Microtransactions in a single player/coop game is such a slap to the face, what could that possibly add to the game?
Animals are super spongy for some reason, it shouldn't take half an LMG clip to take down a single bear especially when it's only for money. This is really bad for the judges since they'll mess up your stealth attempts because you can't kill them in one shot and they'll alert everyone.
The story is flat out garbage, rather than organically give you the story you end up getting kidnapped 3 times by each of the 3 leaders. These involve fights but are ultimately unavoidable and they happen no matter what you're doing so saving a hostage on your way to an outpost may put you over the edge starting the kidnap and then ending with you on the other side of the map from where you wanted to be. The kidnappings makes suspension of disbelief impossible since it's so ridiculous that you'd have survived all of that. Additionally the cult feels disjointed, one leader just wants to torture people, another is converting people by force with drugs, and the 3rd is conditioning people and killing those he deems weak. These are all so counter to each other that it's hard to tell what they're goal even is. The ending shows that they were preparing for the end of days but that doesn't make sense that they'd be culling people who'd have died anyways. They seem to try for a ""maybe Joseph was right all along"" ending but it literally doesn't matter, you can't let the moral of the story be to let a militant cult that is forcing people under their rule do as they please. The cutscenes are all in direct address as well, with your character willingly getting way to close to these people and letting them monologue endlessly even as they're dying. 
The boss fights are super unsatisfying, 3 of them take place in an altered state so it doesn't even feel like you're really fighting them. The one that doesn't ends up taking place in a dogfight with an airplane. They're all so anticlimactic it feels like you just drifted off for a bit and come back to them being suddenly bleeding out.
The story also has some seriously predictable parts, like when you're conditioned by Jacob to kill Eli. Just like FC4 this is so frustrating, seeing the rake from miles away but still being forced to step on it. It's even a mission to save someone who's being programmed by Jacob so they KNOW the programming exists but just decide not to deprogram you despite being captured 3 times and apparently missing for days.
Lastly the bugs, several times missions refused to progress, some wouldn't spawn the necessary items/people, others wouldn't register our progress to go to the next step. We had one cutscene drop down to 2-3 fps for some reason and the audio desynced. The wingsuit refused to open almost half the time, a few times using the parachute made me fall faster. Despite being the stealth fang for hire we had peaches just walk into the open and stand there until enemies spotted her.

Above all it's a mess of good ideas mixed together to create below mediocre experience. Map itself is beautiful but also very ""artifiicial"" in a sense - it has no reason to it, no flow whatsoever - just a bunch of fields and forests with ""content"" sprinkle around it. It would be decent for a farming sim, or a game with much more hardcore aim - but in arcade'y farcry it's just ""small"" and pointless. Combat is horrible both when it comes to weapon handling that simply isn't fun, and when it comes to brain dead enemies that behave like a hive of morons rushing you all the time. 
Identity crisis that this game suffers from is even more obvious when you look at the survival aspects (crafting, healing items and so on) that are contradicted by fast and chaotic combat. I've tried for many hours, even modding the game with resistance mod that allows to iron out few issues but the core gameplay is just never really that fun to begin with.
I much MUCH prefer recent Ghost Recon games when it comes to open world action - they are both highly customisable, both have much better maps and outposts leagues above far cry 5 offering, both are better as action games and as hardcore titles - all depending on your settings (and with FPP mod for Wildlands you even get decent first person experience, which allows to enjoy map craftmanship that the team behind it clearly possesed).
If you are looking for decent (or more decent) far cry experience FC3 is much more streamlined and does not suffer from before mentioned identity crisis nearly as much, same goes for FC4. And if you don't care about open world but you like fpp stealth, and exploration i would highly encourage to try Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 1 and 2 (SGW 3 has open world in classic sense, and is really good on highest difficulty, but the world, although beautifully crafted, is even more lifeless than the one presented here).",1693150304,1693150304,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I love the fact that you're not forced to do all of the MAIN missions and that the order of completing them is primarily up to you. I think that's just the Far Cry formula, but it works here very well.

It's also nice that most activities that involve combat can be done in either a super stealthy way - including bows, throwing knives, suppressors, long scopes, and remote explosives - or in a RAMBO way (preferred by me) which includes choppers, planes, armored trucks, RPGs, choppers, guided missiles, grenades, molotovs, flamethrowers, and choppers. Oh, and you can also have up to 2 companions among whom there is a dude piloting a plane, and a lady piloting A MOTHER**CKING CHOPPER. I can tell you that such an air fleet (including you in the chopper obviously) can be a meaningful addition to the resistance.

All in all, there is a lot of action-driven fun packed in Far Cry 5 and it's hard to keep track of the passing hours. Of course, it gets repetitive after some time (like most Ubisoft games) but after ~24 hours of playtime, I haven't found it annoying yet. I recommend grabbing it on sale with all the DLCs included - that way you can also get a VIETNAM CHOPPER in the main campaign as soon as you get to your first chopper shop (and it's free).",1693146226,1693146226,True,21,3,0.670194566249847412,0,True,False,False

This game isn't flawless by any means, but I think they nailed one of the most important things to me. I actually care about what's happening in Hope County and the fate of the people who live there. Your character isn't voice acted, but it doesn't matter that much (it certainly didn't do much in FC6). The people you meet during your adventures makes up for it. The story is a little over the top at times, but it's engaging. The music is also amazing, which adds another layer to the overall ambiance and feel of the game.

There are plenty of ways to play, whether you like the stealthy approach, or just run in guns blazing. Some enemies are bullet sponges and the AI is questionable at times, but it doesn't impact the overall experience too much.
The resistance points you need to farm to progress each zone and advance the story might feel a bit grindy to some, but you get most of it by simply playing the game normally. 


The same can be said for skill points, but again most of it is obtained by just playing the game and exploring the map. I never felt like I had to farm the same stuff over and over, which was the case with Outpost re-capping in Far Cry New Dawn.

One of the things I am not a big fan of is the scripted progression in each zone once you reach certain resistance levels. Even if you're not on an active story mission, hitting a certain level of the resistance will trigger an event where you get removed from whatever it is you were doing. It's a minor annoyance, but I would have preferred to decide myself when to advance the story.

Overally though I think Far Cry 5 strikes a great balance where there is a lot of stuff to do, but you don't really have to if you just care about the main story. I wouldn't buy a 5 year old game for 60$, but it's fairly often on sale at 50% discount or more.",1693133205,1693133205,True,1,0,0.505882382392883301,0,True,False,False

The ambience of the game is very engaging, it's clear a lot of care was put into building the environments and the sound design added to this a lot. 

Gunplay was pretty fun, the odd bug here or there but nothing inexcusable. A great variety of weapons. Stealth can be difficult at times early on, but not too hard. In the late game with the right perks you can run and slide about enemy outposts clearing them without getting detected which is also fun. 

This is an arcade-y game and it's not afraid to lean into that at times with some crazy sequences, at the same time it can get real with some quite hard hitting story moments.

The last act provides an interesting choice on what you do with the main antagonist which adds some weight to the ending depending on which choice you make. 

All in all, great game. HOWEVER, I do have to deduct a point because the dog can't ride in the car with you.

Pros:
- Mechanically the best so far
- Good ideas
- Whole world open from start, no enemy scaling
Cons:
- Story
- Writing
- Silent Protagonist, especially in scenes where it doesn't make sense for him to don't speak
- Butchered tutorials ( I had to look up on internet how to do Sidearm Takedowns)
- Stupid Ai both enemy and allies
- Your sidekicks comment constantly and it's annoying. They yell even if you are currently sneaking
- To kill any of 3 lieutenants you have to be kidnapped by them 3 times (9 in total!!!). Each time you somehow escape or are released becasue Main Bad Guy ""Got a Plan for You"", even at the last kidnapping, only for him to throw a tantrum and say maybe he was wrong about MC after you kill his last lieutenant.
- Villain is a self rightoues hipocrite ""that is right in the end""
- If you do too much side content in one area, then game locks you out of some missions without warning.
- Ending out of left field with no foreshadowing (or bad and minimal foreshadowing, that is contradicted many times) that only serves as an excuse for New Dawn and is made non-canon because of Far Cry 6

Far Cry 5 takes place in my home state, and though they got the environments right, it's stereotyped to hell... but what Far Cry game hasn't been?
Far Cry 5 takes place in Hope County (which doesn't exist. It's fictional) which has been taken over by a fanatical cult that totally isn't a bargain-bin Branch Davidian Cult. In this installment you must take the steps to dismantle this cult, which is known as The Project at Eden's Gate, to free Hope County from their tyrannical preachy clutches... because there was absolutely no military response... for reasons that make no sense.

So why am I recommending this? Because it's fun to play. DON'T PLAY IT FOR THE STORY, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!

Pros:
- Fun Gameplay
- Beautiful Environment
- There are helicopters and planes now
- Fun with Friends (If Ubisoft's software will actually work)
- Arcade is pretty fun

Cons:
- Map is small compared to 3, 4, and 6.
- The story is subpar and it's endings invalidate everything that happened in the entire game. And there was so much wasted potential with it.
- Enemy Variety hasn't changed except for adding the Angels which are the easiest things to fight.
- Though the gameplay is fun, it's not really different from 3 and 4.
- Multiplayer might break, because Ubisoft Connect is always going critical somehow.

From the moment I stepped into the fictional Hope County, Montana, I was immersed in a world teeming with unpredictable danger and unexpected charm.

Immersive Open World:

The game's meticulously crafted open world is a playground of diverse landscapes, from lush forests to serene lakeshores and towering mountains. Every corner hides a new adventure, whether it's encountering a dangerous cult, rescuing a civilian, or stumbling upon hidden treasures that add a layer of depth to the experience.

Dynamic Gameplay:

Far Cry 5's gameplay is an adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster ride. From liberating outposts with explosive finesse to taking on ferocious wildlife, every encounter offers a unique challenge. The freedom to approach situations with an array of weapons, vehicles, and tactics keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Compelling Characters and Story:

The game's charismatic characters and gripping storyline kept me invested in the battle against the menacing cult led by Joseph Seed. The blend of dark themes and unexpected humor created a narrative that was both engaging and memorable.

Co-op Chaos:

The addition of co-op play introduced a whole new dimension of chaos and camaraderie. Joining forces with a friend to take down cultists, wreak havoc, or explore the vast world added an extra layer of enjoyment that made the experience even more immersive.

Stunning Visuals:

Far Cry 5's attention to detail is evident in its stunning visuals. From the realistic lighting and weather effects to the meticulously designed environments, the game's aesthetics contribute to the sense of immersion, making every moment feel like a cinematic adventure.

Conclusion: A Wild Ride in Big Sky Country

It has a wonderful array of activities and content that will keep anyone looking for a more ""tactical"" approach to a ""turn your mind off"" FPS. THIS IS THE AC4: BLACK FLAG FOR THE FAR CRY SERIES.... not the most plot heavy title and it can get lost in its own sauce... but you get to be a Montana Cowboy Vigilante Angel of Vengeance and Wrath! its fucking fun, and the world is absolutely gorgeous...... but then then comes the rub. 

1. UBISOFT EXISTS..... and thus a game can not simply be fun. The one credit i will give them is that everything i have wanted to have, i have been able to obtain with the currency of the game and not my own... and that it. These Trash Baskets continue to force you to abandon steam and use their RAM hogging, under developed, and bloated excuse of an extension.... it is needless and has only proven to be a waste of my time and a shockingly significant hurdle between me AND A GAME I ALREADY FUCKING PAYED FOR!!!! Shit will full ass make you sign in every time regardless of any options you choose, and will add a good 3 minutes to the games acceptable boot-up time. also they might just delete your account for not playing the game every fucking day...

2. The god forsaken shoe-horned story that feels like one writers failed and utterly pedantic attempt at trying to over force a basic and tired philosophy on the player, and then act like its the first new philosophical thought since Plato. Now lets be clear, the basic story beats and the atmosphere its creates are great... the intro and starting island are near flawless bangers that get you rock solid for a story that will never actually manifest.... instead you will be forced into encounters against you will, having all player agency taken away from you as though you are some petulant child for daring to explore the world. The vibe and tone will remain very good and it does a good job of making you care for the ""good guys' and the over world as a whole.... but all of the forced interactions with the Cult are an experiment in great concept.. that never materializes... which will all lead to one of the worst endings i have seen in gaming... its like getting high with a sophomore psych student who thinks that 9 credit hours have formed them into this paragon of metaphysical knowledge and wisdom...and instead of engaging with you as a player and purchaser of this game, they force you to listen to another philosophy 101 lecture from a strung out junkie and then take all the stake and reason behind the game up until this point and metaphorically wipe their dysentery riddle ass with it. 

So the brass tax is this

It is a solid 8.5/10 open world fps that has polished what it knows and even tries some new shit... nothing revolutionary, but very satisfying nonetheless. It has a gripping and fascinating world that is simply not given the due it deserves from the actual scripted story, but the companions and inhabitants make up for it with some absolutely fire dialogue and banter. This game will be a fun thrill ride of near 50hrs of content that will come at the price of a roughly 3 hours philosophy 101 lecture dispersed throughout, a truly unsatisfying ending..... and at the end of the day.... it is another fun game that comes at the cost of being made by fucking Ubisoft. 

All in all, i would put it on par with AC4 and Watch Dogs 2... fun and engaging, but is another ubisoft game that forces its story on you regardless of your feelings on the matter. 

DISCLAIMER: i have never played Arcade. i have literally zero - 1 interest in the concept, so none of the above apllies to it in any way shape or form..... pretty fun co-op though, if you can get past the Ubisoft client.",1692739235,1692739235,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole game seems like it was rushed to meet a deadline and the creators were not given any time to flesh out ideas and polish the game. Like it was released in Alpha because Ubisoft.
What annoys me is that this game had so much potential. The premise was great, the prologue was great, there were some great ideas, but it all amounted to nothing in the end.

The game ran fine on Linux with proton, i finished it completely on Linux using ""Proton Experimental"".

Pros : 
- The story is pretty interesting, as well as the endings that could leave you flabbergasted for a long time
- The guns have their own behaviour and impact and they don't feel like clones
- The variety of random situations you can stumble upon

Cons : 
- VERY outdated and primitive game design. The devs fantasy is sufficient for 2 things only : spawning the hordes of enemies after every little action made and triggering the story events. It can seem to be fun in the beginning, but only makes one annoyed and angry when repeated for a hundred times
- Dependancy on microtransactions. Like buying an in-game currency for a single player game, really?
- The freedom of choice in this game is nothing, but a simple illusion. You're not keen on hunting? You won't be able to make money then. Some of the tasks imply endless scouting for resources (which is boring), some make you fish/hunt/do stunts/get involved in the activities you don't really want to do, but some of them can be easily avoided. The key word here is SOME and it does make the game annoying
- Very stupid companion AI. Blocking the path, running straight into the danger and whatnot
- Boss fights. This is not what you expect from a AAA-game (no spoilers allowed, so I won't say much here. Just don't expect too much from them).

This was a great story and definitely not a waste of time, however, this is the most annoying game I've completed for a couple of years so far. And even the variety of activities doesn't make it better.

Honestly, just a really fun game that you can really just get into without much worry, with a lot of ""video game logic"" and arcade-like features to make it feel like your a one man army and a lot of extra stuff to make the game world feel alive and unique. That is about how I would sum Far Cry 5 up in one sentence.

But to be a bit more in-depth, here is my reasons on what makes Far Cry such a great game.

The wit and character of everything in the game. Nearly each individual mission, prepper stash and side quest is packed full of wit and character, from the environmental storytelling in the prepper stash missions to the crazy and downright insane NPC side characters. The main story is also pretty decent as well, striking a nice balance between an information overload and no story at all, unlike the COD games where it is 99% gun pew pew and 1% story. The 3 endings are all pretty cool and also pretty fucked up at the same time, but they all leave you with a sense of satisfaction. I won't spoil any as I'm sure you can just look them up if your interested enough.

Mmmmmm the mechanics in this game are simply JUICY. From the driving and movement to the shooting and the UI, everything feels smooth and good to handle. The driving is just so nice and makes you NOT want to use fast travel as you can have a fun time off-roading. The drive assist when your aiming and shooting also makes it feel so good and not at all clunky and difficult to do. The movement with parachuting and flying with your wing suit feels smooth and the swinging from grappling hooks and jumping across ledges feels snappy and parkour like. Everything about the shooting feels wonderful as well. The animations for it are well done and the handling feels natural and intuitive, leaving it all up to your skill to perform well. 

Oh, and one last thing, but there is a bonus ""arcade"" game mode, where you can verse people in death matches, explore user created maps, play through custom missions in said user created maps and earn small bonuses to the base game. Personally, I don't find these types of extra game modes very fun, but this one is pretty polished and worth a shot, as well as adding a fair amount of replayability to Far Cry 5. 

I could go on and on about what I like about Far Cry 5 and why you should get it, but I think you get the idea. That and I can't be bothered adding more. Of course wait till a 50%+ sale to get it, and it should give you about 50 hours of game play with all the DLC included, but of course if you really enjoy it, it will give you many, many more hours of game play. 


[b]LOST ON MARS DLC[/b]

Out of all the three DLC's, this one is the one with the most work put into it. It feels as if its taken the best aspects of both the other DLC's and the base game. This continues to have the wit and comedy of Far Cry whilst presenting something new, as there is a new (smaller then the base game) Mars map, several new space weapons, new unique missions and new alien bug type enemies. 

The missions all feel juuuust unique enough that they don't end up copying each other and over staying their welcome, as they range from parkour type puzzles, enhanced by the low gravity of Mars, to finding Hurk's Body parts (don't worry, he's mostly fine without them but would prefer them back).

The space guns are a welcome change from traditional fire arms and there is a surprising amount of variety in them, ranging from your traditional laser beam, to a guided plasma orb gun. 

The developers have done well to make the endless red desert of Mars into an interesting map with a decent amount of different locations. These include: space stations, satellite towers that you can climb up, alien dens, small rocky canyons, desert (of course) and even an area of the base game map in a dreamlike state. 

The alien enemies are pretty standard really, being giant bug like beasts, similar to other sci-fi films. There is about 3 or 4 different types of these bugs each with a different strength and weakness, but other then this, there isn't much else to say here.

Verdict: Probably the most worthwhile DLC out of all three, and is a nice change from the base game of Far Cry 5. Get this one while one sale.


[b]DEAD LIVING ZOMBIES DLC[/b]

Probably my favourite DLC of all three, this DLC involves 7 ""movie pitches"" which are essentially 7 scenarios you run through killing zombies, with much of it being scripted events, while ""Guy Marvel"" an overenthusiastic movie director wanna-be, pitches the idea of this to famous directors. 

These movie pitches take only about 15-30 minutes, but each feel different from each other. The scripting works in sync with your game play and feels really smooth. Not only this, but if you stray from the intended path and do a bit of exploration, you will often be rewarded with a better weapon and special dialogue, making it feel like you have found a cool little secret.

Also, after you complete each movie pitch, you will unlock the score attack mode, where you have to try and get as high of a score has possible, if that interests you. You can also unlock bonus weapons for the base game as well.

Verdict: if you enjoy bite sized missions that is full of the wit and comedy of Far Cry 5, definitely get this one.


[b]HOURS OF DARKNESS DLC[/b]

This is my least favourite DLC of all three, as it does use much of the same mechanics as the base game, but without a lot of the wit, character and atmosphere of the base game. The point of this DLC is that it is set in the Vietnam war and you're playing as an American helicopter gunner. The helicopter that you were in gets shot down and you have to try and make it to an evacuation point across the map from you. Whilst you do this, you can do extra (optional) tasks like collect lighters from shot down fighter pilots, rescue P.O.W's, destroy propaganda speakers, destroy AA guns and save your 3 other crew members. 

Here lies the the problem with this. These all feel the same. Each P.O.W rescue mission feels like a repeat of one outpost mission, each lighter and propaganda speaker feels like the same Prepper stash mission and to top it all off, there really is no point to doing this extra stuff as you don't unlock anything new, nor do you get a achievement for doing 100%. 

Verdict: It's fine if your looking for more far cry to play, otherwise, don't bother as it doesn't add much new stuff. Get it on sale if you still want to get it.",1691920197,1691920229,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- Gets a bit repetitive in some places. 

- In-app-purchases, but they are buyable with in-game money that you earn from playing so I don't mind them all that much. Still, it's a singleplayer game. No place for IAPs.

+ Scenery is gorgeous. Well designed world.

+ Game runs really well. On ultra settings I get 100+ FPS on 3440x1440 with my 1080 Ti.

+ Perk system is much better than the crafting system of previous titles.

+ Fishing is fun and relaxing (when you aren't being assaulted by planes or bears).

+ Characters are well developed.

+ Despite being a little hectic and imbalanced, the PVP multiplayer is really fun.

+ The map editor is great as usual and support in-game for sharing and playing other people's maps is incredible.

+ Air combat is decently fun.

= There are a lot of bugs, but none game-breaking so far. Bears swim along the ground, enemies can slide 100 ft to cover, and vehicles often are flung dozens of feet into the air when they collide.

= Montana is nowhere near as, er... ""diverse"" as they are portraying. I know this is a work of fiction but it seems almost wishful thinking.

The map is beautiful, well executed amalgamation of western MT, north of Missoula. For someone from Ohio or the UK, it's every bit as exotic as any other location.  As someone who has lived there, and still spends a lot of time there, it's a fantastic homage.

As for gameplay,  if you're familiar with the franchise, then you already know what you're getting,  Ubi hasn't diverged much from the long running formula.  It's very detailed without being particularly deep. Compared to previous titles, the region clearing feels very nerfed.  There's only three regions, with bosses at the end of each.  When you clear a region there are no longer any hostiles, so it just becomes a driving game in those places.  You can't really avoid pushing the game forward either, so it feels rushed. Also there is the obligatory point Ubi seems to put in all their games, where you're unavoidably captured, and wake up without all the weapons you've been collecting and you have to fight your way out...I HATE that, and really wish Ubi would just stop it already.

The voice acting is terrific, and there's a lot of great characters, which really helped make this the most immersive entry in the series so far.  Unfortunately, like all the other FCs, it suffers from some really absurd half-assed moral equivalency by trying to make the case the obviously demented evil psycho killers aren't any worse than you. The whole script comes off life a weekend effort by a twenty year old college kid who read way too much Ayn Rand.  That ridiculous,  chickens*** both-sides jive has always been a problem with Ubisoft, but it was particularly bad here.

Despite the issues, the game looks fantastic, and was a lot of fun to play.  I might have been disappointed if I'd bought it when it came out at full price, but I got it when it was on sale for $15 and I couldn't be happier with that.  At this moment, they are back to charging $60,so Ubi must have moved from Montreal to Qubecrazy...wait for a sale, they drop the price every few months.

I kind of wish I'd waited a bit for FC6, but that one had Giancarlo, and he's freaking awesome.

[b]New Players[/b]
Far Cry 5 is a first-person shooter, open-world experience where you play as a American deputy set in an area in Montana where a cult has taken over the region and are promoting their ideology through force. You are set with driving the cult out, take back the region and deal with the mysterious figure known as The Father and his siblings.

[b]Review[/b]
I've been a fan of the Far Cry series since 3 and have greatly enjoyed the experience each had to offer with the open-world scene and the plenty of exploration based objectives to find. I have to admit though, the game hasn't changed all that much since FC3 other than the theme and environment. I suppose the greatest deviation is FC5 since a lot of the progression based objectives have been removed, but overall, the game play experience is very much the same. The game got gripe for being political and I won't lie, there were a couple of obvious ones like Hurk's dad, but for the most part, it wasn't as political as I expected it to be and it gave a good laugh for some of the more extreme examples.

[b]**Game Play**[/b]
What is there to say about all Far Cry games... they involve lots of exploring, lots of dealing with bad guys and at times some fun on the side stuff to do like fishing. There isn't really much to say about FC5 game play if you've played the previous ones. You start off with mediocre weapons that actually carry on well until the end, but the more you complete missions and liberate outposts, the more loot you'll unlock. FC5, however did remove the formula of completing challenges to unlock special weapons, and instead replaced it with unlocking skill points to improve your character. Not sure what they were aiming for, and perhaps it was meant to get the player straight into the action, but some of my best memories of FC is exploring the map and obtaining all the hidden loot, and completing hunting challenges to get the upgrades. You can get really beefed up quickly by just completing the easy challenges and only unlocking your most important skills. Most skills are meh in my opinion, but that's just my opinion.

Some negatives though are that the game very quickly becomes redundant and easy. As mentioned, you get beefed up really quickly and even on the hardest difficulty, things become easy and stale. One of the worst parts though was I felt very little need to use most weapons. I got what I wanted early and kinda just stuck with that. I barely used any of the herb-boosts and unfortunately, I later on felt no need to aim for 100% because there wasn't any reward for doing that. This is a great game, don't get me wrong, but it felt empty in comparison to its predecessors.

[b]**Graphics**[/b]
All FC games have this in common too... they are absolutely gorgeous ([i]for their time[/i]). FC5 is no exception. In fact, the landscapes are some of the most beautiful I've experienced in a game. Seeing the woods, the mountains, the detailed terrain, it's pretty damn impressive I have to say. So just from a graphical experience, I can recommend giving this a shot.

[b]**Story**[/b]
This is usually where FC shines as they have some of the most controversial, but outright awesome takes on character perspectives that I feel few games attempt to try. Since Far Cry 2, there's always some hidden figure just out of reach that is told is the real bad guy. As you progress however, the perspective also becomes clear that although the bad guy is in fact pretty bad, the ones fighting him are usually just as bad or at times even worse. It creates this interesting narrative of what are you truly fighting for? Are you really fighting the bad guy and does all of this make sense? FC5 is no exception to this and in fact I feel it takes it even further with a major twist at the end.

Without spoiling anything, all you need to know is that there's a cult causing mayhem and your main target is The Father, Joseph Seed. After the prologue, you have different regions controlled by his sibling, so each part has it's own dark, disturbing facets that need to be dealt with. It is however, an awesome and worthwhile experience.

[b]**Conclusion**[/b]

Not too much filler-missions, a good balance of fun and serious moods - amazing graphics, of course, can´t do without those. I would have liked more opportunities to hear the game´s soundtrack and a speaking protagonist. 
But - no spoilers here - the ending is pure shit. This feels like a game-version of Stephen King´s ""The Stand"". Interesting characters in an interesting situation and the end leaves you with the shitty feeling of nothing having been accomplished. No justice dished out, no craving for vengeance satisfied, only lazy-ass writing and forced cutscenes (which happens a lot during the game, major minus here). 
I hate it when a game forces me into doing things I simply would not do for whatever reasons just to further its own story - or doesn´t even force me into doing it, but simply makes me watch it doing those things for me. Its railroading at its finest and I don´t like it.

The gameplay is pretty typical FarCry: fast paced shooter, lots of fun, mayhem, and explosions. The characters are engaging and the main villain is well designed. Where it falls over (and it falls hard) is the writing. The story writing, while at first quite engaging, becomes very repetitive and predictable. There's one story point that is repeated 2-3 TIMES IN EACH ZONE. It only makes marginal sense in one of the areas, but still... 8 times? 8??? The one time it DOESN'T stay repetitive is the end... and not in a good way. The end COULD have saved this game. It could have left the player with a sense of satisfaction. Instead the player is left feeling empty, because no actions made during the game made a difference. Nothing. If you weren't there there would be no difference. I looked up the ending I didn't get and the feeling is the same.

The gameplay is amazing. The arsenal you eventually have at your disposal is varied and fun. The main companions you can acquire are mostly cool and the vehicles are fun to use. Clearing out enemy bases is a blast and taking the time to fish is even fun.

However, almost all of the forced story portions are awful. My biggest complaint though, is the ending. There are three endings, as I have found out, and the one in which you ""beat the game"" is, in my opinion, one of the worst endings in video game history.

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick"", you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

The combat and stealth is actually pretty satisfying when you get a bunch of skill points but thats mostly because of the braindead computer which makes the game laughably easy. The world looks amazing and the textures and character models are some of the best I've seen in any game ever. There's no bullshit RPG mechanics like assassins creed so you can play the game at your own pace and just do whatever you want to do. 

However, the story fucking sucks. The 4 main villains are pretty interesting but the game is too scared to do anything with them. The ending is fucking awful and the least satisfying conclusion possible to a 30 hour game. Also, none of the other characters are memorable except the dog and the bear.

Worst story of all far cry franchise. The father makes no sense, saying he wants to save everyone while their cultists kill people left and right. Then it feels like the story gives a forced twist just to give one. It clearly wants you to reflect on the effects of fighting violence with violence, but put you in one of the few situations in which violence is THE only option. On every other installment I felt the villain leaves you with food for thought, whatever your choice is, like Pagan Ming and the deplorable state of affairs you leave Kyrat in after choosing any of the rebel fighters side, making his path the sour-sweet ""better"" one. He is also a ruthless killer and dicatator, but he never claims to be anything but. The father instead is all about ""I am giving you a chance"", ""I love you all"", ""I only drug you and strip you of your mind to save you""... like hell, he's killing left and right, hanging their carcases head-down from trees, then sticking twigs in their carcases to resemble deer, the whole place looks like a scene from Dante's inferno with so many of the townsfolk corpses laying around, and you are to forgive him to show you're the better man??? If you let him loose he's going to kill everyone!! How the fuck the medieval torture his ""Family"" members put the population through has anything to do with salvation (yeah, ripping pieces of your skin with a knive is totally because he wants you to join him in his bunker of salvation)! and then he lets you walk away from HIS grip because he's a mass murderer? And somehow if you forgive him the nuke doesn't fall?

Note to game developers:  It isn't rocket science.  Players should be the hero of their own narrative.  If you want to tightly control the narrative, make a movie.  Otherwise, let players make their own choices.  And, if you MUST script events to move a story in a certain direction, make sure those scripted events ADD to the fun and don't either suck the fun out or just make the player feel crappy.

FC5 makes you grind through repetitive world-wandering where you indiscriminately destroy bad guys and their stuff.  That, in itself, is not terrible.  You get to be the good guy and the game presents a villain that sort of begs to be destroyed ... so you can feel good about the fact that you are a mass murderer.  OK, that's sort of the game style.

But, where this game goes horribly off-track is that it makes you grind along at this repetition until you earn enough points to trigger scripted events that actually move the story forward.  In other words, you need to do a LOT of busy work before the game decides you have earned the right to advance the story.  This isn't based on whether or not you make good decisions - just whether or not you have sufficiently paid your dues in mindless repetition.

Then, it gets really ugly.  The scripted events just pluck you out of time and space once you have met the trigger conditions.  It really takes your head out of the game in a way that feels powerless.  No matter what decisions you have made and how intelligent you are, your character is forced into situations that you definitely would not have gotten into, had you been allowed to be in control.

In pretty much every scripted event, you are made to feel increasingly powerless and manipulated.  This is supposed to motivate you against the villain.  But, it really just reminds you that game isn't supposed to be fun - it is supposed to teach you a lesson.  And, that lesson is:  Puny player - you must do what we tell you to do.  You don't get to decide anything of consequence.

Again, that would be weak game design, but no weaker than most other games of the genre.  Where this crossest the line to become the worst game I have ever played is that the game takes what should be a heroic/savior character and forces the player to willingly participate in brainwashing to effectively become a more mindless mass murderer.

I am not really one to blame violence on video games, but this game is particularly effective at creating an environment that is almost unapologetically grooming mass shooters.  Some have pointed out that, in fact, some of this is more of a satire on violence in FPS games ... blah, blah, blah.  While that may have been the intent, that finer commentary is, I'm sure, lost on many impressionable players.

Regardless of the impact, it just isn't fun.  It just seems designed to make you experience futility to which the only remedy is mass violence.  I think that the game designers probably think this is clever - to invoke an emotional response in a video game.  But, it is not hard to make a player feel powerless or to motivate them to shoot characters.

It is way more clever to give players some choices that matter and to let them walk away from their time playing the game with a sense that it was fun and that they accomplished something.  At BEST, FC5 will just leave you feeling hollow.  More likely, it will leave you feeling worse than before you played it.  If it brings you joy, you are probably already a cult member.

...

On the positive side, the technical execution of the game is OK to excellent.  Some of the graphics/artwork is well above average, though not particularly unique.  The technical experience is solid with no real unpleasant surprises.

...

And ... now for some nitpicky stuff, but stuff that bugs me anyway.  If you look around, you will find plenty of commentary on much of the stuff that is annoying or makes no sense.  I won't focus on the common issues.  These comments are really directed at the game developers.

1)  Montanans do NOT have Texas accents.  The creative team seems get the West, Northwest, South, and Appalachia all mixed up.  This would be OK, as a fictitious world, but they made a point of setting this in Montana - specifically a few hours southwest of Missoula.  Almost none of the characters fit that region.

2) There really are extremist groups lurking about in that area, making it in really poor taste as a setting for this fictitious fantasy wasteland.  There is actually a town called Hope, ID which was probably the inspiration for the name of Hope County.  There are white supremacist and other idiot organizations in that region - more so than southwest of Missoula.

3)  I and my family and friends are from all over the region and no one I know has EVER seen a wolverine in the wild.  Yet, they commonly jump out and attack your crotch in FC5.  Similarly, we have mountain lions for sure, but you can live your whole life and never actually see one.  Yet, these are appearing and attacking randomly no matter where you are (alongside a major highway while a gunfight is going on, for example).  And ... bears almost never attack people, but moose do.  You got that backward.

4)  I couldn't prove it, but it appears that planes were able to take off and land from a forested hillside.  I did stumble across an enemy pilot idling a fighter plane on such a patch, completely surrounded by trees.  I didn't see how he got there, and I didn't see him take off, but another irritation is that the cult was able to deploy Spitfire-like fighter planes in just a few seconds whenever any cult member spotted the main character.  So, I assume they are just lurking in the trees?

5)  To limit my exposure, a few times I tried destroying a bunch of vehicles to effectively block the road from one direction.

Open world where you run errands for forgettable characters. Essentially you have 2-3 mission types and gets repetitive after 2 hours (while the main story has bored you to death after one hour of cut scenes). the whole thing is about grinding your way, one region at a time. 
Too much cut scenes
Fights are either too easy or shooting at bullet sponges
Shotguns have a range of 5 meters
Stealth is unbalanced and a waste of time over shooting your way through
Friendly NPCs from your gang or whatever are incredibly stupid
Hostile NPCs are deaf and specialize in attacking you by groups of one
Wildlife is just annoying. Walk for 5 minutes on a hill and enjoy being attacked by a turkey, a badger, a cougar and a bear within 2 minutes interval.

-Story line is well thought out and delivers some compelling scenes that keep you glued to your chair for hours on end. While having the 3 Siblings seems necessary for the story to develop, it feels as if the main antagonist is taken away from as his scenes are not as frequent as I would have liked. 
-Graphics are fantastic and is still playable 5 years later, keeping up with today's quality of graphics. Player movement seem fluid and smooth further showing why FarCry is one of the best FPS games on the market.

As the latest installment in the acclaimed Far Cry franchise, this game maintains the series' signature elements while introducing fresh gameplay mechanics and an intriguing narrative.

The first thing that stands out in Far Cry 5 is its stunning visuals and attention to detail in the fictional Hope County, Montana. The vast, picturesque landscapes, dense forests, and varied terrain contribute to an immersive environment that beckons players to explore every nook and cranny. The world feels alive, teeming with wildlife and numerous interactive elements, making the journey genuinely engaging.

The storyline revolves around the sinister doings of a cult called ""The Project at Eden's Gate,"" led by the enigmatic Joseph Seed. Players assume the role of a rookie deputy tasked with dismantling the cult and bringing Joseph to justice. While the narrative tackles some intriguing themes, the storytelling doesn't always reach its full potential, leaving some loose ends and unexplored character arcs.

Gameplay is the series' bread and butter, and Far Cry 5 continues the tradition of offering freedom and creativity in approaching missions. From stealthy takedowns to all-out mayhem, players have an arsenal of weapons and tools at their disposal. Furthermore, the ""Guns for Hire"" system allows players to recruit unique allies, each with their own abilities and quirks, adding depth to the gameplay experience.

One aspect that distinguishes Far Cry 5 from its predecessors is its focus on cooperative play. The entire campaign can be enjoyed in two-player co-op mode, fostering a sense of camaraderie and making the game even more enjoyable with a friend.

While the game offers an impressive array of activities and side missions, some players may find certain missions repetitive or formulaic over time. Additionally, the AI behavior of both enemies and allies occasionally exhibits quirks and limitations, which can slightly detract from the immersion.

In conclusion, Far Cry 5 delivers an exciting and visually stunning adventure set in a captivating open world.

A ""doomsday cult"" poses itself as a legitimate Christian church that misrepresents what Christianity actually stands for is, in my opinion, damaging to Christianity and Jesus Christ Himself. in the first 30 minutes of the gameplay the characters slandered the name of Jesus about 5 times. As a Christian myself, I do acknowledge that there were many instances in history when self-professing Christians committed violent atrocities, and I would not have problem playing such games as far as historical accuracy was concerned. However, to gamers unfamiliar with the the message of Christianity, this game only causes the divide with faith to widen. Even though, knowing my faith I can discern where the false teachers and false prophets are, I cannot in good conscience support this game because of countless souls led astray by such extreme and inaccurate depiction. If you decide to play this game, please, do not perceive the antagonist and this ""doomsday cult"" as an actual depiction of Christianity because it is simply not so, and give Jesus Christ a chance to speak for Himself.

So, I'll start by saying that I love this game! Far Cry 5 is an incredibly exciting game that takes you to the state of Montana, where you encounter the cult called ""The Project at Eden's Gate."" This game is amazingly well done, perfectly balanced, and has lots of interesting quests and missions. Moreover, I'm just in awe of the game world! It's so vast and diverse that you can spend hours wandering through the wilderness, driving cars, or boating. And it all looks amazing! The visual part of the game is surprising with its beauty and detail.

Now, of course, there are some things that I didn't like in the game. For example, it's not always convenient to navigate the map, and sometimes there are quite boring missions. But honestly, these are minor flaws compared to how huge and exciting world the developers have created. 

So, what's my final verdict? Far Cry 5 is simply an amazing game that you definitely need to try. If you love open-world, action, adventure, and humor, then this game should be on your ""must-play"" list. I would give it a 9 out of 10, and only because no game is perfect.",1679644592,1690666988,True,77,1,0.731428682804107666,5,True,False,False

   The graphics are really nice, decent sound, gunplay/combat is satisfying, story is okay at best. Regardless, worth a play through.
   Despite that BASE GAME being worth it, I wouldn't waste any of your money on DLC. Even if it's on sale, don't.  The DLC is garbage in my opinion. The Zombies one are score/time based mini missions. Not bad but not great.  The Vietnam one is short and rather lackluster, basically you just try to get from one side of the map to the other with a few objectives in-between. Pretty sure it doesn't even take an hour to do.
   Now the Mars DLC is what really bugged me. It's bland and just boring. You're on Mars doing essentially the longest fetch quest possible fighting the same 2 enemies in an orange wasteland.",1569727149,1690613679,True,11,3,0.566914141178131104,0,True,False,False

Joseph Seed is an interesting character and a great addition to the series. Absolutely gorgeous graphics even for a game released in 2018 and the game runs really well too. One of the very few optimized games from Ubisoft. The shovel and shovel launcher are both hilarious amazing weapons to use. Possibly my favorite Far Cry game along with Far Cry 3.

My only issue with this game is the absolutely bonkers ending(s). Far Cry 5 is a great game with multiple (4 to be exact; 1 being a meme ending) completely unsatisfying and head scratching endings. The other day when I completed the campaign, I couldn't help but ask myself ""What the fuck!?!?!?"" sort of ending was that, and not in a good way. None of them are exactly a cliff hanger, but rather they aren't what the player truly wants and makes you also ask yourself why you played this game if it was going to end like that. One of the best-worst endings I've seen to a game. A true head scratching ending.

The only ending that I liked was the ""secret"" ending. That was hilarious and pure gold. The only issue is the game just ends right there and there's no game to play after that. You'll see what I mean if you figure out how to get that ending.

I highly recommend this game in Co-Op with friends and solo play. The story is interesting but the ending is typical Ubisoft being Ubisoft. One of my favorite games but I have to criticize Far Cry 5 for the stupid ending.",1690596886,1690596886,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you break free of the first few missions, you can join a friend for what seems like one of the most chaotic, open co-op games I've ever played. There is the slight exception that you can't really travel too far from your companion without being teleported back to eachother. The other caveat being that you are quite literally kidnapped to be fed story and cutscenes over a dozen times. Its the only real way that the game progresses, The worst part, however, has to be the fact that Ubisoft basically forces you to 100% this game to even complete the basic story. You require a certain amount of resistance points to be ""kidnapped"" for the next story beat. This means that we had multiple hours where me were scouring the map looking for certain enemies that would only spawn every 45 minutes. Way to kill what could have been the best popcorn co-op game ever.

The forte here is the co-op up to six players. The game doesn't feel as arcady as FC3 or 4, but feels more like a COD with a PvE feel to it; easy to die, easy to kill. It is fast and it encourages being aggressive. The whole crafting system from FC 3, 4 and Primal seems to have been thrown out the window.

I did appreciate the amount of ''partners'' you can have to accompany you, giving them orders and the fact that they can revive you was a major plus considering how easy it is to die. 

It is important to note that only the host will progress in his or her story (the map), none of the joined players will have any progress save (apart from their perks, guns and money). 

There are also some bugs, like invisible cars in multiplayer (which is hilarious, made me think of wonder woman in her plane), disappearing NPCs (enemies popping in and out of existence while driving), quests objectives that stick on screen... Nothing major, most of these are easy to shrug off. 

The acting and voice overs are great, but sadly there are too few story missions and too much freedom (I know, what? Too much freedom?!) It tends to make it lack continuity. I ended up doing many things in an order that made the game lack a lot of sense. But that's fine. I'm not even going to get into the endings. 

I should also mention the game has a big emphasis on religion, 'merica and might rub some people the wrong way. Personally, I thought it was funny. Especially Hurk. Gotta love Hurk.

All in all, it's a good game. It just didn't feel like a Far Cry at all. It's the RE 6 to the Resident Evils. But it's a blast nonetheless.

For the people who have many bugs with ubi-connect etc. This is mostly because of the steam-ubi connection thing. Really stupid but when you buy a game from ubi over steam, they are most times very buggy and not working. To fix this issue you have to install the game via steam, so it registers in your ubi-acc with dlc's etc. Then you delete it from steam and install it again over ubi-connect. Then you will never have to use the stupid steam-ubi integration again and from that point on I could play the game as it was intented, and its really fun (besides the kidnapping cutscenes, but there are like only 6 of them so not too many) and my favorite FarCry game by far. The cult is very , shall we call it interesting?, and the game overall couldnt feel more american. Guns Guns Guns and some very stereotype shit. The map feels authentic as a ubisoft open world can be and the side missions are 95% all fun and not repetetive. i mean you have to harvest testicles from a bull with a fcking tractor with a shredder, do i have to say more? thats all i have for you know, but i really recommend getting all the dlc with it, Besides everyone hating the dlc, I personally  really enjoyed them. the vietnam one felt authentic, but a bit short and lost on mars is, well, weird but you can make pew pew on aliens so very cool aswell. Just dont expect any good story from the dlc, both are miserable in that part.  Get the agme and enjoy, I mean 13 bucks for the gold edition is worth it, just dont ragequit after the first 10 mins because you are stuck in a cutscene. Youll get used to it, that happens plenty.

Periodically throughout the game it will declare your playtime finished, abducting the player, and then forcing them through some version of the same escape mission they have already done several times before.

All the same Far Cry fun as the previous instalments, but bigger and better looking. Story is really interesting and the antagonists are really fun to go up against. Lots of other interesting characters also.

Gun play is good with a nice selection of firearms and explosives. Air combat is fun, nothing better than strafing an enemy convoy. 

I like the fact you can have allies, both human and animal. One downside is they can get in the way at times. Also if you park up your helicopter and they are around they will jump in and fly around meaning you can't. 

Only other annoyance is you can be roaming the open world in the middle of something and just suddenly be pulled in to a mission (captured) out of nowhere. 

Overall a really decent game, with all the usual gun play madness and thankfully not too many towers to climb :)

~~~~~~~~~~~

And that's Far Cry 5 in a nutshell.

If you've played Far Cry N, N+1, N+2, ..., then you've played Far Cry 5, and know the mechanics.

Pros:

+ They took the great graphics from Primal, and added guns

+ But, you're not focused on finding craftables like Primal, so you can actuall enjoy the graphics instead of ""hunter vision"" all the time

+ Some find the plot weird, insulting, etc (eg: they feel it's an allegory for christo-facists, so why did they allow black people into their fold?) I feel the plot is just about cults.. Manson, Koresh, etc style cults where a ""cult of personality"" leader  finds discarded people, gives them a purpose, and suddenly they have an army and are trying to take over everything. It's an interesting view into how cults work.

+ The exploration, random gun fights, base take overs, etc are fun. Open world sandbox with great graphics and ""do what you want"" is always fun. This is the ""sex"" I was talking about.

Cons:

- ... until they decide you're not allowed to have fun. And, instead, they feel you must be railroaded into a long-winded plot continuation against your will. This is the  ""monologue"" I was talking about. As you clear areas, a meter racks up. When it hits a certain milestone, instead of something good happening, instead the head bad guy of the area comes and forcefully kidnaps you into a cut scene.

If you're lucky, you just sit through some monologe'ing and can then get on with life. If you're not lucky, you get stuck having to control your character mucking through some drug-fueled dream state, or trying to escape some prison.

It's incredibly stupid.

The most important thing about the game should be the player. Is the player having fun? Is the player feeling a sense of accomplishment? Is the player feeling a sense of progress? Is the player feeling like they have some sense of control of outcomes?

Instead, the devs decided that their plot is more important than the player. So, they forcefully take away all player agency and shove you down the plot rabbit hole they dug for you against your will.

And it is forced.

You get a notice ""You've been marked / blessed / etc""
Then you get another notice ""a party is out to get you""
From that point on, enemies home in on you like you're lit-up with a neon sign.
And, even if you do everything you can to evade them, kill them, etc, they'll still magically capture you.

The Faith girl is worse, b/c she just says ""you've been blessed"", and if you ignore talking to her ghost enough she'll just insta-jump you a final time without any warning.

I was almost to the top of a mountain I was climbing looking for a stash. Suddenly I'm interrupted by a kidnapping from the girl out of nowhere.

I was done with a base, and ready to go to my next target. Nope, the head guy in the area called in his lackeys to kidnap me. So, I spent 5 pointless minutes running just for everyone in a truck to find me out in BFE nowhere as if by magic, and get caught.

The other problem is it breaks realism. If these folks instantly know how to find you when you've been ""marked"", why can't they just instantly find you all the time? It makes no sense.

I got kidnapped.
I escaped the prison.
Why doesn't the bad guy just ""mark"" me again, and have them zero in on me instantly?

Why?

Because.

There's no explanation other than the devs want to screw with you.

Whoever play-tested this game should have kicked-up a much bigger fuss about this garbage mechanic, b/c it almost makes this a down-vote from me.

The ending of the game basically taking away all impact you had on the game is also icing on the cake. This is the ""your partner gets up and walks off right before you can climax.""

It just leaves you frustrated.

So, those are my biggest complaints. There's other stuff I could nitpick.

But, I still give it a thumbs-up.

Why?

Because, at the end of the day, 90% of the game is fun.
It's a Far Cry game. It's fun.
But, it's also a Far Cry game, which means for some stupid reason the devs once again decided to have a stupid plot that has insert its stupid self into my stupid life just so I can get back to the fun. But, this time around, *I* don't get to control when the plot interrupts my fun; they decide when that happens. And that is an awful design decision.",1690308079,1690308079,True,135,43,0.804255366325378418,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the positives: the Vietnam dlc is genuinely great: the stealth mechanic risk & reward is fun even tho it shoul need some more cooking

Positives over on with the negatives

The skills don't feel rewarding, you have already from the beginning most of the ""tree"" unlocked and ready to be claimed. most of the unlocks are ""more ammos for x"" or ""the companion recharges faster"" and there are like 7 actually useful skills max. 
the takedowns are all in one skill and you have to figure out how each one works by yourself, i only learn at the end that there was the one where you auto shoot with the one handed weapon.

The Gameplay is not satisfying: you have immidaite access to 3/4 of the weapons and the remaning ones are skins. 
Stealth kills don't feel as such, they extend to give a comical baseball bat to a guy or kicking him in the face once stuff that you can wake up from in idk a few minutes but you kill em apparently, while in 3 you fucking stabbed a dude, they were visceral. again talking about skills, in past entries the tank was a hill you needed to work for by getting many skills before you could stealth kill and even then it was animated like it was still a struggle to defeat, now there is no difference between any enemy. the mercenary with bow and arrow can fucking one shot it no problem WTF. 

The story has no interesting main character outside of 2/4 villains.
The old guy at the beginning is nothing, it's presented like the person rescuing you at the beginning of 3 but you never see him agian [spoiler] untill you see him dead in the finale of the nuclear ending [/spoiler] .
[spoiler] the better ending is the one where you leave, both at the beginning and the end btw, i can't care less about anything happening here [/spoiler]
any try on comedy falls flat: or the line is cringe worthy or is rude or is psycothic. No shit i always pick the animals to go around with
the space dlc goes 1000% with this because IT'S A FUCKING PARODY OF BORDERLANDS BUT IF THE ONLY PERSON TALKING IS CLAPTRAP. You have Hurk talking about BULL SHIT  NO STOP I COULDN'T FINISH IT

The story: For me, there is no story, just a nice idea.

The characters: They don’t have any real interesting story, so you can’t get attached to them. They’re just 
there, which is the only part that I like - the animal companion, air support, etc. 
The hunting and crafting: The hunting is so lame like 10 shot for a turky. and crafting is really basic with only a few weapons.

The economy: You can sell very little things like animal fur for like 100-300 dollars, but weapon trinkets and other looting for trade do not exist.

The player character: The worst part for me is that the player has no voice! Come on! Is that a joke? I played for like 50 hours and I don’t even know my full name in the game. They may have mentioned it, but you don’t have any connection to the character.

- Great graphics and optimization.
- Variety of rideable vehicles.
- Things to do more than just killing.
- Variety of interesting companions and their back story.
- When a region is free of cultists (lieutenant & side missions are cleared out), place becomes a lot nicer: no one wants to kill you while you fish (other than wild animals)

Cons:
- Variety of general populace.
- The story progresses you without warning, not giving you a chance to make precautions.
- Unable to save in key story missions.
- With the above two: If you get yourself to face off with one of the lieutenants, you'll have to do it, or else the only save will be before the other action/mission you did before reaching that high on the wanted list, making your next playthrough longer.
- Supposedly (at highest levels) you are the most wanted in the region, yet the roads can be so empty, you bore to death. That's contradicted when you don't want attention (applies to early stages too) and enemies just keep pouring in like there's no tomorrow.
- On later times, when the resistance gets high enough, cleaning out an outpost completely stealthed will be difficult as many times NPCs just show up and start a fight with the cultists, or an airborne dogfight is getting started above your head.
- Some missions are too easy to do, if you have an attack hellicopter, that is... Like helping Grace. There's no restrictions that you can't ""cheat"" (like when you had to blow up convoys with Nick's plane, but you did it with an attack chopper instead).
- The last mission (take on Father), is pretty much un-doable for casual players, or those who got more used to the stealth of the game.",1563284509,1689978752,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Meme's aside, Far Cry 5 is a pretty solid game, and worth playing with a friend, I thoroughly enjoyed my time, but the writing is very hit or miss in some places. 
Don't go into it expecting a typical Far Cry game, no exotic islands or pirates here, just American Values, and Religion.

Of all the characters, John and Joseph Seed are the two most memorable ones, Jacob is mediocre with horribly boring story sections until the second-last and last section. Faith is just an obstacle, and her fight is reminiscent of an old boss arena from a DOOM game or something.

John Seed's story was probably the more interesting one, even ending in one of my favourite fights (Especially Co-op).

The Gunplay is really fun, the Hunting is.. well very arcadey, but a nice distraction between missions, and the Fishing is relaxing, but not overly rewarding.

The Guns for Hire are awesome too (My last FC game was 3, so FC5 was a real interesting change), Peaches is by far my Favourite, while a Whitetail Sniper and Grace came second for Solo Play.
The Weapon Selection is neat, but feels lacking.

The driving in this game feels -really- good, compared to previous Ubisoft titles, it actually felt like I was driving a car, they had weight to them, grunt, and handled like a damn car, however, All cars in a category are the same short of weaponised ones. A Sportscar is the same speed as a family sedan.

The Monetisation is honestly not as bad as previous Ubisoft titles, it's.. completely unnecessary and completely avoidable.

The Story itself takes inspiration from Wildlands, as in it's a Semi-linear progression. You're not forced to follow a set path, instead, you can progress however you want, I enjoy it.

The character customization is decent, but, I personally would like more National Guard clothes, but, what we have is okay.

Sadly, the ending left me with more questions than answers, and it's only explained through Radio Broadcasts, it honestly felt like a kick in the face, there's no good endings here, all three end in ways to piss you off.",1689544318,1689845260,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Good gameplay buried under the usual Triple-A incompetence, lack of passion, and overprice. Get it at a 90% discount.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Good shooter;

[*]Well done gospel songs for the cult;

[*]The setting creates a nice warzone experience.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Microstutters whenever the game autosaves, which is basically every time you get any item, discover any map points, or complete any activity;

[*]Broken mission scripts, softlocking game progression. In 46 hours of playtime, I had to start it from scratch 3 times, and so I gave up a third of the way through it;

[*]Poorly coded AI, getting stuck on trees, cars, and buildings instead of flanking the player. That makes so objectives like ""eliminate all enemies in the area"" turn into 10-minute-long hunts for every enemy who is unresponsive in the region;

[*]Minimal player progression: there are weapons and perks to be unlocked, but you get perk points so fast and easily that you max out all essential perks in a matter of 2 hours, and then for weapons there's not much difference between them, you will eventually stick to one ""good enough"" gun and never change your playstyle. It gets monotonous pretty quick;

[*]Lack of movement fluidity. If you fall from more than 1,5 meter, you lose health. Can't shoot while sliding on the ground. Knife throws are slow. All that makes so the best strategy is to just crouch near protections, aim above them, and click when there are heads in your crosshairs. Which would've been fine, if not for all the other problems listed above.

I am a gamer who likes to typically give an exception to bugs either because 1. it's funny as hell, and 2. it isn't game breaking.

I have already taken a screen capture of an infamous ""floating tree"" in the valley of Hope/Sinner County...and as much as it pulled me out of the ""immersion"" of the game's story, I still could care less. Why? Because I could laugh about it amidst the game's slightly disturbing overtone for the story.

The game's story is its stronger point, which is both good and bad. When there are in-game cutscenes (AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM), these are the moments the story flow the best and feel the most fluent and immersive. The characters feel so hollow and empty-threat when they are sending goons out to kill you...but when you encounter them face to face, it feels and plays by experiences similar to that to Far Cry 3, when you fought Vaas, or Hoyt, or Citra's Giant, etc. It all panders to a really compelling set of characters that are portrayed in such a manner that the game is enriched just by their presence (prodominently Faith and The Father). However, this then all falls out the flippin' window onto a bed of spikes laced with laughing poison when you have to engage in 'combat' during a story mission, when the AI is just a bunch of morons.

The AI from Far Cry has never been something that monumental or ground-shattering, but the variety in enemy types is what divided super easy enemies from the not-so-easy. I look at Far Cry 4, and think about how many enemy types there are in that game, and how Heli gunships would fly in, along with just the sheer vastness of the fortresses. There was a lot of verticality brought into the mix when Far Cry 4 introduced the varying placement of outposts and fortresses, and allowed the player to abuse the grappling hook item. Here, I throw a proximity bomb where enemies are sure to run towards after I shoot a guy. I shoot a guy, they know where it's coming from (without detecting me), run up there and I just move to the other vantage point across the way, and kill the rest while the bumbling idiot AI just waltzes straight into my proximity bomb! Stupid EZ. What happened to the fear that Far Cry brought out? Far Cry 3 always stands as the pinnacle to the series, as the characters were likable and hateable, the gameplay loop was satisfying yet grindy, and the weapons/enemy variety was enough to not drive you insane...then Far Cry 4 took those concepts AGAIN, put it in a BIGGER map, and basically turned it into a base-capturing simulator, but with a story around it.

Here, I feel none of those things, but a pandering backseat story to the extremes of zealous religious cults taking it to the max in America.

But to keep this review short and to the point, I'll say this: Am I enjoying the game? Yes, I most definitely am! 
Do I recommend this game? Only on sale, and ONLY if you are willing to look past certain bugs (like I did). If you can't look past these things, you are gonna HATE this game.
Finally, is it worth the full price? HELL NO! Get this monster on sale, and consider the DLCs for another time. (got it for $9 bucks during the recent sales).

There aren't any towers to capture (which I personally enjoyed), the health system is different in that you can't heal without medkits, and healing with them takes longer than in FC4 or 3 BUT the entire health bar can heal naturally given time. I personally think that the map (which is set in Montana if I'm not mistaken) isn't as pretty as Kyrat, but it is still gorgeous, they definitely made improvements to the DUNIA engine in that regard. Making money near the start of the game is annoying, it isn't as plentiful as it was before in FC4, not helped by the fact that enemies don't drop things specifically to sell, and that enemy bodies disappear upon liberating an outpost. That means if you try to be sneaky and pick everyone off with a sniper rifle, you won't get the added benefit of being able to loot everyone when you're done (However there are bonuses given for no alarms and being undetected). Initially I found the antagonist to just kinda be annoying, but as I keep going, the story gets more and more interesting.

I'll start with the good. First, the gameplay and controls are very intuitive and fun. Far Cry has always had a great feel to the guns and stealth mechanics. Radio Towers are no longer a thing, which is nice. You're immediately dropped into an open map and can pretty much go wherever you want right from the very beginning. The amount of vehicles, guns and companions can suit various play styles. The grappling hook is also a great addition to traversal.

Now, the bad. Unfortunately, the story was a huge letdown for me. I found all of the antagonists to be incredibly boring, cliche and lack any clear motivations. The whole story and dialogue felt like it was written by a teenager trying to be edgy, yet it never crossed any truly controversial lines. Eden's Gate is clearly inspired by some real-world far right religious cults, but Far Cry 5 has absolutely nothing original or interesting to say about any of it. The bad guys are basically just crazy for crazy-sake. This criticism extends to all of the other side characters as well. I found that none of the companions said or did anything remotely of interest, and half of them devolved into slapstick, sophomoric humor (nothing wrong with that in and of itself, however it doesn't really fit the narrative the game is clearly trying to tell).

Far Cry has always had some drug-fueled story lines, but Far Cry 5 really went overboard to the point that your character is drugged and/or hallucinating in just about every other cutscene. In fact, the Bliss drug is basically a narrative crutch anytime the game needs you to be at a disadvantage.

Character customization might as well be non-existent because the player models all look like Madden create-a-players, and you can't even alter their looks that much (seriously, only 5-6 hairstyles and no facial hair options?). I think the story also suffers from silent protagonist syndrome. Besides shooting people, your character never gets to directly intervene or interact with any of the other characters in a meaningful way. Now, I get why a lot of games go this route, but in order to pull it off, you need a much stronger story or some sort of dialogue options ala Fallout 3/New Vegas. 

I know I listed a lot more cons, but the game is very fun to actually play. Just don't expect any kind of groundbreaking storytelling.",1689513834,1689513834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Good:
Gameplay is Ubisoft doing what Ubisoft does. If you like Far Cry gameplay, you'll like this. It polishes the formula to a near mirror finish, and sets the stage for what would be built on in Far Cry 6 (if you've the choice of the two but can only get one, get 6. Seriously. 5 sucks, 6 is FUGGIN GREAT). The guns gun, the bows bow, and the cars go vroom. It has better car mechanics than Cyberpunk 2077 (not hard to do). The flight mechanics suck--don't fly a plane, get a helicopter.

It has all the features you know and love, hunting, gathering, crafting. The ability to take a base YOUR WAY, from stealth, to gunplay, to using nature, to mortars. Ya know, good ol' Far Cry Gameplay. Bullet Types add a fun dynamic, and the ""hit Q and use the mouse scroll wheel to fly around"" menu is very intuitive. I very much like the UI. Felt natural, and as it should be.

The friendly NPCs are fun, funny, and damn memorable. Hurk is a hoot, Nick is a nut, and Jess is a joy. Most of the time I had Jess and Peaches with me, though, since I prefer a stealthy approach.

The Bad:
Literally everything else. The story is garbage. It started off interesting enough, [strike]Jim Jones[/strike] [strike]David Koresh[/strike] [strike]Randal Claude Weaver[/strike] Joseph Seed is under arrest for kidnapping and assault at the very least, probably murder as well. Not to mention the drugs. Lots of drugs are involved. He's got an entire cult around him that decide ""Hey, they showed up in a heliochopter, let's make sure the whirlybird what's got our Beloved Leader on it [i]CRASHES![/i]"" cause ya know that makes sense.

After that it just goes down hill. You escape, of course, and meet up with the Resistance. Every ""Resistance Level"" you gain, though, you're interrupted by one of Seed's lieutenants (also a family member-YAY NEPOTISM!) in an absolutely unavoidable railroaded ""hunt party"" kidnapping. Or ya know, a cloud of psychedelic drug gas. Whatever. Point is, you get railroaded off to these absolute... well, I was going to say demagogues, but they don't play as much to prejudice as they do to fear and emotion. Anyway, you get to listen to them monologue at you--with no way of escaping or walking away--even in the one section where that appears to be an option. And they don't just put a bullet to you. Knowing full well you're harming their cause. Nor can you just put a bullet to them. Because... Reasons?

And then there's ""the Bliss."" Or I should say there's ""the Bliss"" the drug, and ""the Bliss"" the state of... being? I guess? It's all really rather very silly. Anyway, the drug is basically, as others have said, Ubisoft's catchall for whatever they need for plot. It makes people a mindless zombie. It's a mind control agent. It makes them instantly swap over to Seed's side. It's whatever it needs to be for the narrative to move forward. It is the ultimate lazy writing drug. And when combined with other plants in the area, the player can use it to boost their speed, strength, and other attributes! Woo hoo! Cause that makes sense somehow?

Then there's the narrative itself. I'm not going to go into too much detail, other than to say it's all over the place in tone, and it takes away player agency A LOT. I mean a whole friggin' HEAP. More than just railroading you. It's the Bullet Train to No More Agency.

The Ugly:
Put it this way: Rock Paper Shotgun called the ending ""The Worst Ending In Video Game History."" I don't know as I'd go that far, but I will say it's the worst piece of writing in the Far Cry series. Possibly the worst piece of writing in Ubisoft's history. It's just really, really badly done. It's out of left field, it's not only unexpected, it literally negates everything you as the player have done for the past uh... I have 28.3 hours as of writing this, cause turns out guess what? Once you get to the end? That's the end. You don't get to go and wrap up all those other sidequests you had left. So make sure you're ready. Cause to quote Jar Jar Binks, ""you say BOOM degasser, den crash in de Boss' hedlibber, den BANISHED.""

The Irritating:
Ubisoft requires Uplay to make this work. I've had mixed results with Steam+Uplay, sometimes the game links, sometimes it don't sometimes it asks for a key, and when that happens, it's time for a refund. Obviously, I was able to get this one to work. But YMMV, Buyer Beware, all those other caveats.

TL;DR-Gameplay is Far Cry Gameplay: Liberate outposts, stop the convoys, find collectibles, stare at people till little icons appear over their heads like fairies on Christmas Trees. Everything else is hot garbage. And that garbage is on fire. And the fire is on your trousers. And there's a badger loose in them. And he's very upset at being in your flaming trousers. What I'm driving at is it's a very bad situation and no one should ever want to subject themselves to it if they can avoid it.",1689509020,1689509348,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The plot is by no means special, but it's well written (for the most part) with funny satire, commentary that is still welcome and relevant in 2023, and actually interesting side-characters. The villains are fun, with Faith and Joseph himself taking the cake as the best due to them being deeper and more complex than John and Jacob (mind you, the latter two are still a joy to see, specially Jacob).

The gameplay trims down on the boring aspects of Far Cry 3 and 4. You aren't handicapped by boring crafting that forces you to go to the middle of nowhere and pray what you're looking for spawns. All items have their own slots, with the stuff you can sell never getting in the way of your crafting components. The Deputy is very mobile and versatile from the start, with nearly all takedowns unlocked right from the get go. Whatever's left, alongside other traits and extra equipment slots, they are all locked behind the perks, which this time are unlocked by spending points you earn through challenges and exploration instead of an arbitrary XP system. It's also rather hard to get rich in this game, which is welcome.  The game is also rather hard, even on Normal, as the Deputy feels like a glass cannon.
This game released right before Ubisoft turned the series into a low quality looter shooter, too, so the gunplay is at its peak: weapons all handle differently, bullet travel and gravity are a real thing to worry about, and it overall feels satisfying.

It isn't a perfect experience, but it is nonetheless fun and it got more hate than it deserved. The game also has full campaign co-op and the Arcade mode, complete with an extremely advanced map editor that allows for infinite replayability. At a discount, this game is a must for any first person shooter fans, open world fans or co-op fans.

Story isn't that great (captures suck and interrupt whatever you're doing), a lot of the missions are weak (progressing the story through world activities is so much better), and the resistance characters don't have the same impact as in previous games with you rotating regions and not getting enough time with them. Even The Father suffers from this, not intimidation or charisma but a 3 sniveling broadcasts and a few cut-scenes. As a Far Cry game it is beaten out by 2, 3, 4, and even primal in my potentially controversial opinion.

But,
BUT,

Hope County Montana is one of my favorite settings in gaming. When you are walking through the woods, hunting or exploring or whatever, and you turn and look past the trees to see beautiful big sky Montana with acres of trees and flowing creeks and fish jumping from lakes GOD DAMN. I can't tell you how many times I've just stopped and stared, soaking in the world and ambiance, having the soundtrack start playing and having a moment of peace before the murder kicks up again. Noticeable variation to the 3 regions keeps things fresh with enough areas of interest and much to explore (I really liked the treasure hunts, some bland but others were piecing together stories of survivors or had an interesting gimmick). Speaking of the soundtrack, its fantastic. If they made religious music like whats in the game I'd be a choir boy by now. Both energetic christian country and choir music that gives strange feelings of belonging and hope in a way (besides the murder). Not to mention the beautiful instrumental violin, piano, and BANJO tracks, I never thought I'd enjoy a banjo but here we are. Each region has its own songs and 'genre', keeps the music feeling new and really well represents the sibling of the region you are in.

The weapons are fun to play with, especially giving each gun a test run at an outpost (with a few game-y mechanics and weak sound effects aside). My favorite thing to do is to get a hunting rifle, get the cost of a gun and it's upgrades that I want to mess around with, and hunt and adventure until the the cost is met. The game def goes full 'Murica with the number of well modeled firearms and not even mentioning all the spawn-able weaponized trucks and cars. Far Cry 5 goes the farthest into the sandbox genre, adding a whole bunch of land, sea, and air vehicles to mess around with. Some vehicles do outright break the games difficulty but who can deny the fun of rocking up to a fight with a semi truck armed to the teeth or flying a helicopter and raining death from above. Is having to handicap yourself in a game to even have a challenge good game design? Not really, but it is just so much fun here I don't mind being death incarnate (I think in the cult you they believe you to literally be 'hell' so why not live up to that). 

There is enough to this game I think it's worth your time. I only glossed over the main things I liked, not even mentioning co-op, arcade mode, or the characters and missions that are actually pretty good. If you are a Far Cry fan or just an fps enjoyer pick it up at a discount unless you are needing Montana time desperately and flights are too expensive.

It's been thoroughly well done and the developers should be proud of their accomplishment.

This game took me out of my comfort zone and shone a light onto some subjects that made me feel uncomfortable, and made me think about the subjects they were portraying. All of these are positive things and an achievement for games to do such things for their audience.

The reason I don't recommend it?

1. Limited 2 player co-op only, with a maximum distance threshold of about 800m makes the trailer of 2 players flying planes obsolete and misleading. Ghost Recon Wildlands was released 1 year before (2017) with 4 player co-op with zero tether mechanics (meaning you could travel the entire massive map without penalty). Likewise FC5 and shares some familiar systems with Wildlands, but fails to meet cooperative expectations. Yes, they were developed by different branches of Ubisoft, but that's not an excuse for AAA. Additionally Breakpoint (2019) was later updated to support quality of life features - Ubisoft can certainly do the same here. It's my opinion they choose not to and I think poorly of them for doing so. Were they to leave it and just have it singleplayer only? I could completely respect that - however to advertise only 2-player co-op AND with tether mechanics seems to highlight a wider, systemic problem with Ubisoft as a developer and publisher and the disconnect from their fanbase.

2. 90% of the time I spend senselessly killing people, animals etc. I would have hoped for more dynamic gameplay and narrative options that reflected this. I appreciate that this is part of a wider, meta narrative to emphasise a pessimistic view of America (and world), but in my opinion it was very heavily imbalanced (emphasising the senseless killing too much) and made gameplay dull rather quickly and lost it's meaning. To me that is the antithesis of a game trying to make a point / present an agenda. Dialling it back on the constant shooting / killing would contribute to the overall message of the game in my opinion by making it so when you do take a life, it would have more meaning. Yes they're cultists, but it very quickly just become ""they're mobs in the way of me progressing the story"". I became quite quickly emotionally detached from this aspect of the game. I would have been very interested to tackle additional themes like redemption which the game seemed to shy away from, despite the overarching religious themes (i.e can you turn cult members? Can you play against the resistance? Could you convert resistance members?).

3. Some of the overarching narrative felt a little stale. I found myself disagreeing with a lot of choices that characters made, or seeing cheap plot devices to extend the plot. Far Cry is an IP that isn't shy to hidden or alternate endings (Ubisoft in general with games like Wildlands which also had alternate endings). I would have preferred the option to explore alternate routes in the *narrative* rather than be forced down a linear path (as mentioned above in my earlier point). Even if this was basic gameplay like faction management etc. There are 3 endings to this game, but in the end players' actions don't mean squat until the very end of the game. 

4. Being hunted is completely unavoidable. I've been hit with various sleep bullets/bliss/etc whilst inside resistance HQs (Wolves Den for example) - extremely immersion breaking. I would have preferred an escalation mechanic similar to other Ubisoft games (like escalated notoriety mechanics) to make it overwhelming for the player and truly give the player a sense of challenge, accomplishment and like they're being properly hunted. Again, poor plot device. Wildlands did it, so should Far Cry. Additionally what happens to companions when the player is taken, narratively speaking? It was jarring and disappointing for an otherwise immersive experience.

5. Pacing was off throughout the game. It seemed to jump between intense, fast paced action - to mandatory slow pace. There was a reason people got upset with Bioware when they forced players to walk in Anthem: we don't like being forced into a single play style. There were moments when it felt like the game dictated the pace so much that I may as well have just decided to watch a movie.

6. I found it hard to connect with characters emotionally or care about them in some instances. This is a personal point, but due to the game design and the scope of what was immediately available: i.e being able to go anywhere or do anything, I had a weird sense of just needing to tick off all the people in a region so I could fight the main bad guy, and then move on & repeat until finally confronting the Big Bad™. This goes back into pacing, but too many options and too much freedom in the beginning gave me the sense that my actions weren't really going to matter and that the ultimate goal was getting to Joseph, not helping free people. Especially when it came to freeing people - I would have preferred people with names, not randomly spawned NPCs. It would have made hostages being executed much more impactful. So again with pacing - just easing into the game with a direction that slowly opens up the overall goal would have been beneficial for gripping my attention, rather than just a tick list of names to help and meaningless actions. I think this was most emphasised satirically by the FBI agent & the rather meta fetch quest you do for him.

7. Despite Dutch telling me I wasn't going to have to climb up towers for the rest of the game, I did, in fact, climb up and down towers for the rest of the game. (I joke... Kinda).

8. Finally the Ubisoft Formula™: It's not a bad thing to build on what you've already got and used established mechanics and tools. However Ubisoft games are starting to feel pretty much the same at the moment, with just different themes. Hostile area, slowly liberate it. It worked well for Ghost Recon games because it's that ""operator/blackops-vibe"", but I found it wasn't enough to rely upon when making games like Far Cry where there are big, sweeping themes. In my opinion, the narrative and plot development also needs to take a front row seat to ensure that the player connects with that theme in some way (regardless if positive or negative).

9 (Cheeky). Mute protagonists drive me crazy. Fallout 4 was a great example of telling the story of Nate / Nora. Cyberpunk about telling the story of V. I would enjoy playing a Far Cry where I control a tangible protagonist rather than someone who is mute. This may have been a factor into the duality of immersion and total emotional disconnection - because I was just being talked at for the *entirety of the game* with little agency. There was no emotional connection between the deputy and the players. When you conclude the Whitetail story line, it didn't have an impact on me because there wasn't that emotional connection that I was expecting to have between the protagonist and the other characters. To top this off - there weren't any dialogue options, which really sealed the deal. I could not express my views, I was just simply watching a movie with extra steps.

Overall it was a good game, but Ubisoft could have, and has done better. Especially for open world games, Ubisoft needs to take a leaf out of Bioware, Bethesda and CD Projekt Red's narrative books on how successful open world & narrative driven games are designed. Players need agency to express their wants and control the protagonist their way, not be told or forced into a specific direction. If Ubisoft is going to do that, then they need to commit to the direction of linear story and not wrap it up as something pretending to be an open world game with any illusion of control on overall narrative beyond a few main plot points which lead to similar conclusions.",1689093331,1689093752,False,15,0,0.682995438575744629,0,True,False,False

It didnt make much sense, the characters were unintresting and boring but i think the gameplay makes up for it. The gameplay was so fun that i entirely forgot about the story, i didnt care about what the characters had to say or what happened to them, all that mattered was that the gameplay remained fun until the end of the game. In conclusion, although this game has a really bad story, the gameplay, mechanics and everything else you can do it the game make up for it so i think its worth buying the game

When I noticed this game had gone on sale I debated purchasing it and I have to say, it was probably the best decision I've made. Some things aren't perfect, but I've yet to have the game break on me. The open world feels much like Farcry2 in the aspect of you literally get to do whatever you want. The world is also super interactive; companions converse with each-other and other npc's, there's a couple puzzles, and action is never too far away. I think what has grown on me the most though, is the sound track and the loading screens. I don't think this game gets enough credit for the amount of work that was put into it.

Positives:
Great game play and mechanics.
Great map and characters. 
Nice weapons and features although you will end up finding a default that works too soon.
Great vehicle options that have good drive features. 

Negatives:
CUT SCENE HELL. The cuts have broken 2 rules for me and they don't do it well. They lock you into a linear story that you can't escape and always has a negative result. In the majority of them you have to traverse a linear space but are forced to do so as though you were frozen and then dipped in tar.

I ended up buying this game and Far Cry 5: New Dawn at a huge discount, and I really think it was worth it. I gave it a try and I don't regret playing it at all.

The story or stories are really good. I really liked Joseph Seed as the antagonist. The best part of the whole story, in my opinion, was Faith. I understood her character very well and I really liked what role she played in the story. Her story is sad, and I could somehow relate to her. In the end, I ended up feeling sorry for her, which I liked, because I don't really feel that sorry for some of characters in games as much as I was for her.

The side missions were quite good, at least some of them, some are very irritating, but others quite enjoyable.

The gameplay is different, very good for the most part. The only things that didn't really satisfy me were the takedowns. They were ok, but it would've been better if they didn't change them. The flying system/gameplay is very good, I really I enjoyed it.

One of the best things about this game is the map. I love it, the atmosphere is great, the animals add a lot to the map, a wild vibe, I really liked it.

The graphics are beautiful, the game looks better than the previous one, so that's good.

There are some minor bugs here and there, some of them quite annoying, but nothing to really complain about.

In conclusion, I recommend buying this game only at a discount, I don't think it's worth the full price. It's a good game, not excellent, but a really good one, and i enjoyed it.   8.5/10",1688927994,1688927994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 and was hoping Far Cry 5 would offer more of the same, but unfortunately for all the objective improvements it just feels...soulless. Normally I make a long bulleted list of all the positives and negatives, but since I won't be finishing the game I won't do that here.

I do have the admit that the graphics are excellent and the environment design is pretty amazing: the forests are surprisingly realistic. Unfortunately, beyond this pretty facade lies...more of that, more facade. The game's story tries way too hard to be cinematic. Sure, the prequels were to a degree, but they still had some willingness to be excessive and borderline silly. They still felt *game-y*. Far Cry 5 takes itself way too seriously, and presents itself as this epic dramatic film-game. In fact, this is fueled by the ""improvements"" made that ostensibly removed the repetitiveness, but actually just hid it behind the guise of more storytelling and writing. Instead of racing missions you have sidequests that [i]just so happen[/i] to be races; instead of hunting missions you have sidequests that [i]just so happen[/i] to require hunting. Every aspect of the game is about you being the local hero, but I really appreciated how, for example, Far Cry 4's hunting missions were just you slaughtering rare animals on the whims of some deranged fashion designer. That was funny! Hunting bears to ""save the ranch""? I don't really care.

I see so much promise, too -- I think the religious elements and the character development of the villains goes in a very interesting direction, but falls short of actually being compelling. I could go on, but it just doesn't feel worth my time.

Go play FC3 or FC4.",1688797183,1688801728,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

First off if using a gamepad, reverse controls dont work or descending in aerial vehicles. There are multiple claimed fixes posted but I couldn't get one to work. As someone who has applied their own control to a gamepad for even games such as Tarkov or Ground Branch and had more success setting those up, reverse still doesnt seem to work unless using keyboard. The most recommended fix at the least requires you have to reset or disable certain controls (either in game or steam, not sure as i tried all methods to no avail) and you have to do this every time you start the game. Sorry i really dont want to do that.
Gameplay wise the story sounds great and pulled me in to buy it. However, gameplay gets very repetitive fast. Even if you unlock a third weapon slot it seems pointless to use any other gun aside from the enemy rifles etc. as even trying to sneak or play stealthy getting detected can just lead to a constant firefight of enemies showing up. Traveling on the roads is almost impossible to not get detected, however traveling off path you can still get detected and have a truck follow shooting you, which forces you to stop or have to attack from vehicle which draws more enemies to your position and leads to another tedious time consuming firefight with not enough ammo so you have to pick up enemy weapons or take their ammo. After enough times dying and spending either too much time trying to avoid enemies to reach a destination or obj, or getting caught and starting another firefight which even potentially lead to you winning and then all of a sudden you get killed by a bear, wolf or an eagle that you will often see attacking people near roads or off path. 
Overall, its a great looking game, but i just feel like i'm playing a better looking Ghost Recon Breakpoint.
Now it doesn't mean alot of people wouldn't enjoy this game, but its just constantly, CONSTANTLY being surrounded by enemies of all types, nothing too dynamic with shooting options as select fire would be nice. The ability to go prone would be nice as well, and AI detection is a little weird but manageable and various types of playstyles don't seem to be encouraged or easily done compared a more meta option.",1688800910,1688800910,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
