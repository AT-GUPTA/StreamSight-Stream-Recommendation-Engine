It has a capital city but you explore it in 30 seconds.
It was a nice story but you cant really affect major things until the game forces you to.
It has DLC's but I didnt even realised it as I overlevelled trying to enjoy the game and it felt like a starter region I forgot.
It has a crafting system but endgame armor/weapons dont have the 2 extra attachments and sometimes none can be add forcing you to search other type of stuff to fully utilize your crafting material grind.
All fights are the same, tanky or hard opponents just die slower and if you cant fight them grinding some levels turns the fight to their slow death.
Combat system is bulky the melee fight is weird nothing like the 2nd game which is loveable fast paced, ranged combat is watching a mage poledance or a nerve cracking bow sound.

Besides being a beautiful aesthetic game it offers nothing else compared to previous titles, even the having your own castle thing is an illusion as decorating it as you have to overgrind the decorations which leads to [read above] making the game way too easy.

As a game it's mostly fun overall, kind of scratches that Skyrim itch, but it's a mixed bag.

My dialogue choice: ""Religious fanatics caused this, it's time we start believing in this world""
- everyone spontaneously erupt into religious song... Ok, what the fuck?
I always choose ""I'm just here to do a job because someone needs to do it"" options, but this game always wants to force you down a certain path.

It looks great in surround, and I appreciate when games have it at all, but on my 3-monitor setup there were several locations where it would instantly crash to desktop. 
Wake up in Haven, crash. Entering Crossroads, crash. Redcliffe, crash. 
The only way to progress past these points was by switching to a single-monitor resolution until I got out of the area.

In classic EA style, these are known bugs since release, and will never be fixed. They never fix their shit, unless it's because they are hoping to sell it to you again.

Also - Fuck Origin, and double fuck their always-online DRM. It sucks not being able to play because their services are down, or because you're offline.
They've shut down game servers with active player base before, and they probably will again.

Dragon Age: Inquisition was Bioware's last positievely reviewed game, recieving GOTY award in 2014. However, I do think that this game does have it's flaws and it is all but perfect.
[h2] Combat [/h2]
Inquisition's combat was sort of a return to the old Dragon Age: Origins style of combat, removing most of the fast moves that charaterised Dragon Age II's combat but maintaining some hack and slashy elements here and there. As someone who prefered Dragon Age II's more accessible style of combat, I see this as a step in the [b]wrong direction[/b]. For me, it seems as if Bioware tried to please both fans of Dragon Age II combat and fans of DA:Origins combat, pleasing no one in the process. 
This is also not helped by the massive amount of hit-sponges in the game. Specially in bosses. 
But then again, the combat is decent, but I would rather have Bioware focus on one single style of combat instead of changing it in every single game.
[h2] Story and Decisions [/h2]
Without getting into spoilers, Inquisition's story is simplistic, yet functional. It's a good story that serves it's purpose and fits the theme of the game. Decisions are well thought and act like in every single Bioware game, the change some stuff in side plots and parts of the main plot (who dies, whose your ally and who's not, the status of some characters, some speciffic missions, etc.), but not the main plot thread of the game, which stays relatively similar regardless of your decisions. 
This story is also affected by decisions made in Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Origins in a similar way.
[h2] Characters [/h2]
As with every single Bioware game out there, characters are the strongest point of Inquisition. Inquisition features the retun of some characters that appeared in previous game's of the franchise as important characters(without getting into spoilers: Varric, Cassandra, Cullen, Leliana, etc.) and some cameos of some others. The new characters are mostly well written, and have different outcomes depending on your relationships with them, and their personal quests. There's also a fair amount of romances that you can have with some companions. 
[h2] Protagonist [/h2]
As with every Dragon Age game to date, this game features a new protagonist: the Inquistor. The Inquisitor is sort of a mixture of the Hero of Ferelden (DA:Origins) and Hawke (Dragon Age II). Featuring a more customizable character than Hawke (with a total of four races to choose: Dwarf, Human, Elf and Qunari), but featuring less freedom and background than the Hero of Ferelden (no class origins unfortunately :/) The Inquistor's personality mostly depends on your decision.
[h2] Side Content [/h2]
Definetely the worst part of Dragon Age: Inquisition. Most of Inquisition's side quests are a huge step down from Dragon Age II's and Dragon Age Origins' fully fledged, fun to play sidequests. Most sidequests feel like boring MMOesque side content. 
There's also a decent amount of fetch quests. Personally, I would suggest skipping most sidequests and focusing on the main story, since that is what I mostly did (Only taking fortresses and closing rifts and a couple of other sidequests).
A big exception however, are companion quests, this are really fun to do, and I recommend doing them. 
[h2] Open Worlds [/h2]
The open worlds are alright I guess. They look good, and have some stuff to do and don't usually feel like a burden. However, I think that the Dragon Age Franchise worked better in a non-open world setting. 
[h2] DLCs [/h2]
- [b]Jaws of Hakkon[/b]: Worst DLC by far. Difficulty was bumped up to 11, making most enemies unsufferable to kill. If you omit the difficulty problems, Jaws of Hakkon features a brand new open-world with a good background story to discover. Play it if you wish, skip it if you wish. 
- [b]The Descent[/b]: Very good DLC. This DLC features a throwback to a more linear style of gameplay, something from which it really benefits imo. This DLC features a good story, with good side characters and lore. Definetely recommend playing it. 
- [b]Trespasser[/b]: Very good DLC. This DLC is a direct sequel to Inquisition's main story, taking place 2 years later than the original events. This DLC is a must-play if you plan to play Dragon Age: Dreadwolf whenever it comes out, since it sets up the main plot of that game. This DLC is also features a linear style of gameplay, and a cool story and characters. I definetely think that anyone who plays Inquisition should also play Trespasser. 
[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
If you like RPG's, you'll most likely enjoy Inquisiton. It is overall a good game, but not a perfect one. 
[b] Btw the EA app is trash (worse than Origin) and only lets you play online, even if you want to play singleplayer [/b]",1708555718,1708555718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age: Inquisition had been my first full foray into the series simply by chance. Definitely not the way to go about playing it, but I didn't have a console growing up. And despite that, I fell in love with the world and characters. Even though I only knew the vague stories from games past, Thedas felt alive and full. I played hundreds of hours and went through multiple playthroughs the first couple of years. 

Coming back to DA:I in 2024 after having played both DA:O and DA2, I can say with conviction that it's even better than I had remembered it. 

Truthfully, the only issues I had while playing was the pacing after Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts. The end of the game comes at you fast, but there's still a load of other places to explore. Since I have a lot time under my belt, I knew the path that would make it feel less awkward, but even so I still felt the strain of something that felt like a missing story mission between the events at Halamshiral and the final fight. 

The story is incredible. Everything feels like it has weight, your choices, your companions, the huge plot that lies in wait behind Corypheus. It's smart storytelling at its finest. The writers did an incredible job with every aspect in DA:I, from the Codex entries to the foreshadowing that comes to a climax in Trespasser. 

The combat in DA:I feels the best out of all three games. The skillsets are interesting and fresh. Though I've mostly played mage Inquisitors, it's easy to hop on a warrior or rogue companion and fight battles from there if you want a change of pace. 

As a completionist, the open maps didn't feel overly difficult to find all the hidden bits of information, chests, quests, etc. The level design flowed beautifully in most maps. And even on the more challenging ones (The Frostback Basin and Forbidden Oasis), the environment was engaging and it was a joy to explore. 

All in all, Dragon Age: Inquisition stands the test of time. It is a beloved game for me, and even after all these years it felt like coming home. The characters feel real, the story hits home, and every time I come back to it, it evokes the desire to create and tell my own stories. I'm deeply grateful that this game exists.

It is STILL my favorite game basically ever, with the mechanics tied to building out the inquisition a great incentive to explore and do everything you can find along with keeping the story pace going along well. You may not be constantly in the main story, but the side quests make it feel like you really are building up your own faction and gaining allies and favor of the people, plus the added benefits of points to spend on perks and unlocking new areas is always a treat.  Add in how each race-class-gender combo for the inquisitor (the player character) comes with semi-unique dialogue and can unlock unique scenes and conversations, and you can replay this game several times over and still find new things.

Also the romance options are fun. Iron Bull is and always will be my favorite video game character, he seems like a goofy combat nut at a glance from trailers and the like, but in reality he's pretty complicated.

Also, a quick warning: [spoiler] your actions in the main game WILL effect the DLC, and if you aren't careful certain companions will turn on you and become enemies and even KILL most of the cast during it.

Skipped Dragon Age 2 because they fudged that one IMO, so for years i skipped over Dragon Age Inquisition because I thought it would be like 2, and all the reviewers i watched made the game look bland. Those reviewers were trash. Play the game yourself. I'm  happy to say the reviewers made bad videos and because dragon age 2 was bad does not make Inquisition bad. The combat/exploration and environments/weapons armor are tight. Although the voice acting and story is a little stale, but hey what can you do. Most games post 2010 have meh stories and actors who don't care. Edit in 2024: so i tried to finally beat it, this time i went on hard as a lightning mage. It was alot of fun at first but gets very repetitive. The story also gets very stale after awhile. Most of the characters are bland and boring. I was close to the end but I just couldn't get myself to finish it. It really just makes me want to go play Origins again. It may be my nostalgia goggles but Origins seems to have the best story, world and characters. So I think now I will just mod Origins to my liking and just forget about 2 and 3.

It was WAY longer than the other reviews said - took me 159 hours to complete it with the three DLCs (and I did not complete everything). Worst thing I'd say about it is that it's very brutal when it comes to making a single mistake or missing a moment of dialogue early on, and you can get locked out of romances before you even decide who to pick, and so...this is the game that taught me how to do real hex editing on a save file so I could fix something :P  I played an elf and am glad I did for how it related to the plot. The companions are great, though unfortunately there's less conversation between your party members than there was in previous games, but it's still there and it's still great. (And you still can't romance Varric :( ) The beginning of the game (first ~10hrs) is also slow.

Logistical EA stuff -- Since this game uses the EA ap, you need to have that installed and synced to your Steam account, and launch the ap before you press play in Steam. Also, you will need to manually spend a few hours before playing to fill out your Dragon Age Keep on their website first, unfortunately -- while you can load your DA1/2 saves for your past main characters' names and races and disposition (diplomatic, humorous, etc), your decisions can't be automatically transferred, so you do need to go through and manually plug in all of your decisions from those games, then hit Export, and then import your Dragon Age Keep world state from the website. This is a crappy way to begin this game, but overall it was a great experience.

It took me a good few hours to get used to all the changes, but I eventually even started appreciating some of them. Even though certain systems and mechanics are a downgrade, Inquisition is clearly a much more ambitious and polished game, resulting in a more enjoyable experience nowadays, imho.
Most of DAI's problems stem from MMO-style design decisions, such as power and time gating, tons of collectibles, uninspired side quests and open-world zones... However, a lot of that can be ignored and is not done to an extent that makes it too oppressive or aggravating.
It takes its time to truly open up and get going. Companions are not as attractive or fun to have around right off the bat as Alistair, Morrigan and Leliana for example, but they develop and become much more interesting as the game goes on. No stand outs in either end of the spectrum, but overall I consider this to be the best cast in the series. Similarly, the options for singular character builds and party compositions improve only after you've been playing for quite a bit.
The main plot is still on point with decent and more varied accompanying quests, although with a significantly different premise, setup and denouement compared to its predecessor. There are many more or less impactful choices to be made, they are just not as prevalent due to the sheer size of the game. It's definitely more engaging if you played the first 2 games, but Inquisition puts you up to speed with most important events so it's not a must.
Not all optional content is downright bad either. I would definitely recommend doing the companion and advisor quests, a couple of dragon encounters and dungeons. The zones and their tied story lines as well as area design and collectible hunts do vary in quality and reward however.
I liked the whole Inquisition part too, even though it had apparent flaws. Managing your own organisation, spreading its influence, building up the headquarters and forces made for an interesting change of pace and provided more insight into ongoing world events in a way that is not commonly seen in the genre. That, along with the amount of places you can visit and various bits of lore you come across makes the whole experience much more immersive.
Character building and combat are simplified, but it's smoother and the amount of different items and ways to acquire them make up for it to an extent. I consider mages to still be the most fun to play as, both combat-wise and from the main character role-playing perspective.
Graphics are more stylized, but the game can look very pretty and has a lot of elaborate cutscenes. The dark fantasy undertone is still present despite the brighter and cleaner visuals.
The 3 DLCs are great and show how different kinds of maps and quests could have been done to make the main game better - more focused on quality over quantity, as well as fantastical over mundane.
I did not have much trouble with the game itself or the EA app surprisingly, aside from a few minor glitches which may have been caused by mods.
To summarize, Dragon Age: Inquisition is likely the most accessible party-based RPG, but with some variation in quality of content. It combines classic, real time with pause and modern, more action and cinematic oriented designs in a unique way. So, if you are looking for a relaxing, high production value RPG set in a rich, original high fantasy universe - Inquisition is worth giving a try.",1706752666,1707063897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, if you don't like the idea of an open world-style action game set in the Dragon Age world, then just watch a story recap instead.

I got this game years ago, and along with DA2 I put off playing it for a long time because I'd heard they were so different from Dragon Age: Origins. The problem is that I absolutely loved Origins, and I was pre-salty about changes I hadn't even experienced yet. I recently got around to playing DA2, then moved directly into this game. While it's true that they are all very different games, I found a lot to like about both of these entries.

In a nutshell, this game is much more action-y than either of the previous titles. Whereas in Origins and 2 I tended to micromanage my team's strategies, Inquisition makes that much more of a chore to do, and for the most part I tended to just control my Inquisitor and let my party members follow their AI. In the previous games you could script what they'd be doing to a pretty fine degree, but Inquisition doesn't allow for nearly as much preset behavior. In the end it works OK, but I found I couldn't really count on my partners to do more that the basics of their role. That meant I tended to do the heavy-hitting in combat, which was simultaneously a little annoying and made me feel like a boss.

I didn't love Inquisition's rework to the magic system, which has completely removed healing in favor of magical barrier generation. It theoretically gives more weight to your choices about which perks you take and which kinds of elixirs you give each character, but the game is easy enough that most of these options don't end up making much of a difference. I personally still found myself always rolling with a tank, 2 DPS characters, and a hybrid-support mage. While my overview of the combat has a lot of critiques, I would like to say that I played a decent amount of three fundamentally different builds, and I did find the combat fun; it's just not the same as in the previous games, and expecting it to be will leave you disappointed.

Another huge change in Inquisition (esp. when compared to DA2) is how vast, varied, and absolutely gorgeous the environments are. I feel like Bioware took to heart the criticisms of DA2's cramped cityscape and really let loose here. You'll be traipsing across Ferelden and Orlais and visiting deserts, palaces, forests, cities, ancient ruins, and more. The settings all look absolutely marvelous, and I had a tremendous time exploring every nook and cranny. Does the open world collect-a-thon gameplay get a little repetitive? Absolutely; there's nothing genre-redefining here on that front, and while I was wrapped up in the fun of exploring Thedas and empowering the Inquisition, your mileage may very. Luckily, if you do tire of the side objectives you don't need to do anywhere near 100% exploration to move the story along. There's even a vendor that you can use to build your power at the expense of gold, rather than your time.

Personally, I loved the story of Inquisition, and I feel like there is a lot of room for different experiences based on your character's background and decisions (not to mention all the decisions that carry over from DAO and DA2). I won't spoil anything, but it follows your character as they rise to lead a newly-founded, quasi-religious military organization. You start small, and find yourself struggling to recruit factions to your side, but eventually become a juggernaut of political influence, leaving your mark upon Thedas as you struggle against an apocalyptic threat. Is it novel? No, but they did a great job of putting you there, in the midst of this growing power base that you get to direct.

Finally, I'd like to address the DLCs. I had a blast playing all three of the major releases, but only Trespasser is an absolute MUST, from a story perspective. Jaws of Hakkon essentially just adds another area to the map, complete with all the side quests and collection that main areas have. If you want more of the base game, this is it. I was still having fun, and deeply enjoyed the peek into some of the Chantry's dark secrets that the story revealed. The Descent is a much more linear experience that finds you exploring a new section of the Deep Roads. If you like the dwarves, and want to learn some cool new lore about them and lyrium, this is your chance. If not, you can safely skip it without missing too much, but I recommend experiencing it once. The last DLC is Trespasser, and as I said above, it is something you will absolutely need to play after the major bombshell revealed during the ending of the base game. Similar to DA2's Legacy DLC, this one ushers in the threat that will be at the center of Dreadwolf (the 4th mainline game in this series), as well as tying up a few loose ends. Trespasser was a real roller coaster for me on my first playthrough, and I was quite impressed with the quality of the writing.

Overall, I absolutely loved this game. Is it perfect? No, far from it. Combat can get a little boring and is far less strategic than in other Dragon Age games. The companions, while largely excellent, aren't all as interesting as they could be. The open world mechanics get a bit tired eventually. But despite all that there is a LOT they're doing right here, and if you enjoy the world-building of the Dragon Age universe, and don't mind a different kind of experience, this could be a deeply comfy game you come back to from time to time. I know I probably will.",1707025013,1707025013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

     This is for people who're on the fence about this game. The best way I can summarize it is that it's a triple-A story trapped in a double-A game. Regardless, it's still very much worth playing. (Also--the voice acting is top-notch. Despite the game's limited budget, its voice acting puts most other fantasy games to shame.) If you love a good story with choice and consequence--and you can overlook some mid-tier graphics and combat--then get this game. If you like games like The Witcher, God of War, Mass Effect, or Cyberpunk, then this game's story will scratch a similar itch. (On sale, it's an absolute steal.) 
     One last proviso: Inquisition does assume you're familiar with the stories of Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2. If you haven't played those, I'd recommend watching story summaries before playing Inquisition.

Long Review: 
     Some of the criticisms you've heard about it are indeed valid. It has too many open-world filler quests (e.g., find 18 shards; find 7 lost letters; find 10 boxes off cargo). However, IMO, you can skip those things and just stick to the main quest. (Or the many companion quests--which are quite good, too). There's more than enough content in the game to get you adequately geared and leveled for the main quest.
     I suspect that this game was filled with open-world tropes because it came out 3 years after Skyrim. I have no doubt that some executive (who was clueless about gaming) told the devs to ""make it more like Skyrim."" If true, then I could forgive the devs a little.
     As far as the graphics go, they're OK for a 2014 game. The terrain looks a little worse than Skyrim, but the character models are MUCH better. The graphical demands are minimal, by today's standards. On ultra settings, the game only consumed about 2.5 GBs of VRAM. The only technical issue I found was that, when closing the game, I often had to resort to the Task Manager to force it to quit. That, however, is the fault of the EA Launcher.
     Anyway--despite all of that. The story is very much worth it. Dragon Age: Inquisition is the kind of game that absolutely warrants multiple playthroughs. I recommend that you do one playthrough as a non-elf, and another as an elf.
     As far as the combat goes, I actually found it quite enjoyable. It's not revolutionary, but it's a much more streamlined version of party-based combat that I found refreshing. If you played Dragon Age Origins, you might recall that it's combat system required a lot of micromanagement--due in no small part to how many abilities each of your companions had. Inquisition scales that back by limiting each companion to just 8 abilities. (This also means that Inquisition is much more controller friendly.) I don't think the game's combat system is cheapened by this. In fact, it makes it more fun to try out different play styles because you can learn them all in a reasonable amount of time. I think Inquisition's combat system strikes a good balance between depth and learning curve. Also--the 8 ability cap means you can largely leave your companions on auto-pilot. (Unless you play on nightmare difficulty. Then you'll have go through the tedious process of selecting each companion's ability on a play-by-play basis.) I personally hated that about Origins. The streamlined system of Inquisition makes combat more fluid.
     Anyway--in sum, if you like ""gritty"" fantasy games, but you're on the fence about this one, go ahead and get it.  It may not be the greatest fantasy game--especially by today's standards--but it'll definitely be a story you'll fall in love with.",1706217614,1706217614,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]In Comparison[/h1]

With the recent release of Baldur's Gate 3, the world got a taste of what is perhaps one of the best RPGs in at least the last decade. Compared to BG3, Dragon Age: Inquisition seems to fall flat. The game has very few meaningful side quests within its open world, and it lacks depth to these open world locations. That being said, I find myself enjoying DA:I more than BG3.

The reason for this is its comfort factor.

DA:I boasts a very well-written story in a world with an extremely interesting take on the fantasy genre, leading to a very immersive experience despite the open world's lack of depth.


[h1]The Good[/h1]

[h2]Characters & Writing[/h2]

It has a roster of characters that are each and every one interesting and well-written, to the point where you'll catch yourself wanting to do multiple playthroughs just to see what other characters would say in certain story moments. Each character has their own approval of your actions and words throughout the game, and a high enough approval will lead to the companion's personal quest. Quite a few of the characters offer captivating romances, some of the best I've seen in any game so far - including BG3. With multiple options for an interesting party, intense and captivating romances and meaningful friendships, the characters in this game are by far the best part of it. Not the only good part, however.


[h2]Combat Is Finally Fun[/h2]

The combat in this game is the best the Dragon Age series has seen. A far cry from the slow, clunky fighting in Origins, and a more fleshed out version of Dragon Age 2's action-packed, over-the-top combat, Inquisition offers a wide variety of playstyles that would see the player and their party take on specific roles necessary for efficient and fun combat. Every playstyle is fun, and each class boasts three subclasses, from which the player can choose one to specialise in. This, again, offers fun replay-ability for multiple playthroughs.


[h2]Your Choices Matter[/h2]

The world changes based on your decisions. And not just in this game. Via the Dragon Age Keep, a website where you can fill in choices the player could make in the previous two instalments of the series, Inquisition's world state changes, updating to entire different stories and lore of the world, depending on the previous games' outcomes.


[h2]In Conclusion[/h2]

If you want an RPG that focuses on every aspect of its existence, and leaves you feeling as if every action and choice matters, go buy Baldur's Gate 3.

However, if you want an interesting RPG, set in a truly unique world, with phenomenal writing in regards to both story and characters, where you can sit back, relax and explore beautiful open worlds to progress your characters and the Inquisition itself, with intense story missions mixed in, then Dragon Age: Inquisition is the game for you.

i first played  DAI when I bought a PS3 during covid lock downs in the UK (in 2020) - I bought it on a whim with a bunch of other games - not thinking I would like it- but BOY HOWDY I WAS WRONG - I fell in love with the games storytelling in an instant (albeit I was playing the game on a ps3 that would freeze every...20 mins or so) - I would spent hours looking up the lore and world building - the game truly became a special interest .  I finished the game on ps3 - and then realised I could not play the DLC - trespasser (at the time I did not have my pc)

I've even read some books and comics.

And as much as I hate to say this, with each passing year, it seems harder to go back to these games. 

They have aged very poorly and became outdated practically at the moment of their release.

Inquisition is not worth it for almost anyone. It would only have something to offer to someone from a very specific niche who can savor the best that Dragon Age has to offer and at the same time not feel constrained by the increasing weight of its design shortcomings.

Like those weirdos who play Skyrim and their favorite part is reading the books.

Keep that in mind. If you don't know the universe beforehand, play DA Origins. If you really like that game, and I mean REALLY like it, then maybe take a chance on Inquisition after a good discount.

After several attempts (since the PS3 era) to start the game and play it to the end, and probably putting in over 120 hours of scattered gameplay, I was finally able to perform the ultimate test on a platform with hardware capable of running the game at its best visual capacity and gameplay fluidity.

And it wasn't enough. 

Again, i find myself compelled to abandon another playthrough, this time, hopefully, definitively.

Inquisition may have had its time, but certainly, that time is not now.

The writing of this game is doing an Olympic-level heavy lifting to support the weight of mediocrity spread throughout.

This is a game where you can have long and deep conversations with your allies, expressing nuances like a sense of humor and original and complex perspectives on the world and the reality they live in, while expanding the boundaries of the mythology in an organic and fun way.

It's a game where you can talk to legendary figures and ask what the threads of truth are that underpin the legend.

It's a game with locations that have historical grounding, with sediments of ancient civilizations and past cultures, lending some of their traits to the current beliefs.

It's a game that gives you the feeling of being part of a resistance movement in a credible way, as a small political, military, and economic power and not just through the ""power of friendship,"" as worse stories might do.

And it's also a game where you play in a handful of poorly designed, uninteresting open maps, infested with an exhausting sea of generic and redundant content that can easily TRIPLE the total game duration.

On top of that, the combat seems to have become even simpler and more automated. Requiring minimal inputs from your part, stealing any illusion of tactical depth, even on higher difficulties (which are also ridiculously unbalanced).

The ""functional simplicity"" of Origins cannot be achieved in Inquisition simply because it's a much larger game with much more involved in its structure. The bigger issue here is that these things, this extra baggage, this supposed ""new complexity"" is pure fat. It only anchor the game in mediocrity.

To enjoy the game at its best, you need to ignore more than half of it. For every good hour, you have countless hours of disposable content. Countless hours of a flabby and uninteresting combat grind that gets old before you leave the first area.

Despite being perhaps the best and richest original fictional universe created for video games, the games that come with it suffer from major and minor problems from top to bottom. And I believe that DAI, being gigantic, having this derivative poorly executed open-world design, and often being even more simplified and less polished than DA2, is the worst of them.

Inquisition is the game with the sharpest edges of the three and with more room to fail. And it fails, breaks, and falls short at every moment.

As bad as DA2 might have been, at least it ended quickly.

The secondary narratives can, being very generous, subliminally implant some kind of sense of fictional texture in your brain and make the problems faced by those people under terrible conditions not seem simply superficial and invisible. In a strange way, just like the side quests of the previous games, you get (sometimes) some fragmented perspective, some shallow commentary that explores the social gears that are part of the Dragon Age universe and make the world seem more believable.

At least in theory.

This game was released before The Witcher 3 redefined the genre formula and explored this ""revolutionary"" idea of scaling the quality along with the quantity of available content. In The Witcher 3, you have various small stories, often brimming with humanity and interesting conflicts, that offer some reward as usual. The story is the anchor that guides quests in that game. In Dragon Age (And in the overwhelming majority of games of that time), side quests were just generic excuses to receive small increments to the game's progression system. You did them for the reward, not for the story. If the story was good, which usually wasn't, it was a plus. 

And frankly, for most people, i believe the most of the game's content will feel like these barely justified excuses.

The juicy content is in the main quests, in the conversations with your allies and in the codex pages, as always. The rest is just checklist grinds and a deep sense of banality that has always prevented me from getting into a groove that lasted the entire journey.

There's a lot of lazy crap in the way, hindering you from getting in tune with the narrative and the universe. You get exhausted very quickly. And when a letter found on the ground gives you more context and incentive to explore the world than the people and the visual narrative of the map you're exploring, you know something is very wrong.

No immersive qualities. No sense of adventure outside the text. No allure.

It's just disappointing. I can see the small pearls of brilliance in the game, but they were never enough to make me go all the way. And I don't think they'll be enough for most people.

DAI is a good story, buried under a very average game.

Overall a great adult fantasy RPG that I really enjoyed.

DA: Inquisition isn't as good a CRPG as DA: Origins, but doesn't mean you shouldn't play Inquisition. This is a favorite of mine, so bear with the bias train:

Pros:
1. LOOOOOORE - not only that, lore in the form of endless opinions. Conflicting histories written by different bards/historical figures (all just writer pen names for their in-character lore dumps.)

2. Characters - while the dialogue isn't as natural as in Mass Effect, each character has bias, opinions, and growth. BioWare really nailed the background party banter, and Inquisition has fun little arcs for each possible pair of team mates. I recommend not sticking with one party. Instead, I recommend rotating different people in different maps for most interesting results.

3. Emotionally-charged scenes that are far more nuanced and less histrionic than many social/time pressure choice games. These scenes are even better if you've played prior games (see Trespasser.)

5. Trespasser DLC's story is 10/10

6. Exploration is generally worth it. You will find beautiful scenery, story crumbs, and lots of crafting materials on your way. There aren't many secrets, but there is more than enough stuff to find.

Possible cons:

1. Game-play is more like an MMO than a CRPG, with some cons that made it truly neither. The best part of CRPG play is tactical freedom. The best part of MMOs is a good pull and nuke. Sadly, Inquisition really has neither.

2. Conversation is a bit more like an interrogation than a dialogue. There were some dubious design decisions there, but they invented the dialogue wheel. How could they NOT use it, now?

3. You better like reading.

4. Game could've used more time ""in the oven."" There are several basic usability functions that are likely either known, or would've been spotted with some more play testing. Things such as the map being too vague when there's only one way up a hill. Issues like the tactical camera not panning far nor fast enough to match the open maps. If mechanics or stats are more your jam, this game obfuscates both in an effort to be more player-friendly.

Those being said, any game given more time and money could be improved. The game is playable, has no ""delete your save"" or ""not load in faces"" bugs, and generally gives you what you need. Just because my review of the mechanics and usability aren't glowing doesn't mean they're awful, either.

Conclusion:
DA Origins > DA Inquisition > DA 2

You should play this game if you like plot and world building. The best of the game does have inorganic delivery, but the core of this game is is still better than average. Inquisition is worth playing--even if if it does not live up to the franchise's prior peak.

1. The AI is really bad. They should have ported in the ability to customise the AI just like how it was in DAO.
2. They made it harder to increase approval rating with companions as they removed the gift option. I guess this made every decision you make all the more tailored, but sometimes you just want to make the genuine choice you would make. The availability of gift option was better.
3. This game mainly has a male audience, but there is no typical attractive female protagonist for you to pursue. Feels a bit woke in their choice in that aspect. Sera is kinda nuts, Vivienne is bald. and then there's Cassandra. Where is Morrigan's replacement? It's a shame we couldn't court Leliana.
4. There is a lack of connection with your comrades. In DAO, your story is closely tied with Alistair and Morrigan's. Alistair is pretty much your best friend if you are friendly with him. And you have a nice long relevant story chain to obtain Oghren. Zevran and Wynne has a decent story chain as well. You pretty much decides Sten's life. And of course there is Loghain who is one the main antagonist of the game. DAI has sorely failed in this story writing aspect to craft a gaming experience that makes you feel like you are traveling with 3 other friends. Instead, I feel like I am travelling with 3 mercenaries, with the only exception of Dorian. He is great.

The graphic upgrade is great, but I feel like this came at the expense of gameplay. DAO is definitely a better game imo, although DAI is still enjoyable, and well worth the money on discount. If you like DAI, DAO would be gold for you.",1704625333,1704626159,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

The fighting system got considerebly worse, skills alot of the time won't connect because the game says so, some moves like Pommel Strike will sometimes lunch you into the stratosphere. The ai is even worse then before mostly because they removed the old more complexed tactics menu and put a new menu where you can't set up shit for the ai and it shows in game. Together with the dumbed down leveling up where instead of adding points to attributes and then skills, you just have skills and passive skills which add attributes, they also removed sustained abilities which is baffling to me.

The world is empty mess filled with mmo gameplay and worthless side-quests that actually add nothing to the story, also most of the time it will be a note or something similar which makes it even worse. The only worthwhile side-quests are those of the companions and not many of them, because alot of them is just: go there destroy/kill/take something for me x10.

The Companions are pretty well done imo, with many different personalities and looks, unforunetly for some reason they wanted to make the women of the inquistion somewhat unattractive for some reason, a shame really considering the men look really good compared to them. Most romances are pretty good with my personal favorites being Cassandra, Dorian and Blackwall, other than them probably Cullen is the only one worth mentioning, since the rest isn't really that exciting or intresting imo.

Story is as always great like in all BioWare games that I played, going from prisoner the the most powerful man in Thedas is amazing and fun to experiance, story keeps you hooked up until the very end and is probably one of my favorites. Unfortunetly the main story is quite short and most of the time you'll be collecting power to get to those mission, which is probably one of the worst things that the game does to artificially extend itself.

The last thing I'm gonna talk about are DLCs which are mediocre at best, Jaws of Hakon is quite boring up until you attack the fortress and meet the first inquisitor and then later battle Hakon in dragon form, I can't really recommend this DLC. 
The Descent is a bit better since it gets rid of the huge empty maps and instead puts you in the enclosed spaces of The Deep Roads, the story of the DLC is fairly intresting and the addition of Expedition Table is a fun little thing. 
The last DLC is Tresspasser, which is essential to fully understanding the enemy of Dragon Age Dreadwolf, it ties up the companions stories, the story of the Inquisition and its future, the best DLC of them all.

To close out this review I want to say that I love the story, but the gameplay kills everything and makes the game a chore and I know that BioWare games never had THAT exciting gameplay but it was at the least much better than this. Another point that I realized in the meantime is that I honestly hate how the big thing about BioWare games is making decisions, mostly because your decision never really matter (one example being saving or killing the council in the first ME game among many). BioWare was never that great at making games if I'm going to be honest for a moment, but DA:I and MEA is just sad, I'd go as far as beyond sad, maybe even disgusting how far the mighty has fallen.",1669204269,1704610138,False,6,0,0.47325599193572998,0,True,False,False

This epic tale set in the fantastical world of Thedas not only impresses with its rich narrative and expansive world but also with its innovative blend of real-time and strategic combat, all presented through graphics that remain remarkable to this day.

For a game approaching its ten-year anniversary, ""Dragon Age: Inquisition"" boasts graphics that have aged like fine wine. The detailed environments, from the lush fields of the Hinterlands to the eerie, desolate landscapes of the Western Approach, are a visual treat. Character animations and the dynamic weather system add a layer of realism that immerses players into its world. The art style strikes a balance between fantasy and realism, making every exploration a spectacle.

One of the game's standout features is its combat system, which ingeniously combines real-time action with strategic elements. Players can actively engage in battles with real-time controls or use the tactical camera to pause the game and plan moves, giving a chess-like feel to confrontations. This system caters to both players who enjoy the thrill of on-the-spot decisions and those who prefer methodical, strategic planning.

Thedas is a world brimming with content. Every corner of the map is laden with quests, lore, and secrets waiting to be discovered. The game offers a variety of missions, from main story quests to side missions and minor tasks, each contributing to the game's rich narrative tapestry. The diverse regions are not just vast in size but are also culturally and environmentally distinct, making exploration an endlessly rewarding experience.

As a fan eagerly awaiting the next installment, ""Dragon Age: Dreadwolf,"" the legacy of ""Inquisition"" sets a high bar. The anticipation for another adventure in Thedas is palpable, and if ""Inquisition"" is anything to go by, ""Dreadwolf"" promises to be an epic continuation of the Dragon Age saga.

""Dragon Age: Inquisition"" is a masterclass in RPG design, blending engaging combat, stunning visuals, and a world rich in content and storytelling. It's a game that doesn’t just age; it matures, offering an experience that remains compelling and enjoyable years after its release. For both veterans and newcomers to the series, ""Inquisition"" stands as a beacon of what makes the role-playing genre so beloved.",1703699701,1703944802,True,0,0,0.476804137229919434,1,True,False,False

In addition, some of the characters have an artistic and nice other side. You can romance them or become friends. For a person who doesn't talk to people, it's a comfortable change. The game's lore is extensive and by reading the notes left on the map you can learn a lot about it, from information about animals and demons to the history of locations and cities.

- After talking to companions at base, your character is left in a random area rather than where you originallaly approached the npc. 
- Looting animation. You can use a mod to remove it but why does it exist in the first place?

It has some bad sides, of course, like the Hinderlands and being stuck in them for the first 10h of your playthrough, rushed storylines, mid combat (in between a turn-based one with the tactical mode and normal one? it doesn't flow like it used to in DA2), but I personally recommend this game to every single gamer I know.

1222690,154385494,76561198106419093,0,1,927,0,927,1703521741,"How can this game be so bad? I wanted it to be good, and really tried to enjoy it, but man.. there's so many things wrong with it, it's impossible to put them aside, as even mods won't help in some cases.

One of the major pain-points is the UI itself. It was clearly not designed for mouse and keyboard, but even for a controller it's bad. But you could forgive a less-than-mediocre UI if the game was good, which it isn't.

- The inventory is a nightmare to navigate, you are limited to only seeing a handful of items at once, so you're constantly scrolling through that list, and every time you want to take a look at a different piece of gear, you have to do at least 2 clicks in order to go back from the current category and then bring up the other one (e.g. going ""Back"" from ""Weapons"" and then selecting ""Armor""). 
- The minimap is so useless it might as well not be there.. It does not show you the terrain, so good luck trying to find your way around that hill standing between you and your quest marker. Also, you cannot lock the minimap. I realize this is a matter of preference, but I'm pretty sure it is in fact easier for most people to navigate when the map is not rotating with their every movement. There should be on option to change this.
- Movement is one of your greatest enemies. You are *SLOW* and sluggish. The whole thing is just very rigid, and it feels off And the landscape makes it even worse. The road you're following is taking a detour and you'd like to take a shortcut by jumping over those rocks? Too bad, you're probably going to waste twice the amount of time you thought you would saved IF you even make it - because in many cases, you won't even be able to get through whatever's blocking the way.
- There are no mounts in the game. I mean, there are, but are they? Technically, they are faster than you on foot, but they sure don't feel like it. And you have to summon them, mount up, dismount, aaand deal with your mount losing acceleration because it stepped on a pebble.
- Companions are a nuisance in terms of gameplay. They always get in the way, bodyblocking you when you're trying to leave that useless little house you shouldn't have entered in the first place just to pick up a bottle of wine or whatever.
- Even dialogue feels bad to interface with. If you want to exhaust all your dialogue options with an npc who has multiple things to talk about, be prepared to bid them farewell and say hello immediately multiple times. Once you chose a topic for the conversation, you can rarely go back to the ""main menu"" of the dialogue to talk about something else. So you have to say goodbye, let the camera pan out, and then try to engage in a conversation again while the npc might be trying to walk away. So you'll end up just spamming F until it eventually works. But it can also break them sometimes, and they won't react to you at all. Amazing.
- Looting is also a chore, be it looting a chest, enemies or gatherables. The animation is long, and roots you in place. On top of that, you have to wait for the loot windows to do it's thing, which just... why??? After the third Elfroot you won't want to ever collect anything again. There is a mod that can help with this a little bit, but it only removes the need for the gathering animation, the loot window will still pop up and stop your movement briefly.
- The quest journal is also badly designed. Every time you open it, you are greeted with the list of regions/topics, each being a dropdown, which is passable, but it's always closed. So every. single. time. you will have to click on the area first, then scroll down to find that one quest you're looking for.
- The quests are also terribly uninspired, but I have only experienced the early parts. But even if it gets better later, this is a very bad way to start your game.
- As for the enemies you're fighting... I see the intent. I think this is actually an example of an aspect of the game dragged down because of other mechanics. The enemies in the Hinterlands would be more than fine for early game if the movement and combat was good. Let's take for example the Lesser Terror. It has a special attack where it burrows underground, then opens a portal under someone and jumps out of it shortly after, knocking the character down, then it starts channeling an aoe fear. Sounds interesting. Expect that you pretty much cannot dodge the upheaval attack. If you are not running the moment the portal appears under your feet, it will hit you. If you press W the moment the telegraph appears, it's too late. You *have* to start running preemptively, as soon as it burrows. Which you could make an argument for being acceptable, but it's simply not good. Especially if you're fighting multiple copies of this monster. Like, are you supposed to keep an eye on every single one of them, and as soon as any of them starts going underground, move ALL you characters because you don't know which one they'll target? That doesn't make sense.
- Combat... This one's the most disappointing. It's not only barebones, but a quite terrible one. Nothing really has weight, while at the same time, many abilities are a big commitment, which is an odd combination. Mages use 1 ability (or 2 if you're lucky) and then spam basic attacks that root them in place waiting for their mana to regen. Archers can at least move while shooting. And warriors... just whack at their opponent. If your facing 3-4 enemies, it's just senseless hitting in melee. Yes, you have crowd-control abilities, yes, you have aoe and some combos to deal more damage, but it is rarely needed/worth. If the enemy is targeting your tan, you just hit them until they die. If it's going after you back line, you better hope your tank has their ranged taunt available (or is in range for the aoe taunt), otherwise they'll never catch up with them if your dps is running away at the same time. And if you get caught in a cc-chain? Tough luck, have fun being tossed around. Also, the spells/abilities themselves aren't anything to write home about either. So you can create an ice wall. OR you can create a fire wall! And you have a passive that make your fire deal more damage or whatever. Cool. I know that later on you get more advanced class options, which make things a bit more interesting (a bit!), and one of my main goals was to at lest get there to see how much better it gets, but I just couldn't drag myself to do it. That alone should say a lot about the game.

There're dozens of other things I could nitpick just about the UI alone (like how clunky choosing your companions to form a party is), and then go on to rant about other things in the game, but I think I made myself clear. This game is just not good, and I am very disappointed. With all honesty, I cannot comprehend how it got the game of the year award and a bunch of other. And I'm not saying this to sound dramatic, I genuinely don't understand what made this *game* that good. The story might be stellar, I don't know. I liked what I saw from it. There's some decent roleplay and reactivity to your actions even early on. The graphics are nice, especially for a 2014 game. But as a videogame... this is not a good experience, not even remotely close. Avoid it unless you *really* want to play it for the story or whatever other reason.

This had me back and forth between extreme frustration, to cringe, to SUNDERING boredom. Let's begin:

The Good:

- The game looks good. For the time especially, the Frostbite engine knows how to simulate global illumination without needing the nuclear solutions like RT + Upscaling. Still could use better ambient occlusion, but everything is very pretty. Well done.

The Bad:

- Basically everything else, I am not kidding.

- Firstly, this is a terrible PC port, controls-wise. I needed a total of 7 QoL mods to make it even bareable to control on mouse & Keyboard, otherwise I would not have continued any further.

- This is not an RPG. If you're looking to explore a world and be an agent in the story, inflicting change and receiving the consequences for your actions, this game will offer you close to nothing. In fact I do not understand why they even give you a dialogue wheel. If you wish to challenge any decision or refuse any offer, the characters will basically tell you ""no, you DO want this"", and then the game carries on completely disregarding your input. Dragon Age was never the peak of player choice, but this is just pitiful.

- ""I do not care about what happens to any of these people"". These characters are not allowed to be unique or impart their interests into anything related to you or the plot. Seems like they watered down every bit of dialogue and plot point involving characters to be the most mundane, safe and uninteresting turn of events possible, forgetting that bringing them along and watching them interact & intersect in the unfolding story was the BASIS of the first games. When a character from Origins returns in this game, it's such a contrast to see them having some real agency and defending their interests and beliefs that it honestly made me laugh. Everything in this story is bland, unfocused and devoid of dramatic tention.

- Speaking of dramatic tention, what the hell is up with the dismissal of plot points from previous games? Not only that, but I've noticed several times that whenever a character begins a bit of expeditious world building, they get cut off by something else or another character saying that ""It's not important"" or ""we don't have time to talk about it"". WHY, I ask you, would they dismiss and dilute important pieces of this world and backstory WHEN THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A ROLE PLAYING GAME?! Why are you shooting yourself in the foot, BioWare?

- Oh yeah, the plot. Nothing much to say here, it's devoid of drama and events do not follow a cohesive progression. The story resets itself about 3 times and each time it manages to become even more bland and convoluted. If I had to guess, they came up with a story in a couple days after they finished designing the world to be as full of busywork and time-waisting as possible.

- About that world design, then. This is EA trying to make Dragon Age into a Far Cry game, and it's pathetic. There's nothing of interesting or plot essential in any of these locations, it's basically all the same assortment of repetitive tasks, the only difference being the visuals. They hope for dear God that the vistas will be enough to distract you from the fact that you're only doing chores. There's even an infinite task list that will ask you to go and collet stuff around the map indefinetely. This is not at all in the spirit of the other games, nor would it EVER make for an interesting game world. If I wanted to work, I'd just ask my boss irl for overtime.

- The combat. What have you done with the combat? I also had to heavily mod it just so I wouldn't claw my skin off in frustration. Apart from the controls not making any sense, they managed to ruin the behavior and pause system making it so you constantly have to adjust each character manually. This besides the fact that EVERY enemy is a damage sponge that will take several minutes to kill, spamming useless skills and all. Eventually I just gave up, reduced the health of every enemy to 1 and skipped every fight, I could not take any more of this.

- Bugs, there's quite a few. I have encountered some sort of bug where I could not progress any character relationship or romance. This is not related to any mods, as I checked, but in my playthrough after exausting the interaction cutscenes, characters would have nothing else to say nor any other progression with the main character. I was not able to solve it and eventually lost interest because, again, I don't really care about any of these cardboard cutouts. Other than that I had plenty of LoD meltdowns, falling through the map, enemies disappearing, and the funniest T-poses in the middle of ""important"" cutscenes. 

- Eventually I hit a game breaking bug. After I finished the main plot (whatever that was), I tried to start the DLC with the most boring entrance I've ever seen, only to be greeted with an infinite loading screen upon teleporting to the starting area of the added content. No mods were being used at this point, and I tried plenty of the solutions online, but nothing worked. It would just not load the DLC. Well, that was it for me. Enough is Enough. I'm never playing this again and it's about 60 hours I'll never get back. I will not be checking DreadWolf unless I hear from EVERYONE I trust that It's the best sequel since Return of the King, which I doubt.

* The tactical view doesn't work very well. Often, characters get stuck. 
* The tactical rules also don't allow nearly as much control as in previous DA games. The AI is actually not bad, but sometimes I'd still want more fine-grained control.

You will spend so much of your time simply walking around and not doing much. They could have made these large open areas more interesting, but instead players are mostly just going to walk around doing very simple puzzles and gathering collectibles (like a boring Ubisoft style open world game). 

This game was still very much worth playing, and if I ever decide to play it again, I will definitely be skipping most of the side content. This game could have been a much better experience if it had been condensed. Sometimes less is more. 

I'm excited for Dreadwolf, and I'm hoping that it will be a return to a more condensed experience like the first two Dragon Age games. And I'm also hoping that Dreadwolf will be a return to more simplified itemization. I thought the crafting in Inquisition was too much. There were like 300 different crafting recipes, and if you're like me, you didn't want to bother crafting and wasting the really good resources until you had Tier 4 Schematics. So the crafting didn't even come into play for me until the last 10% of the game.",1702967141,1702967326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of people dislike this game because it wasn't a repeat of Dragon Age: Origins and it leans more into action RPG than RPG, and it really shouldn't have won GOTY, but I still love this game. 

What to expect: a grand adventure with easy to use builds that are basically stripped down to warrior/rogue/wizard and not much else. A game that relies heavily on the relationships you have with your party members and the satisfaction of dopamine hits as you level up and build your Inquisition army. Running around maps, activating checkpoints that expose more of the map and grinding out objectives around the map to the point you feel like you're playing an offline MMO. You are building a grand faction player in this world and going around recruiting other factions to your cause through diplomacy, reputation, and battle. There is also a dragon in each map that serves as an optional big boss battle you can kill to get the best items in the game. There's also the obligatory romance options available that are so popular with adventure RPGs now because it fills the void of being foreveraloneIRL.

What not to expect: the smaller scale D&D RPG that was Dragon Age: Origins. If you want a game where you have more pen and paper style builds for characters, this is not for you. Also, this game gives you choice in dialogue but the choices you make when building your army are superficial and cosmetic and never have a grander impact on the story at all. The only choices that matter are how your private relationships with your party companions develop.

You will finish this game and be done with it because it is a long journey with a fair bit of a grind, but you will have had a lot of fun along the way too.",1702734620,1702734857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1222690,153709421,76561198968217413,0,2,9279,0,9279,1702726112,"I've just completed my first ever play through of Dragon Age: Inquisition (154 hours) - almost ten years after the initial release and right as the new trailer for Dragon Age: Dread Wolf was revealed. I'm not sure how or why I managed to put this game off for so long, but I'm kicking myself for not having played it sooner. 

I honestly believe the story writing in this game was second to none. The companion characters really felt alive and it truly felt like things were happening with them (and the world of Thedas around them) with or without the help of the Inquisitor. I don't know how I managed to stay spoiler-free for almost a decade, but the plot twists of finding out who was behind what and their motives really struck me by surprise. The possible romances in the game were wonderfully written, too - particularly when brought up amongst the in-field party banter (which also made me smile and laugh on multiple occasions - mainly attributed to having the Iron Bull, Sera and Dorian as my companions). 

I really enjoyed the combat system in the game as well - there was a well-rounded variety of specialised classes whereby each party member felt very different to play as. Some of the fights towards the end of the game (particularly in the DLCs) were challenging and kept the combat exciting as I switched between the role of my party members. I played as a Dalish Knight-Enchanter Mage Inquisitor, and I truly feel this was the perfect choice for a first play through given the events which transpire in the game.

I really took my time with this game - I managed 58 out of the possible 69 achievements, and I intend to eventually play again on a higher difficulty whilst I go for the rest. I had the Game of the Year edition which came with the three DLCs (Descent, Jaws of Hakkon and Trespasser) and I believe these were great additions to the events of the main game as the stories encapsulated in each were quite unique. I definitely could have completed the game in less than 154 hours, but I honestly didn't really want it to end, so spent my time completing many of the side-quests in each of the wilderness areas before moving on in the main quest line. Some might say these areas make the game feel bloated for no real reason, but being able to learn more about the world through these side-quests and their respective Codex entries made it worthwhile for me as a gamer who loves exploring every nook and cranny of a game. 

By the time the scenes playing out at the end of the game were rolling depicting the whereabouts of each companion/Inquisition leader following the choices which were made throughout the game, I was bawling my eyes out just a little bit! I've never felt such a connection to characters in an RPG before (and I've played plenty in my time), which allowed me to immerse myself in their stories on such a deep level. I just wanted to post on here to say if it's on your wish list you will not regret giving it a go as it really holds up visually and mechanically.",1702729152,1702729152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1222690,153686921,76561199509269096,0,12,159,0,156,1702712705,"*Full disclosure:  I have over 100 hours of play time over on another platform. 


Positive: 
- Worlds are immense, detailed and interesting. They can be both beautiful and creepy at times. Some of the best I have seen. 
- Writing is well done, and voice narration is a bonus.  
- Sounds / music are good quality.  
- Battle options are very interesting, allowing for individual commands across your unit/squad. 
- The in game navigation is quite good. Maps are nice and having the ability to set up camps for fast travel is great. 
- Character and weapon selection is good.  
- The game is actually fun to play.  

 
- Negatives: 
- In the menu the journal can be frustrating. What order to play in? Which quests are the main story, and which are side quests? *Research and plan. 
- Character dialogue has audio, but a lot of other text does not.  
- Some simple enemies can take way too long to kill.  
- Lack of a sneak/stealth feature (no crouching option).  
- Various glitches, such as beating a dragon and dragon not dying.  
- No run/sprint option?  

 

Conclusion: 

I had a lot of fun roaming the vast landscapes in Inquisition. They are often colourful and imaginative and have been designed in a way that leaves you curious to explore.  

There is no lack of battle which keeps you alert as you navigate. When conflict arises, you can control all 4 characters at once or individually. This for me makes the game stand out amongst similar titles. Each character has their own abilities which help you accomplish the task at hand in an efficient manner.  

The game can be confusing at times in terms of quest selection, so I suggest researching and planning. It can also feel slightly unrefined compared to a title like Witcher III. This being said, I had more fun playing Inquisition and even opted to fully complete most of the side quests.  

Despite any quibbles I liked the story and unique attributes, which makes me look forward to playing the first Dragon Age, Origins.

Launcher Stability: It is riddled with glitches and errors that often prevent launching the game therefore making it completely unplayable. Occasionally it will even literally loop over and over with a ""preparing game"" pop up to ad nauseam requiring you to force close the app with task manager. It makes you wonder how this triple A game publisher has more quality assurance than early access game ones (hint, it doesn't and apparently EA puts more effort into patching out their user base's band-aid fixes that solve this matter than making their app actually work consistently).

Launcher Usability: It always requires me to login online every single time and by extension includes an obnoxious email spam code verification whenever I close the app or restart my computer. It will not let me use my local login credentials like steam's offline mode so if either your internet is inconsistent and/or if the EA servers themselves are trash which they often are, you literally cannot play the game even in single player. You know, the opposite of what you would expect from a single player campaign game which is supposed to be offline friendly. That also means it is not at all mod friendly by any stretch if that ever came into consideration (but modding does not matter for me personally).

Launcher Analytics: The app by default collects user data requiring you to opt out manually and even then it does not fully opt out. It might not sound bad if you are apathetic in terms of privacy until you realize it is still  objectively a resource and bandwidth leech comparable to bloatware.

Single Player Game-Play: Oh and the game play itself is simply pretty enjoyable to avoid spoilers if you do not mind a notably worse and older variant of Baldur's Gate 3 in terms of single player. I emphasize that I mean just the single player because that is where the similarity stops. Typical third person RPG with character progression, story progression, and some open world exploration.

Multiplayer Game-Play: Meanwhile there's also a separate completely hollowed out grind-fest multiplayer that happens to have hilariously overpriced micro-transactions which no one with common sense would buy at any point. Said micro-transactions are just an alternative currency to buy chests (loot boxes) instead of the in-game earned gold system from just playing the multiplayer game. It really would not be an EA game without some loot boxes and micro-transactions thrown in somewhere as if reality was not a parody. Multiplayer also does not even use AI to fill in empty party slots past the tutorial ""proving grounds"" which is such a mind boggling rug-pull. You should expect to always be undermanned if you do not have three friends or find public randoms to play with despite having typical L4D2 coop vibes. You can theoretically try hard and play by yourself, but why not give the option if even the literal single player campaign lets you have both options with having AI party members or not?

It introduces a semi-open world containing several hubs. These areas range in size from small to huge and each has its own theme such as a desert or a spooky village. In each of these hub worlds there are countless things to do and to discover. While some players may find the amount of side missions, fetch quests and collectibles overwhelming and tedious, I enjoyed my time exploring everything this world had to offer. Regarding the gameplay Inquisition continues the trend of Bioware’s latest titles and feels a lot like an action RPG/MMORPG and is thus played best with a controller. Though the combats are fun the camera is too close and the tactical view is clumsy. Regarding the setting Dragon Age: Inquisition feels definitely more epic than its predecessor and the game surely has some breathtaking moments - e.g. the “Dawn will come / Skyhold” scene. On the other hand it also features some forays into the political interrelationships & intrigues between the various factions which I personally did not really enjoy. As with all Bioware games Inquisition features for the most part well written characters and companions with interesting backstories. The overall story is a good continuation of the Dragon Age lore with many references to the previous games. To fully embrace all aspects of the story it definitely helps to play Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2 including their DLC’s before playing Inquisition. Speaking of DLC’s also the expansions for Dragon Age: Inquisition are recommendable - especially “Trespasser” which includes the true ending and spans a nice arc to the next installment Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.",1700915777,1702325471,True,31,1,0.655266463756561279,0,True,False,False

My thoughts:
- Gameplay: Finicky, restrictive and boring. Trying too hard to be an action game and failing. Trying too hard to be a strategy game and failing. Worse yet it's littered with just too much half-assed side content with uninspired writing and lackluster voice acting. It was painstakingly difficult to find any enjoyment in the gameplay whatsoever especially in comparison to previous installments.

- Story: Lots of potential for a truly grand and epic story and yet so poorly executed. They ""pretend"" to go with the story premise of having a random nobody thrusted into the clutches of chaos and prove themself and save the world, only to HEAVY HANDEDLY smack you in the face with a god complex and people worshiping the ground you walk on so much they might aswell stroke your- anyhow... This game is a terrible entry point into the series because unlike the first or even the second game it doesn't function well as a stand alone story. It relies WAY too heavily on the previous installments for context and references. Amazing if you've played the previous games, confusing and likely off putting if you haven't.

- Characters: Probably the ONLY strong point in this game in my opinion. The cast of characters are all very unique with a lot of interesting twists to bring to the table. I found a lot of enjoyment in seeing how each of their individual character arcs played out. My all time favorite moment being a lot of them gathering together around a deck of cards and just having a laugh. Beautiful.

- Final thought: The climax of the game (which I will not be spoiling) for some reason just left me with an almost empty feeling. I felt disappointed with the conclusion of the story along with everything else. It just did not feel as grand or amazing. This entire game, start to finish save for the few sweet character moments here and there was just one big roller coaster of disappointment.

At the heart of Inquisition lies a narrative that's both deep and emotionally resonant. The game weaves a complex and engaging tale set in the sprawling and beautifully rendered world of Thedas. What sets this game apart is the sheer scope of player agency. Your decisions, whether in dialogue or actions, ripple through the game, affecting not just individual interactions but the very fate of nations. Few games manage to imbue player choices with such profound consequences, and it's a testament to the art of storytelling in gaming.

However, what truly elevates ""Dragon Age: Inquisition"" is its characters. The companions you gather along your journey are more than mere allies; they're complex individuals with their own dreams, fears, and ambitions. The relationships you forge with them are emotionally charged, and their loyalty missions provide profound insights into their lives. Whether you're forming deep friendships or kindling romantic flames, these relationships are central to the game's emotional impact.

One of the most glaring issues with the game is its open-world design. While Thedas is undeniably expansive and visually pleasing, it lacks substance. The vast, empty landscapes are often filled with tedious fetch quests, repetitive side activities, and uninspired collectibles. The sheer size of the world can be daunting and overwhelming, leading to a sense of aimless wandering rather than exploration and discovery.

There have been reports of audio-related issues, including missing or distorted sound effects, voiceovers, or music. These problems can disrupt the immersive experience and impact the storytelling. Users also have reported bugs and glitches related to the game's user interface.

Here is my genuine opinion. If you played Baldur's Gate 3 or Skyrim don't come in expecting it to be like those games or you will be sorely disappointed.  If you're coming in after playing the first two games then you'll sort of know what to expect. The UI is very different compared to the other two games and the also completely simplified the money in it as they completely did away with the silver an copper. The UI is also a lot more modern, not bad but certainly more welcoming to newer audiences. One of my biggest pet peeves in the game is how they handled the follower system, compared to DAO's fabulous follower system where you got to customize every aspect of how your followers function this water downed system irks me.

As for the story side, it's fine. Nothing to amazing a few interesting story beats and endings. Overall an improvement compared to DA2 (Though that's not saying much). The companions are hit or miss in my opinion, Varric is a delight while I found Vivianne annoying and wish they had done better for her personality along with more depth. As for the art direction in the game it's some of their best work, the tarot cards are easily my favorite part about them and how they've seemingly integrated them into the game's UI is stunning. Character creation kind of sucks but honestly they always have in the Dragon Age series so meh.

Finally the most divisive aspect of this game isn't even the game itself rather it's the company. EA is probably the worst company and it's unfortunately it's downfall when it comes to anything but the first game. Having to create a whole other account for this is ridiculous even for EA. I already had an account but that still doesn't mean that they should force other people to make one for the own benefit. This is heartbreaking to me as I genuinely fell in love with the series and the first game is by far my favorite.

So here's my recommendation. If you hate EA don't buy this game rather go find it elsewhere. If you wanted to play the series together and liked the other games, get it when it's on sale. I mean it's practically on sale every few months. So would I recommend it, yeah honestly the animation is fun and snappy really makes you feel awesome and like you're is a very fun fantasy game.

Beautiful landscapes and ancient ruins, great story, open world, Waiting for new games from BioWare.",1701570499,1701570499,True,11,2,0.575283408164978027,1,True,False,False

This game for me is a sad disappointment, just like Mass Effect Andromeda, they made the same mistake, which is making the game feel like a open world MMO.
For me the strong point of this game is the story and lore, the choice making and the combat system. The story here has more impact on the world comparing to the other dragon age games, even more than the first.
In the game the main character is brought alive by voice acting and everything you can choose to say is well written.
The combat lets you use a wide range of tactics which works very well for a squad.
The story and lore are very rich and all your choices through dialogue will have an impact on it.
You will be able to have adventures with very well made characters.
The romance in this game for males at least, is somewhat poor, it´s really simple and boring, lacks depth, at least with ambassador Montilyet. I haven´t tried the other romance options. And for some reason they made all the females ugly, so it was hard to choose because the only 2 attractive females were not a romance option. There are rumors that Bioware made the females ugly on purpose because of political correctness, you know, because guys are very evil for having beauty standards, so stupid. But it´s not ""proven"", those are just ""rumors"". Oh, and even the desire demons ceased to exist, wonder why. What a stupid time we live in, that everyone gets offended for just existing.
You can compare the difference in Cassandra from Dragon Age II to Inquisition for example. But maybe the romance with her is better, at least her personality is very good.
The graphics are very good, the voice acting is high quality.
Another thing that puts me off in all the Dragon Age games, is the lack of armor variety, they all look the same, and a lot of them are ugly, but at least they let us change the armor color in this game, and craft cool weapons with cool abilities.
And finally, the worst of all, this is what puts me off and what makes this game boring 80% of the time, this makes Inquisition worse than the older games. This game feels like an MMO, you know, they have a fetish nowadays of making every game open world, so instead of being in the action completing well developed quests... If you want to complete the game 100% or near it you need to collect shards, solve stupid puzzles, find bottles, find locations, place banners, explore everything, find generic treasure spots that aren´t worth anything and other mmo stuff. The side quests in this game are the same as MMO quests, I am going to explain.
Go there kill this creature, find those items, bring me this animal, fetch me those plants. Yeah REALLY F***** BORING. The only games that work in Open World are games like the Elder Scrolls or Fallout for example.
My advice to you, don´t play the game to 100% like I tried to do, Stick to the main and companion quests, If you want to play 100% then play Elder Scrolls Online, it´s better, really.
I played 117 hours because I 100% every map, if I didn´t with would be a max of 40 hours.
Oh, and the system for transfering the save files from previous games to keep the choices from before is Sh**, really, it´s a website that doesn´t even work properly. Instead of wasting 2 seconds like all other bioware games choosing the save file which are found automatically... You have to upload them to a website, which for some reason doesn´t work, and if it works the choices don´t transfer, so it´s the same as not working, I had to waste an hour manually choosing my choices and searching on the internet side quests and characters I didn´t even remember because the Keep system is so Sh**, BORING!

The game's vast landscapes, diverse regions, and intricate lore create a world that begs to be explored.

One of Inquisition's standout features is its cast of characters, each meticulously crafted with depth and complexity. From the charming Varric to the stoic Cassandra and the enigmatic Solas, the party members contribute to a diverse and engaging ensemble. The character development is exceptional, with personal quests and interactions revealing layers of backstory that deepen the player's connection to the in-game companions.

The Inquisitor, the player character, is fully customizable and represents a pivotal force in the unfolding narrative. The choices made throughout the game shape not only the fate of Thedas but also the relationships with companions, adding a dynamic element to the storytelling.

The camaraderie and conflicts within the party provide a rich emotional tapestry that resonates throughout the game. Whether engaging in banter during exploration or witnessing the impact of major decisions on relationships, the characters' interactions contribute to the overall depth of Inquisition's narrative.

Beyond its engaging characters, Inquisition excels in its strategic combat system, allowing players to tailor their playstyle and tactics. The mix of real-time action and tactical pause-and-play creates a satisfying balance, ensuring that battles are both challenging and rewarding.

Visually stunning, with a soundtrack that complements the epic scale of the adventure, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a tour de force in the RPG genre. It successfully weaves together a vast, living world with memorable characters, offering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands as a testament to BioWare's storytelling prowess.",1697647472,1701515956,True,17,0,0.544805049896240234,0,True,False,False

Having logged slightly over 150 hours of playing (and replaying) this I thought I should pen my thoughts - fairly rich if at times draggy main plot bolstered by interesting side missions, decent visuals which one would come to expect of such a game in this day and age marred by glitches galore - from the inability to select items marked on screen for selection to player characters freezing during combat repeatedly and (not giving details to avoid spoiling the plot) boss characters spawning at awkward and inaccessible locations requiring you to replay an entire boss killing stage all over to progress.

The MOST frustrating thing I found on this game relates to combat mechanism, which displays the repeated tendency of a character freezing during combat fairly often, resulting in one or more squadmates just hanging around waiting to be hammered by the enemies and also rendering the rest of the team down on firepower. The only thing i've manage to do when this happened was to activate the Disgage command and then reissue all my attacking commands all over again, which in turn gives rise to issues with the flow of battle. Couple this to character occasionally appearing in nooks and cranies where they aren't able to move (similar to the boss spawning above) really kills the experience, especially when it results in having to replay the entire boss stage.

I'm not sure if i'm the only one, but to me it feels on one hand, the depth of variation across the myriad of side quests feel like quite a bit of thought's been put in, but at the same time, taking in the overall picture, it felt like something hurriedly stitched together. Does that make sense?

And oh, did i mention the pointless EA app which increasingly pops up with a ""Temporarily lost connection"" followed by ""Something went wrong...encountered unknown error..."" message which totally stops one from even starting the game?

Anyway, all in, I'd say this game needs an additional ""maybe"" rating in addition to the Yes thumbs up and No thumbs down rating.",1699369811,1701195407,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's all here in Dragon Age Inquisition, so why is it that I enjoy this game infinitely more than the new ACs?

I think it comes down to 2 factors:

(1) Nostalgia: Dragon Age Inquisition was the first AAA game I ever played and it was back when I didn't have a very good idea of how open-world games worked. In my first playthrough I ran aimlessly in the Hinterlands for hours before realising there was a story to progress. And I genuinely had a eureka moment when I turned in a fetch quest for the first time. Thedas as portrayed in this game is a world that you have a heavy hand in shaping, albeit in ways that are quite limited by 2023 standards. I think for seasoned players of the genre it might be difficult to see this game as anything other than a watered-down version of Origins inheriting some of the worst aspects of game design in the early 2010s. For me though, this game will always be special.

(2) The lore: Dragon Age Inquisition, gameplay hiccups aside, fundamentally respects the lore and does something extremely interesting with it. Soon after The Trespasser was released the fandom immediately found itself in a speculation frenzy and I am so glad that I got to be a part of that. There is a wonderful sense of parallel between the various faiths in Thedas and those that exist in the real world and the politics shown in the game are as exciting as they have ever been in previous entries. I would even go so far as to argue that by focusing on higher echelon players, Inquisition's stories are less personal than Origins' but offer something completely new, refreshing, and strangely more relatable - because while I can see myself attending meetings and leading a tight-knit team in the workforce, how often will I fight in ancient battles, break ancient curses and fornicate with the daughters of ancient witches?

I think it is quite sad that this is very likely the last of its kind considering the way Bioware is going with many of their other titles. But I think it is also important to enjoy the game on its own merits and appreciating it for what it does so right. If you can look past the dated game design and contextualise it within the other games that it came out alongside, most notably Shadow of Mordor, it is not difficult to see how it essentially perfected ""the Skyrim formula"" by giving players a flashy, colourful and intriguing world to explore. You can easily lose yourself in the companion banter, the enjoyable combat and reading the fascinating and well-written lore the game has to offer. So don't let the online hate for the game turn you away if you haven't tried it! It is by all metrics an underrated game by 2023!",1700082380,1700082380,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

In the beginning of this new game, the divine leader figure gathers both parties in an attempt to create peace between them, but this is stopped by an outside party Mage named Corypheus, who decides to doom the world instead, blowing up the place of meeting and creating a hole in the sky. And among it all, you the hero end up stopping Corypheus from going further, and accidentally claim this magic power, while also forgetting all about it in the process. The power now in your hand is the only thing to stop the hole in the sky called the veil, which leads you to create a military force called the inquisition to help you stop this evil once and for all.

If none of this makes sense, it goes to show how much Inquisition requires you know the world of Thedas beforehand, or else you will be confused about what is happening. This was my experience when I first played the game, without the knowledge of the first two games. The game takes you up on a bunch of stories it assumes you know, so it really feels slow and confusing at first. It isn’t until you start going further along the main quests that you realize why your character is important and what it all means, so needless to say I recommend you play the first two even if it’s not the same protagonist.

That introductions aside,  Inquisition does feel a wonderful cast of diverse characters, all with their own set goals and points of view in life where you will sometimes struggle making them agree with everything you do to gain their friendship or love, but the game does a good job at giving you some combat quests that you can easily gain their approval even if they dislike your choices. By the time it was all set and done I was very sad as the credits rolled, because a lot of these characters became close friends and family to my inquisitor, and the final moments are more akin to saying goodbye at a job with great colleagues or graduating and leaving friends behind you to see for years. This will always be Bioware’s strength, and DAI is no exception to it.

Now in terms of the gameplay, this one has a lot of mixed opinions out there, and I include myself among them. The game goes for an open world approach rather than big dungeon levels like in the past. Now, I actually did enjoy the visuals of the open world for its time, and it’s great to see how the world of Thedas looks in a bigger scope. However, the actual quests on this world are a mixed bag, there’s a ton of quests, very much many, with some of them being long ones that you gotta find and complete and solve on every map. Thankfully, these types of quests aren’t really necessary for anything in the game, but if you're a completionist, I think you might make an exception for this game. In regards to character quests, there are a lot of very filler ones, many involving finding a missing person who 80% of cases is dead. But you will still find yourself needing to do these because the maps go higher on level requirement, so you need to meet certain levels if you don’t want to die constantly even on easy mode. This perhaps would be more doable if there was better traversal, you get a horse but is still pretty slow and doesn’t feel different from walking. At least in the case of Mass effect 1 and Andromeda you had a speedy vehicle that made these types of quests more bearable, but that’s not present here, showing why perhaps this universe fits less this type of open world.

Now in terms of the combat I think is all right, I don’t think there’s anything crazy to write about it. I feel I enjoyed more the combat on previous games though, it felt like I was being more tacticall about my choices on approaching instances, where as here it felt more like spamming and hiding when in danger most of the time, but is quick paced enough that didn’t feel like a pain to play through and they still let you play as other companions during them which always helps make the experience varied. The fights against dragons were probably the best set pieces though, and the DLCs for trespasser and the descent have a better design overall where they go for a traditional dungeon design rather than the open world and it feels a lot more exciting and challenging combat wise.

The visuals are overall good, even if lighting at times was iffy and made sometimes char not look as good, but the level design still holds really well today. But the best quality production here is the sound. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, from the main game to the DLCs, it elevates each particular moment in the game. The voice acting is also great all around, everyone feels very uniquely voiced, and never felt anyone felt like a repeat. 

Overall, Dragon Age Inquisition still holds up pretty well to this day, while the open world hasn’t aged fully (most open worlds never do anyway from my experience), the big set pieces, cinematics, and characters are still very strong enough to retain the experience as still another great Bioware title. Hopefully the reception to the last two DLCs will make them move forward toward that approach instead of open world, for the next title, Dreadwolf.",1699726978,1699726978,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They are all bland and one dimensional from start to end. 

Combat like I said is very bullet spongy enemies that even the smallest mob takes 10 mins to kill. And there is level scaling so there is almost no point to leveling up except being able to use higher gear.

TLDR: A good game that is made difficult to enjoy and most likely not worth the effort for most people.

Okay, so I passed over DAI for a while after trying it once for a couple hours and not being impressed (i have left my previous review below for the sake of context). I recently re-purchased it on sale to give it a second chance, and it was a good game, but I still find it hard to recommend but for entirely different reasons. I'll first go over what I liked about the game.

The Good Stuff:
-Story: The story narrative for DAI is much more focused that the DA2 story was, which for many could be a welcome change. I thought many parts of the story were quite engaging and well done. Following the Inquisitor's main journey was interesting.

-Combat: While the combat starts out incredibly basic, once you've leveled up some and once you have a build going, the combat becomes quite fun. The boss fights range in quality, but for the most part were quite fun. I played the game on nightmare difficulty, which forced me to be much more careful and strategic in how I played (for the most part), which I found quite satisfying. Also, dragon fights were amazing.

-Characters: Once the game got off the ground the characters really become the highlight and my own personal favorite part of the game. Companions ranging from mages and templars to elves, dwarves, etc. were quite well done and enjoyable.

-Modding: This game supports various kinds of mods that can range from quality of life changes to gameplay overhauls to cosmetic add-ons, etc. Some quality of life mods (like larger search radius, skipping loot animations, larger inventory, etc) really saved my experience with this game from being frustrating to enjoyable.

Descent and Trespasser DLC: These were quite good and added a lot of enjoyment to my experience with the game. Jaws of Hakkon less so.

Now that I have covered what I really liked about the game, it is time to cover what I disliked and why I ultimately decided to still not recommend DAI.

The Bad Stuff:
-Story: While there were some really good aspects of the story, the main overall plot is incredibly basic. There are also some HUGE pacing issues with the story of the game that takes away any sense of urgency or stakes. The main big bad villain of the game I found to be quite underwhelming and not that intimidating at all because of this. It was also apparent that the end of the base game was quite rushed and felt very unsatisfying until the added epilogue of the Trespasser DLC, which more or less fixed some of the narrative issues.

-Open World: Much of the pacing issues are inherently tied to the open world aspect of the game, which encourages you to go through large maps to do tedious fetch quests and objectives that have no tangible or perceivable impact on the games plot and aren't particularly rewarding in terms of loot either. This made the game feel less focused than it could have, and ultimately made it feel like it overstayed its welcome with how long it takes to do side content.

-AI management: This is one thing that carried over from my previous review that is still a sticking point for me. The companion AI's are really dumb. This can't really be mitigated by the bare-bones tactics and behaviors menu, so on higher difficulties you are forced to micro manage the party for a good majority of the fights, which becomes time-consuming and tedious at times.

-Getting set up: I honestly would not have been able to finish this game had it not been for mods making my life a bit easier, but the effort it takes to install and get those mods running likely won't be worth it to many people. Also, the EA app is by far one of the MOST ANNOYING apps I have ever had the displeasure of having to use. Trying to work around issues with the EA app added way more time wasted than what I'd like to admit.

Overall, at the end of it, I personally enjoyed my time playing the game in spite of many of the glaring issues it has. If you enjoyed DAO and DA2 and are REALLY starved for some more Dragon Age, I think it is worth the effort to mod and get to a point where you can actually have a good experience with the game.  However, I don't think I can really recommend it to anyone apart from Dragon Age fans.


Below is my original review:

I really wanted to like this game after having enjoyed DAO and DA2, but DAI deviates so much from the previous games in terms of gameplay I couldn't bring myself to have fun with this game. I'll try to keep my points brief.

What I can say:

-Character creation: The character creation is decent, allowing you to pick from a number of different classes and races. It also allows you to carry over decisions from the previous games, but not by porting over saves. Instead you have to log into an EA account and manually choose the outcomes of the previous games, which while this allowed for a custom experience, it felt very tedious.

-animations: This bugged me right away, as the idle and walking animations for the MC (I played fem elf) look terrible. The animations of the other chracters also felt stiff, especially facial animations. It was really jarring.

-The combat: This is what killed it for me. The combat in DAO and DA2, while very different from each other, still presented a creative and fun combat mechanic (DAO was very tactical, while DA2 was very dynamic). The combat in this game felt like I was playing a pretty basic mmo. The tactics, which were one of the best parts of the first two games, were dumbed down significantly to the point where you would either have to micro-manage the party or just forgo any kind of party strategy. The tactical camera was also harder to control. Very dissapointing.

-Looting: the looting in this game was aweful. You have to stand right on top of the loot to get it, and to find loot you have to use a button that sends out a radar ping to search for it (the radius of which was way too small to be overly functional.

-Music: The music was fine. Nothing to write home about, but not bad at all.

-Performance: The game ran fine for the most part. A few fps drops here and there, but nothing gamebreaking.

What I can't judge:

Story: I didn't get far enough into the story to really say if it was good or bad, as I dropped it after just a couple hours. What I did see was very basic, but nothing terrible.

Characters: Again, I can't really comment too much on this since I gave up a few hours in. The characters I did run into, apart from returning characters, didn't make much of an impact on me with the time I did spend with them.

Overall, what I did experience with this game left me dissapointed. It felt like I was playing a watered-down mmo with no other players in it rather than a single-player rpg. I got this on sale for $9.99 and still felt I needed to refund it. As much as I loved the first two games, I just can't bring myself to enjoy this one.",1620848382,1698875092,False,4,0,0.485093057155609131,0,True,False,False

The elephant in the room, gamers hate EA. Whether you are someone that identifies with the development part of gaming enterprises i.e. the; coders, designers, and artist which make the property viable for us consumers, you don't like EA. EA has been a sea of horrible crunches that hurt families. Not to mention disconnected leadership which forced developers to force out games before their time. 

Maybe, you are a person who had a favorite developer that made that one game you identified with. Deep Space, the child of Visceral games, Mythic the magic behind Dark age of Camelot, Bull Frog and Syndicate, Westwood, Pandemic, Origin the list goes on. You vehemently hate EA also; they took your favorite storyteller and ripped them to pieces when they weren't profitable anymore. 

Last, you are probably just a gaming enthusiast and EA specializes in making the games you want to play, difficult to do so.  Between game exclusivity, 3rd party applications, unfinished hype-ware and stale redundancies like the sports and FPS whale franchises, your view of EA is perennially negative and you have all the proof in the world to back up this estimation. 

What does this have to do with Dragon Age Inquisition, you may ask?  I and I believe many other gamers allowed our righteous bias against EA the company to color what Dragon Age inquisition the game really was and currently is. Once I allowed the persistent cloud of EA and Bioware negative press to fade to my memory, not to mention desperate for an RPG that isn't a complete slog to play, I reinstalled the latest installment of Dragon Age.  

I have been greeted with beautiful visuals, dynamic and vibrant scenarios with great voice acting. Why was this game not enough for me before? Maybe because I can see the bottom that Starfield and many other games this year have hugged and charged me 70 dollars for. Maybe, I have matured in what I like and Dragon Age Inquisition required a more sophisticated pallet?  I doubt that, it is definitely cause I have see the trash heap gaming has shoveled itself into. 

And yes, before anybody asks, I have played Baulder's Gate 3. Yes I think it is brilliant but, once again it's combat is a slog. I don't want to trade one thing for another. Brilliant story for horrible combat isn't something I enjoy. If I am paying for this; I want my cake and eat it too.

But this ""streamlining"" of the combat system, if you will, still allows for an enjoyable experience that is backed by the tried and tested formula Bioware has used throughout the Dragon Age series.

While it has it dinks with bugs, annoying quests, and other issues, it still provides a rich story with good enough supporting characters that blend in well with the world building. Sadly, the the world building is blemished by a lacking antagonist who in lore poses a grave threat to the world, but in practice, barely has a presence throughout the game which takes away the feeling that the stakes are high and takes away some of the weight from the burden of saving the world. 

Moreover, as the protagonist, you are given many decisions to make that should ultimately alter the course of the sequels, but there are times when these choices lack depth and are limited. The War Table missions are also a good idea in theory, but poorly executed, as the time taken by each mission throws a wrench in between exploration sessions. The War Table missions also feel like gambles at times, given that you're only given textual context about the scenario, and the proposed solutions of your advisors, which isn't always reliable as like in the real world plans don't always turn out the way you want them to.

All in all, Dragon Age Inquisition is a pretty good game. While it may not have as much depth to the decision making present in Dragon Age Origins in my opinion, and the gameplay is somewhat dumbed down in a way, it still is an enjoyable experience throughout.",1698658503,1698658503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's been this conflict between the base game and DLC dating back as far as its launch, which randomly prevents you from accessing the game because of an error where the game doesn't detect DLC's. This bug applies to DA:2 as well and doesn't look like it's ever going to be fixed.

Also to the people thinking about getting EAplay... just know that you're paying for a scam which causes you more problems than the satisfaction of having all these games open up to you, is worth. BTW what they wont tell you is that EA play *does not* come with DLC's, even if the game is technically GOTY. Unless you're very impatient and cant wait for monthly sales, it's not worth it. You'll essentially be coaxed into buying the same game twice.  EA play also exacerbates the issue mentioned above that prevents you from playing the game because of the DLC.

Because the game is attached to EA launcher you'll have to jump through a thousand hoops before finally being confronted with the realization that you have to contact EA support. In doing so you will get put face to face with what can only be described as an Indian scam call center. Workers who are clearly being paid 2 cents an hour; a job they took for the added bonus '1 week to fluent' english course (which is as much of a scam as any of EA's corporate decisions)

As for the game it's nothing special, really. The combat is god awful and completely toneless compared to it's predecessors  (granted it can be alleviated with combat mods which allow you to attack whilst moving). DA:I is much less 'RPG-ey' compared to the (few and far between) good RPG's. In Origins you can make wacky builds, summoning skeletons, corrupting enemies with curses causing them to explode on death, even friendly-fire-cast paralysis on your own team - a spell intended to CC an enemy - to turn them immune against damage. You'll have nothing as creatively liberating, here.

Inquisition's combat is very streamlined in the same way most games are these days, to make it more enjoyable for console players. It might look nice, but compared to Origins this is ZZZZZZ. Typical brainlessly smash stuff gameplay.

But if you're a person who wants to experience the story of the canon DA universe in it's entirety it's OK.

Comparing Origins to Inquisition is like comparing WoW vanilla to retail. It's just not the same.

The best thing about playing Inquisition is coming to terms with the fact that Dragon Age 4 is going to be a flop.",1695056683,1698388918,False,8,1,0.589885294437408447,0,True,False,False

What happened to the multi-rule settings to create proper team synergy mechanics depending on battle scenarios??? The companion AI here is more often frustrating than not.

Disappointing. Boring. And eventually, apathy. Those are the words and series of emotions that I'd use to describe my time with Dragon Age: Inquisition. A far cry from the game I once remembered playing almost ten years ago. Truthfully, this time around, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it and had to quit halfway, something I rarely do. Sincerely, I want everybody reading to know that I gave it my best shot. But, after hundreds of hours of playtime praying things would get better, I had to be honest with myself. I wasn't having fun, and no amount of waiting is going to change that. I had to walk away. It brings me no pleasure writing this review, especially for a game I once so adored as a teenager, but I must be truthful to myself and to everyone who reads my reviews. Get ready, this is a long one.

[b] The Positives [/b] ▼

[b] 1. Breathtakingly Beautiful [/b]

As someone who was able to run the game at maximum settings, DAI has got to be one of the most beautiful open-world games I've ever played. The amount of biodiversity was brimming with beauty. The stunning vistas of the Hinterlands, the sprawling forests of the Emerald Graves, the desert of the Western Approach, and the wet marshland of Fallow Mire, to name a few locations. DAI contains the most biodiverse and varied environments in the entire series, and I had a blast exploring all of them. 

[b] The Average [/b] ▼

[b] 1. Storywise, It's Decent? [/b]

I feel the story got off to a strong start but slowly lost momentum the more time went on until it lost most, if not all, urgency and excitement by the middle of the plot. Who knows, maybe it gets better toward the end, but that's not something I'm willing to risk for another 100 hours of boring gameplay. Due to that ambiguity, I'm putting it in the middle at average. 

[b] 2. A Mixed Bag Of Characters [/b]

Your new team members to the various supporting side characters all ranged wildly in terms of quality from great to forgettable to just downright annoying. One moment I'm having fun chatting with Varric, and the next, I'm spacing out listening to Blackwall talk. Compared to Origins, where it's consistently outstanding, to Dragon Age 2, where it's consistently good, DAI, on the other hand, fluctuates all over the place in terms of characters. 

[b] The Negatives [/b] ▼

[b] 1. The Worst Character Creation System Ever Created [/b]

Genuinely, this is something one has to see to believe. It's that bad. DAI is unquestionably the game with the worst character creation system I've ever had the displeasure of using. The ugliest selection of hairstyles to ever exist. The most eye-watering eyebrows you'll ever see. The most bare-bone of facial sliders and more. I wish I was exaggerating for comedic effect, but I'm not. Unless you're willing to download mods, it's quite simply almost impossible to make any decent-looking character. I must've spent dozens of hours and wasted time restarting so many playthroughs because I just couldn't stand how goofy, weird, and ugly my custom characters look. In a game where the players are supposed to live vicariously through their avatar if they're unable to do so because of the sheer incompetence of the character creation system, then you have utterly failed at your job as a role-playing game. 

[b] 2. Bad Facial Animation And Lip Synching Issue [/b]

On the odd chance that a player miraculously created a custom character that they are somewhat content with, it will be compromised by the weak amateurish facial animation. Dragon Age as a series has always had this problem, but in DAI, the issue has never been more apparent and visible due to the enhancement in graphical fidelity. Characters doing the 1,000-yard stare into nothing, the most laughable frowning facial expression, and the list goes on. Not to mention the lip-synching problem that feels like it's always a fraction of a second behind whatever dialogue that's playing. It's a mess.

[b] 3. Wide As The Ocean, Shallow As A Puddle [/b]

If you're ever in the mood to play a game where the majority of the missions and activities are filler content and busy work, then, boy, do I have the product for you. Introducing: DAI. For the low price of $40 and hundreds of hours of gameplay, you too, can experience the worst of what the open-world genre can offer. Emotionally gripping side missions that rival even the main story itself? Yeah, they're not here. Fun side activities? No fun is allowed on our watch. Mounts that actually sprint faster? Nope, it's all an illusion (no, seriously, look it up). In search of an endless sea of mindless activities and collectibles? Then, you've come to the right place. If all of this sounds fun and enticing to you, pick up the phone and call now. 

[b] 4. The Grind Is Real [/b]

Crafting plays an integral part of the progression system. The problem is it's too f#cking grindy! Not only does the player need to first farm for the schematic of the item, itself, to begin crafting. But they also have to spend copious amounts of time collecting the necessary ingredients for it. Depending on how rare the craftable item is, it could take hours just searching for the schematic and, on top of that, farming the ingredients for it. Unless you're willing to download mods that significantly increase the drop rate and quantity of it, there's no avoiding the grind. Seriously, who at Bioware thought this was fun? 

[b] 5. Behavior & Tactics Menu Is Worse [/b]

The AIs in the Dragon Age series have always been dumb. But, the thing that has always kept it in check was the in-depth behavior & tactics menu. In Origins and DA2, the settings were meticulous and let the players control how teammates would behave in battles extensively. If one is at least willing to spend the time to adjust the conditions, it can make the terrible NPCs a lot more bearable to work with. Not in DAI, though. The tactics menu is so stripped down that it makes it practically impossible to rely on the AIs to support you in any strategic capacity. It's nowhere near as comprehensive as the previous games. As a result, some abilities straight up don't work because your teammates are too stupid to use them. 

[b] 6. Regression In Combat [/b]

All Bioware had to do was copy and paste everything from DA2 into this game, except they can't even be bothered to do that right, either. Everything is somehow worse than before. DAI has less ability slots, slower animation, fewer enemies to fight per encounter, and even dumber NPCs. In fairness, it's still not as bad as Origins' combat system, but worse and inferior to DA2 in many significant ways. 

[b] 7. Frustrating To Mod [/b]

I have a lot of experience modding, and DAI infuriated me to no end and is, beyond a doubt, my most frustrating time modding for a game. Unlike most games where users only have to use one mod manager, this game has two. Secondly, DAI runs on the Frostbite Engine, which is notoriously difficult to use by both modders and users. Consequently, because of this whirlwind of problems, conflicts between mods on different mod managers are a common issue that often requires hours of troubleshooting to fix. It's a nightmare, and I don't recommend it. 

[b] 8. Not Keyboard Friendly [/b]

DAI was made with the consoles and controllers in mind, not PCs. As a result, the key binding for keyboards and mouse aren't very well optimized and tend to be somewhat awkward to learn for most players. Hence, I strongly recommend using a controller should you have one. 

[h1] Parting Words [/h1]

Dragon Age: Inquisition should only be reserved for the most hardcore of Dragon Age fans, for it serves little of values elsewhere. Purchase it on sale, and for most people, I recommend that you don't buy it at all. It's not worth your time nor money. I think I had more fun writing this review than playing the actual game itself.

Think less epic Lord of the Rings, except Middle Earth is controlled by the Pope, and the whole story is about how the Pope and a bunch of cardinals got murdered and you were blamed for it. So now you have to run around killing demons and befriending every living creature you meet in order to clear your name and get Hell to stop trying to tear the world in half.


But in all seriousness, it's a fun game, got a pretty good story, big (mostly) open world, and some of the choices you make actually have consequences instead of having the illusion of them (*cough cough* Mass Effect 3's ending *cough cough*). Would definitely recommend if you like the other two DA games.

I was engaged through the first hour figuring it out,  Once I hit the open world map I was bored.  I hate the combat. Maybe it is the level design, but it feels like it is just dragging to get to the main adventure.  I can barely bring myself to slog on.  I haven't gotten far in that first open world canyon after canyon fest.  The combat is boring, and the character development doesn't give me anything that I can see that gives me something to look forward to in development with spells, power and abilities.

I feel sorry for those who paid full price.  This is not a good dragon age game at all.  period.  I paid 4 dollars for this on sale, and I almost feel ripped off at that.  I love RPG games, and that is saying alot to this.

The very ending was absolutely fantastic. The graphics were obviously a major improvement, with many expansive and breathtaking places. And it was nice to see one of these games finally give the main character a voice and personality of his own. Loved the inventory and crafting system, even if by the time I actually had the cool gear the game was over. And the lore in this game can be pretty good at times. This all gave it a good vibe to play, though I must be fair and speak about things in this game I felt could be improved.

The companions in this game. Iron Bull was my favorite, and without any spoilers the surprise they gave him towards the end was fascinating. Major plus for the surprise. However, as for everyone else, I felt like it was pretty lackluster. I tried romancing Josephine, and in-game it randomly stops without any mention after the main boss is defeated. Furthermore, there were many companion quests I missed out on because they were all spread apart in this huge main base, and I didn't feel like walking from end to end of the Skyhold castle to talk to them for no reason. This resulted in me not being able to use Cole for the two ending quests. In this way, the camp atmosphere which is very personable of a bunch of adventurers holed up on a trail spending time together is more appealing to me than this large, empty castle. 

As discussed earlier, the best gear comes too late. What I mean by this is by the time you're given unique weapons and armor, you barely have anything to use it against. One example would be the ""Bees!"" crafting material. On the flip side, Corypheus was a very uninspired antagonist: not only too easy of a fight by the time you do, but lacking a motive, looking pretty ugly/ weak in appearance, and lacking charisma. The later betrayals were much more interesting from a storytelling perspective.

I was borderline completionist with this game, but unfortunately there is little reason to do so: the main story quests are dramatically better than the regional side quests. The exceptions for that would of course be the deep roads titan quest, which was a miniature story in its own right. Everything else can be summed up to repetition and fetch quests.

While I did like the swagger of my main character during the cutscenes and main story, I did not like the lack of an option to do be evil, or be a war monger. While I don't usually even do evil playthroughs, I prefer things to be more morally ambiguous/ less guided towards one outcome as it is portrayed here.

Anyways, while this is supposed to have more content than origins, it ended up only being about 10 hours more, with me getting about 100 hours out of both. Not bad, about average for RPG games. Which do I like better? Honestly I probably like Inquisition better. Origins is just a little too ugly graphics-wise, combat felt a little annoying, and I liked the ending/ powers in Inquisition better. Companions were handled a little bit better in Origins, but not much. Both games have their strengths and weaknesses.

I think that all things considered, and especially because I had fun playing this game, that Inquisition gets too much flak, it's a good game. Hopefully with the next game we see the maker's appearance/",1696277728,1696277728,True,0,0,0.486870914697647095,0,True,False,False

But the combat I just don't care for. It's far less RPG than Origin. I think the tactical screen is uncomfortable on pc. It's too zoomed in especially in tight quarters.

The story and Lore Is just Phenomenal. It's honestly the only thing that kept me in. I wanted to do every quest, even if it was just a fetch quest, and most of them are. I just wanted to make sure I had Every option available at the end with dialogue. And the Ending is great. It answers a lot of questions and leaves a great plot for the next game. I'm just glad I completed it now and not when it came out, so I don't have to wait as long for the sequel.

This game is sorta special for me because when I played it on Xbox back when it first released it was after the disastrous Dragon Age 2 and the disastrous (albeit in a different way) Mass Effect 3.
Since I don't count Andromeda or Anthem, this kinda feels like the last true Bioware game that ever existed, and it's almost ten years old now.
For a generation (of people, not consoles) Bioware was the high water mark for the entire game industry in terms of writing in video games and, in my opinion, this game is the last true example of that.

The game differs from Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 in terms of gameplay. They try to strike a balance between having the player engaged in combat actively with action game setups and also having more tactical RPG-lite combat centered around various abilities and character configurations.
For the most part this works out pretty well and has a decent enough flow but it lacks the strategic crunchiness of the first game without having the real intuitive combat of a regular action game. However, my biggest issue with the game overall is that I mostly found the combat to be a boring slog, and I was almost always just looking to get through it and focus on the exploration and story content, which is the real draw of the game for me. 
The other thing about the game that I don't like is just how so much of it can feel like a grind. This is a bit of a double edged sword though, because the game is so big and gives you so many interesting environments to explore. However, in most of those environments you'll be doing fairly boring and pointless missions to acquire resources or mowing down groups of enemies for experience. Having to grind your way to the more interesting parts of the game is the big issue.

Where the game really shines is in the interactions you can have with the companion characters as well as with your main base 'Skyhold.' It's always been Bioware's bread and butter and there's so many interesting things to learn about the various companions you can find in here. Although I have my favorites, none of them are boring. And the game also does a very good job of extending the companion characters you can befriend beyond just the ones you can take into combat with you and also having several interesting characters who live with you at your home base and help you manage all of the non-combat aspects of being the leader of the Inquisition.
I don't know what the term for it is, but I love games that have 'war-table' mechanics like this, or Assassin's Creed 4. You can assign resources to various scenarios that come up which require you to make decisions, but don't involve actual questlines or missions.
The game also dives very deeply into various aspects of the Dragon Age lore, which I was very pleased about, because the well-crafted and deep lore of this universe is really the thing that sets it apart out of all of Bioware's outings. Even though Mass Effect has a very special place in my heart, I gotta say, I think the Dragon Age lore is actually the better world-building.

Although I'd hate to say this as a blanket statement, if you're unfamiliar with the Dragon Age franchise, this game might be your best starting point. There's a lot of systems and things to keep track of, but the gameplay is also a little easier than Dragon Age Origins, and the game is much more polished than Dragon Age 2 (which was a disaster.)",1696026540,1696026540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am disproportionately grateful to BioWare for the adventure. For the risk they took to make the game on a different engine that wasn't designed for RPGs. For courage in mechanics. For the completeness and diversity of the created world. A benchmark to which other companies should strive. Be fearless in decisions for the sake of a quality product.

[b]What I liked:[/b]

1. Expanded customization of the character’s appearance and the ability to change it during the passage.
2. A huge open world with locations varied in weather.
3. User-friendly interface (compared to the first part, where mods failed to enlarge the icons).
4. Innovations in skills of all classes. I liked playing as the robber, Sera, the most.
5. Creation of armor and weapons with detailed color customization. Once you got into the basement, 85% of the items you picked up couldn’t outperform those created in terms of characteristics.
6. Astrariums. Time to get creative. I cleared everything that was along the way. I didn’t complete the achievement because at the end I got confused about which ones I completed and which ones I didn’t. In some places, such puzzles were limited by the number of dots, which became scary, but after a couple of attempts they were connected into a picture.
7. Feeling of strong support from minor characters. How many games lack this! Here, not for a second do you feel like an ox is pulling everything on you. This character will tell you, this character will tell you, he sent people here to carry out the task, and here he received brief information. It greatly contributes to immersion in the game world.
8. Quest “Evil eyes and evil hearts.” The most memorable and unusual for the DA universe.
9. Level of character development. It remains top notch. It was interesting to talk to everyone and choose companions.
10. Dragons. D-r-a-k-o-n-s. The Abyssal High Dragon was frayed due to her inexperience in tactics against such monsters. The Mount Destroyer managed to infuriate him, but the flexibility of tactics made it possible to find control over him. It was very interesting to fight against the higher dragons.
11. Black shop. This is something completely new. Ability to buy items, designs and change appearance.
12. Command headquarters. At first it seemed like it would be useless, until I got involved. Assigning performers from among companions and advisors of various tasks to open locations, receive rewards, influence and/or advance along the storyline.
13. Novel. There is no need to give anything and just talk to the character you like when you have the opportunity to complete tasks for him or go on a quest with him/her.

[b]What turned out to be controversial:[/b]

1. Mount. For some reason the horse feels irritatingly slow. The illusion is created that it is faster to walk in any direction on your own two feet. That’s why I very rarely used my horse, even though the armored skin with horns fell into my heart.
2. Landmarks. They play no role in movement. They only give a piece of information about the location. If everything is put in place, experience is given. Mixed feelings in the end.
3. Shards. Thank you very, very much that achievements were not allocated for them. While you are collecting them, you don’t understand where to use them, until you go to the Forbidden Oasis, where in Solasan you can spend them on passing tests. In general, the profit from collecting is very controversial, except to vacuum up money in the temple.
4. Stormy Coast and Forbidden Oasis. Due to the abundance of mountainous terrain. I realize that making everything flat wouldn't look very good, and I didn't feel comfortable walking around for a long time or trying to climb over the mountain. Inconvenient locations.

I saw the bugs and I know. Imagine how it is possible to thoroughly test such an immense game, and even more so to quickly fix everything, given the engine that is unfriendly for RPGs? This is a lot of work.

Perhaps I missed something. As soon as I remember, I will definitely add to the review.",1645705250,1695850041,True,16,0,0.653650164604187012,0,True,False,False

Very good - I enjoyed the art style. The graphics are very memorable, especially for a game released in 2014. That BioWare of all companies could release such a beautiful game in such a primal time of graphical creation is a crowning achievement.
---{ Gameplay }---
Very good - Depends on what strategy/achievements you are going for. I am very happy they stuck with the strategy of paused and tactical gameplay. Paused gameplay is not necessary to play the game, but you might find yourself wanting to if you want to correctly place your AoEs, or if you play a mage (hell yeah mage mains rise up). All AoEs trigger paused gameplay anyway, but my point is that the tactical camera is completely optional. Outside of pausing to place my dispel on rift openings during the second phase of rifts, I hardly use it, even in nightmare mode. If it is your first time playing Dragon Age, it probably seems outlandish, but it makes a whole lot of sense if this is a continuation. The combat is very fast and immersive with an easy to understand system of gearing. I prefer auto-attack to click-to-attack, but after a few hours this was not a big problem.
---{ Audio/Music }---
Very good - I love the music in this game and fits the themes very well. I especially love the dragon fights for their music, it feels very immersive.
---{ Audience }---
Teens/Adults
---{ PC Requirements }---
Decent - Did encounter a few lag spikes here and there but I wouldn't say it made it unplayable. If you are using mods, it may make some areas of the game inaccessible with endless loading screens. These are usually mods that mess with cosmetics or appearances. I used the ""defined"" appearance mods for a playthrough when I did a mod haul and these would put me in endless loading screens when I tried to access the Frostback Basin or Deep Roads, so just be wary of that.
---{ Difficulty }---
Generally easy - It is the typical BioWare formula that if you want to make a game harder or more challenging, they just give enemies more health or make them do more damage. At least they actually tried with this game in the form of trials. However, having difficulty on hard/nightmare with trials on is where the real problem occurs. It does not make enemies harder or more challenging, it makes them OP. I spent about 3 hours trying to kill the Rebel Mage boss in the Apostate Stronghold in the Hinterlands. Nothing would work, they would barrier themselves and no amount of dispelling or dps could break it. Very infuriating, especially in early game. I would not recommend nightmare and/or nightmare with trials on until you have played the game once and found yourself some decent tier 3/4 schematics you can sync over.
---{ Grind }---
Good - The major complaint with the grind of this game is not that the power system is bad, it is that the levelling system very much depends on doing side content. You will not be rewarded as well as you think from doing the main story. The big chunks of xp come from dealing with the problems of the areas and taking your time. The power system is easily cheesed - if you're in need of power, just go kill rifts and easy fetch quests. It is not hard. But the lack of main story quests make you astounded by the level recommendations of the main quests. They feature huge jumps which, unless you have taken your time, you might think you're flying through the game.
---{ Story }---
Very good - The story of Inquisition felt very true to the Dragon Age franchise with many notable returns of characters from Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2. Inquisition has taken a more modern twist, exploring the Fade like never before and also introducing us to visually stunning locations which we have never seen before, such as the vast climates of Orlais' deserts and the beautiful Val Royeaux. My favourite location is the Winter Palace of Halamshiral. The game focuses heavily on the war between the Inquisition and Corypheus with support of his Venatori and Red Templars. The game allows exploration of major areas of Orlais and Ferelden, with reference operations to southern parts of the Free Marches. The story did feel quite anticlimactic in some areas. When they said ""it's time to defeat Corypheus"", I didn't take as in literally right now and be over in about 7 minutes. The ""archdemon"" was a little underwhelming of a plot point and the entire ending felt rushed or not drawn out enough. But for someone looking to just get on with it and do the important stuff, brilliant.
---{ Dev Responsiveness/Communication }---
Good - BioWare has decided to sunset any continued DLC on the game. It now stands as fully expanded as they intended until the release of DA4.
---{ Updates/Bug Fixes }---
Okay - The devs have made strides to improve the general well-being of the game in the past. The multiplayer has a bug with inviting friends (as of September 2023) and there has been no word of resolution. There is a bug with Barrier, and certain other AoE spells that will rubberband you out of the AoE when activated from paused mode. This is slightly inconvenient when you are trying to barrier yourself to jump from a high place without taking fall damage.
---{ Game Time }---
Depends on your enjoyment - If you are looking to complete just the main story of the Inquisition fighting Corypheus and nothing else, you will be disappointed with the lack of main quests as there are not many of them. If you are looking to collect as much as you can and explore as much as you can, you will have near to 100 hours of fun per run. It is not necessary to run through the game over and over on many alts, as (in typical Dragon Age fashion) you can play as your companions - and there is a companion for each specialisation class in the game. If you are looking to do new playthroughs, there are many different classes, story options, races, romances, and options of dialogue for you to choose.
---{ Price }---
Good - It is worth its price at the moment. I did wait until it was on sale during the Steam Autumn Sale. One run through the game will take you around 80 hours even if you are not collecting everything. Good value for money.
---{ Bugs }---
A few - Minor typos in the war room operation descriptions, but no subtitle typos. There are a few bugs present, such as the miner in the Forbidden Oasis not appearing when you need her, and others like getting stuck in endless loading scenes (especially in the Trespasser DLC with the eluvians). However, the majority of them are self-fixed by teleporting to other areas, or restarts. BioWare have done well to create a game with few bugs - not like them at all.
---{ ? / 10 }---
9/10 - I think this game is amazing. It is definitely not dated and if I didn't know it was released in 2014, I would believe this was a game made in 2018+. Playing the previous games and seeing their contribution to the story makes the effort full circle and worthwhile. I do not have a lot of faith in BioWare as a company, but  Dragon Age has been one of those franchises where the passion is evident. Inquisition left the story on a cliffhanger so I am looking forward to Dreadwolf.

Pros
edit: Use the dragon age keep site if you want to customise the history of your world before you create a character edit end:
Game runs very well and the graphics are pretty damn good even now almost a decade later and unlike previous dragon age games not everything has this weird gray tint to it
The price is worth it, especially right now as its on for less than 5 dollars and it includes all the dlc and will stay on sale til september 25th of 2023
Locations are massive and have a lotta things to go and grab
Romances are solid and some of them might be better than the ones from mass effect
Companions are also great
Boss Battles are pretty good but sometimes even frustrating even on the lowest difficulty
can get rare drops if you wanna use these settings called trials which can add extra difficulty to the game such as making health potions only heal for 1, making enemies stay leveled up with you, making bears Much more dangerous
DLCs are also great with each one being top tier
there 4 races to choose from in this game while in DA2 you could only be human and origins you only had 3
Now the abilities in the game are better than the previous 2 games by far adding 9 class speciallization upgrades 3 to Mage, 3 to rogue and 3 to the warrior classes all with unique abilities which allows you get total of 5 total abilty trees
each enemy type has different resistances for the most part and most enemies have resistances to multiple types of damage mainly being elemental types of damage
there is a new game+ kinda thing where if you want to keep all the schematics you found you can find a golden nug statue which will same all the schematics you found for you create a new save youll just have to go up to the Golden nug statue and click on it and then youll get all those schematics onto your new character which is helpful on higher difficulties id assume
pro/con Game is long and you will probably end up putting up to 50 hours into your first playthrough if not more

cons
The Trespasser DLC shouldve been apart of the base game but its still really fucking good and sets up the next game very well, i wont spoil it though
Unlike origins the beginning of the game is the same no matter which class or race you choose which is extremly disapointing
A LOT of fetch quests that unless you are a completionist you probably wont want to do or youll get annoyed doing
Mounts are useless dont both trying them, its basically just speedlines and weird camera angle that makes it like you were going faster
some fights vs bosses can take quite awhile to kill so be warned you might be there for awhile
Character Creation while it is better than previous dragon age games it still wasnt that good for its time

– graphics choose wisely to be more artistic than realistic, not approaching the uncanny valley and providing an immersive experience on top of being actually top-notch.

I need you to give me the complete sentence, not just the general feeling. There's a dialogue option you can pick in Vivienne's quest that says ""I don't know what to say,"" and what does my character actually end up saying? ""Well...Shit."" I DID NOT WANT TO SAY IT LIKE THAT.

Dragon Age simply can't be like Mass Effect. The only thing Commander Shepard has to worry about is being a decent human being or a complete asshole, and it doesn't even matter because all the alien Stacies will fall for them regardless; my inquisitor has to carefully weigh his every word if he is to get into Cassandra's pants, for crying out loud!!

It uses several hand-crafted maps set in different biomes: jungles, forests, deserts, canyons, mountains, shores, and so forth.

Voice acting and actor performances are the highpoint of BioWare: their VA directing team was legendary.

I've played alpha builds of games that have better camera controls than this. How on earth did this get green-lit? I've barely made it through the tutorial and i already want to refund this game just based on how bad the camera work is. The only thing that might save this game is if the gamepad controls are better, i'll probably update after.

When you think EA/Bioware cant ruin things any more they surprise you with this. It literally plays like they forgot to program half the camera controls. and what is EA/Bioware obsession with rotating the camera? leave some directional inputs alone!! I don't need WASD, Arrow keys, and mouse input to rotate the camera! pick one and leave the rest alone. I know its hard to imagine but game character have been able to move left and right for over 30 years.

Glad i got this on sale, instead of paying full price but I still feel scammed.

EDIT: tried a controller and the game is actually playable now. if you want to play this, use a controller the Keyboard and mouse settings are the worst I've come across. i will not change my review to recommend because this is a PC game/PC-port. i should not require a controller to enjoy BASIC level camera/character controls. Even the camera controls in the settings are so bare bones no amount of tinkering will get it to even BASIC/DEFAULT level of control.

I played all of the dragon age games but I have to say that Inquisition is the only one I ever replayed. A more actionee combat fits the setting and the story and all abilities and progression are cool.

I like the story too. All the companions feel unique with their own personalities and beliefs that you cannot change and have to contend with. That is something so rare in modern gaming.

All the classes play differently and the story of the Inquisitor changes drastically based on what race you are playing as. I replayed the main story of this game upwards of 15 times and I feel like I still have more to discover.

I do think animations in cut scenes could have been smoother even for the time and I would have liked more main story choices. Despite that the game is still great and I cannot wait for dread wolf",1694722670,1694722670,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

2) I played DA2 2 full runs. Although not so good as DA:O, it's still a pretty decent game.
3) Right now, I'm on my first (blind) playthrough and I've spent around 120h, and still didn't finish it. So yeah, even with the annoying EA launcher, the annoying tactical camera, the (false) semi-open-world map, it's still a pretty good game. Maybe not so good as DA:O even in today standards, but far better than DA2.

EDIT: With 300hs played (~180hs in the first run, I did almost every secondary mission and the 3 DLCs), and with a couple of mods in my second run, I can say that I definitely love this game. It made me put on hold on Genshin Impact which I played around 1 and a half year.

A few thoughts about some aspects of the game:

- Lore is deep and amazing.
- Characters are pretty well constructed.
- Plot unfolds at a good pace and has a lot of very good twists.
- If you liked the previous installments, you'll love the references and the return of important characters.
- RPGs aspects are good too. It's pretty fun to build and specialize characters to make them fit in the party.
- Combat is amazing and visually stunning for an almost-10-year-old game. At least at ultra settings and 2K/4K.",1691082473,1694229833,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is slighly better than in da2 but why did they dumb down the tactics 

Whats with only 8 health potions without mods? did they seriously think people enjoy running back and forth to camp after every fight

Why is the tactical camera so restrictive i can barely see anything when using it

The story is decent but could have been much more if they scrapped the open world and millions of collection quests and copy pasted fetch quests.

This game is only worth if you really really like dragon age world and its lore and if you are hoping for a return of hero of ferelden someday.

I saw a review saying "" DON'T HATE THE GAME BECAUSE OF EA DESKTOP"" EXCUSE ME? so I should give a good review for A GAME I CAN'T EVEN PLAY? HOLD MY PUDDLE! 

First of all I played all damn games, I have over 300 hours on this franchise, I had this one with Origin then I bought the steam version on sale to keep all my games here, not to mention the many hours I've played as a kid before being able to even afford games if you know what I mean (jack sparrow style)  I did bought DAI with my little money  as soon as I could for the ps3 when it came out ONLY TO BE SUPER DISAPPOINTED because it was a cash grab with HORRIBLE PORT, TERRIBLE GRAPHICS LOOKED LIKE A DAMN ACID TRIP STUCK ON LOW GRAPHICS!

So GET OFF YOUR DAMN HIGH HORSE, this game doesn't come even close the diversity, complexity, story or even fun you can have in DAO which is A GLITCH SIMULATOR, with A TON of patience I finished that one with around 6521 crashes but it was very fun to play a heavy armor healer mage who wields daggers YOU WISH DAI you freaking wish! ,  this game it is better than DA2 which was rushed by EA but it is no masterpiece! and don't get me started on DA4 which has been recycled like 3 or 4 times and EVERYBODY GOT FIRED many times so yeah EA IS DOING US GOOD right? or the state of The Sims 4 being a DLC Simulator, or the many horrible realises or franchises being ruined by this greedy blood sucking demonic parasite of a company called EA, I'M TALKING TO YOU ANDROMEDA!

EA cares only about money and their stupid game passes! that's the whole reason they made EA DESKTOP. I swear to God I wish I could afford suing them! this should be illegal, Its fake propaganda they are stealing my money by not letting me play something I paid for! they even removed the online support for DAO what will become of the damn progression for this franchise? tossing save files to google drive like a madman?

I got so many errors trying to reinstall this game after EA Desktop, you have no idea, I couldn't sleep, I watched tons of videos, read tons of forums, I'm literally going crazy because some %$%$¨#%%#& decided to force this ""software"" down my throat, it behaves way more like malware than anything else.

After trying to install a ton of DLLs, updating and reinstalling basically every software I have including Direct X, Visual C++ and Net Framework, I read somewhere this issue with launching the game could be happening because EA Desktop is so dumb, it can't launch a game from a different drive, let's say in my case, EA Desktop is at C: drive, but DAI is at D: drive, it won't work, now IMAGINE my surprise while reinstalling EA DESKTOP to my D: Drive only to find out that it is still at C: drive, STUCK THERE, despite me LITERALLY CHOOSING THE INSTALL PATH, it stood there, I tried copying and pasting it to D: drive and guess what THE DAMN CONTROL FREAK WOULDN'T WORK it ran CMD and installed something back a C: Drive, WHAT? I went to some forums and yes, apparently that's how this demon behaves, call a damn priest, the worst of all is that I DON'T HAVE enough space to get DAI back to C: Drive to even TEST the damn theory. 

AT this point I'm 12 hours in, trying to fix this, I reinstalled over 40GB like 7 times and wasted hours trying to find an answer so EXCUSE YOUR SORRY @$$ if I'm giving this a bad review, oh you want a review? here we go:

- Generic gameplay, convoluted plot, side quests are way more interesting than the actual plot and weak villain, weird table mechanic make you waste hours of your life for minor stuff which you can't even get it all with perks so please use mods. Tons of glitches as usual from EA, ( mind I don't say bioware, because they fired everybody HAHAHA)

Do I recommend the game itself? 
Absolutely yes. The maps are amazing, not reused assets like in DA2. 
Your companions are interesting and have their own unique personalities (and quests). 
The story quest is compelling and interesting, yet at the same time encourages you to explore areas. 
There are a lot of ""hidden"" side quests, that only unlock once you've reached certain stages of an area, or relationship for certain groups.
The ability tree for each class type is expanded upon, which means that you don't feel stagnant upon maxing out a certain tree etc.
There some bugs, and I feel like they definitely skimped on the Qunari character designs, but a lot of these issues can be fixed with mods etc.

Definitely play with DLC, though. The DLC is great and fully worth it. The vanilla big bad starts strong but ultimately falls short. The various different races and classes make the game versatile. I fully recommend playing as a Dalish mage, as I felt that was simply the most interesting for how the story went (and also for most of the DLCs).

The only downside is that the game is quite long if you play mostly completionist (I completed almost everything, except unmarked collectibles). I would personally recommend ignoring shards, as they simply are not worth it and are quite frustrating to collect. If playing mostly completionist, I also recommend that once you hit level 15 or so, turn on the trials to scale enemies to your level and half your xp gain, as otherwise you will be massively overleveled and your gear won't be able to keep up.",1693765377,1693765377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But in seriousness, as broken as the EA app in which can genuinely make the game both a hassle to play and mod; I really do believe this series as a whole is one of the best in terms of story, and BioWare as a whole should be remembered for their capabilities in that front! 
The unforgettable bonds you make with the story and characters has followed me for years, and it really hurts to see the app somewhat taint that experience, though understandable with how exhausting it can be to simply just start up the game sometime. (This is very specifically to at least modded games since they changed/discontinued Origins.) 

However, I really hope people can find a way to enjoy this game none the less. The amount of hours I've collectively put into this series over the years, over numerous different platforms is almost shameful, yet I regret none of it. The lore, story, characters, events.. everything has stuck with me for most of my life now - from origins to inquisition.

From the moment you step into the world of Thedas, you're greeted with a grand scale of adventure and choices that will shape the fate of the realm.

One of the standout features of Inquisition is its meticulously crafted world. The landscapes are stunning, ranging from serene forests to treacherous deserts, each brimming with intricate details and a sense of history. Every nook and cranny holds a surprise, whether it's an ancient ruin to explore or a hidden quest waiting to be discovered. The attention to detail is remarkable, making the world feel alive and ready for exploration.

The heart and soul of Dragon Age: Inquisition lies in its character-driven narrative. The diverse cast of companions you gather on your journey is nothing short of remarkable. Each companion is fleshed out with their own personal struggles, beliefs, and motivations. Engaging in meaningful conversations and building relationships with them adds a layer of emotional depth that's rarely seen in RPGs. Your choices in dialogue and actions directly influence how your companions view you and can even impact the outcome of the story.

Speaking of choices, Inquisition excels in presenting players with difficult decisions that resonate throughout the game. Whether it's choosing sides in political conflicts, making moral judgments, or deciding the fate of entire communities, your choices carry weight and consequence. This moral complexity adds a layer of realism and investment that keeps you emotionally invested in the world and its inhabitants.

The gameplay in Inquisition seamlessly combines strategic combat, exploration, and customization. The real-time combat is fluid, allowing for tactical decision-making and the ability to switch between party members on the fly. The inclusion of the tactical camera enhances the strategic element, making battles feel both exciting and rewarding. The expansive skill trees and equipment options provide a wealth of choices for tailoring your characters to your preferred playstyle.

In terms of visuals and audio, Dragon Age: Inquisition excels yet again. The voice acting is top-notch, delivering performances that bring the characters to life with depth and emotion. The orchestral score sets the perfect tone for different moments, whether it's the epic battles or the quiet, introspective moments.

While no game is without its flaws, Dragon Age: Inquisition's strengths far outweigh any minor shortcomings. Its expansive world, rich characters, intricate decision-making, and captivating storytelling combine to create an RPG experience that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to the world of Thedas, Inquisition is an adventure that shouldn't be missed. Get ready to embark on an epic journey that will leave a lasting mark on your gaming memories.",1621409575,1693512211,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The soft punches first. Dragon Age: Inquisition is mostly scavenger hunts and bending over to pick up materials for modest weapon and armor upgrades. I wanted to slay monsters and level up, not pick flowers and run errands.

99.9% of the loot you find are downgrades from what you already have. Painstaking crafting is the only way to get improved gear.

The game is vast, which is great, but there is too little variety in types of enemies relative to its scale. Especially early on, most of the enemy encounters are RNG trash. That aspect does improve over the course of the game and at one point I gave it a tepid positive review.

Deeper into the game when combat gets intense, you discover how half-assed the player character AI is, and I don't mean the tactics. It's much worse than that. The other characters constantly get in the way of the character you are actively controlling, like roadblocks. They sometimes get frozen mid battle where you can't move them at all. When you tell them to hold position, they won't even with AI off. Some of them will charge into battle with AI off and Hold Position turned on. In other words, turning AI off doesn't consistently turn AI off. I feel like Bioware hired pros to do enemy AI, but employed their good buddy ""Jeff"" to do player character AI, not because Jeff is good at it, but because buddy Jeff needed a job and they grew up together.

On top of the horrible PC AI, there is no way to zoom to the character you have activated. You have to scroll the screen over to where that character is, and in the heat of battle hunt down the selected character. When you try to scroll to a different spot on the screen to move them, if there are any objects or features beyond beyond empty, flat land, the game flips out and shows you broken graphics and won't scroll normally. It's borderline unplayable when tactical fighting is required on terrain with features.

I've gone back and forth with my review of this game, finding it boring early on, liking it for a stretch, and ultimately hating it. Kudos to the art department. On that end, it's phenomenal. But gameplay is tedious and in a few long stretches downright boring and irritating.

If you still want to play this game, use a controller. Keyboard and mouse implementation is painful.",1606113055,1693430046,False,2,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Perfect:

- your own beautiful castle (hub) with many people in and a lot to do
- feeling that your actually leading the inquisition and helping the continent
- mission Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts - where you are searching for an unknown assassin on a royal ball (I have never ever played better and more thrilling quest in any other RPG)
- companions and their personalities, talks and quests (my favorite: Sera, Solas)

Good:

- dragon fights
- fade missions
- lore of the world

Boring and bad:

- boring generic quests (including main story missions), boring generic maps, and a lot of filler (this is 90 % of the Game!!!!!)
- average combat
- solving a chain side quest leading to a big secret and/or treasure -  you get a generic reward /or stupid and boring ending (...like all quests of this type will let you down miserably...)

Which is a shame really.

Like, there is a lot of good shit in this game. In terms of audio-video, DA:I still look good (considering what engine it's built upon) and music works perfectly. Writing for the most part is spot on: characters are interesting, dialogues are witty and 'meaty', banter is great and there's tons of deep lore giving a lot of context for the game. Some story moments absolutely slaps (camp after leaving the Heaven or Old Temple in Jaws of Hakkon), main story have some nice pace changes, that brings bit of the respite from hacking and slashing and DLCs that actually feels rewarding. Oh, and hunting dragons is fun.

As to what is wrong... game is bloated. Main story has reasonable lenght, but most of the side quests are just simple and boring 'gather 5 pieces of X' or 'move thing from pont A to point B'. At some point you start wondering, if you're Inquisitor or Postman Pat or other Delivery Joe. It might not have been that bad if that was limited to one or two regions, but no - all of them gives you EXP, Power (currency used, among other things, to unlock main quests) and influence (this, you use to unlock Inquisition traits, such as bigger inventory) for walking, gathering, collecting, and then walking and collecting again, because certain quests unlocks stuff in areas you ALREADY EXPLORED, making you go there and wander around mostly empty areas. AGAIN. (Fuck you, Hissing Wastes, you absolute shit of a map); And you can't even ingnore them completely, because you need Power and Influence to move forward. 
Seriously, this could be another entry in Assassins Creed franchise. 
Another thing: game feels very tunneled towards elves. Yes, game is centered around them and their history, but it should not make the gamers feel they are losing something for not playing elf Inquisitor or using Solas (and lets be honest, Dorian > Solas) without giving much in return. ""Why don't you play the elf next time then?"" you'd ask? Because I don't feel it would make THAT MUCH of a difference. Like, your options are quite limited and while you can be honorable or act like douchebag, it's not like in Pathfinder: WotR, where each mythinc path unlocks unique encounters and dialogue options. In terms of replayability, I can't see much in DA:I. 
Most of the fights feels boring, as you constantly battling groups of exactly same three enemies (unless it's main story lane and game throws some unique shit at you) and lack of proper turn-based mode is noticable when fighting bosses (yes, there is tactical mode but it's not as good as proper TB). 
Writing, which is very good for most of the part, sometimes makes you wonder what the hell is happening here. That is most noticable in Trespasser, where you fighting Qunari: pretty much absent from the main game, they rose as the threat in DLC, making you wonder, when and how did they manage to pull this shit? Cutscenes also can rise an eyebrow: I like that the important ones are fully voiced and animated, but some felt utterly undercut and unrewarding, lacking proper closure, leaving you with feeling of ""like... that's it? THAT'S IT!?"".

OH, AND MODS. I appreciate, that you can play with them for the main game and Jaws of Hakkon DLC (very good one btw), but for the love of Andraste, I spent two hours trying to make Trespasser not to freeze on inventory screen, because for some reason, mods would BRAKE THE DLC.

The different open world maps are beautifully designed and fun to navigate. I ran just about everywhere, did all the random fetch quests just to spend more time with my companions, and overall just had a great time exploring. I personally did not find the new combat system (which felt like a mix of DAO and DAII) that great, but each to their own here. 

I find that a lot of the negative reviews on Steam is because of the EA Launcher, which, fair. It's a pain in the ass, breaks randomly and has to be repaired, and launching the game is unnecessarily slow. Is it worth giving the game a bad review? No. 

The one issue I ran into, was that I played The Descent and Jaws of Hakkon DLC before doing the final mission. I was levelled too high at the time, I think, which made the final boss fight a little anti-climatic. I felt like I spent almost 100 hours in a game that fell a little flat in the end because of it, but I have to say... Trespasser made up for it 100%. This game leaves you feeling gut punched and heartbroken (in a good way) and I can't believe I have to wait for the next one now.

The story is excellent, gameplay is fun in general, I love the companions, and in general it's a game I've been enjoyed. This is truly the culimation of what Dragon Age could be. After being the leader of a small army in Origins, and having your own story in II, to finally be a powerful political figure as the Inquisitor really feels like you've on the top of the food chain. Plus, you're surrounded by charismatic (and hot) companions with fascinating stories. The additions to the lore are amazing, too. I can see why this game won the GOTY.

But the main problem is that the game is overbloated with useless things to do. At some point one has to think what's the point of so many fetch quests and the vast, open, empty world. I'm not a fan of having to do side-quests to gain power to advance anywhere, but that's because I dislike grinding in any form. 

I give it a thumbs up, but it's not my favorite entry on the saga. To say I enjoyed Dragon Age 2 more than Inquisition must say something.

-the game becomes better but still feels mediocre however it continues becoming better the more i play it,until it drew me in


-what feels like the middle of the game is where the game really opens up thats the moment i went wow, from that moment the missions and the characters just drew me in even more 

(!!idk who designed the maps due to the graphics they look beautiful but some of them fk with me, i had a hard a time traversing them because i didnt know how to get to some areas and the way mountains are placed it feels like it was meant to make me fkin mad)

like the clunkiness is because of the game engine but if they had a proper one... even better

Only 4.79 and hour upon hours of content and all dlcs

After downloading the files you download the yucky EA app.  Then restart your computer.  Then link accounts. I still had startup issues and was in the process of requesting a refund when I checked the forums and found a fix (needed to copy some files from one game folder to another). Even after the game launched, It would get stuck on a loading screen.  I had to go through character creation 3 times until the game finally was playable. Stick with it! It's worth it!

Why do I love this game?  

-I'm in a dessert excavation site exploring.  I look down into a valley and see a fenic (fox) running.  2 hyenas (area enemies) jump out of where they were hiding and kill the fenic.     

-There is a cave that has wooden planks blocking it.  There is no way to get around it.  I smash it with my weapon. no effect.  I'm about to move on when I think ""wait, let me try something"".  My archer loads an explosive arrow and blows the barricade away. 

-Some of your troops are captured by a group of barbarians and are being held ransom. They have heard of you being ""touched"" by divine power and insist on meeting you in combat so they can see which god (your or theirs) is more powerful.

-A rival royal family has been talking shit about you.  Do you send your ambassador to smooth things over,  send your commander in a show of force, or send your spymaster to ""politely"" remind them to be nice? 

It's this kind of stuff that makes a game good. It's a vibrant, complex world that is not just centered around you. Even the side quests have sense of accomplishment as you are building your influence and proving your worth to a skeptical people. Sure a quest might be a simple as ""gather 5 refined cotton"" but the cotton is then use to weave better tents for the refuges in your care. I was a little annoyed with the ""gather shards"" quests until I realized those shards are use to open doors in a dungeon.  Now the quest has a purpose!  This simple concept seems to be not understood by many game developers.

 - Graphics are still great, especially for how old it is now.
 - Music is amazing.
 - Environments are stunning and sometimes take some actual thought on how to get around, also they're mostly all huge.
 - VA work is great.
 - Story is good.
 - A lot of side quests to get lost in, with good stories too them.
 - Good continuation of past games stories and call backs to characters you met in the previous games, this makes it actually feel like a real world that is actually lived in.

Cons:
 - Movement is really janky and floaty.
 - The spells/skill trees are just awful.
 - The big environments are great but because of the janky movement on foot or on horse (the mounts are terrible to control) it's slow to move around.
 - It suffers from the same weird occasional shut downs/crashes that all the Dragon Age games have. It's almost like they make the games out of paper - and every so often the paper just rips.

Overall:
This game is definitely worth playing if you've already played the first and/or second game.  If you can look past the janky movement and the lame skill trees I think you'll really enjoy the game.  But it definitely would have been better as solo game and not a game where you have 4 characters to look after, since they're basically just AI anyway.

This is currently the best Dragon Age fanservice game because a lot of choices from past games is reflected in your world which only like 2 other franchises have ever done. Almost a decade old and the graphics is the most beautiful I've seen rivaling Witcher 3 or a modded Skyrim. However (re)playing the game I realized this shit is ass and less fun than a lot of RPGs new or old.

[b] Awful gameplay [/b] - Dragon Age Inquisition was made during a time when they thought bigger world = better game, the map in this game is huge and beautiful. However it's also the most empty barren shit I have ever seen and traversal is actually infuriating. Most of the game you spend walking around because the horse is pretty much the same as your walking speed with the addition of zooming your camera to make you believe you are going faster, you're better off using your class's movement abilities like fade step for mages. It's pretty bearable during the first area of the game but other maps is an absolute snooze fest. The world is so empty that it's perfect for screenshots.
Combat is a mixed bag since it's the same as the other 2 games where they try to mix action and tactical gameplay which don't mix when action feels too slow and tactical feels too fast. Fighting anything feels more like a chore than core gameplay and I'd rather click morally obvious dialogue.

[b] PC issues [/b] - Since the game was mostly intended for consoles cutscenes are locked in 30 fps due to physics and animation not accounting for a higher fps. Even if you unlock the cutscenes with commands it will desync a couple cutscenes. This I feel is very fixable but triple A devs don't like fixing old games. People talk about having EA launcher problems which I didn't experience because my PC and game is setup correctly but nobody likes seperate launchers when you buy a game from Steam. Fuck EA and Ubisoft.

On the one hand, Inquisition is an incredible narrative experience. There is lore all over the game tying together elements of the previous two games and expanding greatly on a lot of the mythos of Thedas. While the main villain is underdeveloped and never quite feels threatening, the game otherwise has a great cast of characters with one of the best late in-game twists I can remember. The final twist is so compelling and transformative for the series, in fact, it'll likely have you desperately running to Google to see when the next Dragon Age game is releasing.

This is also still a BioWare game, so there are a lot of choices that substantially change the world around you. The game does a great job responding to the player's choices, and it's impressive that the world itself at the onset is meaningfully altered by the choices from past games that you can load into the Dragon Age website that then carry into a new playthrough here. There are some expansive branches in the main story dependent on player choices that add a lot to the roleplaying experience.

Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be either in open world exploration or combat. Combat is superficially a tactical experience like Dragon Age: Origins was, but it's oversimplified here. There's still the typical Dragon Age staples of pausing the game mid-fight and assigning actions to party companions, but fights are so simple and fast-paced that you won't actually need to do that usually. Fights actually just amount to moving around a bit and spamming various special attacks on cooldowns. Even then, certain builds are so OP'd that you can sometimes win a fight just with a tank-like warrior. There are really only a few special boss fights where you'll need to pause and come up with a more cerebral approach to battle.

That would be fine enough if the game leaned more into being a full-on action RPG experience like The Witcher 3, but it doesn't manage to be that at all. Melee feels terrible. Weapons like swords barely have collision animations or graphical effects, so you'll feel like you're swinging at air even though damage is technically being registered by the game. As a result, only a mage actually feels fun to control.

Then, there's the open world. It's sometimes just bad. BioWare has prioritized size over content. In certain areas, you'll be walking over vast distances in awkward silence with your party members with nothing but nature surrounding you until you finally encounter the same repetitive sight of a group of demons to dispatch under a veil tear. Otherwise, there's nothing to do in some areas but complete pointless small side-quests where you collect ten or twenty of this or that. It's dull. The better areas in the game involve their own smaller stories to complete with actual characters to talk to and choices to make back in the hub world. That's where Inquisition shines again. Otherwise, the open world too often feels like an MMO that was converted to a single-player game at the last stage of development.

Overall, if someone were to ask me if Inquisition was great or disappointing, my answer would be yes.",1630418384,1691647421,True,0,0,0.484546005725860596,0,True,False,False

Ugly:
-Fetch quest are truly awful and there are so many that you can play the game for actual days and realize you have only done pointless things in a video game that weren't even fun.
-Loading screens are CRAZY long and most likely glitched. I use a fast SSD.

[u]About me[/u]
I've played so far ""Dragon Age: Origin"" (DAO) and skipped for now Dragon Age 2 (DA2). Though, I loved every single character and it was one of the main reasons for my purchase despite some of the criticisms.
Also, I still have yet to finish this game... but my motivation has so far quite vanished.

[u]Story[/u]
The Story in itself would be enough as a standalone, but in my honest opinion (imo), it is a mess.
Even though the manipulation around ""the calling"" might still be according to the first game, the variation in notions and understanding of ""blight"" from the first game to this last one is increasingly annoying. The first game made it clear that ""Blights"" even if not entirely understood, is the corruption of ancient gods as established by the Chantry, that only Grey Wardens can kill due to them being attuned to the Blight. If not, a darkspawn nearby would inhabit the 

But suddenly, we get a new explanation about this corruption coming from the ever so bad and old Imperial (Tevinter) Empire - as goes the motto: every empire is evil - and that they somehow created the darkspawn and continue to create them... whatever you say. They even reside in the council! Of course, Tevinter would ever tolerate Darkspawns - soulless humanoids who can't even speak - among them.

In all seriousness, who fought that would be a good thing to add to the story ? And who fought that making Leliana a misanthropic mass-murdering masterminding spymaster ? The chantry driven Leliana who wouldn't dare kill a fly... Has she been hit on the head or smth or was it rather the character developer (dev).

Needless to say... Characters are a mess and have nothing in common with DAO and even the ""new findings"" around ""darkspawns"" ain't even in the DA wiki because it's a clueless mess.

Still, I wonder what became of the Darkspawns that became increasingly intelligent at the time of the ""Architect"" from DAO.

[u]Open World[/u]
That's probably the only good part about this game. It is huge. Not as huge as [i]Assassins Creed: Odyssey[/i] or [i]Valhalla[/i], but huge enough. There are multiple interesting maps and interactions which are based on your choices and interactions.
Also, the graphic ain't bad neither and is pleasant to look at. Especially abilities have very nice flashy effects.

First off, maps are unlocked through a series of events on the ""War Table"". Through progression in the game, discussions and interactions, you'll unlock a series of different maps across Orlais and Ferelden.

You'll also have the possibility to influence alliances, successions, heirs, etc. and unlock new resources and equipements meanwhile those interactions have low if no not no-impact on the actual story.

Once unlocked, you'll have to travel there and uncover the maps as you kill bandits, etc.

Side note: There is a very useful skill once Skyhold is unlocked which lets you see the points of interests on the map!

[u]Crafting & Resources[/u]
Each region/map has a set of resources which you can use for crafting. Crafting might be interesting enough if you want to optimise your damage a bit, but it won't necessarily do much more.

[h1]Combat System, Artifical Inelligence (AI) and Camera[/h1]
This is by far my main complaint and is the most annoying part.

[u]Camera & Combat[/u]
There are two ways to play this game. Third Person or Tactical. In Third Person View (TPV), you can switch btw. chararacters by pressing the F-keys (F1-F4). However, if you give an input in TPV and you switch, the character won't necessarily do it and if you switch back, all actions he was about take, will be interrupted. Also, it seems there is fraction of a second where the character freezes, so it's best to switch while also having the game in ""pause"" mode.
For big fights, especially against dragons, you want to use the Tactical View. And now the fun part starts... Tactical view has a limited angle... a limited range... and a limited high! Great, you want me to say that it was maybe the same in DAO. Indeed, but it seems that in DAO it was at least 3 times as high and had a 3 times as long range.
In short, you have a fixed camera right above your head and can't even properly aim at the dragon and have to struggle with the camera angle to pin it. Forget about using Tactical View while using a bow... That's just horrendous.

This can be however circumvented by using mods which implies usage of a third party... which is again ridicule.

[u]AI[/u]
This should be potentially an upgrade over the DAO ""IF""-Rule. However, as AI seems limited by the camera range, their action range is much lower and therefor useless in range. The exception would be mages with the usage of shield.

In other words, range is a bit of a pain if you truly want to play for long range engagements.

[u]Combat System[/u]
The combat evolves much around the tactical view for bosses and the usage of abilities. Withe the correct setup, it is possible to nearly one-shot an enemy by using high damage (dmg) abilities and combos.
Combos are basically the usage of different skills in order to trigger a chain reaction. For example, you can freeze an enemy and shatter the ice with an ability. This will trigger extra dmg and throw off your enemy.

But in order to be good in combat, it is needed to understand attributes well. Here, imo, it lacks clarity from the previous games.
Also, the skill trees feel way less intuitive than in the previous game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The game has a flashy, nice Open World Environment. The War Table and the different interactive quests are interesting concepts as you are put into the role of a war lord. Also, the Quest ""Sit to Judgement"" contributes to it as you have to judge people for their past errors.

However, the game has a real lack of coherence with its predecessor DAO - Leliana refers to Zevran as an old friend meanwhile they didn't really get along. A lot of the lore and even the characters don't feel right as from the previous one and feel rushed. Even the Qunari, visually, doesn't sit right if you consider Sten from DAO.

Abilities don't feel rewarding neither. The atmosphere is often lacking. The camera during combat is a huge pain.

It feels as if they tried a mix btw. DAO, Assassin's Creed and Greedfall but does neither correct. It's a clear miss.",1691068389,1691068416,False,2,0,0.518104016780853271,0,True,False,False

Sadly this is the worst game in the series, made by BioWare's newer team, it's not good as the first two Dragon Age games.

The main campaign feels all too grindy, requiring the war table to progress and lots of ""power"" from many side activities, it feels just like Anthem and that's not a good thing. Unlike previous games you can't just play through the main quest, you have to grind.

The classes feel much too limiting, there's way less customization than before, many of the abilities are gone, there's no healing at all, no health regeneration (may be a positive to some) you get 8 potions at the start of each map and that's it. The tactics from the previous games are completely gone, there's no tactics slots, instead you can only toggle which abilities your companions are allowed to cast but you can no longer program them.

And the war table... I absolutely hate it, classic EA turned this into a mobile game with lots of timers, sometimes spanning into the hours leaving you with nothing to do but go randomly kill things or exit the game and come back later. This is completely unacceptable for a single player RPG.

Worst of all is the bugs, there where some minor ones in previous games but there are a lot of major ones here. Characters sometimes t-pose and stand in chairs, sometimes they slide around with no walking animations and this is on the latest patch several years after release. The worst one of all is the dragons, they fly around at super fast speed so you can't catch them, I think it's because the game was meant for 30fps on consoles and not unlocked framerate on PC so more than 30fps breaks things...

I really love this series but I do not love this game... Dragon Age Origins is still the best game and the one I highly recommend. I doubt Dreadwolf will be any better unless BioWare learns from Baldur's Gate 3 on how to make a proper RPG again.",1690680401,1690680679,False,3,0,0.518807590007781982,0,True,False,False

Divinity: OS 2 is a similar example in the sense that they're both tactical party RPG's in an open world fantasy setting, and it blows Inquisition out of the water. Even PoE and WoTR kept my attention more, and WoTR isn't even good.

Forcing myself to push through it just so I can find the actual story that made me love Origins, but if I didn't have that drive, I would've dropped this by now from boredom.

Dropped it completely, I can't handle this Single-player MMO style piece of crap, the characters look awful, which is funny considering Origins looks genuinely better and is the first in the franchise.

After finishing it once i thought the game would be terrible for replayability, but im actually enjoying myself more on the second playthrough, (maybe its just because i learned to ignore the boring and irrelevant quests that i went through the first time LMAO). But yeah a lot of the side quests when you enter a new zone go collect this go claim that like its suddenly a collectathon or something. like who in the right mind think that collecting pieces of rocks fun? 

the game's pacing is also pretty weird compared to DAO, because in DAO they made a great illusion of time moving forward every step you walk. In Inquisition you can see changes, but not as big as what DAO did. It is underwhelming in comparison.

The main villain (Corypheus) is painfully boring and doesn't evoke any sense of real threat at all. Like he is washed up. Its insane considering the fact that the main villain in DAO despite having 0 dialogues came off way more interesting than this shell of a darkspawn loser. His underlings are way more interesting than him (isnt exactly a high bar to begin with tbh)

i think overall i enjoy hanging out with every companions, though I do wish there is like a proper morally grey companion because they dont exist here. It makes sense why, but that i think loses some rpg elements to it. They are all good natured, in many weird and different ways.they are all still very good though.

First is its 3rd person camera. Devs clearly wanted you to experience the huge beautiful landscapes they crafted, and this is where it all goes downhill. The game plays like most CRPGs, meaning automated combat of averege speed with an option to pause and issue commands. You do have an option for tactical camera, but plainly speaking, it's uncooked. The camera is tied to your controlled character and your only allowed to move it a limited distance from said character, on top of that you also need to find the correct pathing (that your character would normally need to traverse) to reach the target you want to view. It's also unusable inside caves and most dungeons since it gets stuck on the ceiling.

Second: the huge landscapes. They are, for lack of a better word, empty. They are littered with mundane activities at every corner. Trash items for you to pick up, respawnable enemies that are boring to fight that drop more trash. Side quests that are typical for MMOs. A lot of books and pages and interactable places of interest. 99% of it all never feels good to find and/or read about. The definition of quantity over quality. And to find most of these you are given the radar ability.
The radar comes into direct contradiction with the intention behind the forced 3rd person camera. Most of your time your going to spam Q and look at your minimap for the highlights without really paying attention to the views around you.

Traversal of the huge landscapes just feels off. There is no sprint and the mount feels like a moving brick. Your best bet is a movement skill. You can also jump... Yes, they added jumping to a game that plays like a traditional CRPG.


Visuals - Good, even by today standarts, but with a lot of bugs.

Sound Effects - Great.

Voice Acting - Good.

Main Story - Neither bad nor great. Serviceable.

Combat - Average.

Overall Gameplay - Plain Boring.

For an RPG of such magnitude this game is a joke. Even mods only make it bearable at best. It does not deserve it's GOTY.

Gameplay:
While the navigation of the open world segments can be confusing or frustrating at times, the style of combat felt fun and interesting. Being able to set up fights tactically and control individual characters in real time was very fun and enjoyable. The choices you make in certain moment flesh out future moments within the game, even to the point of losing your allies if you do too many actions that they find unsavory. Which, while potentially being a hinderance to you, helps the game feel realistic to being a ""ruler"" to a guild within the political scene. 
Gameplay TL;DR: at times clunky, but I enjoyed the experience a lot.  4/5

Story: As I mentioned before, I have not played any dragon age games before this, there was things that I felt I was missing in terms of context, which is to be expected. The game does a good job giving context and background to certain events and characters found within the game, however in certain cutscenes they give pause or dramatic emphasis for certain characters that I can only presume were major characters in previous games such as Origins or meant to be a plot twist based on a past event that I was not aware of. Other than these moments of personal confusion, the story was very interesting and (as someone who had not really known anything about dragon age before this) had me at the edge of my seat for certain moments. The other characters within the game having their own issues and story lines that help influence the world is interesting. While many games have their generic side quests based to give context to characters, being able to watch them properly struggle with issues such as strained family ties due to identity, choosing between blood family vs found family, addiction, and corruption within a group [spoiler] fuck the templars [/spoiler].
Story TL;DR: Good Story, was missing context if you didn't play past games: 4/5

Other Small things 

– Game gave me a D&D feel. Being able to create a character and class and then eventually developing and choosing a subclass felt nice and fun. Gave the game some additional replay-ability. [spoiler] Biiiiig fan of the Reaver Swordsman and the Knight-Enchanter Mage [/spoiler]
– Romancing NPC's and having some locked behind queer blocks (some are are straight, some are gay, others are Bi/Pan, hell one is only available if your exclusively an elf.) Also, positive transgender representation, and first ever FtM character in a video game.
– fuck EA and their required launcher for the game, its annoying and honestly its annoying whenever a game forces you to get a separate launcher outside steam.

Playing through this game has been like looking at a trainwreck happening and that is your carrot throughout, where does all this take us? where does it lead?, to fuckville is where.

The combat is boring, and i played a mage, i heard melee is even worse.
The spells you get and the skill trees are simply put; not good. For example there is one skill that activates if you stand still for 3 seconds and once it activates you regen mana 60%~ faster, but considering that your character moves when it casts spells and gets knocked around a lot from a whole slew of different things, this skill becomes nearly useless, and the passive mana regen barely feels like anything at all because of that. And thats just that one skill, all the other spells and skills have similar annoying things that prevent you from having fun, it always holds you back.

The story is meh, it feels very 2014, halfway through the game i pretty much started to skip all dialogue and text that popped up, it was not good, and i cant believe there was a bioware tag on this game. it did come out before all the other bioware controversy after all.

From lvl 1 to lvl 27 (i think i reached), the same gear drops over and over, i actually stopped looting because of it, the crafting system is confusing and feels tacked on, and nothing you can make is better than that staff you got at lvl 5. But back to the lootable gear, at lvl 1 you can pick up a ring with 30% ability damage or duration, guess what you get at lvl 27, a ring with 30% ability damage or duration, it's the same damn gear throughout, sure, bosses drop a little bit different gear, sometimes you can actually get a staff upgrade with 5 more damage, even if the item level gap is 15 levels.

The game holds you back.

well, i dont want to sit here and write about all the other negative things about this game of which there are MANY.

It gets a 31% enjoyment score which is 5% higher that DA2 (26%), but 30% lower than DA:O (61%).
A score i probably only give it cause of two things:
1. it looks VERY nice compared to the first two games, especially over the cartoonish DA2, and the (even when it was released) dated look of DA:O.
2. the fun romance routes.",1689973127,1689973127,False,3,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The abilities were alright, but nothing at all that makes for an interesting build or fun to battle with really, it felt clunky at times. The mount was cool, but felt more like an aesthetic change rather than an actual mount that helps you get to point B faster. I had this vague feeling throughout that they were trying to imitate the witcher 3 somehow, but if i'm not mistaken that came out later.

The story and the characters were alright, but not as good as the previous ones. This game has a lot to offer in terms of quests and exploration. Some of it feels repetitive, and i kinda rushed through the main story due to that. I will definitely come back to experience more of it, but it needed to be something organic and not forced.

Combat: Buggy as hell and boring. if you are melee have fun your character will struggle to path into a suitable zone to hit enemies often humping the air trying to find a valid hit location. Along with the odd need to hold the attack button which just seems out of place. The skills are generally bland. being different forms of slap him in the face with nothing really special... the most interesting skill in the game is the magic missile barrage and thats about it.

Story: Um... how does this plot even make sense... it's like the actions of the previous games needed to be hand waved to make this game work. The OG warden is poofed on a magical quest. And Hawke just shows up to potentially be killed by a forced choice picking on of two characters based on previous actions... why? Why can you just kill of a character like that it's like they are trying the ME1 ashly or whatever his face was choice again but the choice is kinda obvious depending on who is there.... The rest of the plot basically implies everyone is an idiot and has no idea that they have bigger problems then really minor local issues? Not to mention the corruption that affects the factions at times seems foolish or forced... like the Grey wardens aren't that moronic right? or the templars? like seriously... the forced plot is just dumb like they forgot how these factions work.

Characters: Well this is hit and miss you have good ones like Bull, Cass, lilliana, and Varric but then the rest of the cast either falls into forgettable or just plain bad and badly written. Not to mention any returning characters seem to be only minorly effected by previous games... again hand waving the past.

Gameplay loop: It's just bad. The world is full of fetch quests that put og wow to shame for how dry they are. collect this, kill that, or find this thing. there is nothing more complicated then a box check on a side mission and there are tons of these and you can't avoid them all because of the power system needed to unlock new maps along with the bad leveling pacing at an exceptionally slow rate... speaking of the maps...
The maps are massive... but empty. Filled with nothing. you can unlock an area for a main mission only to find it basically contains fetch quests and at the end of it a no joke 2 minute story dialogue for you to then be forced to unlock the acctual story map.

Another is literally placing flags in predetermined areas all over the area which isn't hard it just takes too much time and is severely tedious... All activities require no brainpower or uniqueness.

In Dragon Age: Inquisition you become the savior Thedas once more. You are the Inquisitor, tasked to save the world from the massive breach in the sky, a huge tear in the veil that leads into the fade, where demons and maker-knows-what pours out of it. You play as an unfortunate bystander caught in the middle of an evil plot conjured by a would-be-god creature who calls itself The Elder One.

The reason why I adore this game so much is because in Inquisition you have so much freedom to create the character you wish to be. It doesn't have elaborate origin stories that fill in the empty gaps like origins did, nor does it limit you to a specific character of a specific race with a specific last name, *cough* Dragon Age 2 *cough*. It gives you enough freedom to create without being too restricting with a full backstory, so you can create full story yourself how you see fit in your mind.

You can play as a Human, Elf, Dwarf or Qunari, Inquisition being the first game in the series that allowed for the player to play as one of the horned oxmen. It truly has a great character creator, though there is a few negatives about it that many of the fans have brought forward. The character creator plops your character in the fade, which is very green hued, so creating accurate coloring to what you want can be a challenge. Bioware is also known for a very poor choice in hairstyles, but I believe they did a better job in this game than the previous ones.

I am a huge fan of the whole series, but Inquisition just has something that I can't deny, it was everything that I hoped it would be when it was released in 2014 and I still believe it holds up very well storywise and graphically. The gameplay is something that they could have done better at, but Inquisition was a huge improvement on the previous games in my honest opinion.

It's a game that I love, it's a series I can't say no to, and I've purchased this damn game multiple times so far. It's absolutely a fantastic piece of modern media and I definitely can recommend it to any RPG fans. If you wish to get into the world of dragon age, I do recommend starting from the very beginning, at Dragon Age: Origins, but don't be afraid to just jump into this third game as well, you'll learn most of what has happened along the way!",1689278587,1689278587,True,4,0,0.543081402778625488,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age: Inquisition is a role-playing video game where players take on the role of the Inquisitor on a quest to save the world of Thedas from a catastrophic event. 

The game starts off with a massive explosion at the Temple of Sacred Ashes during a peace conference between the mages and the templars, two factions at war. The explosion opens up a tear in the sky known as ""the Breach,"" which allows demons to invade Thedas. The player character, who was at the conference, is the only survivor and is mysteriously able to close these rifts.

The Inquisitor, believed to be chosen by the divine, is then entrusted to lead the Inquisition, an independent organization determined to stop the person behind the chaos, Corypheus. Corypheus, a Magister of the ancient Tevinter Imperium who was banished to the Fade (an alternate realm inhabited by spirits and demons), is bent on becoming a god and reshaping Thedas in his own image.

As the Inquisitor, players must make decisions and build relationships with other characters who join the Inquisition as companions. The Inquisitor needs to gather resources, alliances, and influence to strengthen the Inquisition's standing against Corypheus and his forces. The game's plot heavily depends on the player's choices and can lead to different outcomes.

The final confrontation with Corypheus takes place at the Temple of Sacred Ashes, where the story began. Depending on player choices throughout the game, different allies will come to aid during this battle.

Once defeated, peace is restored to Thedas, but the story doesn't end there. The Inquisitor and the Inquisition might face other dangers and adventures depending on additional game expansions and downloadable content.



Dragon Age: Inquisition holds a special place in my heart, and I firmly believe it is an exceptional game that deserves recognition. While I acknowledge the criticisms raised by some BioWare fans, I find that the game's remarkable cast of characters, captivating main story, and consequential branching narrative make it truly stand out. One of the highlights is the cause-and-effect system that constantly keeps you on edge, contemplating the outcomes of even seemingly minor decisions. It's both exhilarating and terrifying, as even a small choice can have surprising repercussions, such as upsetting the sensitive Cole.

Let’s break that thought down. Inquisition offers you the choice of adhering to one of three main combat styles: rogue, warrior, or mage. Rogue has two subcategories, dual daggers and bow, while warrior is split into two-handed weapons and sword-and-shield. There’s just one kind of mage at the start, which brings us up to five distinct classes. Your starting party consists of a mage (Solas), a sword-and-shield warrior (Cassandra), and a bow-using rogue (Varric). You’ve essentially got one tank, and two ranged characters that are a mix between DPS and support. 

for the first time, in Dragon Age: Inquisition, the series' Qunari race — both male and female — will be playable, joining humans, elves and dwarves. Players will be able to assume direct control of their followers and have a wealth of combat options available to them.


From the outset, Inquisition impresses with its diverse combat styles and class choices. Whether you prefer to wield dual daggers as a rogue, stand tall as a warrior, or harness the power of magic as a mage, the game offers flexibility and distinct playstyles. While the combat may initially seem lackluster, especially in the first 20 hours, it is worth persevering. The early-game enemy encounters might lack variety, but once you unlock proper builds and delve deeper into the game, the combat system becomes incredibly versatile and rewarding.

The true brilliance of Inquisition's combat lies in its tactical depth. As you progress, each character gains access to a wide range of abilities with separate cooldowns, allowing for strategic and synergistic combinations. With four party members, each with their own arsenal of abilities, tactical combat becomes a mesmerizing dance of calculated moves and precise decision-making. The freeze-frame moments in combat enable you to assess the battlefield, plan your actions, and execute strategies with meticulous precision. From setting traps and exploiting vertical advantages to unleashing devastating attacks and raising fallen foes, the possibilities are immense.

While the combat system may take some time to fully blossom, it is a testament to the game's depth and complexity. Once you embrace its intricacies, the tactical combat in Dragon Age: Inquisition becomes an exhilarating experience, akin to playing a strategic game of chess where every piece moves simultaneously.

Moreover, Inquisition excels in its narrative, characters, and immersive world-building. The rich lore and engaging story draw you in, while the well-written and expertly voiced characters add depth and emotional resonance. Each companion has their own distinct personality, motivations, and backstory, allowing for meaningful interactions and relationships. The dialogue is brilliantly crafted, making every conversation a delight to experience.

The graphics of Dragon Age: Inquisition still hold up remarkably well, and the attention to detail in the game world is awe-inspiring. Exploring Thedas feels like a journey of discovery, as you immerse yourself in its lore, uncover hidden secrets, and forge your path through a beautifully crafted universe.

With its endless replayability and the ability to shape your story through choices and character customization, Dragon Age: Inquisition offers a gaming experience that remains fresh and captivating. The game invites you to explore its vast world and engage with its multifaceted narrative time and time again, offering new perspectives and outcomes with each playthrough.

In conclusion, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a remarkable game that deserves recognition for its exceptional storytelling, memorable characters, and intricate combat system. While the combat may take time to reveal its full potential, the rewards are well worth the initial investment. The dialogue, combat, characters, and immersive world combine to create an experience that lingers in your memory long after the credits roll. I highly recommend giving this game a chance and immersing yourself in the epic journey that awaits within Dragon Age: Inquisition.",1689259624,1689259624,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Being GOTY, I expected this game to be really good, but I was disappointed by the gameplay. In the beginning it didn't feel like anyhting was wrong, but the more I played the more exhausting and boring it got. In spite of having decently designed skill trees and gear system, the combat never felt very satisfying, and just didn't seem to not flow well and felt clunky throughout. I always felt like getting it over with just to see what happens next. Which brings me to the good part of the game, which is the story, lore and characters. I was pleasantly surprised by how in depth the dialogues could go into certain topics and how the themes of politics and religion were handled. Every character was really well written and encountering new dialogue always felt exciting (Cass and Varric's interactions were gold). Of all things, the lore took the cake for me. I will definitely recommend reading up on the previous games (DAO and DA2) to enjoy this to the fullest. The lore enhances the characters interactions by a lot and gives a much better sense of what's happening. The main quest itself is good but the villain felt like a chump by the end which was weird. Fortunately the DLCs were awesome (especially Trespasser, its mandatory for the best experience). All in all, it was a great game, but the gameplay could've been better and maybe the game could've been a bit shorter, as there is a lot of good but not worth it side content that eats a huge chunk of time to get through (my total playtime is for 100% completion). Overall 7/10.",1689197195,1689197195,True,10,2,0.607532203197479248,0,True,False,False

The story is uninspired, the characters mostly forgettable. Someone went through the churn and the motions, but this game has no soul.
It is a rushed production, trying to recapture the charm of the first (still flawed) title, ends up in a game I am pretty sure the actual developers never really cared about.

The EA authentication server sometimes is down or malfunctions, for something that should not require an internet connection at all.
The pseudo-open world is dense of quests and things to collect that are all of no interest whatsoever.
It is a collect fest of pointless things, that require some frustrating and badly designed platforming, with a large number of invisible walls that block otherwise perfectly sensible paths.

The quests pile up in such a way as to lose all meaning, one has to jump from quest to quest and the story skitters around.
It is still fun to play in terms of killing everything around, and complete tasks for its own sake, can be played with the brain off just following the quest markers. For completionists, it has a lot of content to offer.

The game is a mix and mash of genres, with Open world elements, ARPG, as well as TRPG, a bit of housing with a Castle to build and decorate...

As an ARPG, the combat is enjoyable, although at some point repetitive. It is buggy though, your controlled character gets sometimes randomly teleported, _especially_ if you try to be clever with the positioning. Sometimes your area of effect spells will just not trigger, or the character stops moving altogether.

The loot does not always spawn where the enemy is killed, but in random positions roughly in the same area.. the game is full of extremely weird things like that, which I ascribe to just lack of polish, scope creep, not enough time dedicated for QA.

As a TRPG, pressing T to go to tactical mode is sometimes required for some quests (so painful), but otherwise the controls are so terrible (PC), that you'd never want to use this in combat, you'd rather have your companions die than trying to get the interface to behave.

As a CRPG / RPG experience it fails to create any meaningful experience. For better CRPGs with a similar story, I would recommend Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. It has its own flaws, but compared with this title it is a masterpiece.

If instead you are intrigued by the Dragon Age Lore (the lore being probably the best feature of the series), the first title (Origins) is the game to play.

In conclusion: this game has a lot of content (and genres) mashed together, which fail to combine into a meaningful experience. For completionists, it might be interesting just for the sheer amount of quests and items to collect, for everyone else it is basically a chore.

About 170 hrs put into the game.

I purchase DA:I because I've played the earlier games and because it's Bethesda. The game was ok and good enough to recommend even today, but there are a few things about the game that drove me crazy and stop me from giving it a higher recommendation.

What I liked:
Classic Bethesda character interactions and banter between NPCs
Massive scope of game with reasonable character progression.
I didn't start to feel really powerful until level 20+, and even then many dragon battles were tough.
I put in 170 hrs and still could put in 100 more to get to 100% completion... but I won't.

What I disliked:
Invisible walls. Lots of them. I'm trying to take a shortcut over the mountains and then ""boom"" invisible barrier blocks me. I hate that shit.
Jumping puzzles. Well maybe not ""puzzles"" but this isn't a game of Mario. I don't want getting someplace to involve jumping along a thin wall to reach my goal.
Locks: I know you guys want Rogues to be special but locked doors are just stupid in any game like this. If I can't ""magic"" a locked door open I can just break it down with force. I get it - - it's for game progression. But it's a stupid mechanic and the Devs can do better.
Magic barriers: As Locks above, there are times in the game when you use magic ""veilfire"" or just ""random magery"" to rebuild bridges or move rocks. But you can only do this when the game lets you. Other times you just can't ""magic"" things except in combat. Idk it just breaks immersion and is an annoying mechanic.

The good parts are the writing, plot, and it looks pretty. Also it's nice to see characters from Origins and 2 popping up.

The bad parts almost all relate to the combat and UI though. I've not tried it with a controller, perhaps I'm too old and insistent that I play a PC cRPG with a mouse.
- menus just feel bad and can ignore clicks at times, pretty sure they're meant to be navigated with a controller
- The moment to moment movement controls are awkward, I'd much prefer to right click places to move to like in previous games. I don't know what jumping actually adds.
- The quick bar is limited to 8 actions/spells, with absolutely no way of casting a spell you didn't bind during combat. You need to re-bind the quick-bar, in another awkward menu, per encounter as you can't do it during combat. The game also never warns you that it's better to specialise tall rather than wide in this way.
- Can't just auto-attack, so you have to sit there holding a mouse button while hit point sponges die, just annoying
- You can do some of these things in tactical mode but the camera is utterly dreadful and doesn't scroll out far enough making it even more unpleasant.
- In the end all the tactics feel very shallow, no support/healing classes, most the spells have been switched down to basic offensive ones that aren't all that interesting. Even 2 had plenty of spells for moving enemies about for zones of control.
- Also quite a lot of the quests have quite boring design of just go kill/collect a lot of things, very grindy. So they're not fun either more of a chore.

- Skills are boring. Compared to DA:O which had all manner of status effects, in DA:I, if you are cold, you freeze. If you are lightning, you shock (freeze but dark blue). If you are fire, you ""panic"" (freeze but red).
- Itemization is boring. Nothing about equipping new gear feels impactful and navigating the menus across all 4 characters is laborious. 
- You never need tactical view. Sure maybe on higher difficulties, but given the skill depth is so shallow I imagine this boils down to micro management rather than any actual interesting tactical gameplay. On standard difficulty you just don't use it, which is a real shame. 
- Loot/crafting is boring. A ton of containers that just have rubbish and don't feel good to loot. After 4 hours of looting everything I couldn't make anything meaningful. 
- Superfluous ""war table"" mechanic.

All in all, the game play looks cool and there is a lot of good foundation, but it is let down by the fact there is very little strategic decision making.

Despite me not really enjoying DA:O or DA:2, both of them were serviceable enough to at least finish a playthrough, taking about 50 hours of time in total between the two.

But this game I dropped after close to 8 hours. 

DA:O was serviceable because it had strong pros that outweighed numerous cons. DA:2 was bad, but benefited from a very short run time. This game is everything I hated about DA:2 bloated into absolute oblivion. This game is a typical Ubisoft-type open world affair, your map is scattered with hundreds of collectibles and boring, soulless side quests with a main story that was somewhat interesting but not engaging enough to make me want to keep going. The idea that I had another 40, or potentially even 100's hours left of this just made me not want to continue.

I've read other reviews that complained this game was like a single-player MMO. I figured these people were just exaggerating but no, that is seriously how this game feels when you have some crazy world-ending threat happening and you are collecting 10 wood for a villager or 5 furs for a camp in the snow.

The game is also open-world so you will be spending a lot of time traveling to and fro on a horse. Maybe I'm just jaded by other games that do horse traversal better but it seriously feels so clunky and bad in this game, it just looks laughable, and this is how you will be getting to most areas of the map before you can fast travel to them later.

Overall, I can't recommend this game, or the Dragon Age series in general even though I'm a huge fan of fantasy RPG's and even Bioware's other games like the Mass Effect series. It's just not good.",1688744580,1688756197,False,6,2,0.540780842304229736,0,True,False,False

DAI is more of a fairy tale, with clearer lines between friends and foes, the conflict takes place outside of your inner circle - everyone in your team loves and respects you just because. Like Game of Thrones vs Lord of the Rings.

+ The story is great, rich lore
+ A lot of things to do
- It's a console game, the interface isn't made for PC, the # of skills you can use is limited to fit a gamepad, etc :(
- Battle mechanics deserve improvement
- Your progress from previous games isn't imported like in DA2, rather you have to manually set it up on the website
-  Character creation process could be improved (the lighting isn't good, you can't save to reuse later, there is a big trunk of cutscenes before first save - if the game crashes in the process, like in my case, you'll have to do everything from scratch)
- Dragon battles are insufferable, as your companions will insist on ignoring the ""hold position"" command and run into AOE, also they get tangled in terrain there.
- The EA app !!!!
- Potential partners for romance are generally picky about sex/race, you'll be able to flirt, but it won't advance, and the game won't hint why in any way. Your actual options for each sex/orientation/race combination will be limited to ~2. Checking their preferences in a guide beforehand might save you from some disappointment.

1222690,141458846,76561198202249319,0,4,362,0,362,1688655298,"(TL:DR at bottom)

I have spent the last few weeks revisiting the Dragon Age franchise, having only played Origins previously. I read on a forum that the save I had in DAO, and the Decisions I had made altered the lore and history of the subsequent games. This revelation lead me to purchase both DA2 and DAI.

I was genuinley interested to see the way the world would look, and how what I had personally done would affect it. In DA2 I was very glad with how the Origins playthrough influenced my time in Kirkwall. Meeting king Alistair, interacting with characters who i had a hand in saving, hearing of Isabela's experience with the hero of Ferelden, are things that come to mind. 

The story of these two games function in virtually the same way: You start as a nobody and almost by chance, you find success. Being recruited to the gray wardens or being hired by a mercenary company in DAO and DA2 respectivley. 
This very much illustrates the fact that you, the player, exists in an already occupied & active world. The world does not revolve around the player. 

This makes becoming powerful and renowned feel much more rewarding, and the challenging combat makes it feel as if the world is doing everything it can to stop you. Being declared the Hero of Ferelden or the Champion of Kirkwall feels like a genuine accomplishment. You've made all the right decisions and you've managed against so much adversity.

The gameplay / combat are both simple, yet difficult. With hard to defeat opponents, but easy to understand abilities and controls.
dodging and falling back to more advantageous ground are essential for survival, especially against Bosses. you can engage / disengage very quickly, easily and effectivley. You rightly feel that you made good tactical decisions to win.


Dragon Age inquisition cannot compare to its predecessors. If you (Like me) go cold into Inquisition after having played DA2 nonstop, the sheer contrast jumps out at you. It feels like a completely different franchise.

For starters, to continue the story you have to register on Dragon age keep, and manually pick out every major decision you've made for the past two games. and if you, like me, have over 30 hours in both of those? it's kinda hard to keep track of everything. They have a little interactive movie that looks like it was made by a 13 year old on flash in 2009, where you can alter the story while it's being told. Pretty neat, and probably helpful if it didn't freeze every 2 minutes.
It's especially frustrating to deal with this when the transference between DAO and DA2 was completely effortless. Just clicked a button on start and BOOM: Everything was taken care of. I realize that many people had issues and bugs with the original system, but to remove it entirely?

The Story functions very differently. Instead of using the prologue as a genuine introduction to who you are, what you're doing and why you're doing it; your background is completly covered by a single paragraph upon character selection. The prologue is the same, no matter who your character is. You are thrust into a world where you immidietly just become the solution to a HUGE global problem. No buildup, no introduction. You are just the main character within the first few minutes of gameplay. It takes the Skyrim approach, rather than a Dragon Age one.

The Gameplay itself is completely different. It's a game built for console gameplay and that fact sticks out like a sore thumb. Manually attacking, clunky movement, bad targeting system, akward camera, movement ONLY available with WASD, etc. The mouse is for some reason still used for interacting with the world, but not for movement; so if you were to want to loot a fallen enemy you have to physically walk up to them and THEN RMB on it. I know it sounds minor but being able to right click to move was crucial to combat in the earlier titles. for example, if you had 2 ranged in your party and they were both being attacked by melee, you would simply pause the game and move them both simultaneously, all the while  coordinating a distraction for the enemy. That is simply not possible in this game. 

It really feels like im playing SWTOR or some other MMORPG, not the Dragon Age franchise i fell in love with. I really do think it's tragic that I can't enjoy this game like i could the others. The only thing that's keeping me playing is my nostaliga and attachment to the Story.


(TL;DR) 
As a standalone console game, im sure it's fine. good, even. But it doesn't compare in the slightest to older titles. If you play PC, and have played the other installments of DA, I don't reccomend this game.",1688660077,1688660077,False,2,1,0.508130073547363281,0,True,False,False

A bit too much of unnecessary time-consuming stuff (looking at you, wartable) turns this game into a comletionist's nightmare. Beautiful giant locations with nothing to do but a fetch quests (hinterlands and hissing wastes can burn). Difficulty balancing are not very good too. Also, AI aren't smart.
Now to the good stuff: the locations ARE beautiful and interesting to explore. The difficulty balancing can be tweaked by turning trials on and off and going for example all damage dealers suicide squad with some guard slapped on top.
The party banter is fun and companions are nicely written. All classes have a distinct playstyle.
Replayability 2/10 because no way i am ever going into the hinterlands again.
Probably better to buy it on sale.

dragon age: inquisition is a action-adventure RPG developed by bioware and published by EA, and it is the third mainline entry in the dragon age series, following dragon age: origins (2009) and DA:2 (2011). bioware initially was going to either create a new IP after DA2, or make a sequel to jade empire (2006). however, bioware wanted to address a lot of the negative feedback from DA2 as it was generally viewed as a major step-back after the overwhelming success of DA:O. they figured the dragon age franchise had more 'consumer awareness' around it than jade empire did, due to it having two games compared to the single jade empire game, and the first dragon age game alone was much more popular than jade empire. they also felt a new IP would be too large of an undertaking after they had tried numerous different things over the last decade or so. development on DA3 began in 2011 after development on DA2 ended, with most of the conceptual phase coming throughout 2011 until full-on production began during and throughout 2012. they wanted the game to release sometime in late 2013 but during that summer they delayed it to 2014 at E3 2013. eventually they announced that the release date was october 2014, but then had an additional delay of about six weeks, pushing the game's release to late november 2014. 

it features more of a semi-open-world style that put way more emphasis on exploring than there were in the previous two games, especially DA2 which overused the same handful of environments and it was a pain after like 15-20 hours of gameplay. instead of one big gigantic world to explore, they instead opted for many different hub worlds of varying styles and aesthetics. they really wanted to have fans play DA3 and think bioware had finally figured it out, as the massive backlash of their two previous games (DA2 and mass effect 3) made them want to really cater to what the fans wanted. they tried to take the best parts of each of the first two dragon age games and combine them into DA3's gameplay loop. for instance, they decided very early on to bring back a lot of features from origins that were missed in DA2 like the tactical view. they also brought back the choice of different races (four races in this game compared to three races in origins with you being forced into being a human for DA2), which was a sorely needed feature. they also tried to cater more to console players, which is something they did take from DA2 as that was a big focal point of that game as well. 

due to the fact that they changed the way the gameplay loop worked with the semi-open world hubs, they had to overhaul how they typically came up with the story. they felt like early on in development, they had found a nice balance between story content and quests, and adding things like collectibles and side content. however, i think they ended up padding the playtime out with way too many of the collectibles and pointless side stuff. the dev team thought DA2's story lacked clarity but i think they still were lacking while making the story for inquisition. there weren't as many main missions as i'd like, especially when considering the fact that they padded a LOT of content in the game, it's just a lot of lame side quest stuff and collectibles instead. it was definitely less nuanced than origins was. definitely not bioware's best work when it comes to the story/writing. 

while i think they did a pretty good job incorporating the best elements of the first two games like they originally intended, i think the decision to try and cater to a more casual/console audience, which ultimately led to them adding too many ideas from DA2 as opposed to DA:O, which is insanely better in my opinion. all three games are good, but DA2 is really only decent while DA:O is great. DA3 is kind of in the middle, although it's closer to origins than DA2. i bought this for 88% off, which has the game cost less than five dollars, which is an absolute amazing value for a deep and fun 2014 RPG from bioware. you definitely don't need to have played the first two games, either. definitely wait for a sale and grab this and you will definitely be putting in over 100 hours total when you're all said and done with this game.",1688262793,1688262793,True,1,0,0.485011786222457886,0,True,False,False

Modding is a fucking nightmare, on top of the ridiculous ea launcher needing custom handles, so does origin, and steam etc.. and the game has 2 modmanagers that each use different mod formats and requires HOURS of decompression, hand merging, and recoding just to convert to the manager you want to use on top of half a dozen 3rd party softwares you need to install and learn just to do it. So getting fixed with mods? NOPE, not gonna happen

I can not recommend this game on PC to anyone at anytime. Also the canonical ending, is in a DLC post game, not the absolute SLOG of a game itself

Cons 
- Potato graphics at highest setting, 
- Multiple launchers needed to play because EA hates gamers, 
- nigh impossible modding so getting fixes or graphical from the community is more tiring then getting 900+ skyrim mods to work at the same time flawlessly
- the ending is behind a 12 hour dlc that you do AFTER the already slow and bogged down mediocre campaign (played it on console, thought PC would be an improvement, I was wrong)

Pro's
- nope. none. it's worse then DA:O in every conceivable way from graphics, to story, to just launching it. Fuck frostbite and fuck EA get a lore video on youtube and watch that before DA:4  or better yet, just drop the franchise and find something that was made with heart and the consumer in mind

Ah, Dragon Age: Inquisition, where do I even begin? This game is an absolute blast that has managed to captivate me for over 327 hours on Origin and now an additional 209 hours on Steam. As a seasoned connoisseur of video games, I can confidently say that this gem from yesterdecade still holds its ground and remains a shining example of what a well-crafted RPG should be.

The sound design as a whole is meticulously crafted, enhancing the overall immersion and making every step in Thedas a joy for the ears.

What truly sets Dragon Age: Inquisition apart, however, is its impeccable dialogue. The writing in this game is nothing short of perfection. From the rich lore to the complex and memorable characters, every conversation feels meaningful and engaging. The choices you make carry weight and consequence, making you feel like a true decision-maker in this sprawling epic. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life with nuance and authenticity.

Despite its age, Dragon Age: Inquisition has aged like a fine Orlesian wine. The game's technical prowess remains impressive even by today's standards, with a level of detail and polish that many modern titles strive to achieve. The seamless blending of exploration, combat, and narrative keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, ensuring that every hour spent in Thedas is a delightful adventure.

In conclusion, Dragon Age: Inquisition is an absolute must-play for any discerning gamer. Its stunning visuals, breathtaking soundtrack, perfect dialogue, and enduring appeal make it a timeless masterpiece.

First all you should know that I absolutly reccomend this game ! (You should even start with DA Origins then DA II as both choice will impact your run on DA Inquisition). The story, the lore and the characters are amazing and quite complete. The open world is really nice too, despite you can find your character/mount a bit slow and few round trips, and for those who are afraid to play a game that will soon blow his 10 candles, don't worry, its graphism are still amazing.

Then why did I check the ""you do not recommend this game"" mark ?
Easy : EA
When I first started my run I was carefree, after 60h I was nearly at the end of the game (1 last quest) and thought of my next run and different choices I could've do.  Problem : the game stopped working overnight. by checking steam forum and EA support I found out that 90% of the thread there are about launch issues due to EA App (how lucky I was to play 60h with no problem)
Not a single true solution from steam forum, which is understandable, yet even the EA support doesn't bring a solution either. Worst ! The only ones that help the players are the players themselves, there's not a single employee who cared to answered any of the threads on a issue which prevents the players to play a game that they paid for, on their own support website !

Apparently, this issue started when EA switch its launcher from Origins to EA App.
Apparemment les problèmes ont commencé depuis que EA a changé son launcher en passant d'Origins à EA App.
Anyway, friends, go your way or get the game in another way, for those who already got it, we can only pray that somehow a bug will walk on a wire and fix the problem god knows how.",1687249668,1687249668,False,2,0,0.52733689546585083,0,True,False,False

Definitely not something you start off blind. If you want to appreciate the story I definitely recommend starting off on Origins first so you can understand some key conflicts and characters. However, this installment of Dragon Age's gameplay deviates from its other two games that long time Dragon Age fans might be upset with. The removal of sustained effects (toggleable passives), the weaker tactics system, clunky and slower movement compared to previous games, and its combat system as a whole were the first things that threw me off when playing the game. It seems Bioware had dumbed down the tactical combat systems and D&D aspects that made its previous games successful in order to appeal to a wider audience with a simple hack and slash style that left little to no room for strategic play. Regardless it is still an exceptional game, so If you're a fan of Bioware's masterful ability to craft compelling stories and even more compelling characters, this game is about as good as its predecessors.

I'd only recommend this game if you're invested in the dragon age universe as a whole, it's a very average, bloated mess of a game that doesn't truly exceed at anything compared to it's predecessors (Yes, including Dragon age 2). If you want an empty open world with meaningless side-quests and boring combat then this game would be your thing. It's only carried by some of your companions and even then they have a small amount of content relative to how overly large the game manages to be. Since this is the GOTY edition, some of the DLC's included are a clear improvement over the vanilla game and I hope to god that Bioware realizes that. Mods are a must if you decide to play this game to fix a number of issues and annoying things that Bioware thought were a good idea.

I would then force close the EA App with task manager, as none of the ""solutions"" the EA App offers worked (restarting, refreshing the library, etc.). The game would then refuse to launch again until I manually cleared out cache files in a couple different EA App folders, and then restarted my PC.

having fun with the game, but fuck origin, touching nothing, you are gambling if it works or not. Buy this game on anything that isn't connected to origin, use console or pirate it if you have to.

may change my review to positive, but these origin issues really are awful.
but the game is amazing so far  imo, played alot of DAO, and played DA2 one time long ago.


**REVIEW**
magic is underwhelming compared to origins strength wise , UI for spells is awful, hotbar only has room for only few spells it's annoying. 

I'm liking the dialogue and plot so far. 
companions are interesting.

Running and using horseback feels like traveling in origins, slow and tedious. 
only upside is we can fast travel

Combat so underwhelming compared to origins, least in origins we can micromanage the bad AI. no doubt any complexity was gutted to make console easier. 
Ai is better than origins, but still infuriating to deal with. Least in origins you can specify each companion behavior. 

In this game you tell you squad to hold position, and your tank will sit there and do nothing, you tell your tank to do something, and the other party members decide they wanna move too.

huge con also, is they made this game unfriendly to modding, Went to nexusmods to see if i can fix some of these issues, only to find out you need to download 2 separate programs to simply mod out some shitty hairdo

Speaking of hair, like in origins a 10+ year old game, has hair variety of a burn ward. 
why there has to be 4 different types of bald is baffling.




**UPDATE JUNE 2023 NEW EA APP**
Seems to fix these issues and opens seamlessly, but you will need to disable the overlay if you don't want the game to crash every other loading screen. In the game folder find the file called  igo64,dII and rename it. Otherwise you need to log in to the app because the steam one closes if you close the game, and you cannot change the setting in the app while in game (morons made this app).

**IN DEPTH GUIDE ON HOW I GOT THIS GAME TO FINALLY WORK**

*first day opened game worked fine, every day after had some issue that has happened.

Foolproof way to make it work for me

Set game on steam to open as admin, 
(this fixed it the first time)

set origin to open as admin.
(the second day it stopped opening)

If that doesn't work means you gotta restart steam first. 
(did this after it stopped opening for the third time)

Also don't try opening it from steam, it may just pop up like it opened origin then closes. 
(fourth time it wouldn't open)

You have to open the game on origin every time.

-Arcane knight is cool
-The open world extends gameplay acting like a screensaver rather than you playing the game
-Level 12 in the starter area while' giving you a close all the riff quest oh wait that's a con you can't dark souls your way out of it.Very tricky move not cool
-You can have passive perks in other trees and not be restricted to said weapon
-Example you can have sword and shield passives while you equip a two hander
-The title screen is a nice screensaver
-I'm just acting like DAI extending the run time
-The elf rouge ally you get is obnoxious like a teenage highschooler
-Bee gernade someone got paid writing for the elf rouge LOL RANDOM in the war room to have you look for Bee gernades the story has gone downhill
-Riff having timetravel is interesting to bad we can't century hop and have a mass effect cameo or weapons that's way to imagative.

It is an action role-playing game set in a high-fantasy world filled with political intrigue, epic battles, and memorable characters.

The game offers a vast open world to explore, filled with diverse environments, from lush forests to arid deserts and snow-capped mountains. The attention to detail in the world design is impressive, creating a sense of authenticity and wonder. Dragon Age: Inquisition is an expansive and immersive RPG, but like any game, it has its flaws.

The game's vast open world and the sheer amount of content can lead to pacing problems. Some players may feel that certain areas or quests are repetitive and lack the same level of depth and engagement as the main storyline.

Inquisition includes a significant number of fetch quests or side missions that involve collecting items or completing simple tasks. These quests can sometimes feel repetitive and less meaningful, detracting from the overall experience.

While Dragon Age: Inquisition features a large amount of side content, not all of it is equally engaging or well-developed. Some quests or areas may feel generic or lack the depth and complexity of the main story and key side quests.

The user interface in Dragon Age: Inquisition has been criticized for being cluttered and unintuitive, especially on consoles. Navigating menus and managing inventory can be cumbersome and confusing at times.

While Dragon Age: Inquisition offers both real-time and tactical combat options, the tactical aspect is considered by some players to be less robust compared to previous Dragon Age titles. The tactical camera is less intuitive to use, limiting strategic options during combat encounters.

Some players have expressed disappointment with the limited options for character customization, particularly regarding physical appearance. There are fewer choices compared to previous Dragon Age games, which can be a letdown for players who enjoy creating unique and personalized characters.

Like many open-world games, Dragon Age: Inquisition is not immune to technical glitches and bugs. While these issues may not be game-breaking, they can be frustrating and hinder the overall experience.

It's important to note that opinions on these aspects may vary among players. While these criticisms exist, they don't diminish the overall positive reception and enjoyment that many players have had with Dragon Age: Inquisition.

In summary, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a highly ambitious RPG that excels in its world-building, storytelling, and character development. It offers an immersive experience with a captivating narrative, memorable characters, and satisfying gameplay. Despite a few minor flaws, it is a must-play for fans of the genre and a worthy addition to the Dragon Age series.",1646208996,1686705194,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age: Origins has a much more traditional RPG feel. Origins handles combat almost as if it were turn based. Enemies have fairly high HP, damage for non-mages is low (at least early on) and each section of the game feels grand and well paced. It handles companions very well, giving each a desire and a goal, and a personality that is fun to engage with. 

Dragon Age 2 was a complete 180, for good or bad depending on the person. I thoroughly enjoyed Dragon Age 2. It is much more of an action RPG. Spells still have huge impact, but other classes also have much more mobility and every class has quite a bit of flare to it. The companions, in my opinion, are much weaker generally falling into E-boy or crazy woman. 

Inquisition, at last, strives to make the game as annoying as physically possible. They kept the action-esque combat from DA2, but also kept the health pools from DA:O, leading to your fast(ish) paced class design to take ages because every enemy is a health sponge. The inability to move when attacking leads melee combat to feel extremely sluggish when enemies constantly strafe. Mages will use all of their mana on damage spells, just for enemies to lose 45-60% of their health. 

Tacking on a mediocre crafting system that leads the player to run around spamming a search button, watching a 1.5 second animation for every plant and rock they pick up that kills the flow of game-play. A mission table straight out of an MMO, gating near meaningless rewards behind a timer like I'm paying a monthly subscription fee and they need to keep me coming back every day. 

Companions in Inquisition are uh..they exist. You may find one or two enjoyable, but most are really uninteresting typically falling into some kind of bland trope. Girl boss, prankster, oppressed elf etc etc. Their dialogue is horribly uninspired, and would frequently lead me to just not checking up on any of them as I progressed the game. 

It has a Ubisoft open world. Wide, looks okay, but completely devoid of anything interesting. It's an excuse to make you run around and pick up resources, this game would be significantly better with more structure. 

I do enjoy Inquisition despite it's many, many flaws, though I would not recommend it to those new to the franchise. It has so much working against it, fundamentally, that leads it to feel sluggish, uninspired and very much a relic of the mid 2010's. After games like Elden Ring or Tears of the Kingdom have set new standards for open world games, it's very difficult to come back to a game like Inquisition. Antiquated crafting system, mediocre character interactions, combat that becomes stale as you pour hours upon hours into the game and a tedious, bland open world. 

If you REALLY like Dragon Age (as I do), I can recommend it to you to play through when the Dragon Age itch hits (pick up some mods to fix the item pick up animations and mission table at least), but if you're just getting into Dragon Age, steer clear until finishing the first 2.",1686242904,1686684427,False,1,1,0.464571535587310791,0,True,False,False

This game, in my view, has the worst combat in the series - for single-player at least. Maybe I just don't get it but controlling four characters between the two camera modes (tactical and action) just feels extremely finicky. The units don't stay in the place you send them to and the ""hold""-command gets overwritten instantly. So you got everyone running where they please unless you give them a new command every second, which makes luring enemies into a bottleneck position for my team (which is very important on the highest difficulty) a nightmare.

If you don't want to facetank every encounter by chugging huge amounts of health potions, you have to cast the barrier spell of your mage on cooldown, which again requires you to keep your characters in a specific spot together.
Sometimes a character ignores an attack/skill command and just stands there, which can only be fixed by jumping once, causing a lot of downtime for that unit.

In multiplayer the combat system is actually fun because you only have to control one character in the action-cam mode. This makes for a couple of fun sessions but needless to say for a BioWare-RPG, the multiplayer is not the main strength of the game.

The character and world design of DAI is wonderfully crafted and the dialogues are fantastic but with a huge part of the game being combat, I just can't get myself to even getting close to the end of this one.",1686590084,1686590084,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a nutshell, do I recommend this game? Yes, there are achievements, and they are all simple to obtain.

breakdown: 

As with previous Dragon Age titles, this one plays similarly, so if you've played any of the previous titles, you'll know what to expect. It's an open world RPG with a strong emphasis on choice-based gameplay and has a decent story.

The graphics: 
The graphics are very nice and still hold up well today, so there shouldn't be much dissonance when switching between this and newer games. 

achievements: 
All of the achievements are easily attainable, if not a little tedious, and should be able to be collected in around 70 - 80 hours if you try to run it quickly, or 100+ if you take your time. 

game time: 
the overall length of the game is around 70-80 hours, but if you take your time and enjoy the game, you can easily get closer to the 200-hour+ mark with multiple ways to play and different story outcomes to explore. (This includes the DLC) 

DLC: 
The DLCs for this game are all good and provide a good amount of content with each. These DLCs don't feel out of place and are well-integrated into the story, making them worthwhile to purchase alongside the base game. 

multiplayer: 
So I didn't touch it, so I can't speak to it. From what I recall, it was pretty ""meh"" back in the day, and I'm pretty sure people don't play it anymore. (but don't quote that)

dislikes/problems: 
- As with all EA games, I dislike the fact that you must use their launcher to play the game because it is inconvenient and just really annoying. 

- I played this game with a controller, and the game does not recognise it if you turn it on while the game is already running. To connect it, you must first turn it on before starting the game. 

- The biggest issue I had with the game while playing it was that if anything close to you took damage, it would aggro you, slowing you down and making you unable to interact with certain things, which could be very annoying at times.

- Also, keep in mind that I crashed around three times in total and ran into an issue with the trespasser DLC loading screen; keep that in mind and look into it as you may encounter the same problem when playing.
 
Summary: 
The game is worth purchasing. Of course, if you can wait for a sale, that is the best option, but even if you can't, you will get your money's worth out of the game. I would also recommend purchasing the base game with the DLC included in the GOTY edition because they are excellent and may enhance your experience (as they did mine).",1686576167,1686576167,True,28,2,0.710317611694335938,0,True,False,False

However, from the very beginning there was just something missing in this game fore me. I could not care about the story or the characters. maybe I've missed something, as this RPG is totted as one of the better ones out there. Everything about this game felt clunky and devoid of life for me. I can appreciate the time that the developers put into this, but for me this game is a no. If you are looking for a solid RPG experience i recommend you give this one a skip.

The story is unbelievably complex, with overlapping character arcs that interweave and evolve as you progress through the story. I love the relationship building aspect (lots of personalities!), and the unique and powerful Hero's Journey you experience. I'm playing through as a Human Mage, which presents its own special can of worms in terms of influencing the world around you. It's brilliantly political, gritty, funny, tragic, romantic, grand, and high fantasy magic. DRAGONS. (duh) There is seemingly no end to the content. I'm astounded by how much story, characters, and exploration this game has to offer. Choices do matter.

I really enjoy the combat system. In my opinion, it's one of, if not the best action RPGs out there. You can play it ""turn based"" if you like, while essentially pausing the game when giving characters commands, but I prefer to play it fluidly. I also really enjoy the ability to switch between characters on the fly, as you can really work through some combos and strategize your character placements. Building your characters is very satisfying as well, as there are customizable skill trees that can be modified as you develop your play style. 

I can't believe how much amazing voice acting is in the game. Seriously, the wandering NPCs are great, the party NPCs and recurring characters are fantastic, and there's SO. MUCH. DIALOG. It's like reading a dense fantasy novel, but making it happen right before your eyes. 

Artistically, gorgeous. Incredible environments, cool monsters, unique character designs. The armor and weaponry are fairly standard in terms of style, but I still like them a lot. Nothing seems too forced or kitschy. 

The musical score is lovely. Cutscenes are great. It's a very impressive game from pretty much every standpoint. If you're a fantasy lover, this game is highly recommended!

(also, all the hate for the EA app is kind of silly. It's really not that big of a deal.)

excluding that scene I would rate 8/10, it has astonishingly great story, but the UI and the control is sucks, especially the strategic view.

All hail the inquisitor, herald of Andraste... Those are the cringe title that you will hear again and again throughout the story until it is not cringe anymore because you feel that those title carry so much thing in it, responsibility, power, fear, and hope. Storywise, the beginning of the story is pretty confusing either for player character and for player itself, the mystery will reveal itself by progressing the main quest. The game depicts a more realistic political situation than the other games, and the political decision that player made will have an impact to the ending. When I was reaching the end of the story, I was shocked by the twist that I did not expect. 
The main story is amazing enough, even some of the side quests have a great story especially the companion story. in the story, there will be many dilemmatic situation that will face you, in some of that situation, it took me minutes or even hours to think and contemplate to reach the best decision based on my moral compass.

Gameplaywise, for me this game is suck, which game that use ""A"" and ""D"" key to move camera? The grinding is pain in the ass, the level progression is very slow, some of the quest reward is not rewarding enough and make you think ""oh my god, I spent hours only to get this? really?"" However the open world adventure was enjoyable, and I do really like the banter of companion during the adventure, it made my adventure become more fun and enjoyable. The combat was enjoyable at first, until I was tired being a double dagger rogue then I changed to bow rogue that AFK left-clicking while my companion fight with their life on the front line. Lastly, if you play this game, I suggest you to create a save data as much as possible if you planning to replay the game to get different ending. 

In conclusion, I had a great time playing this game, even though sometimes this game is frustrating but it worth the time to play until I reach the ending. Can't wait for the next series of this game :prayge:

Nearly 10 years later, DA:I still holds up. The story is solid, the graphics are still pretty good, and there's actual character development. I don't really recommend multiplayer (if multiplayer is still working on this title) - it was a bit of an afterthought and was mildly entertaining for a few hours in the same way that ME3's multiplayer was sort of fun for a few hours, but who buys a Bioware RPG for anything but the single player experience? The story isn't quite as tight as the first two Dragon Age titles, but it's more expansive with more varied environments.

If you're looking for a 100+ hour single player RPG, this is worth a buy. If you haven't played any Dragon Age title yet, I recommend playing through at least the main stories for Origins and DA2.",1685780031,1685780031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And how, despite this being a deeply, [i] deeply [/i] flawed game, I still recommend it in the end.

Pros:
+The main story is great and all of the main missions have some really cool scenarios that you get to go through like the huge battle at Adamant Fortress or going through the wilds after rallying all of your allies together. Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts will always be a standout to me since I'm a huge fan of court intrigue and all of the different ways that quest can play out are incredibly impressive.

+I love the cast of this game and really feel like (almost) all of your party members are well developed and interesting. Their personal quests are all great and even the ones I didn't like were still pretty well done. Plus I think it's funny how you can kick Sera out of the Inquisition at any time, even though I ended up liking her after a while and didn't find her that annoying. 

+The Romances are great and I really like that they have romance exclusive quests that help flesh out the romance arcs more. 

+The character creator is really in-depth and I think it's cool that you can get race and class specific dialogue options. They're way more rare than they should be, but it's cool to see them none the less. 

+Parts of running the Inquisition are a ton of fun, like certain war table side stories and everything involving Sutherland and company, and I absolutely love Skyhold and seeing it evolve as a base as the story progresses. Also Inquisition perks are really cool for the most part and its cool seeing the Inquisition make an impact on the world when you get to do things like rebuild bridges or claim keeps that you then have your soldiers garrison. 

+All of the DLC is really high quality and each one is memorable in a different way. Jaws of Hakkon has hands down the best open world area in the game (which isn't saying much, but still), The Descent was an insanely cool dungeon crawl that has a unique element of you repairing parts of the dungeon to find bonus areas that I haven't seen in anything else, and Trespasser deserves a section all by itself. 

+Trespasser is hands down the best part of the entire game and one of my favorite things to come out of Dragon Age as a series, period. It starts out as the DA equivalent of Citadel where you get to hang out with your party members and see how the choices you made in the main game are affecting the world 2 years on, but then it slowly morphs into this huge conspiracy plot that has one of the best endings I've ever seen. The ending of Trespasser alone made the game for me and is one of the main reasons why I really, [i] really [/i] hope that Dreadwolf is good in spite of the development hell its gone through. 

Cons:
-The open world sucks. There's no other way to say it, the main open world portion of the game is simply not fun. It's filled with nothing but pointless filler quests that are boring to play through and serve no other purpose than to pad out your play time. There are a few exceptions to this, but they are extremely rare. This wouldn't be so bad were it not for...

-The Power mechanic. Requiring the player to have a certain amount of Power to continue the main story and open up new areas is beyond stupid and it forces you to waste your time doing side content so you can go back to actually having fun.

-Combat in this game is also not very good. It feels really clunky and awkward at first but gets better as you progress and get new abilities. It still never becomes anything more than tolerable at best. 

-While parts of running the Inquisition are fun, other parts are extremely poorly explained, like how the Divine Election works or the fact that certain war table operations that seem like filler are actually really important and can have an impact on the world without you ever knowing that they're even in the game. Also, war table timers suck and you basically have to get a mod to get rid of them to enjoy that aspect of the game. 

-Mounts are also completely pointless and make it that you can't listen to any party banter while you're on them, so you end up never using them at all. They don't even increase your movement speed and every area feels way too big because of this. 

-There's no way to track your companions approval within the game itself. I get why they did it this way, but I still think it's stupid they hid that info from the player. 

-The EA app is ridiculous and feels like it's breaking the game half the time while I get no problems whatsoever the other half. 

Overall, I like Inquisition despite it's flaws because I feel like it does enough to keep me interested through the story, lore and characters. It really would have been better if they cut down on the open world filler and made the game more focused and linear, and I can easily see why this game is as divisive as it is. Still, I hope that BioWare can make a comeback with Dreadwolf even with everything that's happened with it throughout its development.",1680551682,1685301681,True,23,0,0.732561826705932617,0,True,False,False

And I'm saying this as a fan of both DA:O and DA2 — so I'm not an extreme conservative who wants a franchise to repeat more of the same with no changes ever.

But, like, what IS [i]Dragon Age Inquisition?[/i]

As a tactical RPG, it's mediocre. Character customization is there, but it's not overly deep, and due to the misguided emphasis on pseudo-action combat and console friendliness, encounters aren't really tactical. There are dozens of tactical RPGs that are better at this.

As an action RPG, it sucks. You're given third-person control of the character, but they're sluggish and can't dodge, so... why, exactly, does the game need this control scheme and perspective? How does it benefit from it, apart from looking ""console-ish""?

As a story, it sucks. DA:O offered impressive non-linearity based on your background. DA2 was much simpler, but at least it tried something interesting with the story — you played as a refugee of DA:O's events, a victim of the heroics of DA:O's protagonist. [i]Inquisition[/i] kinda just... throws a bunch of pre-existing characters together and starts off a completely new story, very loosely connected to the previous ones and very generic. Your hero is a standard chosen one. The dialogues are poorly paced, with characters dumping everything on you in one go and then standing silent. Characters lack charisma or humor.

It's not beautiful — everything is soaked in instagram filters, and characerts's faces are just unpleasant for some reason, with small eyes. Maybe this more realistic approach to art design would have suited a game that started off with political intrigue, not a bombastic demon tearing the fabric of reality.

The exploration is decent, but the world around you just isn't interesting enough to drive it.

This is a game that tries to be everything and achieves nothing. The trailer-friendly set pieces are okay, I guess, but nothing new in modern gaming landscape.

I see no reason to spend time on this one.

The biggest issue for me was limiting certain available mats for crafting, but not telling the player that only 40 existed in the entire game.  So on your first play through, you use these super rare materials to craft lower level gear, effectively preventing you from crafting quality highest tier later.  Sure you can do fine with less quality gear.  But why can't you go out and farm or even purchase higher quality mats?  It is a single player RPG game, if you want to spend the time getting the materials to make the best gear that you can while looking good, why not allow a player to do it?  

Guess the other option on your first play through would be to massively search the internet for these kind of things, and also potentially ruin the story for yourself as well.  But I would have never thought that I would need to research massively for things the game play won't tell or explain to you.  Also, who wants to do 40 hours of research on a game before they even start playing?

I just couldn't get pass certain mats being so limited as being a major issue for me, and if I don't already own the game, I would NOT buy the game again.

Before that game, BioWare games were relatively tight experiences. There were always choices but the choices came during the main and side stories, and you were really supposed to do most of the side stories both from the narrative (almost all the quests were done with a lot of effort in terms of story) and mechanical perspective (the game expected you to do most of the side quests on your way or you'd be under-leveled and had to really know what you were doing). Basically you were supposed to play BioWare games in almost a completionist way.

DAI is different. Perhaps at the time devs thought that every RPG has to be Skyrim, perhaps Dragon Age 2 caused an overreaction, but DAI is a huge expansive game. In addition to a traditional BioWare story and dialogue-focused game there's a more traditional dungeon crawling experience on top of it. People often call it MMO, but to me it reminds classic Might & Magic games more - the fights themselves are rarely hard, it's about persistence and bringing the right tools to the fights. The point is, the majority of quests in this game are very simple stories you are supposed to do to farm resources. Numbers go up, bars fill, you get crafting materials, and collectibles; you might feel good about it.

The thing is, it's all fluff on top of essentially the same game as what BioWare has done before. The Journal highlights the quests devs really wanted you to play, and calls all the grind stuff ""Tasks"". Playing previous DA games makes you think you have to do everything and that's a mistake. If you only do ""main"" stories you'll be perfectly capable of going through the story on Normal difficulty, all the other activities are there only if you want them. And then if you want you can turn this game into Diablo-style rampage for a while walking around some map that has ten things to collect for some cosmetic reward. 

One more thing about this game is that it looks great. It has a good balance between realistic and stylized looks, and the visual design of basically everything is superb.

Contrary to what Steam says it works great on Steam Deck. The only issue - and it's not a small one - is that the gamepad controls don't function, so you have to play it with keyboard & mouse emulation.",1685099460,1685099460,True,15,0,0.642436087131500244,3,True,False,False

It shouldn't have come to this. If player doesn't find anything interesting from the start then what is the chance that the game will even be considered a success?
Cons:
- game works only with EA launcher,
- keyboard and mouse controls are a total mess, no click & move, no automatic fighting after clicking the target like it was in previous installments,
- primitive class mechanics where every previous installment was more interesting,
- mediocre (at best) story in the beginning,
- non-existing differences between background sequence in the beginning,
- huge empty locations with next to nothing to do in them where the only thing you can do is fight the enemies while trying to get somewhere or take quests to fight the enemies (sorry, not sorry).

Pros:
- nice looking locations.

Overall if I were to buy this game for a full price I would say it's a total ripoff. Even buying it at half price would be asking too much but you know that Electronic (f)Arts doesn't provide value. If you are searching for an interesting RPG with a strong story that would hook you up then you might want to search somewhere else. I strongly suggest playing Dragon Age: Origins. It has much better story, better mechanics and control setup that could be considered unacceptable in AAA title.

Likes:
- Companions feel fleshed out: background dialogue with party members, can't please everyone with important dialogue decisions, they will leave if they disagree with you a lot, etc.
- Lots of main story moments that gave me goosebumps and excited to play more.
- There is evidence given to you for and against Chantry teachings.
- Maps are very well done, and the astrarium puzzles are my favourite.
- Crafting feels very important, especially on Nightmare difficulty.
- Soundtrack is SO good!!

Dislikes:
- Antagonist is kind of bland, bad for the sake of being bad.
- Main character origin doesn't feel important outside of additional dialogue, and sometimes is skimmed over and flat out ignored (elf war table quest, iykyk).
- making a cute female elf without mods is basically impossible.
- doesn't have the same dark fantasy feel as Origins.
- Maps kind of feel unnecessary in size and number, the value in dragon age to me is in the characters and story and it removes some focus from that.",1684422949,1684423466,True,2,0,0.51112067699432373,0,True,False,False

1: Without spoiling anything, a certain character will leave your party and will not return. There's no warning for this and so if you put equipment on the person before they leave you will never see that equipment again. It happens after the final mission of the original story campaign.

2: Didn't happen to me but supposedly if you do too many things that a character disapproves of they will leave your party.

3: Don't waste your money on new mounts. There is no ""best mount"" in the game. They all have the same speed. New mounts are purely asthetic.

4: Do NOT start the Tresspasser DLC unless you either make a separate save file right before you start it, or you finish literally everything else in the game. Starting the DLC will lock you out of all other content because its the climax of the game. Once you finish it, you can't continue unless you start from a previous save file or you start over. However if you do start over you can take the crafting blueprints you earned from your first play through with you to your second play through if you sync your data on the Golden Rabbit statue.

5: Don't be afraid to waste talent tree points. You can reset any character tree with a purchasable item. So if you make a mistake or you want to change things up a bit, you can always respec.

6: If you're a mage, I highly recommend choosing a Knight Enchanter path. Combined with the Spirit tree, you're pretty much untouchable. You can constantly replenish your barrier just from attacking and enemies have to go through your barrier before they can touch your actual health.",1684104787,1684104787,True,100,2,0.828876197338104248,0,True,False,False

Do not get me wrong, this game is very much worth playing, but many mechanics are poorly designed and annoying in result. Few points first maybe:
-Main plot rather interesting
-Ties well to events from previous games
-Sadly, undermines legacy of Grey Wardens whom we all loved since Origins
-Dialogues and romances quite interesting, but sometimes cause too much consequences and as result they are not so natural, since they have a forced following actions
-AI tactis are good, but followers behavior will not once block your path
-Movement is really bad
-Dragon Age II decisions don't really matter

With these as basics, I believe we can begin actual evaluation of the game. Plot is quite interesting and meaningful, but I believe it's quite overdone. While it is definitely better to have influence on the events in the World, unlike Dragon Age II, this game does not feel that natural because of the implications.
Companions conversations are quite good, but again, you have to run between them in big castle every 5 minutes, the banter activates very rarely compared to its predecessors.
You can romance not only your party, but also advisors- ok, cool. But again, they overdone it with 'gayness'. I'm not talking that there should not be bi or homo relations in Dragon Age, because they always were here, but due to covering 'all fields' you can now romance almost noone as for e g Male hetero oriented Inqusitor, and I will bet all my income from my games that these still are majority of Dragon Age players, like every other fantasy. Also why are almost all romancable option ugly? In previous games we had Morrigan, Leliana, Allstair, Zevran, Isabela, Tails- all very pretty or handsome. Here only few characters are good looking, especially the female ones. This looks like the game tries to tell us something, and it is sadly political and damn it, I want to lose myself in the game, not to find reflection of our broken world there. Every important character should be your heart desire, because that's fantasy. That's why we like it. BioWare used to know that...
Oh and animations in dialogues are often unnatural, sadly.
Combat... there is not much to say about combat, sometimes it really is too flashy (and I have played many RPGs and other games, I have really wide comparison). AI behaviors are usually so well defined you do not need to change them, unless you give game a try on a hard mode of course.
Equipment- hmm, the crafting system is mind bogling and the begginig, but with second playthrough it's allright. Black Emporium addition sadly damages balance in the game, as does the Descent- the gear you will get there is freaking overpowered. Main boss at the end of the game won't even finish his sentence if you have that gear on your party.
War table- annoying and unecessary, I don't know who thought it was good idea that some missions lasts 16 hours when you can finish the game in 40.
Now about movement... I don't think it was thought through. At first you think, cool, I finally can jump- only to find that actually you can't. You can't jump over any meaningful obstacle, a fence, not even a stone. You always have to go by the road but you think you don't and that will drive you mad. T'was be better if there was no jumping here at all, instead of some jump-spamming-colectable missions that you have to search on youtube because for all the treause in the world, you can't find the way.
Locations... locations in this game are kind of weird, really. They are tied to the main story and they aren't. But you still need to explore them... but not fully. Maps usually won't help you, and even worse with minimap- it's more of a compass with you and your party, because nothing else is really there. You think there is a map of that 3-level mine on the desert? Forget it, your memory, a movie from youtube or rage quit, those are your options.

So yeah... Good game, quite rich in story, but annoying as hell.",1684005521,1684005521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- story and characters
- basic gameplay loop of quest progress and character development

Cons:
- difficulty to navigate maps
- spongy enemies
- boring combat
- bad UI designed for controllers only

The game wastes your time by trying to copy Skyrim. There are numerous open world maps that are full of mountain ranges that block your path except for tiny hidden passages. Simply finding the way from A to B is a painful chore. Sometimes entire areas of the map are blocked before you do some unrelated war table quest, so you waste 30 minutes walking around trying to find a path that doesn't exist. Quest areas are level-scaled and you unlock an area only to find all the enemies are four levels above you so you just wasted your time even going there.

Combat is boring. You hold down LMB until the enemies are all dead and occasionally activate cooldown abilities. Playing a mage is no more compelling, the spells are weak and positioning does not matter at all. Even basic enemies are massive damage sponges that you need to bash for two minutes, slowly wittling down its health bar before it dies. It just looks ridiculous, like you're wielding foam swords as weapons. There is none of the visceral combat of DAO/DA2 left. Tactical mode is unusable because the camera is zoomed in too close and blocked by trees/massive target indicators obscuring everything.

The skill trees have too much chaff in them and too many abilities the AI doesn't know how to use properly so you should never pick them unless you love micromanaging everything. You know the damage output in this game is ridiculously bad when you need abilities like ""1000% damage for a short period of time"". The only way to do actual damage is combos, which gets repetitive very quickly. But then you run into bosses that are immune to all possible status effects so we're back to hacking away for minutes on end.

Random loot sucks and the inventory is limited so don't even bother with non-special item drops. The crafting and equipping UI is also horrible to use. In the end, you just craft a slightly more powerful version of a sword you already have but it has a different ridiculously generic name. It all just feels like playing a boring generic MMO with 100% randomised loot.

The character interactions and dialogue are good as usual for the DA franchise. The story is fine apart from the beginning that is very poorly explained or motivated, although the story explains itself a bit better later on. The Inquisition does give you some reason to care about the companions and the side content, although there is a jarring contrast between the ""Inquisitor sends armies or agents to deal with political problems on the war table"" and the ""Inquisitor roams Bumwood for 20 weedstalks to give to the local healer"" quests.

If someone tells you this is the best game in the series, they didn't play the first two at all. Only worth playing through once for the story/companions, everything about the mechanical gameplay is deeply flawed. I got halfway through the final DLC before the sponge fights and interminablt confusing puzzles killed my interest in the game.",1683992186,1683992186,False,8,0,0.527845144271850586,0,True,False,False

I played this game first, instead of diving into DA Origins or DA 2, and I do think that was a shame.

FrostByte is hard to mod so a lot of the texture issues or customization issues can't be fixed to your preference unless you know how the engine works in depth. And on top of this, Vivian exists and unlike Sera, you can't kick her out of the inquisition when out of all the characters in this franchise she is my absolute least favorite, companion wise atleast. 

This game is also different from the previous games combat wise, you can turn on a top down RTS style combat system but its way less refined and it is not the optimal way to play, leaving you to third person and switching between companions when the boss is a hard one. Besides that the story of the game is good an this one has a couple of my favorite companions and fates form them, such as Sera or Cole, both being characters who I absolutely love. Dragon Age Keep is also introduced with this game as to bring your saves over, but I have a small issue with Keep being: it sometimes messes with your saves when uploading and transferring saves can also be quite finicky depending on what you do with some of your work also not really being transferred to keep properly so once you upload a save or export a save, you may want to check and unblock spoilers for DAI just in case some tings you did, did not show up. 

Either way for stories such as your friendship or romance possibilities with characters like Sera and Dorian, I say this game is worth a buy. Also you get some great DLCs like Jaws of Hakkon and Trespasser (Descent is mid tho).",1683147068,1683147068,True,1,0,0.507504701614379883,0,True,False,False

You pick a class and go on your way saving the world with the help of companions you meet on the way and making dialog choices that actually seem to change things. Of course this has a completely different story, locations, combat system, etc.

The story is decent enough and has some really great moments, but at times I find it hard to follow and there are definitely parts where the dialog gets a bit boring. Part of that is on me though as I tend to exhaust the dialog options.

The locations are various and are each a smaller open world, filled with towns, NPCs, quests, enemies, resources, and more. At times there can almost be too much to do. My map is constantly filled with markers and objectives to the point where it can be a little overwhelming. The more I played the more I found myself just sticking to the main quest and companion quests while ignoring all the side stuff.

The combat system is another thing that is good enough. It works, but it’s not great. It would be nice if I did a little more damage and regenerated mana a little faster. In most RPGs these issues can be resolved by allocating stat points and getting better gear, but in this game stat points are assigned automatically based on your class and it doesn’t take long before you sort of hit a wall where you stop finding better gear. There is a crafting system, but almost all the gear I can craft has stats significantly worse than the stuff I find. There is also a weapon modification system, but 99% of the gear I find or craft does not seem to be modifiable.

I really like how much choice I get in dialog and that it rarely feels like I’m being forced to make a choice. Of course, this is a game and I’m sure the overall story is very similar for all players, with the overall outcome being similar. I doubt anyone is beating this game without saving the world. There are a few times you get to choose between 2 or more people or factions to side with and it feels like I’m freely allowed to pick. Companions and characters will often comment on these choices and react to them in a way that feels natural and makes me wonder how many lines and scenes I never got to experience, or if they just did a really amazing job at making me feel like I had a choice. Some of these choices give bonuses and I would imagine If I had chosen differently I would get different bonuses, but it’s possible these are fake choices where everyone gets the same bonus regardless. It just doesn’t feel that way. For example, I captured a prisoner and got to choose what to do with them. I choose to make them work for me, which gave me an agent to help me on missions. I cannot imagine I would have still gotten an agent if I had chosen to kill the prisoner. My one issue with this system is the game often doesn’t seem to give me much information on who is who and what they stand for, so I end up picking semi-randomly.

In terms of bugs and technical performance, this game is not great, but it's far from bad. During actual gameplay it runs fine at above 60 fps. Cutscenes drop down to, an often unstable, 30 fps, even though they seem to be rendered in real time. There are also many animations that seem to be capped at 30, even though the rest of the game is running well above that. The default controls suck, but everything is remapable and you can even make the camera control like a normal game. Motion blur is on by default and there is no in game way to fix that. I had 1 crash during the final boss fight, and plenty of issues with EA’s thing. It constantly has issues synching my save file, and often throws up scary warnings saying it has deleted my save file, even though the actual game sees and loads my saves perfectly fine. It would have been way better to just use Steam Cloud and ditch EA’s thing.

Overall, Dragon Age Inquisition is a very fun game that is well worth the price. I have yet to play the DLC, but even if they are bad, I’ll have no regrets buying this game.",1683126512,1683126512,True,28,1,0.704686880111694336,0,True,False,False

On the positive side, this game looks great, even 9 years later. Character models and most environments are stunning and the regions that are fleshed out feel epic and are a blast to explore. Combat animations and effects look awesome and you can feel the punch of mage spells impacting your enemies. The companions and dialogue are superb and many sidequests are engaging and interesting. Like the rest of Dragon Age, the lore is fascinating and discovering bits and pieces of the magical world is really rewarding. The regions of the Hinterlands, Crestwood, Emprise du Lion, and the Emerald Graves were a blast to explore. Managing and recruiting agents for the Inquisition is great and makes you feel like you are really building a powerful faction as the game progresses. 

However, all of this cannot be saved by the game's glaring issues and poor core mechanics. The biggest issue is the AI, which makes horrible tactical decisions when controlling many of your companions. Once you reach higher levels, the way the AI handles some of the characters' specialization abilities makes them impossible to have in your party. Mages will be positioned way too close to enemies, Shield Wall is effectively useless, and Reaver builds require an un-fun amount of micromanaging. Even with a party that the AI can decently manage, the gameplay largely feels like a lackluster MMO that becomes grindy and boring pretty quickly. So many fetch quests with no story, so much resource gathering. A lot of your time is spent power-walking around Thedas to click on things on the ground. This is not necessarily a chore in the more fleshed out regions, but some regions were clearly slapped together with far less effort than others and are extremely dull and lacking in lore and visuals.

Unfortunately, the main storyline is rather boring and unfulfilling. The main villain seems... incompetent to say the least and his motivations feel hollow. Secondary villains are introduced with no context, only for you to kill them one encounter later. I didn't care about or feel threatened [spoiler]by Corypheus, even after Haven was destroyed.[/spoiler] Plot points and locations are quickly introduced and then cast aside and the narrative just felt like you were jumping from one location to another without much of a cohesive story. 

I love the Dragon Age franchise, the first game is phenomenal, and I enjoyed the second installment despite its flaws. Inquisition, however, is too big, too empty and its core mechanics are just not very fun. If you are a Dragon Age fan, I suppose playing it for the story might be worthwhile, but as a video game overall, I cannot recommend it.",1682717940,1682717940,False,7,0,0.579032182693481445,0,True,False,False

I am an avid fan of RPGs and this game basically covers every single base for what I want in the perfect story based RPG (free for all RPGs are a different story). I have a bad habit of finishing every game I buy within 2 days (not 48 hours play time, just two days of playing) and I am on day 3 now and still in the region of Redcliffe doing quests. The leveling is slow, there's a ton of secrets to find in the regions, a variety of quest types, the usual Dragon Age banter between your party members, a unique character creation system, downloadable world states to start the game in (I haven't tried these yet but I love the option), and I have the absolute worst computer and it still runs extremely smooth and only freezes for a moment now and again or lags a lot when I'm on my horse or zoomed out.

Update: I finally brought myself to finishing the game. It took me forever because I knew I'd be absolutely devastated, because I chose to romance Solas and couldn't resist peeking at how that ended, and was trying to put it off as long as possible. Well, now I did it. I finished the game.
All I have to say is this: How dare you, Bioware? How dare you write such fantastic characters with such depth of personality and emotion that I can't help but become attached to them. How dare you fill this game with so much lore for my thirsty ass self to drink up? How dare you rip out my heart and crush it into a million pieces? And god damn please do it again. My entirely unhinged grasp on my emotions has had me depressed since I finished playing. The writers really outdid themselves on this one, as per usual, and the animators managed to make the emotions of the characters shine through the eyes in such a perfect way that it broke my heart so much.

Having been a classic DA fan from the beginning, two things immediate stand-out about DAI:

1) The graphics are beefed-up. Particles, lightning, (ray tracing?), and other finer-details really bring this installment to life.

2)They weren't detailed only with graphics, but with EVERYthing else. Menu transitions, fades, ambient effects, dialog improvements, and even little icons in-menu to show you who is talking (was that even necessary?). The game shows the amount of effort put into DAI.

I love how they brought back previous-game characters! I was especially stoked to see Leliana (..annnd a few other cameos)! It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in 13 years!
___________

One thing I must say, however, is the movement and battle-control mechanics have gradually gotten worse as the series has progressed... ESPECIALLY DAI. Expect to glue your finger to the right mouse button as you play. If you let it go, your A and D will switch functionality with Q and E. In ""tactics mode"" you better stop using A and D altogether, or you'll make your head spin for no reason at all. In previous installments right-clicking an interactable object made you, well, interact with it. Now, it does nothing unless you are in the perfect sweet-spot to do so. There's a useless V search button that shows you the (only extremely close) interactable objects that you can already see. And other hotkeys that were used in the previous Dragon Ages (or common in most games) are changed to unusal ones. (How many times have I tried to unpause commands-in-combat only to have my character instructed to ""jump"" for his next action and I can't even undo it if I don't have enough mana to give a different command?!!!) Oh, by the way, you aren't allowed to change any of these buttons. You can't even move which hotkey your basic health potions are on! Phew, that's a long complaint. Don't get me started on the ultra annoying perma-phantom purple mist if you have a rouge in your party. In all subjectivity, I think EA hired an all-star team for MOST of the departments, and threw in a couple interns to cover the others. All and all, the progression of the game helps alleviate it's ""intern issues"". The game is easily 40+ hours long, and still enjoyable at the end (how could it not be with the story twists?)

Anyway, still perhaps the best Dragon Age they've made, and I highly recommend this game. However, if you haven't already, I highly advise you play the previous installments first - esp. Origins.",1670082843,1682601295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the positive side, it's great to see recurring characters like Varric and Hawke from Dragon Age 2, and Leliana and Morrigan from Dragon Age Origins. The voice acting is top-notch, and some of the set pieces in the main campaign are truly impressive.

However, these positives are overshadowed by the game's numerous flaws.

 The quest design is terrible, and often times force you to go down paths that just arent engaging or suffer from incredibly frustrating arbitrary obstacles. Some quests are insanely bugged, leading to frustration and wasted time. Forcing you to reload an older save or do the most tedious things imaginable.

 The Hinterlands is a terrible starting place that can lead to players feeling overwhelmed and lost. The power system is tedious and annoying, and the fact that quests are locked behind it is frustrating. The game just drops you off here and bombards you with dozens of markers, each leading to a quest that plays out the same. 

""Im not gonna help you until you kill x enemy/get x item"" 

Its terrible and this is how most of the quests play out.

The sidequests are extremely mundane and tedious, with little variation or excitement. Waiting between war council missions destroys the pace of the game and breaks immersion.The worst part about the War council missions is you need to do them for a lot of other quests. 

Oh you wanna help this character you like? Go here! Oh sorry this rock is blocking the path, go to the war room and wait 6 hours real time while it gets removed.

The game's enemy encounters are poorly balanced, leading to frustratingly long and tedious battles. And to top it off, the ending is anticlimactic, shallow, and just a bad ending overall for such a long-running series.

Overall, if you love Dragon Age Origins and 2, you should just stop after Dragon Age 2. This game is another failure from Bioware that doesn't do justice to the amazing series. It's disappointing to see such a beloved series go downhill, and Dragon Age Inquisition is a prime example of what not to do with a franchise.",1682546212,1682546212,False,3,0,0.468961536884307861,0,True,False,False

I am not an Origins purist. If anything, I can't stand Origins purists. Inquisition is not a betrayal of the origins of the franchise, because Dragon Age is one of those odd franchises that isn't defined so much by its game mechanics as it is by its overarching story and world. And it does the latter exceptionally well; rarely will you ever come across another fantasy title with Dragon Age's scope or narrative heft. Each game has its own strengths: if the strength of Origins was its unflinching dedication to exploring moral quandaries through the lens of one of the most enigmatic and insular factions operating in a cataclysm-torn world, and the strength of DA2 its ability to invest players in a game of small confines and even smaller stakes but no less affecting emotional stakes, then the strength of Inquisition lies in its polish, scale, and ambition.

No other gaming franchise has built a fictive world with such fidelity to sociological truths, or so seductive a trove of lore. And Inquisition shines brightest of all in the ways it explores themes of memory, culture, theology, politics, and history: in the moments when its true, unassuming antagonist waits in the wings, doling out wisdom (or condescension, depending on your perspective) and glimpses into long-lost civilizations, guiding your Inquisitor through questions about past and present and the distorting, tyrannical, transformative influence of time and power, of how it warps actions into legends into whispers and irrevocably splits both reluctant and willing rebels and heroes into the body natural—the person—and the body politic—the figurehead, the symbol.

Even when Inquisition succumbs to spectacle and the worst grandiose impulses of epic fantasy, it is always quickly moored again by its balanced, well-realized, almost flesh-and-blood cast of supporting characters, who journey through this odyssey by your side as advisors and companions. At times it truly feels like you are steering an underdog organization with growing pains and monumental responsibilities through corruption and impossible odds, and nowhere is this feeling more crystalline than in Trespasser, the DLC that should have shipped with the base game. Trespasser is in many ways the true ending to the game; it elevates Inquisition from a merely good game to a great one.",1682357356,1682357883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The storyline in Inquisition is also a highlight, with a well-crafted narrative that tackles themes of politics, religion, and morality. The characters are well-written and memorable, with complex personalities that are developed over the course of the game.

Here's the thing... I still recommend it because it offers a very specific RPG experience. After a certain quest in the game you realize, as opposed to DA:O's Warden & DAII's Hawke, that you're Inquisitor isn't a hero of legend. The Hero of Feralden and the Champion of Kirkwall might stop and end the big bad, but they wouldn't be able to navigate the convoluted power structure that is fantasy France. That's where your Inquisitor steps in. The power fantasy is not being the hero of legend (even though the game beats you over the head with it sometimes) but in being a ruthless politician. A fantasy Henry Kissinger of sorts.

After that main story quest, I came to the realization I was expected to rp as a sociopath. What do I mean by this? It all begins with the difference between your companions and your advisors. The difference in how you conduct yourself in dialogue entries and the war table make for two very different Inquisitors. You essentially comfort your companions and say things that they like that align with their morals, all while unofficially plotting assassinations, sabotaging dissidents, investigating intrigue, and doing many things that fly in the face of the Inquisitor your companions know you to be. That's when the game is at it's peak. 

Sadly, there's not enough politics in this game. Not enough of your war table actions infringe dire consequences to your companions behaviors so well-written operations like Alliances, Clan Levallen, or Dance with the Dowager always feel like they're segregated off into their own world.

It really feels like an EA executive played World of Warcraft and insisted that it was the perfect RPG experience. Gameplay feels like the team stapled a WoW private server without multiplayer to Farcry. There is story here, somewhere, if you play long enough - but the game is not in any hurry to nudge you into learning it. Character progression is S L O W for a singleplayer game. To its credit the game does not fall into the 2010's trend of autoscaling enemies - but it also doesn't really give much guidance about how to find properly difficult enemies. The end result is that you kind of drift around the world, generally completing unchallenging quests and occasionally finding things that you have no hope of completing.

You are just one character in a party and your party, in traditional Bioware style, is all fully voiced and have their own stories about how they came to be here. However, because the plot has such a loose structure, interaction points are few and far between. The closest I've seen is that characters will occasionally approve or disapprove or an action - but I don't know how I'd learn what they want or understand how they feel. I think the idea is that, while you're at your home city, you can find and talk to your party members - but it feels very strange that you'd talk about your adventures only while taking a break from adventuring. It's doubly strange because, as I said earlier, the speed of advancement is quite slow and it would make things more interesting to get relationship advancement at the same time - but if it happens it's too slow to notice.

Most of the gameplay is running around a large map doing quests for NPCs scattered across the map. You might imaging that means there'd be a good system for tracking those quests and understanding what the next step is. You would be wrong. I wonder if the flaws of the quest tracking system influenced how aimless the game feels - they couldn't figure out a good way to show you what you should do next, so they never require you to do anything.

So - if most of the game is wandering around large open world maps - at least the combat is interesting right? At least 9 hours in the answer is no. Abilities have status effects and there's some sense of chaining abilities and status effects together - but in spite of all that combat feels very same-y. It might get better as time goes on, but 9 hours really feels like it should be enough for combat to feel compelling. To the games' credit, the opening tutorial is short and useful - it's just that the game never seems to get more interesting. It does not help that, while the party AI seems pretty good, it's very hard to tell what they are doing or what they are planning to do. They largely run independently. The game offers an active pausing system for you to give individual orders - but so far the combat is so simple there's little reward to doing it any it takes much longer.

I know people mourn the loss of the tactical view from DA:O, but to me the real loss is in any sense of gameplay arc. You are just kind of in a generic soup of quests with no direction or meaning. I'm sure there's lots of story (and perhaps some gameplay) hidden somewhere in there, but it's agonizingly slow to get to.",1681159638,1681159638,False,5,0,0.515219509601593018,0,True,False,False

DA:I is the textbook definition of an epic game, in length, scope, and theme. Like the first two games, you slowly assemble a band of merry marauders from whom you pick a team of 4 (your main character plus 3 others) to handle each foray into questing and (IMO most importantly) bantering with each other. Combat is the same combination of real time select targets with the option to stop and issue commands for each party member and slowly advance to see them play out. Unlike the second game and very unlike the first game, combat is relatively fast-paced, so battles don't drag on (notwithstanding a couple drag-ons). Also unlike the first game, the AI is fairly decent so the slow mode is only necessary for tough fights -- most of which happen early on.

That's because, like Skyrim and many other such games, if you do all the sidequests, then the end of the game is a bit of a ""Oh, I guess I'll go beat the game now""  I did almost all the sidequests, including finding every one of the 100+ magical shards hidden around the world, to open all the forbidden doors. 

And frankly, I probably should have skipped more. Because unlike e.g. Oblivion where some of the best quests are random sidequests for a mad Daedra, the quality of DA:I's quests is directly proportional to how close to the main line they are. The main quests themselves are fantastic, very epic with cutscenes and inventive scenarios ranging from time travel to a fancy dress party. The character-specific sidequests are fairly short but generally very good, revealing a bit more about the characters, changing their tarot card representation, giving you a deeper appreciation for them. And the rest of the quests... well, there's a whole lot of checklists, and I perhaps spent too much time running around checking things off.

It's a bit of a double-edged sword, because players clamor for these big epic worlds filled with a hundred hours of things to do. And by god, DA:I has them in spades, over a dozen large maps that each contain their own landmarks to find, shards and mosaics to collect, a dozen sidequests, and of course resources and monsters and so forth. It's a massive game that feels like there's always more to do. But after doing 98% of it, I think my experience of the game might have been even better if there had been half as much. And there's already plenty to do with all the resource-gathering, potion-crafting, weapon-upgrading, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game throughout, and unlike DA:O and DA:2, I never even had a part where I felt like the game was moving too slowly. The plot pacing was all very good in the main story, combat never felt interminable, things always kept moving... but a lot of the checklist quests in retrospect felt like running on a VR treadmill. A good workout, and even engaging... but not really going anywhere. Which yes, is my own damned fault for doing them all, but a game that adds them is clearly asking players to do so.

Also, the quality of intra-party banter varied widely. Some characters had a lot to say to each other, whether it was generally upbeat (Dorian and Sera playfully trading jabs) or thoughtful (Cole's insights into other characters). But some characters quickly seemed to run out of interesting things to say.

My only other complaint is that the game crashed occasionally -- maybe about a dozen times over 120 hours, which isn't bad, but is still annoying -- especially when two came amidst the final battle quest. Thankfully, unlike my crashes with DA:O, the final battle was mercifully short, so I didn't have to replay an hour. Still, the fact that the game requires the EA server, and then I'm guessing crashes whenever the connection to the EA server fails, is a tremendous PITA.

But that was a small price to pay for what truly was an enjoyable epic of a game. The game basically has two acts, and had the game ended after the first act with the epic finale I got there, I'd have felt I got my money's worth. The production quality is very high, enjoyment was high throughout, so I definitely recommend this game -- just be sure to not only ""Get out of the Hinterlands"" (as everyone advises), but also more generally not to compel yourself to do every sidequest.",1680979907,1680979907,True,11,0,0.660171627998352051,0,True,False,False

There is too much focus on the player character at the beginning of the story. He is ""the chosen one"" blah blah blah.

Too much epic will kill the epic, and the Blight appears in retrospect to be unimportant when major risks occur every ten years...""

But we realize that this major threat is actually not that big of a deal: in many places, things go on as usual without much concern for the impact of the demonic invasion. Besides, the super villain only seems to care about the inquisition instead of attacking the strongholds of Thedas.

So in fact, unlike a classic RPG scenario where you start as a nobody and progress through a story revealing a growing threat, you start with the impression that the world is falling apart and end up discovering a cheap villain.

i arely played the older ones, couldn't get pass the dated graphics even with mods, i hope they do a remaster. the older games appeared to be more involved and technical game play wise, but this ones fun.

voiced dialog, good acting, good story and writting, good graphic

i loved skyrim, nwn(the single/multiplayer one) ac odyssey, and a few trned based to a lesser extent, this game is now on my fav list.

The game does an incredible job of allowing the player to choose the type of character that they want to play as, and the choices throughout the game are not arbitrary.

I think the game does a good job of keeping you invested in the story if you're the type of player who likes to explore. 
It definitely has a lot of content, and there's a lot of cool weapons and character classes to play as too.

Pros:
• It has a very large world to explore.
• It gives you a lot of freedom in which path you want your character to follow.
• You get to choose your character's race, class, religion, and much more. 

Cons:
• Some players are a bit frustrated with the combat mechanics and prefer the style of combat in Dragon Age Origins.
• Overall, the world is really big, and I think players might be a bit overwhelmed by how much there is to do. (This one's kinda nit-picky, but I think it's a fair criticism.)
•There is a lot of grinding in the game, but it's not nearly as bad as some MMO's.",1680809123,1680809123,True,5,0,0.578064084053039551,0,True,False,False

Starting off, though I might be a little late to the experience, the fan support is incredible to this day. Players really enjoy the series and actively communicate that. It adds onto the gameplay, because guides, tutorials, and even memes have already been created to help ease new players into the community. I personally love how welcoming the fans are to others and think it’s important to state. 

Now onto the main part: how well produced is Dragon Age: Inquisition? 
The graphics, especially from that time, compared to the other games both produced by BioWare and other companies, are outstanding. It’s a very beautiful game and between that and specifically choosing what armors your character (and their companions) wear, what they look like, the animals they can ride, creates total immersion for the player. Inquisition gives so much control for people to make this game their own story, and that’s the main reason I enjoy it. There are many different locations, and all have different weathers, environments, and passive animals/npcs. From actual towns to full on castles and royalty; the game has it all. It’s an open world role-playing game that sticks close to the actual storyline, which is continued from previous games, but gives so much leverage over when and how to complete it. There’s plenty of side quests, companion-based quests, achievements, easter eggs, specific events, dlcs, and minor details that really draw the bigger picture. They even have a modding community that produces fan-made additions that players can add to their game. 
When beginning, I was tipped off by a friend that I should create an elf mage, for plotline reasons. The game features 3 different classes: warriors, rogues and mages. All 3 have subsections for specifics, like rogues that wield daggers and others that use a bow and arrow. There are 4 races to choose from, the options being human, elf, dwarf, and qunari; the 3 main ones are common to the fantasy genre but qunari are a new addition to the series. I was thrilled to see the addition and initially wanted to create a rogue qunari, but ultimately took my friend’s advice and created an elf mage. The character customization is so in-depth. It ranges from a whole color circle for inner eye colors to nose positions and eyelash colors. It’s incredible to have so much freedom to create a specific appearance for the main character.
One dislike I have is the dragon age keep, I’m not a fan, and I don't like using it due to its confusing layout but it’s necessary for full immersion. During this confusion, I accidentally used the default world format, instead of my specific story from the past which led to minor disappointments throughout the playthrough but not enough to drive me away from the actual plotline. After creating your main character, you jolt right into the storyline and meet your just-as-confused custom character as well as the first of many companions. Most dialogue is scripted, even for the player, but the option to make decisions comes frequent; ranging from 2-10+ tone-indicated responses/questions that really give a personal touch. I adore this aspect of self-creation and got attached to my custom character quickly, given that I was able to make her exactly how I envisioned. After gaining control of the character, you go through a set of tutorials that guide you through basic key binds and general mechanics, such as fighting, healing, inventory control, looting, etc. The guide was simple and easy to understand while the story leaves you confused and curious. The storyline really revolves around the player and the ability to do side quests and companion-based ones aren’t time-related at all. You can spend hours on end doing just side quests, exploring, and resource gathering without it actually affecting the plotline. You get so much freedom to experience the foreign world and really dive into companion complexes, locations and small little nick-nacks that develop both the character and the connection to the game. It’s important to note that if you just spent ~40 hours doing the main plotline quests and quickly moving on, that the experience would be disconnected and ultimately create a neutral opinion; you have to inspect every aspect of the game to understand it, as well as explore the other two games. It’s incredibly in-depth and gives so much freedom to the player to pick and choose how they want to enjoy it.
The base mechanics are adaptable, like changing key binds and controls, graphics, resolution, audio, subtitles and much more. They really created a game that was accessible to many and for that, I’m a fan. It’s relatively easy to correct certain quirks that come up, like inevitable bugs and glitches, and continue with your gameplay afterwards. I spent roughly ~100 hours on my first playthrough over about a month and I still have content I could go back and complete; I only finished 57% of all content presented in DA: I. There’s multiple DLCs available to complete that add questlines and plotlines to the world, as well as mods and other gameplay features that can be downloaded from fans themselves. 
The companions that the player meets are incredible and easily my favorite part of this entire game. There’s an approval system for the inner circle, a handful of characters that the main character either meets through the plotline or can seek out and invite them to join the player, and the advisors are characters that guide the story along. You get 3 advisors and 9 inner circle companions. None of the advisors can be brought with the player but those in the inner circle can be used to help fight enemies and complete quests, as well as learn about their character qualities and involvement within the faction when accompanied. Each character has a set of morals and approvals, as well as character development; this leads to disagreements between characters and the player, including plotline nudges. You can bring 3 of the 9 inner circle characters with you at a time, all specifically having a class and set of abilities available. This leads to the idea that 8 of the 12 total companions can be romanced by the player, depending on gender, race and total approval. Though, the player can choose not to romance anyone, and no plotline difference will be felt. It gives another freedom that people can indulge in and experience, as well as create moral complexes and overall character depth.

Overall, Dragon Age: Inquisition is incredibly fun, interesting, and in the end, a total experience the player can walk away with. I’d definitely recommend playing it, even once, or if you buy the game on a whim during one of the frequent sales or even watching a playthrough of it from another person! It’s so involved and keeps reeling me in every time I think I figured it all out. The future games are definitely going to be on my wish list, and everyone should at least look over the series. Out of 10, it’s a solid 8.9.",1680281423,1680281588,True,19,0,0.712593257427215576,0,True,False,False

I adore all the games for their own purposes. Dragon Age Inquisition is an absolutely beautiful game, with such lovable characters that I got attached to. I recommend DAI as well as the previous two games to anyone. The visuals are stunning, the story interesting and immersive, although you do have to give it a bit of time to build up. 
Inquisition is a bit of a new direction taking the main character and making them the head of a whole organisation. You meet exciting new characters, with plenty of variety. Chances are you'll find at least one you really like and another who you dislike. This I find really great. Trying to keep everything moving and together whilst the sky is being torn open.

In my opinion it's a great game and enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of the series. It does have some flaws though.

The pros:
-Beautiful graphics, with stunning views and locations
-Fun companions with banter you want to listen to
-Plenty of romance options
-Nice variety of mounts
-You get to literally play judge and executioner
-Brilliant lore
-Character creation exists
-Companion Cole, you get to actually piece together his odd behaviour and reasons behind them throughout the environment, chat to him about it and play a direct role in helping him in his character development
-Emotional plot
-Amazing music and sound

Cons:
-Whilst pretty, the open world tends to feel very empty
-Too many side-quests making you run from one end of the map to the other
-War map-only missions should have had way more engagement, especially the character specific quest
-Character creation is quite lacking, especially the hair department
-Companions should have more story, scenes, chatting options, banter - I found I got to Skyhold and was out of chat options with my companions already (apart from quest-specific lines)
-Romance options could be more varied, I would have absolutely loved to work towards a possible relationship with Cole - a fascinating character
-Would've really enjoyed more variety and engagement in the actual combat with more interesting and newer spells (I tend to play a mage character)

The pros are that you can finally play as a Kossith, Cassandra is a companion, finally meets the child born from Morrigan's Ritual, Hawke shows up, finally reveals Flemeth secret, and best of all is way longer than DAII. Now while it looks like their is a lot of pros their actually is more flaws. Their is a lot of pointless features like horses, skyhold customization, and jumping. They game is trying hard to be a open world RPG even though it's not. It's basically plays like DAII but with a jump button. They give your character an origin but it don't even come into play for the main game. But the worse aspect of the game is the terrible story. The Mage vs Templar wars is not interesting in the slightest and Corypheus is not a good antagonist. Corypheus was basically winging it the entire time. He was just a fool that was being used by and hypocrite. The DLCs didn't add much to the game and charging for the true epilogue is very scummy.

[b]What It Is:[/b]
The third entry in the Dragon Age series, a continuation of the previous stories without a necessity for having played the previous entries.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
You do a ton of exploring through very well decorated worlds, fight in real time or stop and go combat, and uncover mysteries by solving puzzles. If you've played DAO and DA2 this game feels like it is smack in the middle of those two in terms of gameplay.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Relatively trivial, although there is a huge disparity in the leveling of certain areas within the game. There are many times you will find yourself having to come back to areas you previously attempted to clear of quests simply because you are not the appropriate level to complete those quests.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Quite good, while I wouldn't call the engine's models realistic, they are believable and that's all a game needs. I do use ReShade on this particular game to push FHDR, DPX, and sharpen tools, giving an even richer tone to the entire scene. That being said, on its own it has quite good color grading and art direction (as with all DA titles).

[b]Audio:[/b]
Sound effects are top of the line, but that's where it stops. Balancing of sound effects is poor, characters repeat the same audio cues too often, the voice acting of almost every other person but David Sterne is sub-par for the budget of the title. Some tertiary one off characters actually have better VA than some companions, and holy cow are the menu sounds too loud! Our cast includes such hits as 'Iron Buzz Lightyear', 'Never Shuts the Hell Up', and 'Microphone without Proper Dampening'.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
Low. I wouldn't consider this game worth replaying, especially given the length and time gated nature of its content. If this game was a better experience with less filler, it would be well worth it. As it is, I can't see the value in slogging through the prologue to even get to mild enjoyment in the mid game.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
The lore and world building. That is the biggest draw of this particular DA to me. It might not meet the bar in many, many, many other areas but lore is a rich part of DAI. Much like Witcher and Deus Ex, you'll find a myriad of documents creating a rich story environment and developing character personalities in the world around you.

If you can get past some of the awful voice acting (especially those horrible French accents) the writing is actually quite good in a lot of these characters. They have worries, hopes, fears, etc. The ones that have any kind of dialogue availability always interest me with what they have to say.

[b]What I Don't[/b]
This game is a AAA title that bit off more than it could chew. It's got all the wrong parts of an RPG experience at the forefront, and the right parts in the arse end. Now I understand I am only 30 hours in, but if I am not having fun 30 hours in, there is a serious issue with this game. 

Combat is slow, methodical, and pointless. XP is a wash in most fights, with you gaining roughly .5% XP for killing a large enemy that might take you a full five minutes to kill. Now this might be excusable if XP was plentiful in other areas, but it isn't. It's a slog to level up, and the reward at the end of the tunnel is not worth it at all.

The skills in this game suck. Half of each skill tree is essentially useless, and what is there are such boring, boiler-plate RPG attacks. Say what you will about DA2's faster combat and ludicrous speed, it may have felt rushed but at least it was entertaining. At least you began to feel a difference in power as you leveled and acquired new gear, here there's nothing of the sort. Most of all, it made combat not take forever to complete.

Loot drops are some of the worst I've ever seen in an RPG, ever. This sounds like exaggeration, but no lie I have played a lot of RPGs and I don't think I've ever been force fed as much garbage gear as this game gives you. Get used to constantly seeing trash. Everything is trash. Trash here, trash there, trash everywhere. I got a level 13 bow about 5 hours in, just now able to use it. Horrible. Level appropriate rare drops are non-existent and those you do find are often overshadowed by your normal leveled weapons. Just not good, at all. Basically the whole loot table boils down to-- craft gear and don't bother looting anything other than treasure, you can buy every material you need and you'll never need to bother with the trash loot system.

Real time waiting for story elements to progress. Holy cow why would anyone, in their right mind, think this an okay, acceptable, or remotely good idea. I paid money for a game, wouldn't you think I want to experience the game's main draw? Well don't get too excited about that, as the game will force you to slog through a ton of side content and boring nonsense in order to acquire power points to progress the story, you know, rather than just telling the story.",1608104785,1679438713,False,6,0,0.488616496324539185,0,True,False,False

Areas are very fun to explore and pretty stunning honestly, and if you like being a completionist and a collectathon then you'll love this probably. 

This game is everything I hoped that it would be and I'm so glad I finally go to play it after all these years. It is a major step above the second game and although less rpg elements of the first, they improved so much that I don't mind that. 

If you have any issues at all with the launcher, the game IS still playable and accessible, you just need to clear the APP Cache.

The protagonist, The Inquisitor needs to bring order and peace to Thedas and close the Breach, facing a known enemy.

As usual, the story and characters are the strong points of Bioware games, see your old friends from DAO and DA2 and meet new ones. When the Inquisitor meets Hawke it's magic.

Tactical Camera is back, although Dragon Age isn't tactical anymore. You can only use 8 abilities, but that's a lot of combos. The skill trees are good,  but I have some complaints...

Why remove the heal spells, I mean, it's an RPG, if you play as a mage you were supposed to heal yourself using spells instead of only using potions. 
You cannot change your specialization.
You can't set the attributes, the game does it for you.

♥ My favorite life ""partner"" in Dragon Age is Cullen, he has a great voice, beautiful soul and body and personality. A very nice guy, as a woman should be, and a friend at the same time^^

♥ I'm terrified of spiders and it was hard to install a mod to make spiders invisible. This was my biggest problem, but we got over it thanks to my beloved Zmiij^^ I wrote an email to the creators about these spiders earlier thanking them for a great series and adventure. I hope that in part 4 it will be easier to ""get rid"" of spiders from the game. I know that even if not, I will still play.

♥ It's a real tearjerker and there were moments that made me so emotional that I had to cry. Because of the beautiful moments and the sad ones.

♥ Thank you also for the beautiful music that I listen to today thousands of times and beautiful songs.

I'm waiting impatiently for part 4 <3 I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WILL BE NEXT
SOLAS, WE WILL SAVE YOU NO MATTER T_T
And by the way, the whole world...

In the end, there's much to love about this game, but many things I wish it did differently or better. I wish there were more difficult and game-changing decisions, more consequences, more main story/character quests, and less of the power grind.

pros:
-dorian
-EIGHT good romances
-funny characters
-trevor morris' MASTAPIECE soundtrack (half the reason the best moments in this game are so good)
-incredible art direction
-well optimized, looks really great for being 8 years old (60 fps in cutscenes is iffy though)
-however you feel about its open world areas, they look beautiful
-the dragons are sick

cons:
-horrible grind
-not many real choices/consequences, unless they're all going to drastically affect DA:D
-protagonist can be a little boring (unless you pick alix wilton reginquisitor; vo's are all pretty good, but never as good as femshep or purple hawke)
-villain is kind of a joke after his first appearance, but has some cool lines and a really awesome voice
-player character walks like they had their spine replaced with a golf club
-combat kinda not very much fun, but i enjoy it more when i do a little cheating
-enemies have too much health
-character creator is so insanely frustrating

Had much more fun the second time around. Good story, good characters, graphics look really amazing for being nearly 8 years old. Improves on a lot of the faults of the other Dragon Age games, but still falls short in some areas. Combat is not for everyone; hated it in my first playthrough, but in my second I had access to mods. The right amount of cheating can vastly improve your experience with the combat, and also the horrible power system. Want to progress in the story? Go grind for two hours. Want to do the next mission? Go grind for three hours. Thankfully there are ways around this when you mod the game, so subsequent playthroughs won't be as boring and grindy. Definitely plan to play it again.

Excellent story and writing, great companions (although I felt romance options were a bit more limited), stunning environments that really warrant exploration and an ending that has me super excited for Dread Wolf. Took me 116 hours to finish (DLC included). I only partially skipped one zone towards the end as I was massively over-levelled. Never found myself bored or wanting to skip to the end, which is incredibly rare with large RPGs or open world games. I recommend this highly!

I will be honest, I'm not a huge fan of BioWare's titles. After playing almost all their games, I do enjoy their reputable RPG formula and the stories they tell. However, it feels like they ignore everything else (like side quests, gameplay, exploration etc.).

Dragon Age Inquisition is the perfect example. I really tried to like this but I'm left with immensely mixed feelings. [b]A lot of aspects like the story, world-building, companions and combat are exceptionally well-done and of high quality, while others (exploration, side quests, some gameplay features) are very bad and annoying.[/b]

For starters, all the quest zones feel exactly the same as the Hinterlands (the starting area). Every single one of them. All filled with the exact same fetch quests - [b]typical MMO filler[/b] - for you to get a tiny bit of companion approval, XP and fame. Most of the side quests you get by finding and reading some letters. It 's best to just ignore everything which is not in the ""Inquistor's Path"" (main story) or ""Inner Circle"" (companions) part of the journal. 

Which leads to another problem - [b]you can't just play the story because you more or less need to grind XP, gear and materials.[/b] Yes, you need to collect tons of materials which you can and should use for upgradings and crafting new gear. Some quests require certain amount of materials to continue, most of the time nothing too crazy but it's worth mentioning because I can see how a lot of players would entirely skip gathering resources. Or you can download some mods.

As for the gameplay itself, [b]the combat is really punchy and spectacular[/b] with lots of spell combos, although a lot of people (mainly Dragon Age Origins fans) don't like the direction BioWare took. I absolutely hate the limited 8 skill slots. It was hard to get excited about levelling up near the end, as any new ability meant the loss of another one I sunk several skill points into already, so I ended up forcing myself on passive abilities. [b]What's more annoying are ""little"" things[/b] like not being able to sprint, the slow movement of the mount you eventually unlock, long looting animations etc. Most of which can, again, be fixed with mods.

As for the positives, main story is quite intriguing and a lot more creative than most fantasies, althought it does have the redundant ""chosen one"" trope. [b]I especially liked the banter between all the different companions.[/b] They will ask each other either serious or dumb questions and tease each other. Some of their dialogues are so good that they actually made me laugh (mostly thanks to Sera). It's one of the reasons why I pushed myself to beat DA:I and get all the achievements. However, the banter in the vanilla game is for some reason so rare that you basically need to, that's right, download some mods.  

[b]Overall, I'm conflicted on whether or not I enjoyed my time with Dragon Age Inquisition, but I wouldn't recommend it simply because there are more negatives than positivies.[/b] I can see why a lot of people might and do enjoy it, but personally I hate MMORPGs and for the most part it felt like a waste of time.",1677827146,1677827146,False,3,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

BEFORE YOU BUY, ask yourself if you have the patience to deal with the EA launcher since sometimes the launcher can bug out when it loses network connectivity and soft lock you out of the game, other times the EA launcher can mess with mods if you plan on installing any. The game is old so if you want to install mods that improve your quality of life and might help make the game more enjoyable then you'll be holding together the mods and the game with tape and band-aids because there's plenty of research and time that will be dedicated to actually making sure they work. 

The game without the use of mods is bloated, like absolutely bloated, like almost as bad as assassins creed bloated but each map has the same types of collectables scattered everywhere and a lot of fetch quests are ""search this area for x"" types of quests that can break you if you don't have the patience for that. Rewards are level and class locked and you'll come across those often IF you can even carry those items because of how small of an inventory space you have. The more people you add to you pool of fighters the more of a hassle it becomes to micromanage their equipment, upgrades, modifications, add-ons etc. The UI can be an absolute mess so just leveling up once can stop the flow of the game with how often you navigate between menus to spend points and potentially equip a new piece of armour you might have been leveling towards. 

The combat without mods is a SLOG, like sorry but don't bother using the tactical camera the AI is dumb and that feature is so limited. For instance fighting dragons in the series is not good (don't worry dragons are kind of an afterthought sometimes you won't be fighting them that much). The AI is not good at detecting environmental hazards so a lot of the time they just stand in hazard while their health chips away and they burn through your potion reserves. With everyone in the party sharing those potions you can see why this can be a problem, allies burning through potions because they won't avoid staying in an area that actively damages them and the AI behaviours you can adjust are VERY limited so you can hardly prepare any contingency plans should something go wrong. Again you'll see how bad these get during dragon fights. Apart from those enemies are very much DPS sponges, you can go through a god rotation of abilities on mini bosses and they'll just soak it up, mind you this is when you exceed the level requirements sometimes. There are bosses that spam defensive armour as well, dragons included, maximum armour or shield you have to burn down again and again which means you essentially have to try and burst them down before they apply more armour like trust me they really spam that a lot. 

Again this is still a soft recommendation since I had the mods work during my playthrough, if you figure out how to make them work and hope and pray that the EA Launcher doesn't screw anything up you can still enjoy the core game, which is still well done, enough of the game has aged well for me to at least appreciate it. Also the story is eeehhh... well for every interesting aspect there's also an aspect that leaves you wondering what the game is even trying to say, but the romances are well done, for 2014 that is. Overall the experience I've had left me very conflicted, but I can't lie when I say I did enjoy myself somewhat.",1677488509,1677488509,True,7,1,0.593799889087677002,0,True,False,False

They also changed the controls in the worst ways. For example, you can't have your character just walk over to things with a click. You have to hold W now. Want to pick up that object over there? Gotta manually go over there to get it. Want to auto-attack? You now have to hold down a button. They went through the trouble of adding a ""tactical mode"" to this game, but in a game series that's liked in part for strategic depth, you now have to hold down a button to have the guy you're controlling at the moment auto-attack.

You will often find yourself stumbling around half the map, bouncing off invisible walls trying to get to a point 10 feet away from where you were standing for no discernible reason except they wanted to annoy the hell out of you.  No matter where you want to go there is a SINGLE unmarked path that you have to find by brute force.  You can’t see it on the map and there is no way to find it except running headfirst into invisible walls until you luck into it.  On some maps its a nightmare on others it’s merely annoying.  2.

For reference I have played through this game twice on my ps3 and my Origins acct (185 hrs) and I have beaten the game. I bought this a couple months back in a bundle with Andromeda (Mass Effect) as I wanted to beat Mass Effect on steam (despite owning both these games on Origin). Alas it was not to be and despite multiple attempts to get into Andromeda, I just can't get immersed in it.  

THIS GAME HOWEVER (DA III)  IS AN AMAZING FEAT OF AN RPG. If you have never played it, do yourself a favour and settle in for an amazing game.

I love the different characters and the different builds as well as the great story and exploration. There's a lot of skills and equipment tweaking you can do for your builds, and a whole cast of characters with back stories. You can romance your team members and explore their unique stories at your own pace - or not at all!

DA III is truly a great game that stands up to today's games as well. I will add that if you are playing the game for the first time, don't try and do everything in the hinterlands right off the bat - collecting this and that, running all over collecting mundane hides and herbs etc or you might get bored like I did on my first play through.

Let's start with the character creator; I absolutely love it and while some more choices in the scar and hair department could've been there, I also have to remind myself that this game is also nearing 10 years of age (which is crazy). 

Once you're done spending probably too much time while still being unhappy with a minor detail of your character you get thrown into the game. Quite literally. The game's start is very fast but the first 3-4 hours take you by the hand well enough to make it work. After your first major quest is finished, the game opens up a lot more and let me tell you: there is A LOT to do. A bit too much for my taste but that's mainly concerning the collectibles/locations you can discover but as a completionist... well. Still, the areas you can explore are all very unique and offer a lot when it comes to quests and lore. And the lore and world-building of Inquisition is exquisite. You learn so much about the Dragon Age world, even if you haven't played the previous games. After a lot of hours the game finishes with a bang and the Trespasser DLC reveals a bit more about all of it. All in all, this game's strong suit really is the story. 

The combat is ... not so great in my opinion. Mages and archers are a lot of fun but close-ranged combat classes feel quite tedious in my opinion. The tactic mode is a nice idea but the controls of it are a bit too all-over the place and some commands are getting kinda ignored by your companions anyway which defeats the purpose of it all. 

Speaking of companions, this installation of Dragon Age is probably the one where I find myself liking your squad the least. Don't get me wrong, the characters are still well-written and intriguing but no one struck me as particularly unique or interesting but that might just be my bias. The dialogue also feels a bit more bland and generic but a lot of that is because of the sheer amount of dialogue and questions the player character. 

TL;DR, DA:Inquisition is definitely a great game when it comes to exploration and experiencing an epic story. The companions are fun to get to know but most lack that certain kinda something the previous installments have. Still a very solid game with lots of hours to play even if exploration can get a bit repetitive. 7.5/10.",1676307983,1676307983,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

DA:Inquisition is a fine entry to the now trilogy in the series. Story & characters are ok but your part in it and how you end it doesn't hold a candle to DA:Origins. Gameplay is more smoother and streamlined than DA2 & DA:Origins. Includes the best skill tree in the series IMO but classes have no common skills.

Semi open world exploration is the core gameplay loop for crafting & hidden items, although tedious and not as rewarding like Witcher 3 or The Elder Scrolls.
Combat is decent doesn't have finishers like the previous titles a bummer there although the animations and general feel is much better.

Lot's of roleplaying and lots of story telling plus you are the center of the game and as you make choices so does the game present your actions to you.

-------------------------

This game is PURE WASTE OF MONEY! They should pay ME to have this installed.

To my huge surprise this game is still full of bugs after so many years after release.
And so much other bad stuff that makes it completely unplayable, or at least without any enjoyment.

- Characters get stuck mid-battle without any actions or movement.
- Some spells are so buggy they make you lose any fight. Like ""raging bull"" being unstoppable and your tank is suddenly the other side of the map, letting your whole party being killed. Not even close enough to taunt.
- Some fights are so unbalanced with your level and the quest line that after many save-and-loads I installed a cheat engine to win them, and even then it was hard!!!
- The new game engine (as compared to precious DA's) is so buggy that this game is worse than any predecessor dragon age. Intuitive targeting, moving around, rotating, character select, and walls are blocking sight, ..unbelievable this is made after the year 2000 and after all its predecessors. 

Worse Dragon Age later in time?? WOW!! Nice development company! (sarcasm of course)

After having played all dragon age games, this is the worst yet and though I tried to get my best anti-frustration helmet on to get through all these horrors (not the monsters, but game atrocities), I cannot continue to play.

Pros:
•	Locations are atmospheric
•	Interesting characters with background
•	Pretty good plot
•	Good RPG component
•	Engaging combat
Cons:
•	Open world for the sake of open world
•	Feels like MMO RPG, with online cut
•	No sprint and bad horse riding
•	Hissing Wastes is 2 times larger than any loc and just a desert
•	Climbing is tough
Summary:
Personally I enjoyed the game, although there were frustrating moments and mechanics. The main reason not to play the game is if you need the good open world or if you prefer strategic combat to action. But all other things are present: beautiful locations, vast RPG component, epic soundtrack, realistically written characters. Made me want to play previous games in the franchise. Although the beginning could seem pretty boring, many may be deceived by it. If not vacuuming the whole first location at once, but mix it with the main quests the things start to change, as the main story line is awesome. And last but not least, there is a multiplayer mode, so you can play with friends and other players.",1675445572,1675445572,True,1,0,0.511349320411682129,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue for me was that the main plot and side quests are so uninspired, it gives the feeling that you're playing an MMORPG in solo.

Positive:
[list]
[*]The game world is stunning and beautifully crafted; each region looks different
[*]Great companions
[*]The lore of Thedas is substantial and layered, there are plenty of dialog options and codexes
[*]Good for new players, it is much easier than the previous games
[*]Fun and variable abilities and cool sub class builds

Negative:
[list]
[*]Uninteresting story and antagonist
[*]Closing rifts, making camps and collecting junk feels endless
[*]Horrendous console-ish UI
[*]No photo mode (DAI Cinematic Tools didn't work for me)
[*]Lot of glitches and texture pop-in
[*]Absolute trash EA app (or Origin)

Some tips that will vastly improve the overall enjoyment:
Turn up the difficulty and use the ingame trial challenges if you want the true Dragon Age experience.

While this was my first introduction to the Dragon Age series, I had played it originally on the Xbox many years ago. In both playthroughs, I was baffled by the highs and lows of the game. The atmosphere is like none other, and the tension of being chased by eldrich horrors through forgotten catacombs was unforgettable. On the other hand, being assaulted by minute long load times, having allies bug out and refuse to fight,  falling off the map, and buggy or unclear quest triggers brought me to the verge of quitting the game more than I can count. I also installed multiple QOL (instant missions, tactician's renewal shop, optimization) mods that helped somewhat, but did not alleviate many of the underlying issues in the game. 

I also want to give my thoughts on leveling/combat/talents in a separate section, as I have so many conflicting thoughts about it. Talent trees were great - love building my ideal class archetype, and many of the skills were really interesting and well balanced. However, enemies end up having massive health and damage at higher levels, forcing more dps-oriented teams. Originally, I had planned to run dual tanks, with a rogue/mage support but had to transition my MC to a two-handed mDPS and my tank to an off-tank. The stats are also not introduced in a way that is beginner-friendly. To this day, I have a vague idea of what stats to stack for what class after reading countless guides, but should you invest your abilities wrongly you're essentially hardstuck - your dps and health will not be able to keep up with higher leveled enemies. 

Personally, near the end I was just hoping to get the story over with. I don't mind keeping some tabs open while playing the game, but doing so **and** having the guide say 'this quest might not be complete-able due to long load times' leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Hell, one may wonder how did the same studio release this and something as utterly barbaric as ME: Andromeda. While I wish I could say DA:I got on my auspicious list of the ""Games I'd replay"", I ought to be honest and confess the sole reason for me replaying the game was the fact I have given up finishing it in the past as I was furious at Bioware for ending the core game with a CLIFFHANGER so directionless and one that left too many questions out in the open (especially considering the plot of the upcoming sequel).

So, if it were not for the facts that DA:I GOTY Edition has all DLCs included and that the core game stood the test of time, this review would have gone in a whole different direction.

Technically wise, the game ran smoothly with but a few glitches. However, the few that have sucked the joy out of my run-through at times -- most of which were attributed to clunky and barely functional companion AI, alongside the complete flop of The Descent DLC that was ruined by the single decision to place infinite mob spawn in a dungeon tremendously scarce with save points, which eventually ruined otherwise alright-ish DLC.

[b]Overall, at the price of 8€, it would be a shame to miss out on everything this game has to offer -- regardless of questionable DLC strategy and dum-dum companions.[/b]",1675103795,1675107062,True,1,0,0.506976723670959473,0,True,False,False

Then I played Inquisition for the first time and man, i loved it all. Gameplay felt fresh, story was more than amazing, characters from previous games returning to the game, I just loved it. Some years later, I came back to the game to make a new save, and I felt nostalgic because it felt as If I was playing Dragon Age I and was getting a different path from my previous save.
I heard the next game is in Alpha Stage and that hyped me up so much.

My direct thoughts without looking at other reviews, which I later found to be shared, is this is like Skyrim and Mass Effect or Divinity had a baby and it just hits right.

DAI is a pretty good game, with many flaws. I enjoyed my time with it for the most part, however, near the end I got burned out because of all the side content that is quantity over quality. In these side quests, there's sometimes a good story or fun designed level but it's hard to know whether you'll get something good or yet another generic one.

Overall, I liked this game, but I would recommend getting it on sale.
I'd say that for me, the dragon age franchise is ranked in the following order:
1. DAO
2. DAI
3. DA2

[h2]Story:[/h2]
+Most of the companions are pretty good

~Sometimes you have to stop thinking about it, but overall it's fairly decent
~The war table operations are so-so, there's so much of them that it's nearly impossible to do them all in one playthrough, but I liked the idea

-The main villain is awfully generic and boring
-A lot of side villains that aren't fleshed out and are just meh

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]
+Better than DA2 but not as good as DAO, it finds a balance between style and substance
+Interesting and a new way to present Thedas
+The crafting system is great, I'm normally never a fan of crafting in games, but here it has a certain depth in how you want to craft it
+Sad that I even have to say it, but I'm glad they brought back armor for companions

~Dragons are fairly fun to fight, but they're all re-skins
~The side content is better than DA2, but there's too much of it
~Nightmare difficulty felt like a perfect fit for me at the start till like half of the game, but then it just gets mind-numbingly easy
~Not enough spell slots for a mage, but it suffices

-The world suffers from the Ubisoft syndrome
-Most side quests are either fetch quests or go there and do/kill this
-Selecting a party before going out is a bit annoying
-The combat gets stale near the end, maybe it's because I was a knight-enchanter though

[h2]Visuals:[/h2]
+Has a good art direction to it
+UI looks better again, the UI in DAO is still the easiest to navigate through imo

-Facial animations are wonky
-Hair looks very bad
-Riding a mount feels stiff because of the shitty animation
-Almost all cutscenes had some sort of weird thing going on, so it's hard to take it seriously
-Those face masks in Orlais look so bad, they are just floating on their foreheads

[h2]Audio:[/h2]
+Music in the bars, they even keep playing music if you pause, and their mouths keep moving along as well
+Voice acting is pretty good in general

-Some spells are ear rape at best, for example combining Static Cage and Fire Mine is a clusterfuck (also visually), and then you could add Energy Barrage to that, not fun for the ears. But then again it is fun to see so much destruction.",1674653513,1674772489,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The world is really well made. A lot of beautiful places to visit with medium to huge maps, really cool designs for some zones and really atmospheric. The care and attention they put in designing the environment is really something else and i'm glad they managed to make the game as they wanted. I'm kinda sad that we didn't have as many places to visit in Val Royeaux and i kinda wanted to visit the other cities from Dragon Age Origins. Hopefully we will get to do that in the 4th installment.


The combat felt better than the second game, but not that good over all. I played as a two handed warrior and at times i felt like a rag doll being thrown around like nothing. Wished some enemies didn't have that much power that completely negated my armor and stats and just sent me flying.


The itemization was meh. There were some good and cool looking unique items but most of the items in the game were useless when you got your hands on some crafting materials and crafted something.


The crafting was welcomed, but they could have implemented a better system. At times i was going through lists and lists to find what material was better and the fact that they were not sorted by power really annoyed me.


The story was really good to be honest. The first time playing the game i really didn't suspect a thing about Solas and who he was. The main missions were good, some side missions were interesting, but there were the boring fetch quests that had to be implemented to populate the world. Wish they will improve on the side activities in the future and go the route The Witcher 3 did where every side quest had it's little story to tell and it felt refreshing every time.


The companions are, like in every bioware game, the soul of the game. Really loved the banter between them during missions and exploring. Kinda sad that i only play a certain party (Solas, Cassandra, Varric) and never get the chance to see the other interact, but oh well.

-Cassandra at first is this battle hardened warrior that takes no jokes and can kill you by just staring at you. She does open up and becomes a really likable character as you get to know her and even romance her like i did in my time playing.

-Sera is an annoying little kid. She is stuck in her ways of thinking and nobody can make her see otherwise. She was a good addition to the party, even tho she was annoying, because of her lively personality and her playful mood.
 
-Blackwall was boring for me. Didn't invest that much into playing with him except when doing his quest. He felt sketchy from the start and i knew something was up with him and he was lying about something.

-Iron Bull was a nice addition to the party even tho i never had him in my active party. Loved his dialogue with my qunari inquisitor. Really love a thing about him, his attachment to his squad.

-Vivienne is a power hungry mage that would see here fellow mages stuck in circle towers than let them be free. Really hated her and even more after end credits seeing here grabbing power.

-Cole was meh. Interesting personal quest, but that's about it.

-Dorian was a cool dude. Loved his personal quest and i was glad when he called my qunari inquisitor his best friend if not his only friend.

-Solas, oh my dear Solas. He had me fooled the first time i played this game at release. Really loved his character and liked that he did give small hints here and there about who he is and what he wants to do when questioning my qunari inquisitor about how he felt in certain situations.

-Varric just like in Dragon age 2 was the shinning star of the companion roster. Kinda sad Sanders was not in this game, would have loved to see them banter again.


DLCs where good, was not expecting to enjoy them as much as i did.
-The decent was a nice little story that gave us more information about the dwarves and their back story. The end boss was kinda annoying.
-Jaws of Hakkon was really cool, from the environment to the quests and the story was fire.
-Trespasser is the crowning jewel of dlcs and every developer should make at least one dlc like this one. It gave us more time with the cast, rounded up some story points from the main game and pointed us in the direction of the next game.


This game was a good investment money and time wise. I wish people would see past the bad always required connection to ea launcher and just enjoy the game.

It gives the impression that Bioware had a different game in mind while developing Inquisition and ended up scrapping together a bunch of systems and mechanics and called it a day. 

The combat has been streamlined and can be mind-numbing at times, the skill trees are simplified and stupid-proof and the game simply feels unbalanced all around with pacing issues. How is a Dragon easier to kill than a Troll in the same zone? Simply baffling. 

The narrative isn't gripping at all, simply another ""I'm the chosen one"" story trope which bored me half the time.

This game took me way to long to complete. I have it on the Xbox 360 but I just never finished it. Hardest part of course is creating your character and picking a class, this alone takes me an hour to pick something I like. You can choose between a Human, Elf, Dwarf and Qunari. The classes you can choose from is fighter, your front line fighter that protects allies or a more scrapper role where you rend your enemies with a greatsword for heavy damage. The rogue, who is sneaky and can backstab enemies for additional critical damage or can choose to fight with a bow at distance relying on evasion to stay safe. The mage, who relies on magic spells to deal massive amounts of damage or to control the battlefield with control magic and keeping allies safe in a fight. Much later in the game, each class can choose a specialist class with extra addition support for your playstyle.

The plot of the game is pretty ok, I did had to go back to the wiki to learn about certain things again. There is a lot to do in this game, and I mean a lot. Now of course this only means something if you plan to do everything. If you don't want to do everything the game has to offer or you find it a chore, the playtime will be drastically less of course. While I personally feel its worth it to go for everything, I will admit it does feel chore like after the 4th day of playing. There is always something to look out for, with the the companions you can recruit along the way being the best part the game offers. This group of crazy people who help you along the way is amazing, especially if you take your time to talk to all of them and help them out with their own personal requests.

The game of the year edition also has the problem of not labelling its DLC content, so I actually did two of the DLCs by accident thinking it was part of the main game. The first one I did, I was the correct level for it but by the end of it I walked out of there like a god with the most broken gear I could find and nothing els I found afterwards could beat it. Not complaining, but I don't think it was design to be played like this. So just a small gripe I have.

At the end of the day, there is not much to say about this game. It gave me around 84 hours of entertainment, I spend my week vacation on this game and I had a lot of fun all the way. This is a great game to play if you love to pause the game and observe the battlefield first, moving your warriors to the front and the mages at the back for the best tactical advantage. It's not 100% turn based combat, but you can pause anytime and scout out the battlefield first. It's a great tactical game with plenty of fantasy RPG stuff to do. If you like to punch dragons and make questionable dialog choices that make your rogue frown down upon you, this is the game for you. Rather start with number one and two of course, but number one is extremely dated for today so you might want to skip to number two. I won't tell you how to play, the choice is yours.

Despite following on from the finale of DA2, there's a clean enough break to jump in from the start and know enough to understand the state of the world. The central conflict established at the end of 2 was between the Mages and the Templars and though this isn't ignored, it is broadly resolved quickly in lieu of a more identifiable antagonist. The narrative does spin this to its advantage, however, ultimately to tell the story of power, corruption and the nobility of truth. Of course as it's a BioWare RPG, the broad strokes of which you align with is up to you. I wouldn't say there are any distinctly hard moral choices to be made, but there is some freedom to how you develop the world and how you run the titular Inquisition. 

Supporting you are a stable of generally interesting characters and plenty of opportunity to mix and match them in your current party. There's a heaping of patented party banter giving you a great sense of who these people are that allows them to become more fully realised, along with their downtime conversations in your hub and subsequent bespoke quests. This leads to probably my greatest criticism regarding the role-playing element however, that the character traits you leaned into in conversations in DA2 are seemingly no longer present. For example, in DA2 if you kept picking sarcastic responses in conversations eventually you'd be served fewer other personality options and just different sarcastic takes and so on. That really sold you forging the protagonist, rather than picking the same type of responses to maintain your own sense of who this person is. 

Though the playable areas are all divided into large open-world sandboxes, this never really plays an interesting role in combat. There may be some obviously placed explosive barrel equivalents, or ridges you can rain arrows down from, but nothing to really let you take advantage of a large pool of abilities. That said many abilities do combo off others by way of various status effects which can include cross-class syncing. This encourages you to keep a party of varied classes, not to mention the odd class-specific locks and exploratory puzzles, and then learning what each party member really contributes. Some new layers to combat from DA2 give it an interesting extra step of complexity, albeit with a slightly steeper learning curve. Additionally, early game can seem quite slow when you have few abilities and have cooldowns meaning you are quite reliant on auto-attacks.

There's a comprehensive gathering and crafting system which if fully utilised allows for a variety of extreme benefits, from over-powered gear to various potions and tonics that aid in you battles. This is especially useful for healing, again notably early game, when your means to provide temporary defences are minimal and you can find yourself chugging down limited potions before having to return to camp to refill. Combined with a fairly aimless open world area to start with and the opening few hours do not feel as refined as you'd hope. That said as the game moves on and you unlock more areas they become better paced and varied in environment and difficulty. 

It's very easy to get lost in the world though, from exploring every nook and cranny to find the fortunately spartan collectables or because you've picked up a quest that has you searching for clues as to how to proceed. Though you can get a mount to move along quickly, this comes at the expense of not hearing party banter and with most of the fast travel locations being smarty spaced out, running along with your group to hear them chatter amongst themselves can be satisfying enough.

The main DLC content, The Descent, Jaws of Hakkon and Trespasser, add well to the world. The Descent tells an interesting narrative along a far more linear route, but filled with rather challenging combat and whilst Jaws of Hakkon also tells another fairly standalone story it is more in-keeping with the rest of the game's open world design. Though not uninteresting, Hakkon very much feels like more of what the base game offered, but without anything super interesting to make it particularly rise above what else is on offer. Descent, meanwhile, holds an intriguing mystery to keep its momentum up.

Trespasser, however, is far more concerned with providing an epilogue to the story of the main game, as well as establishing the antagonist for the sequel. The situation this DLC offers is unique compared to the rest of the game, as well as giving opportunity to spend a bit more time with characters, see how they've been doing since their interactions with you and offering a compelling mystery of its own through a mix of cool environments. Despite the base game offering an enjoyable and fitting conclusion to the narrative it introduced, Trespasser offers a more exciting and tantalising prospect of what is to come.

Inquisition offers a lot and the majority of it is fantastically crafted. The combat can be enjoyable complex, albeit with some questionable AI decision making at times, the role-playing is deep and engrossing and the world to explore looks great and is generally well designed to keep things varied and interesting. I was unsure at the start, but by the end of my time with it I came to utterly adore the game.

Yes, it's a little bit watered down in some ways compared to Origins but don't be fooled: this is still a very good and high quality (by now) game that offers almost everything you've come to love from BioWare. You can feel that there is passion behind it. 
I did not like the fighting and skill system at first but found that it actually offers some depth and is pretty satisfying, especially on the highest difficulty with modifiers etc. Origins still takes the cake here, though.

The controls are a downgrade but are somewhat customizable. The tactical cam is servicable once you got the controls down. Sadly worse than in Origins, Maker knows why...

Many hate on the ""neverending"" MMORPG-like fetch quests when you don't have to do a single one. Just ignore the Requisition Officer everywhere - done.

Everything minus the main story, side content and combat are really well done, the reason Im saying this is the ultimate entry point is because the next game will have super high stakes that are better understood if you beat the third DLC of Inquisition.

The down sides are getting your head around not being a hoarder as you will find a lot to pick up but little of it you will actually needed.

By that i mean Inquisition's [b]devs made TOO BIG game.[/b] There is a lot of unnecessary things - picking soooooooo many flowers (or minerals or whatever) after beating boss was real my dream to do in DA ;-; Not to mention the number of maps...

But i would not complain if ""being too much"" was the only problem of Inqusition. The thing that hurts me the most is that [b]this game isn't good balanced.

But the most ridiculous thing is that there are some moments in the game where you can easily beat idk 5-6 monsters on lvl 12 but 3 minutes later you see another kind of monsters also on lvl 12 but they are VERY VERY MUCH STRONGER. hOwiAsk

[h1]OPTIMIZATION[/h1]
Okay but let's talk about optimization. I didn't have huge problems with glitches or bugs in the whole game. Until Trespasser DLC. Holy heck, that was hell. The game crashed every 10 or so minutes with no reason and every loading screen lasted forever. Thanks to that, i couldn't enjoy the story, i was just praying for not stopping the game again.

[b]If you also have problem with optimization - here's what helped me:
- changing resolution to lower;
- playing in windowed mode;
- changing all graphic settings to lower;
- deactivating all mods;
- changing party members;
- saving game 999999 times a minute c:[/b]

[h1]WORTH PLAYING?[/h1]
Despite all this sins, despite all bad things Inquisition has, i think that it is really worth playing. Even for the story.

(since there's no in between option is there..) Compared to the previous dragon age games? I think it falls short. It's a good game, but it's a whole lot of fluff in between the good bits. It gets INCREDIBLY tedious. If you like exploring for hours on end, then this game is for you. If you want to get straight to the story and have a terrible sense of direction, I do not recommend it. Maybe it's the nostalgia speaking, but this game falls very short in comparison to DA Origins and DA2, though it's not likely any other game would beat the likes of Origins nowadays. Perhaps Baldur's Gate 3 would be what you're looking for if you want a sort of spiritual successor (complex companions and companion quests, strategic combat, campfire romances.. and compelling dialogue and choices!)

I know there's a great story hidden underneath the TERRIBLE filler, and the companions are wonderful. Solas has got to be one of the greatest ""romances"" (if you know you know.. ) Bioware has written. And it's absolutely beautiful.. if not for the janky and cringeworthy animations. At times it can feel unresponsive, and glitches, bugs and crashes are not uncommon. You can spend hours in this game, but most of it is wandering around closing rifts and killing idiot monsters and doing tedious side quests instead of engaging with the rpg elements and main story, which is the main aspect that got me into the series. WHY does it play like a bad mmorpg? who thought players would enjoy doing the most tedious garbage ever? It's okay if your game is short! It just has to be good! I do not want future installments to end up like this game!!

UPDATE: Also, this game is pretty much unplayable on modern pcs. EA has not bothered with optimisation or updating it. I have tried every solution online and have now given up getting it to launch on my new PC. Even if it may end up working for you, it should NOT be this hard trying to get a game to launch when no other games have this issue. Mass Effect, Origins and DA2 work just fine.

I might even buy it at full price back in the day. The game itself provides at least 70+ hours of gameplay (if you are into side quests, of course) which is a nice duration for a game in its genre, I think.

- Story
- Companionship development
- Companion banters (some are comedy gold lmao)

- Choices matter (Trespasser spoiler: [spoiler] I'm so glad that I chose to save the chargers [/spoiler]

There are also things that mind slap you out of immersion from time to time:
- Face animation (well, it's BioWare alright)
- Accessible area not quite clear sometimes (I hate sliding down a hill I just climbed up, damn it)

The plot of the game is superb, especially when you have ""dragon age keep"".

Fighting is a bit mild because you just need to press and hold ""R"", plus some numbers to combine skills

Looting animation is extremely stupid because you can not skip it

Travelling also is a shame although it has a so called ""mount"", which is slightly faster than walking

And buying item one by one is another frustrating feeling as we need a lot of crafting materials in the game

The game is wonderful in lots of aspects, mainly the environment and companions.

The points that I hate on this game are related to:

- Mage gameplay: If you've played Dragon Age Origins, I believe you will find mage inquisitor boring. I've really liked the idea of arcane warrior on DAO, but there is nothing like this on both DA2 and DAI besides Knight Enchanter (Single skill);

- DLCs: I've seen lots of people with an old issue like I was facing, and EA don't even seem to care about it. Basically, you can't have access to any DLC. I've found a solution made by the community, but you have no access to play DAI online if you use it.
Also, I believe I've passed more time pissed off with the DLC situation than playing them.
https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/3779


- Bugs: There's a stressful bug during the combat that simply blocks some characters movements. When this happen, I always need to jump or cast an skill in order to fix it.

I hope DA4 be much better than DAI. and also hope that EA do a good fix for the DLC access (I'm almost sure this will never happen).

I'm just recommending the game because I've liked most part of it, because the DLC issue really made me disappointed.",1672344224,1672886201,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I won't bother waxing on about how there's too much mmo style filler in the mix, that's definitely been covered by others. 

But honestly I feel as though the thing that made me really connect with this game is that your actions ACTUALLY feel like they matter. I play tons and tons of choices matter style games, and inevitably they all seem to just let you bullshit your way into what you want at critical moments regardless of the choices you made earlier. Not DAI, in this game it GENUINELY matters what choices you have made, and each and every character has absolute novels of development behind them. And even the aforementioned MMO style tasks peppered throughout the game can affect the overall game progression. The game will absolutely let you butcher your choices and suffer bad consequences as a result. Also look at my playtime, im only about halfway through the game based on what i've researched.

I HIGHLY suggest you follow the launch guides here on steam to increase your FPS, also don't try to play this with keyboard and mouse, it's an absolute chore. A gamepad just makes everything feel much smoother and more manageable. And pro-tip: You can just manually adjust your clock on your pc to progress the war table missions without actually waiting.

A lot of fans consider Origins the best part of all three released and i am actually agree on that, but Inquisition in general almost just as good.

IMO, the best traits of the game are:
1) An open world.
Yes, some people do not really like to gather elfroots half of the playthrough, but it is actually a common thing, that's what RPG IS. I am, for example, excited to gather plants and metals to be able to craft a decent equipment in the future. It is the part of immersion in game. While you are looking for your elfroot, you will find a lot of hidden places, and you will 100% enjoy it.
2) Locations and general look of the game.
For 2014' the game is really good, especially if you play in Ultra. It is just beautiful. Deep roads, the Dales, forests and cities, everything. It is really nice to look at, and I especially like distinction between dwarven, elven and tevinter buildings, each location has unique cultural background, but they do not look the same.
3) Fan's content.
A LOT of easter eggs, some of them I notice even at 5th playthrough, it always bring the game a new perspective. Your choices from previous games are not so important, but visible.
4) Atmosphere/creatures/music.
All good and enjoyable, really. Diversity of creatures, like giants and dragons, cannot be unnoticed.
5) Characters. 
Unlike Inquisitor, most of their companions are extremely well-written, in my opinion. The system of approval/personal quests is not new, but well built in game.

So the opinion is good in general, but I would like to point out weak trairs of the game if anyone read until this sentense and interested:
1) The plot.
Yep, the plot. The game is good as an expansion of the Origins world, let's admit it. The story about a chosen one is not new and unlikely interesting, as well as Inquisitor's ultimate lack of personality.  Main character is boring. Very.
2) Armor, namely the lack of it. Every armor you found and craft look the same (with a few exceptions). It is kind of boring.
3) Characters' models are non-diverse as well, it is understandable, but still. Very funny catscenes with 20 people looking exactly the same.
4) Gameplay is slightly unbalanced, at the certain moment it becames really easy to win in fights, even on nightmare+trials.

To sum up, Inquisition is not perfect, but it can be enjoyable to play, so I recommend to try it, if you have any doubts.

Combat: Dumbed down combat with absolutely no tactics needed; terrible for hardcore cRPG players.  Dull, boring combat that has you holding one key the entire time; terrible for those wanting a good action game.  The companion AI is the worst of the franchise, the camera cannot handle you being on elevated ground in a fight, and worst of all, the game is so long you'll have to suffer through 100+ hours of this.  

Main Story: Bioware used to be able to take a cliche and twist it into something interesting and different.  This is not the case here.  It is one of the most bland, uninspired fantasy games you'll ever play.  Bland protagonist who's a world saver but doesn't think for themselves at a single point in time, a boring antagonist who literally never gets a win over you (apart from one time, and then 5 minutes later you're made even stronger), a disconnected main plot where it's obvious there were 1-3 missing pieces to give a satisfying conclusion, terrible pacing, lore & world destruction.

Side Content: It is a single player MMO, simply put.  However, the grind isn't even the worst offender when it comes to side content.  I can name almost every single side quest in DA:O off the top of my head.  Even if it's a simple fetch quest, it's is tied to an important area (which connects to the main plot), with many different outcomes and many ways to role play & get exposition from the NPC.  You get none of this in Inquisition because the areas serve no purpose other than to look pretty.  Literally the only sidequest I can remember is some dude searching for rare animals/bugs in a DLC section.  Bland Bland Bland.

Companions: Returning characters are either less charming than before or completely retconned.  New characters are essentially flanderized by the end by the 1-2 personality traits you see when you meet them.  (Dorian is good, Iron Bull & Blackwall are okay).  Romances are terrible (I'm not a fan of them in general, unless they serve a purpose or are well crafted).  In DA:O, one romance partner can outright betray you if you don't show him he can experience something past shallow encounters, or see through the layers of personality in someone who acts like they don't need anything (and is difficult to get the best relationship with).  In DA:I, you're waiting until you have enough approval (completely disconnected in a romantic sense), complete a side quest for them, and that's it.  It's pandering to the max, for the weirdo's who have para social relationships with fake characters.

Dialogue: Terrible.  I face palmed at least 10 times just in the intro.  Exposition is terrible and most people are outright stupid.  Everything is just lacking.  The only true bright spot here is Claudia Black.  

I can keep going; clipping, laughable cut scenes (seriously, go watch the cutscenes in what's agreed as the BEST main mission in the game), missions that make you wait real world time, etc.  

Literally the only above average part of this game is some beautiful scenery in the areas.  And no, the DLCs do not fix anything (Jaws of Hakkon is pretty good though, its what the hub worlds should've been).

(Even letting you make decisions of past games even if you haven't played them)  that to me is incredible! the amount of changes each decision can make to your world is unbelievable, it leaves a sour feeling not being absolutely sure about your choosing and what consequences it may lead to! so treasure your saves cause you are going to load a lot of saves if you didn't liked an outcome, the game blurs the ""choose the good or the evil "" to something unique being somehow both of them at the same time, on every single one. Gameplay it's amazing, challenging if you're not experienced in some RPG aspects of the genre, Graphics are great for the time the game launched! looking great even now!
The characters are very lovable, every mission has a lot of feeling on it, the love thrown into this game is really in there!
Also i recommend playing it with a controller, cause that's the port the game was designed if I'm not mistaken.
The only thing i couldn't see the point to it was the tactical view game mode, it was interesting at first but totally forgot about it mid game.
Tons and tons of content to enjoy, even replayability just to see how could the story be making other decisions, can't stress that enough, if you love a good story driven game this is for you!

Its like some random movie you start watching on some random channel on 10pm and you just keep watching it for no reason, you enjoy it but forget about it as soon as credits start rolling.

Game as RPG is hit and miss. Didn't complete yet but completed 100% for few zones and moving into last parts of the game. Every aspect of the game is in right direction but such underwhelming experience. You have weapon and armor slots, they are quite simplified where armor is just one armor piece without needing to collect chest, legs, boots piece etc and I like that but then gear is generic as possible. Its X amount of armor/damage then gives +hp/str/cunning, that type of crap stat and then some have 1 of 5 special effects like poison on hit. You get excited about purple gear even if you know its gona be shit and it always is shit with some random useless stats. 
You have 2 types of rings , rings that increase attack/critical and other basic stats, and rings that give 30% dmg boost even for abilites that deal no damage. There are no other types of rings. GEAR IS UNDERWHELMING
Even if abilities are simple and effectivem, they leave you unsatisfied. From the moment you open talent tree you see your options are REALLY limited. Only spell that genuinely make me impressed is one mage spell. Themes of classes are great and really give nice vibes, they really transfer what each class represents and then execution of spells is blah.
Story seems intriguing and calls to uncover more but every step, just like gear is so predictable and underwhelming. Only part I enjoyed is some side stories for characters where you make decisions that dont affect anything but your moral stance. They are short and sweet but they managed to destroy even that part. To start these missions you need to go around castle and speak to them to start so after missions you spend 2 hours starting conversations hoping something happens.
But there is PLENTY of collecting of stuff like shards that, story pieces that, visit places there bullshit. Again bullshit but feels nice.

In the end I want to hate this game because every aspect of it insults me becase game represents everything wrong with modern games yet i enjoy it whole playthrough",1672006991,1672006991,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

- Great world building
- World feels alive, companions feel legitimately conflicted
- If you've played since Origins, it's very rewarding to see plot points come back here and actually develop after all these years
- While the characters and world feel very much alive and fresh, the plot itself is lukewarm at best.
- One of the worst class designs in any RPG i've ever played.
- Combat is the worst aspect of the game. Tactical combat is cumbersome to the point of exhaustion.

After playing this on Xbox One and PS4 several times, I bought this on Steam to replay it before Dragon Age: Dreadwolf releases and it is still a good game. It is just such a shame that you really see all the lost potential with this game for it could have been one of the best games ever made.

Most notably the dumb down mechanics and poor strategical combat can leave a sour taste behind for this is where Origins shined. Besides the poor RPG elements and combat the map is utterly useless and navigating in some area's of this game is frustrating.

Instead of focussing all on the bad, here is why this is a good game: Graphically it can still be pretty impressive on ultra settings. Especially considering that this game was released on Xbox360 and PS3. Slap a shader on from Nexus Mods and it's a pretty game to look at still. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The story for the main game, although a bit generic, I enjoyed it for what it was and although the main antagonist got a lot of flack for being one dimensional I really like the main villain. The DLC is good and really works well to end the game and set up the coming release. As usual Bioware shines with their characters and most of the characters are well written and interesting. The locations you visit are the same for the most part.

It took me a little over 97 hours to finish this game. I finished the story and all sidequests and most collectibles in the main game and the story, most sidequest and most of the collectibles in the DLC. If this is your first time playing this game, you can easily double that number of hours as you are going to want to replay this game.

This is a good game that could have been great, and that is why it receives many critisism. It's no must play, (unless you played the previous titles, but then you would not sit here reading this over 8 years after this game released) but it is a good RPG, with a nice story with great lore and great characters.

It's like anything that isn't connected to the main story and the romance/companion content, was just Bioware coming together to create some of the worst decisions for an open-world RPG game. A big, empty open world; Enemies with MMORPG levels of hp; Over-the-shoulder, fourth-person(?) dialogue that just made every quest that used it feel irrelevant. Side quests that start on one side of the map and then required you to go to the other side of the map just to scan something and be done with it, essentially just padding time.

Definitely game of the year worthy. Buy it if you want to sink your teeth into a 100 hour completionist run or you just wanna have a little fun killing some Demons, Templars, Mages, Elves, Big Dragons or Little Squirrels.

Cons:

Kinda clunky (Gameplay movement) but this game was made in 2014 so I can't really complain too much, I just wish the horse travel wasn't so bad on controller.

What I mean by that is the way this game plays is lowkey kinda ass.

Beat this on xbox forever ago on normal and am currently going through this on the pc years after the fact on nightmare difficulty, and truth be told couldn't really tell you the difference. Combat boils down to holding down the basic attack button and the occasional special move, you can theoretically also cycle through your party members to use their movesets but I only really do that if the inquisitor is knocked down. Any difficulty comes from how well you time these specials (ig) and if you passed the gear check (bigger numbers on weapons for bigger number healthbar enemies, simple as). Some fights do take me more than 1 attempt but I couldn't honestly tell you what I did different for each attempt so I guess there's also a bit of luck involved.

Companions as characters are (usually) alright but typically speaking are woefully incompetent in combat. Cassandra, baby, I love you but I gotta beg that you use that shield and those guard granting abilities that I gave you baby gurl. If there's an ability that isn't as simple as ""do a lot of damage/ debuff an enemy"" I probably wouldn't bother leveling them to have them, they will not utilize them properly (if at all). Thankfully there are some ways you can tweak AI behavior, most importantly giving them a limit to how much of your healing potions they'll use before inevitably dying to some archer 1 hit away from death and at their back love tapping them.

Now as for how missions work it's what you'd expect from an MMO. Fetch this, go to x amount of locations to mark, clear x amount of groups, do this mundane task, gather x amount of y and z, and the slew of repeatable side activities like clearing breaches (waves of enemies gauntlet) or connect the dot puzzles oddly enough. Thing is a lot of these bland and mundane side quests have the very real potential of not being side quests at all, as you are hardlocked from progressing the main story until you gain enough ""power"" from doing side activities like this to even unlock the option of new areas/ story missions (on top of the the softlock of wanting to be properly leveled for them).

For the two prices I got the game (free on xbox, think around 7 bucks on steam) I can't really complain because it's enough to keep you busy, story is somewhat interesting too with maybe 80% of the cast of characters being likable (but nothing near mass effect). Just don't come in here expecting a groundbreaking rpg, or hack and slash action game and you'll be content if you get it on a similar sale.",1671334585,1671334585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it's Dragon Age, and those who know the franchise know that the story is the important part. Dorky bugs and all. Recommended you play 1 and 2 first, with dlc, but it's not necessary. Dragon Age Keep still works as of (12/22)

The combat is similar to da2 which I enjoyed, and as per usual mages are the most fun class. The ability tree system carries over and works fine. Tatics are pretty much pointless now unfortunately, for those who liked those systems like me. The great parts of this game really are the graphics which are far better than 2 or origins. Also the story is better than 2's in my opinion. I just never gave a shit about hawkes problems, she basically did everything anyone told her to do without really much reason besides 'coin' which was useless in that game. What they should have done in 2(I understand why they didn't, but it doesn't excuse it) is make your base(skyhold in this game) able to be upgraded with coin and such. In this game it's mostly well implemented, though again I was flush with coin as upgrades are not tied to coin in this game. And honestly other than cosmetically upgrading skyhold is pointless. I assumed we would be attacked and upgraded defenses at skyhold would help, similar in concept to mass effect 2, but that never came to be. Dialogue options are like da2 which means theyre dumbed down because of voice protagonists. I never really liked my main characters voice and he seemed very one note, Like no matter what path you choose you end up being a 'good guy'. I was trying to be a Qunari merc but my guy sounds so nonthreatening no matter what. A great part of Origins was that you got to choose if your player character was an asshole or an angel, that is mostly gone. Good fan service, Morrigan is the best, I hope she returns in 4 and many other good cameos can be found. Companions and their dialogue are good and even great at times, many good additions to the cast. The open worlds while detailed leave somethings to be desired. It has the issue of too much empty space and too many pointless 'side quests' like collect 30 bottles of beer, yay!. The campaign overall feels weirdly paced and missions that should be short are dragged out and ones that should be longer are short. There's lots of side stuff to do but I would recommend sticking with companion quests and the main plot to avoid being bored unless ur into collecting random stuff with little context. Good loot system and cool weapons but there should be more rarities besides 3. The overall plot is nothing crazy you stop a bad guy from doing bad stuff, but really it feels too safe in my opinion. The darker aspects of origins are nearly all gone, there are a few missions that attempt it but fall flat. I believe only 1 companion can die out of the 9 making the stakes feel low as well. The dialogue has little choice you kinda follow the same path no matter what. Music is good, but barely ever plays sadly, you walk around a quiet openworld even though they do have good tracks, its really strange, w3 had such good ambient music this game definitely needed. Although despite all this I enjoyed my experience. I think they're really a few design decisions away from making a great DA game that might come close to origins, though without the dark aspects Im not sure they can fully. Also because of the bs microtransactions EA forced in I wanna say 7/10 but my real score is probably 8/10 I think it deserves it with the dlc and get on sale if you can.",1670894425,1670894425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is of the most cinematic and epic looting simulator I've seen.

Pros
- Bigger budget, more cinematics
- Graphics
- Location design
- Combat system is kinda fun
- Good choice of companions

Cons
- Nightmare difficulty is too easy
- the map shows you markers regardless of a floor level. You can come to a marker just to realize it's a floor above/below or in a dungeon
- grind
- 30 fps cutscenes lock. It feels even less tbh. A lot of in-game animations are 30 fps or low as well (e.g. fighting/training warriors in Haven)
- Inconvenient controls from M+KB. I suggest using a controller
- Yet another forgotten order to restore. C'mon, really?
- Poor optimization
- Long looting animation. Long characters dialogs farewells
- No idle health regeneration
- Constellation puzzle doesn't have an ""undo"" button and the UX is uncomfortable
- Shards mini ""game"" is just boring pixel hunting
- Boring kill & gather quests
- Dungeons are too dark
- Only 8 health potions, forces you to travel to a nearest camp to replenish
- You're supposed to return to the same locations
- War council map is difficult to read
- Romance options are a joke
- Boring specialisation ""quests""
- If you launch the game without a gamepad connected, you'll have to restart it
- Levels are very vertical and it's often not clear how to get to the marker because of vertical obstacles
- the final fight is boring
- the ending is boring and emotionless
- companion side quests are very short
- [spoiler]re-usage of DA Origins plot with a person possessed by a demon that is offering you a gift if you don't kill it[/spoiler]",1621113097,1670879029,False,1,0,0.494125783443450928,0,True,False,False

Positives:

This game really is a flawed masterpiece. There are a load of great things in this game, but they are often dampered by poor game design.

The graphics are astonishing. From effects to the look and feel of the open-world, everything is top-notch. There are great biomes that all feel different and the Main- and Sidequests are interresting and compelling, while never reaching the lofty hights of genre-leader The Witcher.
Performance is great, though when there´re a lot of flashy effect are used at once there are some frame drops, but nothing to dissturbing.

Negatives:

BUT, there are a lot of poor choices in game design. Having to wait for war table missions is ok, but everything past 1+ hour is just stupid and you´re likly to finish the game before the missions are done.
Some of the missions and open-world areas are also very misleading or hard to follow without google. A good hard riddle is nice, but running around for 10 min, because you can´t find the right way is not fun.

Also EA forces you to create an account and the EA App interrupts the game trying to update in the middle of a fight or cutscene.",1669803169,1670797365,True,0,0,0.608693480491638184,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age Inqusition is a great RPG, with lots of interesting characters and story!
When going for 100% clear you gotta play on hardest difficulty, which can be very tough the first 10 levels, but after that its a breeze!
The DLCs bring the story forward, ending the story with Trespasser DLC. (do that last)

i am heavily surprised that such a shitly optimized game, has this high positive review. I am currently have a run on highest difficulty with a few trials and friendly fire on. So I guess this shows the majority of fuckers who tolerate and like the game are pussies who enjoys having no challenge.

Why? The UI, loot system, etc. The UI is absolutely F'ing HORRENDOUS. You wonder why PC gamers can't stand console developers? This is why. Well, one of the MANY reasons.

Also, no tactics system like in DA:O. It was a nice feature and let you really customize how your companions fought in combat so you didn't have to micromanage them. It wasn't perfect, but it was very good.

Also having to constantly press a key to see if there's loot nearby? What a joke. There was nothing wrong with holding the button down like in DA:O.

Mounts? Worthless. Nothing but a cosmetic for showing off unlocks. They are not enjoyable to use. About 2% faster than walking and they hate terrain of any kind. Literally useless. Don't turn well. They stop or trip up and glitch over so much as a pebble.

Want to craft some gear? Good lucking comparing it to other gear. It's a real chore.

Want to sell gear/drops? The tooltip/info about the item you are selling doesn't update correctly and can be confusing when selling.

This is the kind of crap you have to deal with when console developers get their nasty hands on titles.

Great story and all but from a gameplay perspective the combat is fantastic goes from tactical to almost WoW level twitchy with good rebinds whatever suits you. Awesome magic system too - quick casts, targeted, AOEs, even blink pretty much everything and cooldowns not too bad. Melee/rogues also really slick. WoW should totally take the mage Knight Enchanter mechanics from DAI and make it a class, basically picture a WoW mage with a backup sword option and tank shield... just yes yes. Recruiting all companions lets you play each class if you want to swap – say play a melee for a while taking a break from your mage. Maps are huge too and a little overwhelming but just make sure you methodically clear zones/quests/war table missions as they pop. Zones don't scale keep that in mind. Won't run out of things to do. Only real drawbacks are - one race Qunari have no helms and basically no nicer armour options, there is no mouse run like WoW and the game camera isn't very low for a more in your face combat experience.

In my opinion, Inquisition is the best entry in the DA series. The main campaign and DLCs offer a lot of great content, and includes many new and interesting part members. That being said, most of the side content is boring and feels quite forced, which is a serious drag for any completionists. Additionally, making the game ""semi-open world"" serves to do little more than drag out the game much longer than it needs to be, which wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem if there were actually more interesting things to discover while exploring.

For as negative as this review has been thus far, I genuinely enjoyed my time with this game.

Graphics wise it is also impressive with all the environments and details put into them, though the glare and shine could be toned down a bit. 

Biggest complaint is how the ability bar is the most limited of the series since it was to help fit with consols and so we are typically restricted to only 8 abilities instead of a wide bar.

Requires you to download EA games app. Requires you to make an EA account. 
Requires internet access to play this OFFLINE game. It will not start without internet access even if steam is in offline mode. 
Have fun not playing the game you paid for if you have spotty or limited access internet, for no good f* reason. Just lazy DRM that punishes people who buy the game. (ie. Minecraft has DRM and also can play offline) 
Should have p-worded it. Its available on the other steam, and it would work without being constantly online. 
Next time i see a game with EA DRM tags and want to play it, lets just say im not buying it. 

But i doubt this game is even worth the download... From a user perspective, this game is too disappointing and i would rather spend my time on much funner games that each do aspects of this but better. 
Even the older DragonAge games may be better. It had a phenomenal player introduction to your race and all the lore. While THIS game doesnt explain lore much at all in the start, confusing you by talking of unknown lore all the time, and what there is to see is all WRITTEN in many, many, many notes which may or may not contain a lot of random nonsense. 
You heard there are horses in this game? Yes, but no. They are literally barely faster than walking... 
Open world? Yes, but no. They made expansive maps full of land and sights and fights, but your forced to undercut that fast-traveling everywhere. Unless you want to jog everywhere. Thats right, jog, your character cant even run/sprint, EVER. 
You see there is crafting in this game? Yes, but no. Your limited inventory and almost actually zero places to store it makes you throw away things you spent time gathering, or sell it for mere pennies, handicapping the elaborate crafting they spent effort to put into the game. 
Dialogue is cool, characters, choices and political repercussions, but thats about it.? Gameplay feels too much like im just chasing quest icons and holding left mouse button for battle. Not to mention, what is even this story, your a suspicious prisoner and they just start giving you high command and respect for no reason.

Firstly wait for a sale and secondly it suffers like The Witcher 3 suffers from its open world design.

But it definitely falls behind the two previous games in my eyes.

[u][b] The Good: [/b][/u]
1.) The music and atmosphere of the game. Especially the tavern songs that you find scattered around tend to be quite catchy. And while its not as doom and gloom as the first game it still has the air of a serious conflict, an intriguing adventure, and just overall good story.

2.) The controls are easy to understand and mapped well for mouse and keyboard.
3.) The side characters. While this includes some of the companions, there are a lot of random NPCs that are great to listen to and potentially interact with scattered through out.

[hr]                                                                                                                                                                 [/hr]
[u][b] The Bad: [/b][/u]
1.) You don't have the refined control you have had in the past over character stats. They are controlled by what abilities you unlock and equipment. This really makes leveling up feel very slow and not very important; you get one new ability, which can be passive, active, or upgrade, and thus only see one stat boosted per level. 
2.) The size of the game. It's fun to run around the various zones, but some of them are just huge with little to draw you there unless you're a compeletionist or have lots of free time. It definitely avoids DA2's flaw of using the same zone maps over and over, but almost to the far extreme and you tend to disconnect mentally from the game since little is happening to keep you engaged.
3.) The story. In a similar vain to the Witcher 3, I feel the story is somewhere awkwardly between to long for one game and not enough for the follow up. I feel if they had some how found a way to split the story between two games or condensed it, it would have been better. It also doesn't help the game that the Trespasser DLC feels more like the proper ending than the basic game.

All the open areas are basically big open spaces to claim camps, fight enemies every 20 meters and collect some shards in, sprinkled with an uninteresting quest to complete in each one.

You basically recruit party members and then visit game maps collecting various things, unlocking areas on the map and resolving quests before moving on to the next map. Along the way you follow a main storyline which eventually takes you to the end game. 

Not all of the maps (locations) need to be played through or even visited and most of the side quests can be skipped. Even with a horrible tactical camera the combat for this game with its classic pause feature is well implemented and fun. The story by the way is basically closing rifts in the sky along with a big bad guy who's after you because of a thing in your hand. Obviously there is more to it than that. The companions and dialogue is all very well written and the music is well done but sadly this still is missing the dark fantasy feel of the original Dragon Age origins. It's still a pretty great game if you’re a fan of DA but 'clunky' with its jump puzzles etc. You don't necessarily need to play the previous two games to follow along and enjoy this one. Problem is it starts off very slow so get out of that first map (the Hinterlands) as soon as you can, here is some helpful advice to run the game on Steam:

-	Disable the origin EA overlay
-	set the graphics settings to auto or customize it so that vsync is adaptive
-	set tessellation to medium or lower
-	shadow quality should be high or lower

After deciding to give it another chance, it took me quite some time to get into and I didn't really know where the gameplay and story was going, but advancing further in the story, I began enjoying it a lot to the point I almost coulnd't stop myself from playing.

Everything about this game is amazing.
There are characters that are lovable and others that are annoying. Yet the bonds you make with the characters, you will remember. All of them have a story to tell.
The scenery and animations are flawless, the dialogue is entertaining and interesting (especially the more you advance), and most important (for me): the combat is fun. You can play as all of your team members, meaning you can use four custom skill sets at once. The AI is really intelligent and you can set your teams skills and skill usage, unlike a lot of other games. There is a lot to explore, with the many different areas and quests. You will not get bored.

I'm nowhere near the end as I'm writing this now, but for anyone considering whether to buy Dragon Age Inquisition or not, I highly recommend giving it a try and not drop it after the first hours into it.

[i]Spoilers ahead. Big ones will be marked; read at your own risk.[/i]

TIP: Play Dragon Age: Origins first and then Dragon Age: 2! If you haven't, leave this page and head over to there! Don't let this be your first Dragon Age game!

NOTE: I am still trying to finish DA:I at the time of writing this review... because it's that big, and I'm trying to do as much as I can. [i]Save me.[/i]

Dragon Age: Inquisition is the third of (currently) three fantasy RPG games in the Dragon Age series. It is a mostly decision-based game where your choices change the path of the story for better or worse... except not really. You play as the Inquisitor, a mage, rogue, or warrior, dwarf, elf, human or qunari that suddenly finds themselves in a position of power after a tragic incident occurs. Oh, and you have a magical hand.

[b]GAME PLAY SUMMARY:[/b] DA:I is, like its predecessors, a third-person game with a slightly different combat system [spoiler]again[/spoiler], interesting conversations, an absurdly large amount of combat, and gorgeous graphics.

[b]COMBAT:[/b] Yet again, the combat system has changed! Now, there's something called 'Tactical Mode' [spoiler]which is the bane of my existence and I only use to fix bugs[/spoiler], and the combat has returned to be more like DA:O, but with cooler graphics! Except, of course, things are a little more funky, as traps, poisons, etc. are now skills. Weird...

[b]DIALOGUE:[/b] Where DA:O and DA:2 succeeded, I feel DA:I sadly fell short. Unlike in DA:O and DA:2 where you can actively have an opinion on things and are more knowledgeable about things that are relevant to you, you have been hit with the Idiot Ball. For example: You're Dalish? Surprise, you don't know about Mythal who is one of your main religious figures. Also, heaven forbid you want to argue with someone about an opinion they might have, and attempt [i](attempt, not necessarily succeed)[/i] to sway them into thinking differently. The dialogue in the game is enjoyable, but if you've played the other two games, you might get a little frustrated with it.

[b]CRAFTING:[/b] Taken to a truly insane level in this game. You want to craft armor? Do it! Craft weapons? Do it! Tint your armor a different color? Do it! Modify your weapons? Do it! Modify your armor? Do it! Oh, and there's also requisitions. DA:I is a crafter's heaven.

[b]PUZZLES:[/b] Quite a few! Say hello to the astrariums found all over Thedas, where you make constellations! Look through a skull to find... pieces of stone that glow weirdly! There are also a few puzzles you can find throughout the world, although those two are the big things I can think of at the moment.

[b]GAME CONTROLS:[/b] Miracle of miracles, [i]DA:I has controller support.[/i] The only issue is? The jump button and the interact button are the same button on a controller. If that doesn't bother you, go for it! I personally go back and forth between using a controller and using an external mouse and keyboard. Oh, and yes: I did say [i]jump.[/i]

[b]CHARACTERS:[/b] DA:I goes back and forth about the quality of their characters, and a big part of that is up to your personal interpretations/tastes. You're going to see a lot of fandom hate for certain characters that don't necessarily deserve it, and a lot of fandom love for characters that also don't deserve it. They did some things right and some things very wrong, which continues to fall under the whole 'Dialogue' issue mentioned previously.

[b]SPECIAL MENTION - ROMANCES:[/b] Something that I [i]do[/i] applaud DA:I for in this game is that they have a gay love interest and a lesbian love interest. Excellent! The bad element of romances? They can be limited by race. Want to romance that bald elf? He's only romanceable by female elves. Like the commander? Female human or elf. Think the hot woman talking to you feels fruity? Psych, she's only romanceable by men even though you can flirt with her for the majority of the game as a woman. [spoiler]Yes, Varric is still not romanceable.[/spoiler] Again, not necessarily complaining... but I'm complaining.

[b]DIFFICULTY:[/b] Actually, DA:I is harder than the last two games. Be careful not to go to an area higher leveled than you, because you [i]will[/i] die.

[b]GRAPHICS:[/b] Remarkably better than DA:O and DA:2! You can truly get lost in the gorgeous scenery around you, and the characters are now in much better HD than before. [spoiler]One can only wonder how much better Dreadwolf will be...[/spoiler] Absolutely stunning.

[b]GAME LENGTH:[/b] Can get [i]stupidly long,[/i] as I have been encountering. My advice to new players: [b][i]Get out of the Hinterlands.[/i][/b] Due to the nature of it being open-world, it is far easier to get lost doing an insane amount of side quests before you even touch the main campaign. If you just focus on the main campaign, however, it is fairly easy to complete the game in a short period of time.

[b]REPLAY VALUE:[/b] Due to its length, I feel the replay value isn't great. Being able to play as different characters, however, does enhance the experience, and you can make some big decisions that change your play-through.

[b]NAVIGATION:[/b] The game is now open-world, unlike the past two games, and you can jump, unlike the past two games. To say the navigation is crazy is an understatement. Be prepared to get very lost, wonder why you can't find the object even though the map says you're right on top of it (and then slowly pan upwards to see there's a cliff that you need to now find the way up to), and to constantly be checking the map.

[b]SOUND:[/b] Oddly enough, DA:I doesn't seem to have a lot of music at times. Lots of great sound effects, but it's really during critical moments that you get fantastic music--or [i]any[/i] music at all, in my opinion. A lot of voice actors have come back from the last two games with some new ones: Freddie Prinze Jr. (She's All That, Scooby-Doo, Mass Effect, etc.), Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect, Metroid Prime, Powerpuff Girls, etc.), and Laura Bailey (Spider-Man PS4, The Legend of Vox Machina, Fruits Basket, Uncharted, The Last of Us Part II, etc.). Dragon Age: Inquisition really went all in with the voice acting, and it truly does pay off.

[b]STORY:[/b] Picks up slightly from the end of DA:2. The events of DA:2 have come to a head (except not even), and if you played the DLC, boy, are [i]you[/i] in for a(n un)pleasant surprise! Pretty enjoyable if you're playing the main quests consistently enough, but very easy to get distracted.

[b]GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION?:[/b] Includes all the DLC which is pretty enjoyable! (Except if you like modding. [i]Good luck.)[/i] Includes: Jaws of Hakkon (location), The Descent (location), Trespasser (post main game campaign), armor, weapons, items, and a lot of customization things. At the very least, Trespasser is a [i]need to play[/i] DLC because it finishes the game off very well [spoiler]and is vital to Dragon Age: Dreadwolf[/spoiler].

[b]THE MODDING COMMUNITY:[/b] Continues to be insanely creative and helpful. Tired of hearing the 'there's no items here' sound? There's a mod for that! Want to hear companion dialogue more frequently? There's a mod for that! [spoiler]As with Dragon Age: II, however, there are some very unsavory mods out there. Again, if you know, you know. I'm not happy with that.[/spoiler]

[i]In summary......[/i]

Dragon Age: Inquisition, while a very enjoyable game and gorgeously made, is far too overrated. Is it a great game? Yes. Is it the best of the current three? No. Is it worth playing? Yes. I believe a big part of the difference in game play regarding it is Bioware's working with EA (Dragon Age: 2 also had its involvement with EA... makes you think), for better or worse. There's a lot of unfortunate retconning that occurs in this game, and that aspect unfortunately detracts from the experience for more intense fans of the series.",1668111309,1668111309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age ™ Inquisition is the third part of the series, this time we play as the Inquisitor, and together with our companions we expand our influence on the entire continent ( including locations from previous games, and the new Orlesian Empire ). From snowy mountains and forested valleys to dark cities and massive deserts.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
The story is solid, each mission is trying to show something new, and you have to admit, it works. The plot is well written, everything fits together well. As in Mass Effect 3, DA:I is in theory the final game where all the forces of good and evil collide with each other. The plot, fortunately, manages to carry such a weight of events, but sometimes it feels like everything is being pushed a little too hard by nostalgia. And the biggest problem is probably the plot continuity. The problem is that this game is built like an MMO. So in order to progress, you have to do a lot of side quests, and shitty grind.  
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As I wrote before, this game is an MMO pretending to be Singleplayer. The exploration of the world is enjoyable, but the amount of crap side quests and artificial barriers is so overwhelming that I doubt I'll ever be able to complete this game, at least not 100%. At least the views are very diverse and pretty. Fighting is another joke in my opinion. Personally, I don't feel the weight of the weapon, each of them behaves (and sounds) like a wooden club. The skirmishes aren't fast, they're downright slow now, and repeating animations don't help. UI is another joke, although everything is prettier, now some keyboard shortcuts have been removed, and the game stubbornly denies us access to important information that was shown in previous games. Besides, everything is similar to the previous games, the only thing that stands out is the new Inquisition system. Now we can improve our keep, and although the system is not that deep, it's a nice detail to watch our base grow a bit. We can decorate this castle, and in the throne room we get the option to decide about the fate of important prisoners who we captured while exploring the world. Really nice system, but fairly shallow nevertheless, it would be nice if they improved the strategic aspect of this in DA:4. And there is this unfortunate war table. All we can do there is send people on missions around the continent, which although it sounds good, the system itself is as deep as a puddle of piss. We just send someone on a mission, wait from a few minutes to even 24 hours, we get a notification that the task is completed, a small reward, and it's over. Pure MMO, so people who will try to finish this game 100% will get to know the real hell on earth. I guess the only thing that saves the day are our comrades who are very diverse now, and although I wasn't their biggest fan at first, after a while I really started to like them. Oh and I will also mention the character creator, which is surprisingly good. Although this game is graphically similar to Mass Effect: Andromeda, the character creator is surprisingly good, it allows you to do a lot, even change your voice. There is also a multiplayer mode, but I'm not interested in it, especially when I saw the microtransaction store.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
The game runs smoothly and stably, and the graphics are beautiful. The animations and facial expressions of the characters are really well done, which makes me wonder how they managed to fuck it up like that years later in ME: Andromeda. And as befits BioWare games, all the voice actors did a brilliant job. The only thing that bothers me is importing characters from the prequels to this the game. Instead of being able to do it in the normal way, EA and BioWare force us to go to a dedicated Dragon Age website where we have to fill in a lot of tables to make everything match, and only from there we can import to this game, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
Good game, but pushing the MMO aspects hurt a lot. I recommend it, but if I could, I would put a neutral review because there is a lot of good things about this game, but also a lot of things that pissed me off. So if you want to buy then be prepared for a wild grind.

I know prior to playing DAI, I was a lil nervous as DA2 really disappointed me. However, after literally sinking 100 hours into it, I can clearly say my fears have been laid to rest.

Inquisition takes place after the events of DA2. Your created character is thrown for a loop with darkspawn chasing you after you witness the death of a very important figure. You are saved Cassandra, Solas, and Varric. They find that you somehow possess the ability to close these strange rifts in the sky that have been summoning demons. With the world plunging into chaos, Cassandra decides to open up the Inquisition, naming you as the leader. You have to convince people to help you, save the world from these rifts that have opened up in the sky, and figure out the cause of all this craziness.

DAI's is a beautiful blend of Origins and DA2's gameplay. You have the fun and fluid hack n slash ability based combat of part 2 and the tactical camera and ability to give commands to your party members like in Origins. I loved that both styles were used as it also tailors the gameplay for both casual and tactical players. For example, early in the game I was having trouble with ranged enemies constantly killing my main character. So after losing a few times, I used the tactical camera to order my mage and ranger to focus on that target while I handled the front line. I was able to win the battle after that and it made me feel great. The tactical camera can also be used to solve certain puzzles in the game that require simultaneous switch presses and so on. 

Aside from combat, DAI returns to the fun globetrotting adventureness of Origins. You will travel to different locations and dungeons taking on quests, collectibles, and more. One of the best things I will praise DAI for is seeing the fruits of your labor. Yes, the quests can sometimes feel repetitive like kill X amount of enemies, collect this amount of items, or clear enemies from said location. However, there are many times you will see the map shift thanks to the quests and deeds you perform. Clearing a fortress and then claiming it will suddenly have it filled with your army and viola, you have a base to return to while you're exploring. One of my favorite examples is early on you have a quest to just collect food for a village. Seemed stupid, but after I finished the quest, I just happened to be walking along when a family of NPCs were sitting around and saying, ""Eat up, thanks to the Inquisition, we have a meal tonight."" Small touches like that always make me appreciate RPG games like these more because now I have a reason to do quests aside from just getting stronger.

Dragon Age is always great at having great party members and DAI is no different. You recruit a great cast of party members to help you on your journey and they all come with interesting stories that you can explore. I love how they banter with each other while they travel with you and some of the choices you make in the game will affect how much they like or dislike you. If they like you a lot, you can take on special quests that will let you learn more about them, or even romance them. Another little nod I love is that whenever you are choosing party members, they are on tarot cards. When you unlock certain parts of their story, the tarot card will change depending on what you have learned about them which I thought was a fantastic touch.

DAI will have you picking up tons of materials and foraging as it has a pretty fun crafting system. You will find tons of schematics and blueprints to make weapons and armor, or attachments to enhance them. What's even better is that you can choose the materials you use when crafting and that will affect the stats and effects of the weapon. This amount of freedom was really impressive as you can make a weak sword blueprint pretty powerful if you use high-end materials.

Lastly, I want to talk about the war table. This is where you go to make choices around the world. You have three main advisors. One is good at marketing, finances, and dealing with nobles. The other is good at handling tasks sneakily, quietly, and subtly. The last one is good at handling objectives with guards and military might. Whenever an icon appears on your war table, you get to choose who you want to handle the situation and wait for in-game time for them to handle it. Your rewards can be money, influence for the Inquisition, items, or even new locations for you to explore. One of the coolest things is when you explore a map and find an area you can't explore because a bridge may be broken or something. You can go to the war table, commission someone to fix it and BAM, you got a whole new part of the map to explore. One thing I wish I paid attention to is that it is sometimes very important who you send to handle missions. Late game, I wasn't paying attention to who I sent to handle tasks and I wound up losing a lot of people including a party member. You have to make these choices carefully!

Now for the gripes. There were graphical glitches, which is expected large RPG games like this. My game crashed a few times, but luckily the autosave was very good and I never lost too much progress. The biggest gripe shared with me and most players is the war table. Whenever your advisors have finished their task, you have to return to the war table in order to collect the report. This doesn't sound too bad until you find yourself in the middle of exploring a map or dungeon and have to go all the way back to your main base to collect the report and then send them off again. It would have been nice to have the ability to do that from a menu aside from big story missions. Enemy types can get samey after a while as well as the questing and objectives. The main story itself didn't feel that long, however, doing the side quests and party member quests really stretch the game out to an appropriate length.

Final verdict? I was very impressed and happy with my time in Inquisition. Being that I played the previous two titles, there were a lot of callbacks and cameos from characters in those respective games. I also liked the LGBTA+ representation in the game, really put a smile on my face. For the longest time, Origins was my favorite Dragon Age. I have to gracefully admit defeat as Inquisition was quite the treasure. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for an RPG game to play. While you don't need to play the previous two titles to enjoy this one, you will get so much more out of the story if you do. Thanks for reading!",1666591702,1666591702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]Should you play?[/u] YEAH
[u]Should you BUY???[/u] YES, BUT THE ORIGIN VERSION, ON A SALE

[b]Comment:[/b]
So after hundreds of hours between me and my wife on Origin I decided to get Dragon Age Inquisition on Steam as well. Connecting to Dragon Age servers takes longer. Loading screens take more time as well. And far more dips on frames than when just launching via Origin. In conclusion, having three layers of DRM (Steam, Origin, Denuvo) is just as dumb as it sounds. Now to the game. I will admit that I found it to be a really cool story, additionally the DLCs that expand the lore too. Yeah the main villain is cheesy and not that great overall but there's so much more to see here than to just focus on the final boss of the campaign ([spoiler]arguably, the real final villain is in the Tresspasser DLC[/spoiler]). What drags the story is the huge amount of pointless side quests, mostly of the fetch variety. The War Table missions being tied to real time is an awful design point that wastes your time and rewards you for not playing.The NPCs and companions area a mixed bag. Some REALLY great and others you just want to feed to a dragon to make them shut up. Take your pick. A much more responsive combat system to the previous two titles can be found here. Your reactions matter too and while the start is terribly sluggish it becomes MUCH more fun once you unlock more abilities. But it does require taking some skills as mandatory for melee based fighting - Combat Roll for warriors, Hook and Tackle for rogues - due to clunky hitboxes of big enemies. What also adds to the clunkiness is the awful tactics system for your companions (truly destroyed since the DA:O times) and an even worse tactical camera. You are better off to pause a lot or do what I did - make a char who can eventually solo everything. You can mount horses & beasts in DA:I but it isn't really all that faster and your companions disappear once you mount (they literally disintegrate) which was too immersion breaking for me to use. The crafting system is nice but don't bother with it until later in the game when it becomes good. Lastly, multiplayer isn't absolutely terrible but it is really unnecessary. Just a thing of the time when big publishers forced their developers to add multiplayer whatever the cost. To sum it all up, the game has a nice intro then grinds to almost a halt with too much side stuff and stiff combat. However, it does pick up mid-game and if you played your cards right it can be a lot of fun from levels 12-16 until the very end.

[b]P.S.:[/b] This GOTY Edition contains all of the DLCs. The main ones to take note of are the story ones that expand the lore - Jaws of Hakkon (separate island); The Descent (deep roads) and Tresspasser (fade, mostly). The other stuff is just flavour items - weapons, armour, mounts or things for your keep. Here I will reiterate that Tresspasser is a MUST to play, basically it's the epilogue of the whole story and a really bad thing to hide behind DLC (if it wasn't part of the GOTY edition).

[b]*Note: The review is mainly for the game, which I've grown to like, less about what it is like to play it via Steam. To that part - just like many other Origin games released 2011-2020 - it is unfortunately better to buy the Origin-only version. Steam often loses track that the game is still on but unlike DA2 this will most likely close it. Origin version has better fps, less crashes and can be played offline. Shameful.[/b]

Aye so listen to me the first 20 or so hours had me glued to this mother fucker like it was some of that fine Afghan export. Then it loses focus with arbitrary wait times just to continue the story, as well as the less character events you just lose interest with continuing the slog to the next cut scene. Combat is the standard BIO WARE fare with the splitting of abilities into four groups: Zweihander, sword and board, bow, and the actual interesting one, magic. after you have your class you get into combat Wow congratulations you now have the pleasure of pausing the game to make sure that all your characters do the right ਗੰਦ, and then and only then can you unpause, let it all happen, and then pause to do it all again. Yet even so, that is to be expected of Bio Ware isn't it. DOESN'T STOP IT FOR GETTING BORING AS TRANSCRIBING THE ENTIRE FUCKING BIBLE INTO ANCIENT COPTIC. Even then, you give the game a chance, your patient man/women/person/lower eldritch deity, but after a while you notice that the characters reach their limit of what events you can have with them and you realize that without those simple interactions that this game has very little going for it.

It lacked the polish BioWare typically puts into its titles, and almost the entire affair felt like a gigantic step back from everything Origins had established. What was once a promising franchise that reminded me of the glory days of RPGs such as Baldur’s Gate became a shadow of its former self, with lazily re-used assets and no sense of scale.

BioWare went back to the drawing board with Inquisition, the third Dragon Age outing, and the game is all the better for it. It felt like a culmination of its predecessors’ strengths, with all of the bells and whistles that come with current-gen hardware.

Almost immediately it’s easy to see that Inquisition takes to heart everything BioWare has learned throughout the development cycle of the first two Dragon Age games. Combat has vastly improved since Origins, but now rather than feeling too twitchy like Dragon Age II, it’s a mixture of the two design philosophies and feels just right. Attacks have weight to them, but you can’t just go flying through the air like a ninja and launch a thousand attacks a minute — a style that cheapened any sense of strategy the second game may have had. That tactical feel of Origins is back, and married with the action concepts from DA II.

Said compromise also spills into the core story, which is no longer a small-scale tale of one human’s struggles in a fortress town. While the initial creation process isn’t as detailed as Origins — it doesn’t go all the way down to your socioeconomic status, for instance — it’s a huge upgrade from the previous game. You can choose from a pool of human, elf, dwarf, or Qunari races and pick your class from the start, whether it be a dual-wielding or ranged rogue, one- or two-handed warrior, or a mage. I would have liked more race and background options.

The tactical camera is back on all platforms (thank goodness!), and you’ll need to get used to it during some of the tougher encounters. Boss fights and even a lot of world-map encounters are legitimately difficult, and you can’t just slice your way through everything. Skill building isn’t as robust as Origins but there are at least four trees to choose from, all of which have their own set of useful abilities; nothing feels tacked on and everything has a point to it. Customized armor is also back, and again, feels like a mix of the two philosophies. It’s streamlined, but allows you to fundamentally change the look of your party and adds a sense of importance to loot and item progression.

If you’re completely lost at this point in the story or you’re jumping ship to a new platform, Dragon Age Keep has you covered. By logging in to the online tool with an EA account, you can select just about every single detail you wish from the first two games, and apply it to your Inquisition save file. It’s insanely detailed, and an innovative way to span multiple platforms and jump through technical hoops. It takes roughly 30 minutes to get everything settled, and bam! — you’re all caught up.

Inquisition begins with a bam, too. Within five minutes, you’re thrown into a situation involving the zealous Chantry and a worldwide inquisition to stop an encroaching demon threat. Through mysterious circumstances you’ve been given the power to banish rifts and send demons packing, so naturally you’re recruited into the fray and instantly gain some semblance of authority — seeing as you’re the world’s last hope and all.

Of course, much of your power will have to be earned, and you’ll need to grow the inquisition from the ground up. Not everyone, including the infamous Mage and Templar factions, actually respects your authority. You’ll have to prove your worth over the course of the game. It’s a different feel from the Grey Warden-driven narrative of Origins, as there’s an inherent sense of helplessness and confusion that drives your rise to power, which is especially complicated if you play a race that many fear, like the Qunari.

The story itself is by-the-books fantasy and less nuanced than Origins, which can get boring at times if you aren’t keen on going on more exploration treks, but it does the trick. The writing at times can slip depending on the character (Varric and Dorian are always great), and the first few hours in particular can be painful in terms of deliveries and a weak script. But overall it does a great job of world building, and it’s fairly easy to follow throughout. You’ll also get to learn a lot more about the world of Dragon Age in general, as you can roam about both Orlais and Ferelden regions with more freedom than ever before.

What Inquisition nails is that big-picture feel Origins pulled off so well. This isn’t a small-time story you’re playing out; the stakes feel real, and you’ll meet a wide variety of accompanying characters that make the world worth exploring. It helps that Inquisition is a beautiful game, with an impressive engine that boasts long draw distances and a smooth framerate. You can now see the imperfections of certain people, adding more character to them without a word of dialog. The new codex card and lore art style is also mesmerizing, and draws you into reading more about the world of Dragon Age.

But the best part of all is the vast strides BioWare has made in the exploration aspect of the series. Topping even Origins, the new hubs are gigantic, and take hours to completely clear. Progress in the campaign works by gaining “power” points through essentially any action in these hubs, which lets you take on new story missions. It doesn’t feel like a gate considering how open Inquisition is in giving out those points. You can also randomly discover optional dungeons, random world events, and special world bosses. That feeling I get from taking a random party into unknown territory is perfected in Inquisition.

It cannot be overstated how much Inquisition has to offer in terms of side content. It feels like every five minutes you’re stumbling across a new optional quest, along with fresh landmarks to find, camps to set up, shards to locate (that unlock a completely new optional hub zone), animals to poach, resources to gather, puzzles to solve, and more. Better yet, everything contributes to the overall war effort, so you never feel like you’re wasting your time. BioWare claims that you need over 100 hours to complete everything, and based on my experience, that number is accurate.

Multiplayer (yes, multiplayer) is the cherry on top, because nothing in the campaign feels like it was compromised for its addition. In essence, it’s a modified horde mode that operates similar to Uncharted 3‘s co-op sections. Four players will be able to select from a host of classes, each with their own skills and abilities, and play through a miniature dungeon together.

here are three difficulty levels in tow, and if you’re up to the challenge you can play with less than four people per run or even go at it solo, but to my knowledge it doesn’t scale, so it’ll just end up being more difficult. For those of you who are worried, multiplayer does not affect the campaign in any way. There’s no silly “play multiplayer to help the galactic front!” nonsense like in Mass Effect 3 — they are completely separate entities, and you can enjoy one without even touching the other. There is a microtransaction system, but much like Mass Effect 3 I didn’t feel compelled to use it. None of this spills over into the campaign, either.

Dragon Age: Inquisition not only feels like a fully fledged role-playing adventure, but it’s also packed with fun things to do that will keep you busy for weeks. Having played well over 100 hours, I’m still finding things to do like plotting another playthrough to handle things a bit differently. Inquisition is a triumph and proves that despite some missteps along the way, BioWare hadn't lost its touch. Until 2017 that is.

Pros:
 - good mechanics - no pseduo 3d like in DA:O and DA:2, good hitboxes, collision detection and so on
 - skill system - superb skills, albeit very simplified and console-oriented. Many unique ways to make a good character, skills are interconnected and fun to use. Not just attacks with different animations and formulas
 - views/graphics - beautiful scenery, stylish and enjoyable
 - end game content - post-completion, just for fun content
Cons:
 - political agenda, more below
 - ""diversity hires"" among characters - this is supposed to be a medieval game based on Europe of the time. Instead there are mostly black characters which is ridiculous because there are no asians or other ""minorities"", so it's just pro-black. I'm a minority myself and wouldn't want people that don't belong there in universes/stories based on my people's history and culture. Leave the European culture alone
 - selective ""progressiveness"" doesn't make sense. In any society that's medieval or below people were very racist, chauvinistic and bigotic - even today you can come visit developing countries - you'll be surprised they are less progressive than characters in this supposed-to-be medieval game. In this game any farmer that speaks like a redneck is suddenly a progressive and open-minded person when it comes to skin colour and sexual orientation. When it's not about these things they are suddenly chauvinistic  and racist(towards elves/dwarves) again.
 - MMO-like generated quests  - a lot of content which is bland and generated, so you have to play not like a completionist that does everything but rather like a MMO player that focuses on progress. So less like DA:O and DA:2, more like single player world of warcraft - 70%+ of content skipped and no regrets.
 - Absolutely no immersion - I played DA:O's 50 hours in like 4 days, then I played DA:2 for 30 hours in 3 days(I'm sick so having a good gaming run of Dragon Age), but this game I play for like 2 hours and it gets boring
 - Feels like a new game that's more of a slasher/MMO than an RPG

I can say that the teams that worked on graphics, mechanics, engine and physics are good, they did a good job. But the storywriters, game designers and other did a terrible job. I'd rather re-play DA:O one more time than play this game again.

No, not because of the difficulty. Around level 8 you start killing everything, unless you encounter rogues/mages who can one-shot your tanks, but this happens only at the later stages. I didn't even get the specialization because you're already a killing machine.

I got tired because of:
1) cliche story where you play a role of Yet-Another-Messiah,
2) constant railroading,
3) literally almost zero choices for shaping your own story,
4) naive dialogues, (DLC ""The Decent"" is the apogee of the dialogue nausea)
5) stupid and illogical actions of your character and NPCs,
6) moronic romance banters,
7) zero tactics in battles: either rush-and-kill or shoot-and-hide,
8) the battles themselves are very tiresome: you just autoswing/autoshoot through thick enemies' HP bars in Nightmare,
9) non-working tactics mode with your characters refusing to stand their ground,
10) the only challenging boss is the very first pride demon in prologue -- when you have no tools to be efficient with your tank; all other bosses are ""pew-pew-pew"",
11) limited options to heal your party; so +1% heal weapons are EXTREMELY useful for back-row members, unless they are rogues with healing poison,
12) crafting is unbalanced. You only have a limited amount of T4 resources, so you literally can't craft Top Tier items for all your party members,
13) unique items are usually underwhelmed by crafted items,
14) the first 3 companions are given within the first 20 minutes of gameplay, and stay with you for 9-10 levels until the end of chapter 1; everyone else appears immediately after ""chapter 1"". The character introduction is nowhere near to the DA: Origins, and the characters stories are from mediocre to blatantly bad,

If you want a kind of click-bait TLDR it is a Mass Effect Andromeda in a fantasy setting. 

What is done really well:

- Visuals and overall graphics - not the best but the overall look and aesthetics work pretty well, Valammar is impressive and stunning
- Narrative design (not the same as writing and story!) - this is where Bioware shines and they deliver again 
- Gameplay and combat - the core loop is well designed, but it may become repetitive, I actually enjoyed the tactical camera and used it quite a lot
- War table mini-game - I really like the idea and always appreciate something different to enhance the gameplay (like at the beginning of Tyranny or kingdom management in Pathfinder Kingmaker), but I would prefer the Influence to be not in a form of currency you spend to open regions but rather a level that keeps increasing
- Dialogue system and voiceovers - this is something Bioware does perfectly (only sometimes it is difficult to decipher how certain options translate into the actual response and you might be ""Wait, what, I did not want to say that!!)
- Music


What is not that great:

- UI of inventory and character progression - I thought it is because of consoles, no, it is a dedicated PC UI, not a fan
- If you are not into a ""chosen one to save the world"" story, try to focus on the qualities of the story implementation and progression  
- World and level design - DA:I is not an open world nor exactly a linear corridor, but the result is quirky - the regions are full of content and large, but the designers worked a lot with obstacles such as hills, rocks or mountains that you are not able to traverse (and the exact rules for when you are able to somehow jump up through it and when not are murky) and it creates situations that there is a bandit camp literally next to your camp (just across that unreachable hill). In the end, the regions are sort of lose corridors packed with content, that is sometimes very illogically placed close to each other which breaks the immersion 
- Items and loot in general - a lot of useless stuff, regular weapons, racial/class-only items 

Overall, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a really well-developed game, with high-quality content, a functional and entertaining core loop, many well-designed mechanics and gameplay aspects, perfect job in narrative design and dialogues, it is inclusive and it appeals to a large and diverse group of players. At the same time, there are many things that break immersion for me and I am annoyed by them, but I was still entertained and enjoyed it a lot.

It is not the RPG I want, but it is a very good RPG.

Update: After playing multiple play-thrus of the entire series, I can say that this can not hold a candle against Dragon Age Origins. Sure this game looks polished and mechanically fluid but they dumbed-down most of the mechanics from DA Origins. This is just a sleeker skin of DA2, at least DA2 had the best character. The dialogue option is just poor makes replaying it not that great like in ME: Andromeda, say what you will with just a Paragon and Renegade option in RPGs but they work better since this makes replaying on a different path fun. 

The best improvement and the stand out feature however are combos and detonation since they were always fun to do in Mass Effect 2 and 3 and I get to do that here as well. 

Still I will recommend this game for Bioware fans and fans of this series. Hoping DA Dreadwolf will be an improvement that draws the best in gameplay and story from the 3 games",1630938817,1663587915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's all this game does. There is no open world with quests or dungeons or raids. Its just a handful of dungeons that you have to grind for hours to get any sort of upgrades to gear.

-Maps can be a bit too big so getting lost happens a lot if you don't pay attention. It also means the game can get boring. I quit at first because of this but obviously came back and decided to push through and now I am incredibly thankful I did. 
-Side quests aren't always related to the main quest so they can also be a bit boring if you're just interested in seeing the story unfold. But completionists and lore fans will love it. 
-There's a bug in connecting your previous game saves with this game, so you have to go to the Dragon Age Keep to choose what your story was and then log in after launching the game to get the desired history. Maybe it is just my problem, though. Not sure.

In fact, I thought it was one of the worst sequels I'd ever played, and (at the time), had a higher opinion of [i]Dragon Age II[/i]. 

Then I played 99 more hours, and my opinion has certainly flipped on the game. Let's start with the things I found I liked after revisiting the game. 

First off, the story gets significantly better after the end of Act 1. It's by no means perfect, and I feel that the pacing of the story as a whole is really poorly executed. Act 1 could easily be a entire story all on its own, and it's rather jarring to reach Act 2, and realise you have two thirds of a game left to play through. Acts 2 and 3 are also rather segregated into their own segments, but are blended significantly better. 

The other big change in my opinion was in regards to the game's party members, whom I previously felt mixed about. Cassandra and Solas were by far the least interesting (Cassandra because her character felt generic; and Solas because his whole mystery-elf shtick ultimately made him less interesting to interact with), but characters like Dorian, Iron Bull, and Cole really carried the experience for me. 

The only character I genuinely despised this time around was Sera, but only because she felt like a mix of Peebee and Liam from [i]Mass Effect: Andromeda[/i] with none of their few redeeming qualities. 

Unfortunately, [i]Dragon Age: Inquisition[/i] is by no means perfect, especially when it comes to stability, core gameplay, mission progression, and level design. The game is fairly buggy, with some nasty terrain pop in, a fair number of AI glitches, and it crashed more than a handful of times on me. 

There were frequent audio errors (including one where the sounds of battle would just cut out for a while before suddenly becoming audible again), as well as some issues with dialogue from multiple characters within the same cutscene overlapping at once. 

The game has some serious issues with its gameplay. Power and ability progression feels slow and boring, with your ability scores increasing when you unlock nodes on your skill tree, rather than being purchased every time you level up; and powers being limited to maybe four or five per skill tree, at least for mages. 

Crafting is broken, with a good deal of the unique items found during gameplay being outmatched by generic items you can craft with materials. 

A couple of the AI companions are seemingly incapable of using their abilities properly, resulting in them going down during combat. The first game allowed you immense freedom with setting up AI routines for your party, something which has practically disappeared from this game. Your only real option is whether they use potions, and, if so, how low their health needs to be to use them. 

By far the worst parts though are the mission progression and the level design of the maps you play inside. Mains story missions, as well as new areas, have to be unlocked with a resource called 'Power'. Power is obtained by completing quests, collecting objects in the environment, and performing repeatable tasks. This would be acceptable, if some of the missions didn't require upwards of thirty power to attempt, which necessitated grinding through the game's lacklustre and oft-boring side content. 

This, in turn, is made more frustrating by the game's obsession with featuring large, mostly empty, and incredibly generic open world maps, meaning that at least half of my time with this game was spent running from point A to point B, killing the occasional group of enemies, and not doing anything to further the plot. This running around is nauseatingly tedious, and I'm really not impressed by the whole affair. 

Overall, [i]Dragon Age: Inquisition[/i] isn't as bad as I initially stated it to be. It's nowhere near as good as [i]Dragon Age: Origins[/i], and I'd honestly rate it on-par (or slightly better) that [i]Dragon Age: II[/i]. 8/10, formerly 5/10, hopefully [i]Dreadwolf[/i] will improve, rather than copy or regress.",1632028296,1662868992,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean, if you're all for grinding materials and pointless running around then I think this is your game, but goddamn. I thought DA2 got repetitive with its ONE map but no. I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually prefer DA2's gaming mechanics over this game, fighting included. Fights feel like they take HOURS because even higher-level enemies seem to make little damage while their health bars are longer than the Great Wall. Also did you want to maybe dodge an attack? No can do, movement also sucks and you'll have to literally jump to get away, and that too might or might not happen in the timeframe it takes your character to take all the damage anyway.

God fuck this game is so annoying, but I am forcing myself to play as much as I can for Dorian. Who wouldn't want a piece of dat. (Most other characters are surprisingly... Flat? I mean, how do you succeed at making VARRIC boring?)

Also be forewarned that if you're thinking of importing a custom storyline from Origins and/or DA2 through DA Keep, you might have to do some tweaking. I was halfway into losing my mind trying to get it to work and finally gave up for vanilla male mage Hawke, gag.

I tried really hard to like this game. Nearly 150 hours in. But I still never managed to finish it. Because this game is nothing but a pretty husk carrying the dragon age name. I've never FELT a game so blatantly railroading me into what it wants before. For fucks sake it's an RPG where you don't get to pick your own STATS. Removed the entire school of creation from mages, removed auto healing after battles AND put a limit on healing potions but I guess IM the bad gamer for thinking it's a dogshit system to expect the healing to come from letting the entire party die and then reviving them. 
But of course when talking about railroading, It doesn't stop at stats and combat. 
The dialogue of this game is not good. It suffers both from the sheer volume of it (ENDLESS shot-rverse shot, shot reverse shots with the inq and everyone they talk to. Which is also WAY too many people because seems the team was more focused making MORE than making anything of substance) that needed to be produced, and from the dialogue wheel itself. The paraphrasing works in something like 2 where it's a story being told, or in mass effect where it was designed with it in mind, here it's frustrating at best, actively enraging at worst, ESPECIALLY when the writer's bias begins to show and you only have way nicer/sometimes ONLY nice dialogue options with some characters (Cullen, Cassandra. The fantasy cops) only uneccessarily mean options with certain other characters (Sera) and don't even get me STARTED ON FUCKING SOLAS. The writers seem to realllllly be jerking themselves off with ""how good of a twist villain"" he is, so far as to name the new game after him. which is surprising considering he's a blatant gary stu. ""Oh so mysterious"" only because they don't LET YOU ask the questions you want to
""Oh so powerful and scary"" sure, when recruiting the mages I watched him die to red lyrium but go off. 
He's only as popular as he is because he has a huge simp fanbase that's very taken in by the prospect of ""ooh an old god so full of turmoil and revenge but I can fix him"" . You know. Very ironic conspiring the whole fanbase despised Anders for doing the exact same things Solas has done. But to a smaller scale and for an actually noble goal. But no, tearing down the vail and genociding the entire WORLD to bring back elf supermacy because he's disgusted by the current minority coded elves not being exactly as he left them is ok apparently. 
In GENERAL , everything this game does to the lore is appalling to me. The plight of the mages and elves is suddenly a goddamn joke, and there's the implication that they DESERVE to be oppressed, which, fuck off. The wardens are goo goo gaga stupid because we need the Inquisitor to look smarter than them. All the mythology built up both of the elves and the dwarves? Not real! Haha! Only the Christian coded god is left vague! Screw you if you felt represented or cared about anything else! The woobification of the chantry and retcons to back it up are also quite something. In divine Justinia in both origins and two was an annulment and crusade happy tyrant, but now I'm supposed to think she was a sweet old lady that a BENEVOLENT SPIRIT OF FAITH WOULD TAKE THE  GLOWING FORM OF MAKING HER LOOK LIKE A SAINT. NO. NO. Absolutely not. 
I could write a novel of all the things I hate about this game andhow it completely killed my faith in bioware, but to keep it relatively short I'm going to add the final cherry on top. Dragon age keep was a terrible idea that's both frustrating to deal with and takes away A LOT of player choice because there's no way to put every single possible player action neatly on a tapestry. So in origins you might have found Bevin and given them money without taking the sword but the tapestry doesn't give you that option because the only thing they want to carry over from that quest is ""how will your warden be insulted in the throne room"" background dialogue. And in Inquisition itself? you are very much able to befriend Cassandra just enough to get her quest, then the moment you learn what the seekers were withholding instantly tank the approval and hate her. You know, like a roleplaying game? But the tapestry is just like. Haha no. You were either best friends the whole time or you never LEARNED about it. It's a complete fucking joke. Especially when you have Fiona hanging out in the tower next door ,as an ally, with nothing holding you back from telling her hey. Guess what? There has always been a way to reverse tranquility. The templars and seekers are simply even worse than you previously thought. But doing so would require that a quest in this game have any amount of depth, which is simply impossible to expect. 
As a final note, if you want to play a dragon age game where you are a very powerful leader that seals fade rifts? Play awakening. If you want a pretty open world RPG with fast paced combat and actually enjoyable sidequests + fast travel that doesn't still have you walking 5 minutes manually every time? Play kingdoms of amalur. 
Peace out.

The world of dragon age is the single thing that gives me interest in EA they have fucked everything else up star wars battle front, sports gacha games like fifa and maden, battlefield, deadspace, racing games, mass effect. Hell they even fucked up dragon age by trying to cater to a wider audience by completely removing bird's eye view from it completely, making it feel like some back water fantasy action fighter game. Yes EA has gone back and made games they failed upon better similar to how fallout 76 went but every other one of their projects have failed to make a come back in my eyes. Dragon age inquisition is the 3rd title in the dragon age series it is the big name title that has been able to redeem itself instead of progressively get worse. DA3 inquisition released before the mass string of failures to their big name titles. The world of dragon age intrigues me on the same level as the witcher 3 and to do it some credit it was released before it. And unlike the witcher 3 the series isn't over. It is a solid game on its own right. It suffers from having mindless repetitive content sprinkled throughout like most openworld games but if you turn your brain off during those instances of boring repetitiveness there is a world to experience and appreciate here. EA is corrupt but DA3 is literally a story about building up your empire, making a change in the world-only to see it become so successful that it begins to rot with corruption from the inside. 

Also download the mod that makes you pick up items without having to go through an animation, the mod that gives you a larger and longer lasting searching radius, and class rebalancing mods to make vanilla underwhelming skill options more enticing.

1) I often felt like the game was deliberately wasting my time, having to run back a ways just to turn in some inconsequential quest.
2) The storyline, and how the characters in the game react to it, makes absolutely no sense.

my first unfocused thoughts here 

I have fond memories of origins, that scene with Sten giving a guard a cookie was unexpected and funny. and in the end, I loved the journey and character. 

I had a hard time getting into inquisition initially on the PS3, I played again here and got sucked in briefly but the number of things to do can get tedious when finding items, killing the same enemy or getting ambushed by 2 bears that turn into 2 more bears turned me off, the sandbox feels much larger. the presentation, music, and story make it an enjoyable experience. but the gameplay is a mix for me.

Add to this the clunky controls where everything seem to have a 0.5-1s input delay, uninteresting party members (when comparing with the other DA's)  and a combat system that tries to be tactical and action-y at the same time; while failing at both.

I do not think that this game is bad, in fact I do believe that this game is the last good game that Bioware has made (granted Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, and the next Mass Effect Game have not come out yet).
I actually liked both the characters and the gameplay more than I did in dragon age II, however I was not invested as much in the Characters as I was with the crew of the Normandy. Changing the cast of characters for each game is a clever idea, however it restricts you from forming deeper attachments to your party, which is why I preferred that Mass Effect kept at least 3 companions in your party from the first game at least partially (Garrus, Tali, and Liara). If lets say Morrigan, Leliana and Alastair (granted all of them make cameos in this game depending on your choices in origins) were to be companions, it would have made the game much more compelling. 
The Music is amazing, the graphics are good (frostbite was not made for this type of game, but it is still better than Mass Effect Andromeda), and the story is quite alright.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Dragon Age Inquisition continues the story laid out for you in the previous games where you play as yet another new hero, which you can, thankfully, customize including its race. Things happen, you are in the wrong place and you acquire a cool power that lets you close veils in the sky, which are basically portals to the fade where demons can travel freely. You eventually find out who the bad guy is, a DLC boss from Dragon Age 2, that is seemingly immortal and you set out on your adventure to stop him.

Before you start your story, it's probably best to head out to Dragon Age Keep and pick your most important decisions from the previous games. The game will then import them into Inquisition where some story bits will be impacted by your previous choices though nothing major. 

So, you set yourself on yet another journey of saving the world, this time even on a bigger scale than the previous two games combined, where you'll travel to a lot of important and nice-looking locations that you may have read about in previous games as well as some familiar ones.

You'll meet a lot of interesting characters along the way that will join in your Inquisition, either directly or indirectly, and some very annoying ones, such as Sera. I would need at least an hour to describe how sht she is as a character from both writing and dialogue but I'll just leave it at that. The rest of your companions are pretty great, from a very friendly Qunari to a charming Tevinter mage. As is the case with every Dragon Age game, you can also romance some of these characters if you wish. 

Sadly, there are not that many major story choices that you can change, it's pretty straightforward, you gather allies and you defeat the bad guy, the end. The Trespasser DLC should be played if you want to see the real ending of the game and how it sets up the upcoming game in the franchise. I won't spoil much but I really enjoyed one particular character that has quite the major impact on the entire franchise. Overall, Inquisition has a fantastic story that surpasses its prequel by miles and is just as good as Origins, maybe even better.

Story rating: 8/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay is quite the mixed bag. On one hand, the combat itself is super fun and fluid, you'll never get bored of it and there are quite a lot of skills to learn. On the other hand, it suffered yet another consolization by removing your ability to alter your character stats as you see fit. Skill combos are also much simpler now and the game requires far less tactical thinking than before. I finished the game on nightmare and I had no stress whatsoever. Even the skill bar is straight-up console trash and you're limited to a fixed number of skill bars without any way of increasing it or changing it, which means you have to place points in your skill tree, not as you see fit but in a way that you don't overflow your bar. 

Most of the gameplay bits were designed to waste your time, to prolong the gameplay as much as possible. Every map you visit is an open-ended zone with tons of stupid things to do, such as collect 20 skulls, solve astrarium puzzles, capture locations and so and so forth. It has the standard mmo gameplay design tropes that we hate and every map you visit is the same. Luckily the combat and atmosphere carry the whole experience on their shoulders, also FYI, fighting the dragons was awesome.

There's also a new mechanic, a map that is pretty much an overview of Orlais and Ferelden, where you can send one of your 3 advisors to do timed objectives which in turn can give you gold, influence, items or unlock new paths or missions that you buy with said influence. The problem with this mechanic is that most of the events require you to wait actual real-life hours for them to complete, meaning you'll have to wait and keep going back to the game as you play. It's not a bad thing because obviously, it's an 80+ hours game and you'll keep returning to it but it's a bit tedious because you always have to return to the war table even when you're gone on missions. Luckily you can easily fast travel back and forth and besides main quest events, you can always do that whenever you want. 

Gameplay rating: 7/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Consistency is very important sometimes and Bioware is consistent when it comes to good voice acting. Inquisition is full of talented voice actors and they all do a fantastic job at voicing their characters, yours included. There is one exception, Sera. To hell with that character. 

Another fantastic thing about the audio is the soundtrack, it's phenomenal when it plays. Most of the time it's just the sounds of the environments. Wish we could've had a setting that maybe loops the music a bit more. Other than that, sound effects and whatnot are pretty good as well.

Audio rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
After the atrocious experience of Dragon Age 2, Inquisition finally returns to having a varied and incredible atmosphere. Every map feels unique, and there is never a sense of repetition in how each zone is designed. You can tell a lot of work was done in this particular aspect, you can even see story bits by just looking around you. Spell and skills are superbly lit and detailed, it never ever got boring to see my thunder spells cracking down on enemies' heads. 

Inquisition is visually stunning but does it run well? On a high-end PC it does, but I did play the game when it launched as well and it wasn't very well optimized for the hardware at that time. Still, nowadays you should be fine running the game on high/max settings. Bugs are present, as it's always the case with rpg's and you may get freezes/crashes once in a while but overall it's a smooth experience. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 9/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Inquisition may have received some hate for the things it did, but combat, story, especially the Trespasser DLC story, and the atmosphere are well worth the effort regardless if you're a fan or not. I hated Dragon Age 2 but you should play all 3 games for the upcoming entry. You can get Inquisition at any price you want, it's worth it.

Pros:
- Environments are kinda nice, especially when compared with previous DA games. No, seriously, it's pretty. 
- The Descent DLC is cool, cause it's all about dwarves and Deep Roads ^^. 
- Combat system in general COULD HAVE BEEN enjoyable, were it not for the bloated health bars and uninspiring encounter design.
- Dialogues are generally okey-to-good, with some jarring and cringey exceptions. 
- Ehh, guess that's it?

Cons:
- The plot is as generic as it gets, even by Bioware's standards. No stakes, no urgency, no purpose. BBG wants to do destroy the world because of reasons. You are the chosen one. Bioware's creativity at its peak. 
- Corypheous is the worst main villain in the history of video games. He literally fails at everything he attempts to do, he's laughably bad at building tension or being an adversary.
- The main story consists of several chapters, each of which needs to be unlocked by grinding mindless tasks, activities and fetch quests. Thrilling. At least later on they give you an option to buy the Power currency with gold, instead of grinding all the regions.
- The game tries to force this heroic 'last stand against evil' power fantasy with epic set pieces, grandiose cutscenes, cringeworthy dialogue, pompous music and endless shots of NPCs looking up to the PC, all of which stand in stark contrast to the actual gameplay, consisting of mindless grind, running errands, placing banners, collecting shards, gathering plants, mining for minerals, pitching tents and closing rifts. Map after map, region after region. Exciting!
- The entire thing is lacking focus. Pacing is all over the place. 
- Likewise, the game's mechanics are a mess, gameplay feels like a trashcan of design ideas thrown together without any direction or purpose. The flow of the game gets constantly disrupted with running back and forth, moving through loading screens, summoning the war council, grinding for power, browsing multiple menus.
- Combat is boring and repetitive. Each and every encounter feels samey and takes literal ages to get through. Trash fights around every corner. Enemies' HP bars bloated to ridiculous amounts. Nearly fell asleep when fighting a dragon.
- Companions are boring and uninteresting. Some are goofy for the sake of feeling different, but imo they all fall flat when compared with previous Bioware titles. Their personal storylines are dry, grindy, brief and forgettable.
- Player choice is nearly non-existent, and that's a cardinal sin for an RPG. 
- The game just feels like a single-player MMO most of the time. 
- Cutscenes feel unpolished, with NPCs phasing in and out, odd camera angles, occasional flickering or dodgy editing. 
- A matter of taste, but the game is too flashy with its combat FX. At times it's hard to know what's going on on the screen, and I've only had a single mage in my group. 

All in all there is a nice game buried deep under the horrible design choices and the general lack of focus. Trim the excess fat and polish what's actually good - hopefully the upcoming Dread Wolf is more focused on the story and choices, instead of activities and task lists. Quality over quantity. 

As it stands it's a bloated, unfocused mess of a game, with weak RPG elements, cliche story, unpolished mechanics and boring companions, all traded off for a big open world with the same five or so activities copy-pasted all over the game map. 

But it's pretty!

Buy when on sale if you're a fan of pretty fantasy worlds, otherwise avoid.

It had bugs but the most annoying one is when your party member/s stops moving. You need to command them to jump or use some abilities to make them move again. definitely had the potential to delay or fuck up your strategy.

Hard should've been the Normal difficulty with the even ground trial as default. The challenge will be just right for 1st playthrough. Limited heal pots and no hp regen after battles so you had to camp for replenish. That's a needlessly tedious shit to do, with how big the maps are to explore. This resulted me being super allergic in receiving damage.

Honestly, tactical cam is actually a + but it had too many -
It doesn't clip/move freely through terrains. Trees and other obstructive to vision doesn't fade unlike in DAO. You can only command repositioning of party members in tactical cam which annoyed me a lot. There's no ""ctrl +a"" or multi-select of party members.

Friendly fire is garbage. It's just there for masochists. Poorly implemented. Not a good idea to add for immersion 1st time playing.

Keyboard controls is not as bad as people think, just needs tweaking in key bindings to fit old DA controls. If only I can key mapp auto basic attack in left mouse button.

Tactics like in the previous titles is almost non existent. Pray the ability's tactic works the way you hope it will be used in combat. Because of this i micromanaged almost everything. The only barely acceptable ai was probably tank roles.

Limited skill slots was frustrating and sad.

A single player mmorpg, Fetchquesition as they say. Even if there are actual interesting side quest around, you will have a very slim chance of finding them because you'll immediately get bored that you won't have any motivation to explore the large reskin maps.

The weak mc introduction affected my connection with the inquisitor from start to finish. 

Because of Dragon Age Keep, I looked forward to callbacks, and it actually helped me continue to endure the game. 

my personal handpicked two good things
1.) 1st time fighting a high dragon, although succeeding high dragon fights will become ""just another Tuesday"". x100 better than previous DAs at least.
2.) SPOILER [spoiler] Morrigan[/spoiler]'s character development if your Warden romanced her [spoiler] and did the ritual, and went with her through the eluvian. or at least just the ritual really. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] true ending is in DLC. so[/spoiler] you better buy GOTY

I'm sorry but your guy's whole vision for DAI  is just wrong.
They open worlds are empty, nothing changes they are just empty ,and full of NPC waiting for you to kill them.

The combat is a chore basic enemies do not need butt tons of health to fight against ,nor do we need a basic enemy then multiple different ones just bring back the enemies to be just npc versions of classes. I looked at the health of one of the shades in the beginning of the game on normal. 2,000 something health, a dual wield rouge 518. So 4 times are much health as a level 3 rouge, and that is on tutorial level with armor that only has 41 rating. 

Every model int he game. One of the best things about the other games was the constancy of it being a normal world, so Elite enemies were he same size as standard ones, but now they are 8 to 9 ft tall, and shields while the NPC sword and board warriors get a huge tower shield, if you find the same one it's not even half the size.

No actual tactits ,and if you do try ,and tell your party to use this skill and this skill more they still won't. I want to be able to tell my archers ,and mages to fight at range my warriors to either be scrappers or tank ,or controllers not use this skill more often that this one.

No attribute points. It allows players to make the character theirs ,and right now it juts feel like Bioware ,and EA don't trust the players to make their characters.

 Let Warriors ,and Rogues use every weapon again. Allow the warrior to be an archer, allow the Rogues dual to use maces ,and axes. There was no point to taking this away.

 No more than 8 skills at skills at once ,and you need two slots for your evade ,and block skills.

 Special classes are lacking, extremely dumbed down form the 6 to 9 you could have had in Origins

Dumb crafting system. It is tedious ,and just badly made. You have to craft armor in a very specific way for your character, there is no base armor in the game that you can find that fits a play style which forces you to craft,and if you use to high level materials it goes into a level lock. Find these materials is also a chore, and not fun in the slightest way.

No healing I hated going into a dungeon getting in one bad fight ,and then having to go all the way back to my camp ,and then back track all the way back while have to fight the same respawning enemy NPCs. I'd rather prep ,and buy potions, and gear up I want to play a story driven RPG not a Single Player MMO.",1659638547,1659638547,False,16,1,0.544971942901611328,0,True,False,False

This game is one of my favourite games of all time, but it's definitely not without its own issues. The biggest issue is the filler content. In DA:I there are multiple regions that can be explored that each have a decent amount of stuff to do, but whether that stuff is actually worthwhile is the question. Many of the quests are simple and repetitive (i.e., place a flag here, collect this shard, destroy that fade rift there). There are some side quests that are actually interesting, but the rest is pretty much filler stuff. The actual gameplay is fun, but also different from the previous DA games. It's more action-oriented and simplified, which is suited for new/casual players, but those who prefer the more tactical style found in DA:O/DA 2 will be disappointed. Tactics is pretty much non-existent. It's technically still there, but heavily simplified to the point where you can't specify abilities and scenarios. Because of that the AI can be kinda stupid, which is especially annoying on higher difficulties. However, even on Nightmare difficulty I didn't need to control the others all that much—it's almost meant to be played completely through your own character. 

There are three story DLC: Jaws of Hakkon, The Descent, and Trespasser. JoK and Descent have their own region and story that's mostly disconnected from the main game; they were enjoyable enough. Trespasser both wraps up DA:I and makes way for the next game in a much more focused structure. There aren't any filler side quests, it's just one long quest. I really enjoyed Trespasser and highly recommend playing it, especially if you enjoyed the main story.

If you've played the previous DA games, you'll probably still enjoy this one. I liked the story, overall setting and companions; honestly, one of my favourite parts of DA:I is simply talking to everyone. For newcomers, the story might be confusing, but it does a kinda okay job at explaining what's going in game. If you had to play the previous DAs, I'd recommend DA 2 since its events are directly related to Inquisition. Oh, and you need to use EA's shit Origin client. I've been fortunate enough not to experience any major issues, but I know others have terrible experiences with it, so be wary. The game goes on sale usually for 75% off so I'd recommend you wait if you're unsure.

The third instalment in the critically acclaimed Dragon Age series and widely considered as the last Bioware masterpiece, Inquisition sets you out on an epic journey to stop yet another world ending threat.

TL; DR – Don’t let its age fool you, this is one of the last truly excellent AAA western RPGs to have come out in the past 10 years. Friendly to newcomers and familiar to veterans, this is one RPG that I highly recommend.

Story (4/5): In Inquisition, you play the role of the namesake Inquisitor who sets out to resolve a potentially world ending threat spurred on by an ancient evil. Aside from a few pacing issues and the deep-rooted lore that players need to be familiar with, Inquisition’s story is very much near perfect. All the hallmarks of the Dragon Age series return from the fantastic companion quests to the heavy decision which affect the world around you.

Gameplay (4/5): Like the Dragon Age titles before it, Inquisition plays out like its predecessors with a mix of real-time and strategy-style combat. Exploration is pseudo-open world with various side quests strewn along the map along the way. A central hub exists where you can mingle with your companions, manage your gear and commands your army on expeditions. The game can be as easy or difficult and simple or complex as you desire. I find that granularity refreshing, allowing players to decide just how much they would like to micro-manage. 

Controls (5/5): Played entirely on keyboard and mouse, there aren’t any complains I can think of. Default key bindings are logical with controls feeling intuitive and natural. Inquisition takes full advantage of the keyboards vast array of keys, and the mouse inputs feel snappy and precise. 

Graphics (5/5): Powered by the venerable Frostbite 3 engine, Inquisition has stood the test of time remarkably well. Character models are incredibly detailed especially facial details and animations. While the environments put many open world games to shame with everything from lush forests to deserts that span as far as the eye can see. Most cutscenes are rendered in real time and this helps greatly in the longevity of its presentation.  

Audio (5/5): Superb voice acting coupled with EA/Bioware’s tremendous sound department make for an aural experience that is as pleasing as the visual feast. Whether it be on headphones or speakers, Inquisition’s audio delivers the pivotal role of keeping players immersed in the world of Dragon Age.

Issues/Optimization: Inquisition may have been a demanding title at launch but, modern hardware will have no trouble running it. I did not run into any hardware/software compatibility issues throughout my playthrough. Aside from an audio-loss bug which needed me to restart the game, everything played out smoothly. Inquisition is mod-friendly too and one I would recommend you do after you’ve familiarized yourself with the game’s systems.

Overall (4.5/5): Dragon Age Inquisition’s experience, for me at least, is best described as a crescendo-decrescendo. The first quarter starts out strong, the second quarter is perhaps the weakest but, the final half is excellent throughout. Highly recommended!

The level design is awful and necessitates running back and forth trying to find the path through otherwise unpassable terrain.

The quests are more like cheap MMO quests - fetch this, find 20 of these, kill this badguy, etc. with barely any thought, background, or care put into establishing a why.

The characters have all the personality of cardboard cutouts and I find myself cringing when I'm forced to speak to any of them. Not because of the voices which are largely very good, but because their history, personality, and comments are so incredibly dull.

On the positive side, the graphics are pretty nice and the majority of the voice acting is good.

The voice acting is good.

There are more options for character starts than the second game

Cons:
Poorly optimized with always on anti-piracy running in the background
Gameplay specialized towards DPS play - there is no juggling healing if you want to play support nor is tanking optimal (you remove a key rift mechanic, disrupting them during fights, as you will have aggro)

Unfortunately. At some time in the last three to five years or so (i previously played on Origin) controller support has essentially disappeared for this game. 

I am unable to seek Steam Help because its a third party software and, unsurprisingly, EA Help is lackluster and suggested I go buy a new controller and hope for the best (as if I hadn't already done that because CLEARLY it couldn't be the game having an issue I thought). 

At this point I've tried literally everything I can think of or read about online and am just over it. 

Will I still play the game and suffer through M&KB purely for the nostalgia? Probably.

But if you are someone new to the game/series and considering stepping in here? Do yourself a favor and just wait for Dread Wolf next year. Hopefully it will have fewer issues than this game currently has.",1658780732,1658780732,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first, i bought this game 1 year ago and i gave up on it after 2 hours, the boring hinterlands and the clunky gameplay made me quit and i thought i would never buy it again.
But, as a huge mass effect fan, after loving to replay the legendary edition, i said to myself, i have to give dragon age another chance, and so i did.

After 22 hours into it, i got to say that i me enjoying it... it is not as good as mass effect but this sand box type game is huge and heavily inspired by game of thrones. Combat progression is excellent and the customization is great, but there is a lack of character development compared to previous games, also the story is very lacking, there is a huge amount of reading, and i dont like that.

The visuals hold up really good and the huge variety of biomas is just excellent, but one that i hate about the overall experience is the Power system. The power is given to the player every time he completes a Quest or activity, they are used to unlock new areas and to progress into the main plot, that for me, is game breaking, it forces us, players to grind a lot of hours in order to just progress ... i dont mind doing it, because i Love exploration, but really? It is so exhausting to grind in this game.

I wish i could change my character body, you cant in this game...but atleast you can change between your party members and use them in combat, you can even choose their skills like in the mass effect games. 

In general, Dragon age inquisition is a fantastic rpg, that needed a little bit more time when it comes to writing. But, well, you get to have a castle and a huge amount of content, i m 22 hours into it, and i barely progressed into the main story. 
Try to leave hinterlands as soon as possible, or you will get bored to tears. Another thing that i also recommend is, to search online for each area recommended level, yes, some areas have a level requirement, but others dont, i dont know if that is a bug or not... but sometimes it is so frustrating, spending 20 power in a new area, and then going there and enemies kill you instantly.

If you love medieval fantasy games, this game is for you, but make sure you see online all classes/races before you create your character, because the prologue is huge and u cant change your character when you are done. Also give combat a chance, when you're up to level 11/12 it gets much better.

It is a 7.5/10 game with a lot of content, optimization though, terrible, crashes and fps drop.

UPDATE: one of the best rpgs out there and one of the best games i have ever played, totally worth playing, glad i gave it another chance, and by the way, the expansions are huge and very rewarding, giving unique armor, weapons and a lot of new content, especially if you're looking for new challenges.

After the start and getting sent to the Hinterlands, the first town you visit has quests for you along the lines of ""Kill 10 Rams"", another was ""visit 5 locations"", and yet 3 more were ""visit 4 locations"". I think eating cheese is more interesting than this game. The lack of quality in questing is something I would expect from a cheap MMORPG, not something with the Dragon Age name. RPGs are supposed to have quests better than MMORPGs, but Elder Scrolls Online has better more exciting quests than this game. I've heard the story gets better, but between the uninteresting characters (DA:I has only 2 romance options for my char... Morrigan & Leliana in Origins were amazing and the ones in this game... well, don't want to say anything to offend anyone), the annoying controls, the needless clicking (sooo much unnecessary clicking, I wish there was an auto loot or a ""loot one to loot all"",  but nooo, every single corpse must be looted separately), and the boring quests (visit 4 more locations? ok will do!) , I have better games to play than trying to make it out of the Hinterlands zone. Now, time for some wine, cheese, and a better RPG, like Skyrim, any Fallout, or maybe even some Dragon Age Origins.

Speaking of Origins, I'll put my wine and cheese aside to discuss why DA:O is so amazing and what DA:I isn't. DA:O opens up with origin stories, which is chilled out and provides lots of flavor for a part of the game's lore. The Dalish are magic space tree people, the humans are fairly standard medieval knights and religion types, the dwarves have a nasty caste system, etc. You then get hauled off to Ostagar and you explore the Wilds, which introduces you effectively to the game and to more lore, and then the game really starts.

In DA:I you have your exciting opening, but then you get pushed into the Hinterlands - this broad but comparatively shallow area with a big question of why am I even here? Because one big missed opportunity is how poorly the game uses the rifts as a plot device early on. Rifts are in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by demons who don't do anything. Why aren't they in the middle of a ruined village, actually demonstrating why these things would be so horrific. Imagine something akin to Honnleath in DA:O - the village full of darkspawn - where you have demons tearing a village part, corpses being raised by spirits, etc, something that really demonstrates what will happen to ordinary people if this gets worse. In DA:I these demons are just hanging out minding their own business, no havoc, no killing, so why am I even in the Hinterlands? The opening portion of the game loses momentum with a large MMO area, and that is what a lot of people remember.",1626901176,1658340543,False,19,2,0.559047341346740723,0,True,False,False

Rather than expand or improve on the systems they had, they've replaced most everything from look and feel to abilities, movement, and combat system.  Inquisitions has a bit more in common with Dragon Age 2, and if you prefer that one to Origins it might be up your alley, but it also has a lot of problems that neither of its predecessors did.

The vast majority of the gameplay in Inquisition is wandering around large maps hunting for specific pick-ups or area markers to claim, punctuated by frequent combat with perpetually respawning enemies.  In this, it seems to have taken inspiration from MMOs or successful open world games like Elder Scrolls, and this could be a lot of fun if it were better implemented.  However, the maps are defined by invisible walls and impassible slopes, and actually getting around them involves more switchbacks and spamming the jump button to try to get around unseen obstacles than actual exploration.  Much of what you see you can't actually get to, and you can't go too far without having to sit through another combat sequence that won't distinguish itself from any other before you'll be able to progress.  Which is its own set of problems, because

Combat, likewise, has been completely overhauled, but mostly for the poorer.  It retains a few of the tactical elements from Origins as options you can go through the motions of if you pause and insist, but it's designed to seem much faster paced, with your party automatically attacking anything that moves and firing off about one attack a second.  They've removed healing and area effects, and with stuns and hold durations being reduced to vanishingly short spans in relation to how long a whole fight takes, the only mechanic worth paying any mind to is maintaining Guard and/or Barrier, which consists mostly of repeating the same action whenever a little meter depletes to keep your shields recharging so you don't take any health damage, making any micromanaging or tactics beyond watching cooldowns while your party runs off and does its thing largely pointless.  

To make up for this increase in pace (and, let's be honest, to pad out the playtime) every enemy is a massive pile of HP, with even the weakest level-appropriate enemies taking taking dozens of hits from the entire party to go down, and stronger enemies absorbing nonstop attacks for literally minutes on end.  This hit-sponge approach to enemy design arguably makes sense in MMO raids where dozens of people are trying to stay alive while chipping away at a group boss or the like, but in Inquisition it will be very clear whether you're going to take any damage or not within the first few seconds, and then you kind of just... wait.  Watching your guard meter or your barrier meter so you can hit the appropriate key when it drops close to zero, but otherwise just waiting for the nominally human enemy who somehow takes dozens and dozens of hits from lethal weapons to fall.  And bosses?  I'm not exaggerating when I say minutes of just waiting with zero concern that you'll lose.  No dodging, no maneuvering, no setting up special vulnerabilities or group combination attacks, just waiting.  You could see hints that boss fights might develop this way in some of the Origins DLC (Harvester especially, but some of the bosses in Awakening as well) and that trend of endlessly respawning waves of enemies instead of observable and strategic battlefields was already the direction the series was headed in Dragon Age 2, but both of them together in an open map that takes hours to explore before moving on is just... it's really boring, is the thing.

The graphics are... good?... until they're not.  The environments are very distinctive and feel real until you hit the invisible walls, and the textures and lighting effects and all that hold up remarkably well; it's definitely the best looking game of the series so far, at least until the people show up.  The characters, though, are pretty off-putting with only two or three exceptions.  Everybody's very pale and very sweaty or greasy all the time, several characters return from the first game but aren't recognizable until you hear their voice actors and realize this poor sickly person is supposed to be your friend from before, and the setting's only original species, the Qunari (the tall bronze guys from DAO turned rad horned gargoyle looking guys from DA2) are now just huge guys with humorously small heads and horns instead of foreheads.  (And, of course, very sweaty.)

The writing is still pretty good and the characters are easy enough to get attached to, but rather than a relatively straightforward story told through conversations and cutscenes like the first two games had, much of the story in Inquisition is political machinations and ancient antagonists that you've never met before taking advantage of wobbly magic systems native to the setting that you're supposed to already know about from DA2 DLC or the comics or something, and the context of who they are and why they matter is only given in this game in text via various discoverable books and letters and whatnot throughout the world that you can pick up for points and read through piecemeal if you're invested.  Very much like the Destiny model of world-building, except without the simplicity of an uncomplicated setting to wrap it all up in.  

If you could skip most of the mission and combat gameplay and just make conversation choices it would be an amusing visual novel of sorts, but so much of the game is just a slog to get to the next story scene that I honestly can't be arsed to drag myself through it unless I'm wasting time at work.  I'd happily play a very trimmed down version of it, but as is, it's a hundred hour game with about a 1:4 interesting to boring playtime ratio, and that's a huge bummer for a series that also contains my favorite game, personal opinion.  The party banter and cutscenes are worth watching on youtube, but I don't know about playing the game to get to them.",1658319716,1658319716,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're a completionist, you could probably spend a good 500 hours in these lands - be sure to keep plenty of saves (one for every day and three or more 'rolling' saves) and plan your achievements carefully. I didn't.
If you read all the lore in here, it's at least another 100 hours - there's SO much history and content and it's well-worth a read if you want to understand the characters and the DA universe.
You can also import your actions from DA:O, using the Golden Nug.
The gameplay can be anything from walk-in-the-park to skin-of-your-teeth, depending on the party you choose and how you use them, with some battles forcing you to try new tactics and squeeze every ounce out of your party's abilities, inventory and the environment. There are also plenty of puzzles to challenge your problem-solving skills, scavenger hunts and chance encounters that could benefit or betray your outit, sometimes depending on your later choices.
The storyline draws you deep into the world and will differ with every race you choose for your character. As you play, the plot thickens and forces you to make difficult, sometimes world-changing decisions. Events and individuals will surprise you and keep you guessing to the end (unless you guess right).
I would probably return to this game in a few years and play a different race, make some different decisions and select Nightmare mode (without Trials).",1658177960,1658177960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've probably clocked close to 2000 hours in the game including all of its various versions. That all by itself should be revealing! :-)

I think of myself as more of a Mass Effect kinda guy, but my plays on ME--including the 600+ hours I've put in on MELE--pale by comparison. This game might just be the apogee of BioWare's work. Even now, I discover or learn something new every time I play. 

I saw another review where the reviewer complained that the game was more like a single-player MMORPG. I could only wish! That for me would be the ultimate: if BioWare--or the modding community--could find a way to decouple the game from the core mission and really have it be a single-player MMORPG, like Skyrim. 

I'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty of why i think the game is great...others have covered both the game's highs and lows and after nearly a decade and nearly ten thousand reviews I can't imagine I have anything to add. In any event it would be hard for me to unpack because it's not any single aspect or even combination thereof that makes it work for me, but the integrated whole. 

Don't get me wrong--the crafting and purchasing interfaces are not what I'd call models of good ergonomic design--you have to constantly switch between the Inventory and either the Crafting or Buying screens to make any comparisons between what you have and what you are thinking about making or buying--and it drives me batty that you can't sort or filter anything in your inventory beyond the categories the game provides. 

If I'm trying to make paldrons or greaves, should I really have to scroll down through all the armors in that category just to locate them? If I want to improve Bianca, why do I need to wade through the completely irrelevant Bow category just to do so? 

If I'm looking to buy a particular type of crafting resource, wouldn't it be nice if there were a submenu that mirrored the way the crafting resources are broken out in your Inventory? 

And in all cases, why oh why can't they show the existing--if any--item you're crafting in a side window, just as they do when you're comparing inventory items or buying from a merchant?

And speaking of crafting resources...why do I feel like I'm spending more time and energy harvesting them than actually playing the game? Aren't I the leader of a vast organization with a logistics infrastructure whose job it is do just that? They had a pretty good system going for that in DA2...what happened to that? 

Shucks...I'd settle for an auto-harvesting function where you automatically hoovered up any resource you could detect. And maybe an automated version of the regional resource missions at the War Table--have each source automagically accumulate resources on the clock and put them in your inventory. 

But honestly, these are mere nitpicks. To reference Sturgeon's Law, this game is not only in the top ten percent, it's in the top one percent. As such, I cannot truly criticize the game for its flaws--they just seem more noticeable than they might in a lesser product. 

So there you have it. Highly Recommended.",1658157048,1658157048,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

Nothing of value was lost; it was essentially ""Oh look, a new obsession for me, neat!"" At least I called it right early on. Anyway, onto the review!

I've played the whole series and DA:I is my favorite installment (blasphemy, yeah, I know). Suck it, bronto-lickers, there are dozens of us!

The graphics are beautiful. The voice acting is nearly flawless. The companions are memorable and compelling. The locations are gorgeous. At your home base, you can jump off of balconies and crap like that without taking fall damage! I love the story and the main story quests. Companion quests? Blew me away at times; I honestly didn't see a few of them coming. The rest of the quests? Optional! That's right, if you're not interested in shard-hunting or finding every location in a region or unlocking astrariums or looking for bottles of Thedas or...okay, holy crap this game has a fork-ton of fetch quests, but seriously, you can skip them all! I don't, but you, dear reader, you can! I didn't even know to unlock/visit the Forbidden Oasis until my second playthrough. I prefer to do all the quests, even the stupid fetchy ones, because I'm an enormous sucker for grinding and the longer I spend searching for a poorly marked shard on my map, the more companion banter I get! Speaking of banter, most of it is super witty and genuinely funny (and heartbreaking, at times).

Personally, I adore all of the DLC and Trespasser is mandatory. 

Really, I have zero complaints about this game. I haven't even bothered to figure out how to mod it yet. I've played as all the different classes and most of the races; all fun. I love being able to tint armor. I love that there are some really random ""secret"" quests like finding the Ardent Blossom headgear. I love lamp- I mean DA:I! I love DA:I. 

If you want to play a game that can easily take 80 hours to complete, has tons of different regions (and like 3 deserts), where you can pretty much go wherever you want, whenever you want, and enjoy the view and the banter as you run around, this is the game for you! 

I haven't had any issues with bugs or crashes with settings on ultra. The Golden Nug that you get after your first complete playthrough unlocks all saved schematics for following playthroughs, and that's frigging amazing. Even with tier 1 crafting materials, you can be super overpowered early on if you want on your later runs. 

Any complaints I -could- make are largely related to the fact that DA:I isn't Origins. We all miss having the ability to set tactics. I know. It hurts, but time heals all. Regardless, this game *isn't* Origins, so I've chosen to embrace it for what it is. A comping mechanism for my mental illness- er... I mean, a genuinely fun game. Anyway, I thought that Awakening was better than Origins, sooo...ah, sh!t, I'm just full of bad opinions, aren't I?

Oh, wait, I do have *one* complaint! Mounts. They're so cool, and varied, and fast, and...okay, they're *completely* useless if you want to listen to your companions chat while you explore. Once you're on your giant battle nug or whatever other monstrosity you've chosen to saddle up (including your boring old horse), your companions disappear into the void and you're on your own until you dismount. Boo, that sucks! Give my companions horrible zombie horses, BioWare! Jeez. 

The last positive point I can make is that my probably unhealthy obsession with this game got me to start writing smutty fanfic (cough-Blackwall-cough), so I mean...the romances are pretty nice. At least my favorite one is.

I'm still going to make scrambled eggs out of a certain elven apostate when we get the next game in a decade or two, but not every character can overcome their flaws.

It's definitely more fun coming back to this game knowing more of the lore of the whole franchise, but it's also enjoyable as a stepping stone to the games. I definitely do miss the sense of urgency from Dragon Age Origins, because I never felt like the world was in any actual danger when my Inquisitor decided they wanted to pick flowers for ten hours or yknow, get in good with the companions.

Visiting the Fallow Mire after 2020 hit different than it did back in 2014, but coming back to the game all these years later felt like coming home, in a way.

I loved Bloodwych, Balders Gate, Dragon age origins and thought rpgs where my thing because of it.  However I now realise levelling beats skill, combat is boring and not strategical (just hold left mouse and occasionally press a number if you feel like it), mounts are pointless, endless bears attacking, boring story, endless running around just for yet another attack, re running areas because you were 2 levels too low to complete them first time round, and just so many other parts to make you want to stop playing.

The war table is an absolute icon of why I don't like rpgs.  If you like pressing a button to perform and pointless task and doing all the character voices in your lonely head, probably about how you'll smash some war band and then have an orgy with your right hand then this game is for you.  There is so much wasted time running around skyhold trying to find the companion to talk to while your life slips away that playing half an hour a day might mean you never actually start a mission.  

In summary if you have no life and are umemployed that romancing a digitised companion might be right up your street.  Or learning to craft a piece of armour by reading a text and clicking a tick is a sense of great achievement.  This game has every dull cliche right here.

And in my opinion, take it for what you will, the games get less interesting with each new addition.  I tried to play the second one way back when it came out and never could get into it.  Recently I pushed through and beat it and though it wasn't my favorite there were some fun times to be had.   

However Inquisition is terrible.  I'm not even sure really what it is, I've tried on several occasions to get into this game, I've spent 11 hours attempting to find the part of the game that makes me care about it at all and it's just sooooooo boring.  Console commands don't exist in this one, so you can't even cheat yourself some better stuff to have a little fun.  Dragon Age Inquisition is not a bad game. It's just a painfully ""meh"" game.  

When I play an rpg I want to feel like a bad ass and the game does a poor job at making you feel strong  because A: You do a pitiful amount of damage to anything regardless of your class unless you're hyper over-leveled and B: Every single enemy is a tank that takes way too much to kill.  I get it if it's a boss, but tell me why Joe Shmoe, the shield wielding generic templar, takes the concentration of my entire party to kill in less than 60 seconds?

tactical combat without meaningful tactics, makes rock paper scissors look complex
boring classes and abilities
awful writing that wants to be game of thrones instead of its own thing
worst console action gameplay, it feels like a bad port
awful and nonsensical UI, why cant i see what abilites do on the hotbar? who made this?
almost NO rpg, cant talk to npcs (left click attacks lol), dialog choices are bioware shovelware standard (X didnt like this)
mindless crafting because its 2014

back then the devs listened to the community and their critique about DA2s repetitive environment(s) so they put their focus on creating a bigger world while essentially neglecting everything else. to be blunt:
DAI is not a sequel, it's just a copy of DA2 placed in a bigger environment.

Origin's world was a little cramped, but had a lot of character, along with the story which was amazing. Speaking of story, inquisition’s is pretty good, there are some fun characters (even SPOILER returning ones), and it has that same Bioware feel, where your actions might actually matter. So with that said, I really like the action rpg combat, pretty fun, with different skill trees to get, and various combos. Characters are fleshed out and have meaningful (or fun) chatter. Being an inquisitor feels great, judging people/leading the inquisition. The open world is nice with an abundance of side-quests, some of which are interesting, and the game looks pretty nice and ran on my not so good pc (at the time).
      Next, the game can be modded to fix most things, and I am a pretty easy to please gamer. But here are some dislikes that I have. The lack of crazy (or just deep_ rpg elements and unlockable sub classes was kind of sad, unlike the first game, they just appear after certain points with no real story or quest tied to them. The mount system is awful, it almost feels like they put the mock up demo in, instead of the finished system, sort of a tank controls style system. The terrain feels weird, you get caught on every pebble, some paths require almost parkour levels of jumping to get somewhere in the intended way (leading me to get lost, as I thought certain areas were off limits). The crafting and items system has a major downfall, where you have a large amount of trash all the time but nothing to do with it, and crafting can get weird and complex with a lack of benefit. You can craft amazing gear, then can't find an upgrade for 4 levels.
      Minor things I guess, I love the game, there are just some little things. Love Origins more, but this game does give you that modern Dragon age feel (because that is what it is) and it has a lot of fun and memorable parts.

Now, I have experienced DAI through Steam mostly for all the DLC’s I couldn’t acquire through PS4 and it is an absolute headache; no fault of Steam whatsoever but Origin’s (EA’s platform).

Logging in has become a ritual of doom, knowing that I would need to reach customer service over and over again. Customer service has been competent, proactive, polite and swift <so shout-out to them> the problem -I figure- is Origin’s platform. It needs work and restructure, because you cannot place games on a rival platform and make it fraught with logging in bugs. It’s not a good look for EA if your own platform can’t handle the simplest task as LOGGING IN.

For first timers, you may still play this one but you might miss on a lot if you didn't play the first two. So go and play those first and update the story in DA Keep. You'll be encountering characters and somehow, the story, more meaningful if you are already familiar with the events that happened in the past.

I enjoyed the gameplay especially since it is more updated, but for some reason, I didn't utilize the pause button as much as I did compared to the last two games - which means that I relied more on just mindlessly killing the enemy rather than making a tactical play for this game. Story and development seems lackluster compared to Origins but still decent enough to play the game (I got bored at the middle but I paved through and finished it).

Overall, DA:I is still a good game, albeit being pseudo-open world. For a game that is released in 2014, it's still worth it playing. So go ahead and try this out. 8.5/10!

But the cracks are still showing: A lot of trashy filler quests, the power-mechanic is just there to stretch out the game time and the combat is not as trategic and tactic as the game wants you to think it is.

The game has a few bugs here and there and it's certainly a product of it's time in terms of gameplay, however BioWare (IMO) does an excellent job of consistently bringing nuanced stories into the gaming fold. 
Thedas is a troubled land and it shows, the people are constantly under stress of the undead, demons or the likes of bandits and ect. during the troubled times that we often find ourselves within, trying to help guide the continent towards a beneficial peace for all, or plunge it into a new type of darkness. 
---THIS--- Is why I continue to come back and play them. The option to control who YOUR character is, how they react to things and how to manage others, is all a formula (once again IMO) to encourage you to try and immerse yourself and get lost in this world and it's struggles.

The story/characters/world are great outside of a few caveats, the open world stuff is hit or miss but I really don't mind it as much as a lot of people do. Where the game really lacks for me is the combat, its not very good from a cRPG perspective or from an action game perspective. Origins, for example, had great AI tactics with a lot of variety, which made combat go a bit more smoothly on higher difficulties where you wouldn't have to pause to issue orders as much. For some reason, this game has very little in the way of actual tactics you can give to your companions. You can tell them to follow OR defend someone(including themselves), set stamina/magic thresholds and set abilities to priority, enabled or disabled. Thats it. Its so limiting, and honestly it wouldn't be the worst thing if the AI on its own behaved, but more often than not you'll find AI controlled ranged characters just being right up next to the big tank enemies who will kill them in a few hits. I can't imagine what it must be like on harder difficulties, you must have to pause constantly or just play in the overhead view. 

Again though, like I said its a good game but that really holds it back from being great. If you love the dragon age world, you will enjoy this a lot. I especially enjoyed Solas, THE Iron bull and Dorian as characters, they were all great and maybe even better than beloved characters from origins like Allistar and Morrigan. But, you do have to deal with Sera and that is certainly a negative.

- Don't do any side quests. They are dull as all hell. Only do the main story and character quests for the characters you like most. There are too many characters and some of them are kind of meh. 
- Look up explicit walkthroughs as soon as you are confused because they just throw random ass controls at you throughout the game without explaining. Don't trust that this game will be discoverable with reasonable effort. (Example, use the F key to eavesdrop? A key I've never used in the whole first half of the game? When the circle icon I'm familiar with requires me to click 99.99% of the time?) After consulting with another player who played on Origins, it seems possible that the timing of the mini-tutorials are bugged on the steam version, but who knows.
- Turn the difficulty setting WAY up, otherwise the fighting is just ""hold down the R key""... Like, literally. I played trespasser way under-leveled and found it more enjoyable since it actually mattered what I did in the battle. The tactical camera is junk, just ignore it. 
- The download is WAY bloated at over 39GB. Make sure you have time to play and get through it because it's going to eat your whole disk if you have a laptop and any other substantial programs.

the story is perfect and unexpectable things happen all the time. your choices matters because some choices may cause the charracters become upset or happy with you. the design of characters is awesome. each one has their own story to tell and you can choose if you want them to be closer to you or not. its not just about you in this game, its about everyone in the Thedas(the world in the game) so what you do affects whole bunch of people and your actions are loved by some and hated by others tho you can keep the balance with your choices.
so if you want to say this game is a human, music is his soul, designs is his mind and the arts are his heart.
now, this human is crippled lol
the combats are so boring and you just spam the attack button. the enemies dont do anything special. they are either so easy to die or so tough. the world is very massive but due to its greatness there isnt really much to do. you dont really need . the physics are too bad in this game and the graphic is so boring. the skill point tree is really useless since you cant relly on any of the abilities in fighting because all you do is spam attack and sometimes use those abilities for a little bit of more damage.
this game had the potential to be a lot more better but i think u cant expect much of the games which are published by EA.

do i recommend it?
if you are looking for a story based role playing game, yes

This game also feels very grindy for no real reason, you need power for missions, which is a bad mechanic because it leads players to do side-quests, which lead them to spending hours not playing the actual story. The story progression is also not super clear so players who just want the story might end up confused about what to do next, not expecting a 20 minute wait time at the War Table. The game throws so much stuff at you, and when you find a quest interesting enough to attempt, you're slapped in the face with yet another war table wait time for a side quest with no reason. Some side quests make you go out into the field, fast travel back to your base, unlock the path, and head back over to where you just were 5 minutes ago to progress along the quest. Many quest mechanics were not thought through or with an average player in mind, instead opting for a confusing progression system and questing that breaks the flow of gameplay.

this might be a controversial take but,,, while i enjoy this game, it's a shame about the writing, if you are looking for an open world game where you can go from one side quest to the next and clearly see the progress you have made then this might be a good game for you, that being said,,,

the writing is terrible, with the botching of multiple characters by making them have certain views that go against everything else that that character stands for making them all a ball of contradictions to the writers seemingly suffering from a case of """"enlightened centrism"""" as they try to both sides the topic of fucking slavery and of course this is happening with one of the 2 visibly poc characters you can have on your party and of course it goes against everything else the character usually stands for, the other character you can have on your party who is visibly poc is a woman who is a pro circle mage [if you know anything about dragon age you will know why this is a big yikes moment] personally one of the most annoying characters for me was cassandra but that's likely because i'm pagan and while it seems like the writers were trying to make it so she becomes more accepting of your character not believing in the majority religion and possibly having a different religion i never saw that character development also the game's way of talking about racism is just essentially making your character deal with racism if you make certain choices during the character create but then the game doesn't really do anything with that concept, it's just fantasy racism with no pay off of being able to do anything about it, the closest there is is looking up a guide to see that if you try to get liliana to be the new chantry person instead of cassandra then she tries to help the elves

also i wouldn't recommend this game if you are suffering from an eating disorder as the character create might be triggering, while you can change your characters face changing there body isn't an option and for me at least the elf characters are so thin that it can be triggering for me to play as one, this is a shame since i am nonbinary and my expression is using they/them and he/him pronouns while looking feminine and the male elf characters are the closest i am able to get to that since all of the other male characters are muscular and playing as a female character triggers my dysphoria both with the chest they have and with the use of she/her pronouns for a character that is meant to on some level be representative of me, i was unsure of saying this last part but i find it unlikely that i am the only one dealing with this and someone else might find this helpful",1655454288,1655454288,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Score: 4/10
Pros:  Uh. Hmm. There really isn't anything profound enough to give points too. Everything is either eh, or mediocre at best. Skills don't do enough, combat doesn't do enough. Your narrative choices do have more impact then DAII, but not enough still.
Cons:  The game shits on the legacy of Dragon Age: Origins, just not as bad as Dragon Age II. The gameplay is a slog and the pacing is terrible. Open world was one of the worst decisions they could have done from this game, as now doing things to complete the game and have a more fulfilling narrative is tedious at it's nicest. I don't look forward to going to new areas, as now I have to spend like 3-6 hours walking back and forth to make sure I have everything. The alternative option is to use guides which risks spoilers so I'd say that's another hit on the game. You shouldn't want to use guides in a game about it's story and adventure. After the first act my motivation to continue tanks hard. The game is even more backwards as the dlc retroactively makes the whole thing pointless and shows off how pointless it was. Trespasser should have never been a thing, it literally kills the entire point of DA:I.
Recommend to: I really don't know. People who want to continue the DA experience and hope DA4 is good.
Overall: Hopefully they just release another comic/book/dlc that allows you to make your choices, and DA:I is overall painful to get through.",1655255440,1655255440,False,0,0,0.457190364599227905,0,True,False,False

I'd heard good things about the series, and I enjoy good storytelling in an open world, but this? This is not comparable to The Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate, or Divinity Original Sin. because they all have great storytelling and are well designed in terms of maps, mechanics, and world logic. All things that are missing from this game so far...


Every area looks like a lazily thrown together collection of undetailed, unimaginative, empty, premade stuff that all looks the same. The sound varies horrendously when people talk, so you don't know if someone is on your right or left side and the voices. I've never heard anyone speak so monotonous!! Even in fucking Skyrim, which has only 4-5 default voices for the NPCs, you hear more variety in the dialog. Then there is the constant fetch-quest-bullshit that drags the game down the most. Everywhere you go, someone tells you to kill 4 enemies in this area, bring them 5 sacks of something, or a letter from someone that lies dead somewhere in a ditch. WHY DO I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS TIMEWASTING FILLER??? You run across the map at a snail's pace (no sprinting or any other speed than a slight jogging). The comabt is boring and bland. You hit the enemy until he dies and sometimes use your ability. There are no healing spells and most of the enemies look the same. The game drags on so much and apart from the main quest, there is not much value to be gained by sidequests or chores you need to do. All in all, this game gets a 4/10 from me.

Now, comes the 3rd day I am supposed to play it- it wouldn't open again. Now I'm done putting up with it. Really pissed on the issues launching this, this is the only steam game that got problem with my computer.

Edit: It finally launched again, just when I was about to uninstall it. Will not change my first rate on this game until after I finish it. I really want to like this game, I wanted to see what other info the sequel games had for my Warden.

Edit 2: Okayyyy!!! With my tons of patience, I made it work just fine. The game. I love it! although it lacks a bit of immersion when playing as non human character, it's still okay.

I will state it has been several years since I've played Origins or II, but this game irks me from what I have played.

The game feels like it wasn't designed to be played on keyboard, nor was it designed to be played on a controller. It is an extremely confused game when it comes to game control - and yes, you can remap - but as a game series that started out as a successor to CRPGs of the late 90s and early 00s, it certainly feels like it is trying to be both a CRPG and a game that was never meant to be on computers.
The characters go into uncanny valley, and often times don't look at each other when they talk. I think Solas is the worst for this as his proportions look wrong, but so does everyone.
I am a dalish elven mage - so where is the hatred that the previous two games established?
The gathering of materials is weird, and makes it feel like a Ubisoft collectathon with no direction.
It feels like a best of hits for characters with all of the characters showing up that are the fan favourites, and so far, that's okay, but I never liked a lot of them, and its jarring to have these characters I personally did not like back.
Combat feels janky. Tactics mode is like its aimed purely for controller, and it gives me motion sickness to use it. Regular combat requires you hold to a button to auto attack. Why?
Origin launcher - I would have rather purchased on Origin and played on Origin over purchasing this fuckup. You have to have Origin up to date. But it never tells you that. You can't play offline because you need to launch Origin, so if your internet goes down like my whole state's did for a day in March of 2022, tough shit, don't play video games. This one really pisses me off, and I just don't understand the design choice here. And for those willing to go ""just use mobile data"" - sod off. Data is 1) limited, 2) because everyone was on the network, slow to the point of taking 20 minutes to load any page, and 3) didn't work because some of the mobile network were also down. Either explicitly advertise on the page in big letters you need a connection, or don't sell the game.
Inventory management is garbage. There's no sort function, either by type or by stats, they're just there.
I should reflect that I hate the character creator. You can't make a nice looking character. I don't like the weird X/Y axis thing going on. I would have rather sliders that are preset or a slider with a number value attached.

Characters get annoyed that I don't do the main quest, but allow me freedom to explore. It doesn't affect their opinion of me, but I get frustrated here. Either give me a world to explore, or don't, since the world seems huge.
Load times are extremely variable. Sometimes, the game to get to main menu from launch takes 2 minutes, other times takes 10 minutes. Sometimes, while playing, travelling between camps takes up to 7 minutes. The loadscreens for the areas this happens in so far have been tips, while areas it instantly loads have had massive lore dumps. I can't understand why this is. To further comment on this, when I loaded up at 6.5 hours of gameplay, I had 5 hours and 20 minutes. I have yet to die, so the time is spent on loads.
7 hours in, why has only 36% of the playerbase managed to get to the second major quest? I think that's more telling of the game than any review.

But Dragon Age Inquisition was very disappointing for me and maybe I should have expected that after finishing Dragon Age 2.
It's a common sentiment that the world of Thedas is full of interesting lore, creatures, characters, and politics. It is a dreadful world. This fantasy world does not have very many moments of reprieve or peace, even when the main threat has mostly been eliminated. It cannot be overstated how interesting and deep the world of Thedas is and it is still just as amazing in Inquisition.
But the story of Inquisition is so fragmented and poorly paced that I spent the VAST MAJORITY of my 80 hour playthrough doing boring side quests and completing objectives that feel like chores.
Dragon Age Inquisition introduced the War Table and Power mechanics, where you gain Power for completing side quests, and exploring the world. You then use this Power as a currency of sorts at the War Table, where you conduct operations that may give slight bits of story or character building, but mostly are just a paragraph of text that you forget about in 5 minutes. However, you can choose to mostly ignore the War Table aside from completing the main quest and unlocking new zones in the ""open world"". 
These two mechanics have two major flaws: 
1. In order to progress the main quest, you must gain enough Power to unlock the missions, which means completing boring side-quests which each give you a fraction of the total Power you will need to progress.
2. You have to wait REAL WORLD TIME in order for objectives to finish at the War Table, like it's a fucking mobile game (or warframe) which is such a waste of your time and it is clear that the developers just wanted to pad the players' game time. The War Table completely disrespects the players' time and its insulting.

The ""open world"" of DAI is more like a bunch of fragmented levels which are designed in a way that an open world would be. You can think of the world in DAI as one very large map with separated zones and individual loading screens. The zones in DAI are very similar to the zones of many MMORPGS like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. Which brings me to my next comparison.
The game feels like it was originally designed to be an MMORPG but the developers realized they were supposed to be making a single player RPG and decided to dump all of their interesting content in the Main Story and leaving all of the side-quests and zones to lack depth and be bland:
1. The simple side-quests with minimal information which litter and infest the many zones of the world.
2. The Main Story which is severed completely from the rest of the game. 
3. The time consuming collection of crafting materials for making gear or cosmetics. 
4. The simple action game-play with tab-targeting and limited hotbars for abilities. 


But how is the Main Story?
It's pretty good! And if you are reading this review and wondering why I am recommending this game despite all of my criticisms, it is mostly because of the Main Story, the world of Thedas, and the characters that reside in it and participate as your party members throughout the game. Luckily, if you decide to purchase this game on Steam, you will have the GOTY edition which includes the DLC that was released after the initial release. This is a good thing because the ending of the Main Story campaign in DAI was extremely underwhelming. The DLC: The Trespasser, expands on the ending of the DAI and takes place two years after the ending of the Main Story, which serves as a great conclusion to the story and as a good cliffhanger for the next title in the series and it feels like the proper ending of DAI that should have been in the game to start with, rather than served as DLC for later.
The story isn't perfect, but the dialogue and choices that are made throughout it are decent enough to keep you interested and just might be enough to make you slog through the many terrible side quests. Your ""Inner Circle"" of companions have interesting stories and their quests are where the other interesting content lays. Your party members will go through personal changes as you complete their missions and you will see them change as you play the game. It's good stuff. My personal favorite character story-lines were Cullen, Cassandra, and The Iron Bull. 
However, the most important character, the main character, is written very poorly. Throughout the 80 hour adventure I spent with my character, I felt an extreme disconnect and never once felt as though I was role playing in the world. It felt more like I my mouse was controlling an emotionless sock puppet that just went through the motions and never developed as a character. In Dragon Age 2, you saw development with Hawke. they go through loss, they struggle with their reputation, they grows as a character. In Dragon Age: Origins, your dialogue choices are more varied, and you feel more of a connection with your character because they are just as lost as you and are a silent protagonist that will only say as much or do as much as you. In DAI, the dialogue system suffers from the same thing that many ""RPGS"" now-a-days are suffering from: the voiced protagonist with a dialogue wheel. There are times where it works, Mass Effect and Dragon Age 2 worked fine, but DAI tries to play both sides of the field. DAI wants you to role play as your character and they want your character to be a representation of you, but they also want a protagonist that fits the story and they will insert dialogue and actions in cutscenes that you did not specifically choose, leaving you feel dissatisfied no matter what kind of character you are looking for. It's disappointing.

The last thing I will discuss is the bugs.
This game has bugs, many bugs. Some, I would argue, are even game breaking. On my first play-through of this game, I was trying to complete a quest that allows you to craft lyrium potions which act as essentially mana potions. These potions are pretty important for mages during combat, as they speed your recovery of lyrium and allow you to cast your spells at a quicker rate. However, when I turned in the quest, the lyrium potion was not available to craft, and crafting them is the only way that you are able to obtain them. The only save that I could load to in order to potentially retry the quest, was 2 hours before. So if I wanted to get lyrium potions, I would have to load back 2 hours of progress and hope the quest works the second time. But the game has many more bugs than that:
-Being unable to pickup a highlighted item.
-Unable to talk to an NPC to finish your quest.
-Mobs despawning in the middle of combat.
-Enemies flying up in the air when using the Whirlwind ability upgrade which pulls enemies to you.
-Your highlighting ring making a sound for an item nearby when there is no item nearby to pick up.
-Herbs and ores glitching inside the ground or walls.
-Your character flying in the air after colliding with terrain.
-Missing textures.
-Music cutting out randomly.
-Sound all together cutting out randomly.
-Mobs standing still and just taking hits in the middle of combat.
-Mobs spawning in the ground.
-Mobs' models still standing even though they are dead.
-Your party staying in combat even though all enemies have been cleared.
etc.

I have heavily criticized this game but I still think it may be worth your time if you are willing to put in that time. If a single player RPG with action combat and a decent main story and companions sounds good to you, give the game a try when it's on sale. But Dragon Age: Origins is a better RPG and a better game. I would recommend the games in order.

So far so good, the skills are giving lots of options to mix and match your playstyle.
Story so far mediocre, but enough to keep me interested.

The Bad:
The controls are terrible, I really hate it. The game is also feels like a very generic RPG Game.
Bad things happen, you're the chosen one, and you're the only one who can stop it.
I know it's the main element to make RPG game, but it's very cliche! You start off in a village, on a grand path to conquer evil. 
The gameplay is also somehow mediocre.
The skill and character UI feels very spacious, and empty, the design for me is kinda bad too. 
No explanation what does auto skill/auto level up button do? where will it assign my character's skills? will i be able to reset it?


I played this game WITHOUT comparing to Dragon Age Origins. If you really want to compare, DA:O is much better and more interesting for me to play compared this.

On normal price, I really don't recommend it. You may buy and try it if its under 10 USD.

Its probably one of my top 5 favorite rpgs of all time, let’s talk first about the things that this game does well:  visuals-wise its stunning, for a game released 7 years ago it barely aged, surely it has the usual bad animations from BioWare in some of the cutscenes but you get used to it, soundtrack is great so is voice acting, every character delivers a believable performance, the story grabs you easily due to its big scale, the many choices that are presented for the player to take, the world and characters everything contributes for a really memorable experience.

Gameplay-wise the combat here is a bit of a tab target but its more action based, the combat here is good altho a bit easy, theres also a really barebones tactical mode that lets you control things from above like a RTS game but I never messed much with it because it always felt underveloped, the crafting system here is great and so is the loot, shame that the game lacks a fashion outlook when it comes to the armors you find, they look really bland visually and there arent many models to find, weapons-wise its fine with many unique models. For maps the game has those hub social areas and separated areas for the player to explore and do quests, side quests are your usual mmo-like model and  the maps range from decently-sized to very big maps with sprawling environments, secondary locations, cities and towns scattered around and such, for rpgs fans who like customizations and exploration this one delivers it a lot, you can build your character the way you exactly want, since the game offers an expansive skill system.

Let’s talk briefly about the things that the game does bad apart from the lack of armor models which was just a nitpick, the actual bad parts is that the game has a messy pace, sometimes it feels slow, sometimes it picks up the pace, it depends of which part you currently are but the beginning of the game is kinda slow, the game can get repetitive too, the sidequests could have used more creativity and the multiplayer mode is bad, just dont waste your time with it, not only its a tacked-on subpar mode but it has a lot of mobile games-like monetization stuff and the servers are really laggy and unstable and its also hard to find matches cuz theres barely anyone playing.

For overall length, the game here which comes with all dlcs (that are completely worth playing) took me around 100 hours to complete it all (I went for the completionist route), considering the price now since its an old game, the game offers a lot for the player, if what I said above interests you I think youre probably going to find one of your favorite and most expansive rpg experiences but know what youre getting into, its a big game after all, one that will require dozens of hours to get somewhere but once you see the credits roll I guarantee you that you will not forget about this game and the experiences it gave you.",1636564086,1654519350,True,37,0,0.74840933084487915,0,True,False,False

I have no issue recommending it, but a few facts need to be added.

-The real time requirement of the in game War Table is stupid. Mod it out
-You have go through Origin. Which is why i have 10 minutes of steam time and 200+ hours on Origin
-You may have to trial and error getting the DLC to work due to the bizarre Steam/Origin interactions
-Its hard to get the game to launch in steam without Origin Freaking out since you don't have the game ""installed""",1654504744,1654504744,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

The story so far has been an epic fail, its Twilight series bad. Most decisions so far are a farce and have zero impact. The game play is straight rip off of MMORPG's, although the RTS aspect is refreshing but degraded by a repetitive combat loop and clunky interface. There are fetch quests with decent voice acting but meaningless dialogue for even less meaningful quests. 

There came a point about 5 hours in where i forgot what i was doing and if i should bother to keep going.  Im not feeling rewarded or entertained, but its just kind of there and something to do.
I can tell im not alone on this, only 51 percent of players bother to play long enough to get their first skill upgrade. That says a lot about the game right there, and its not good things.

Its just not a game i can suggest for entertainment purposes.

Of course technically I now have two copies on Origin, the EA purchased one and the Steam one.   I never got past around ten or twelve hours on my original copy so I figured I would take my time and enjoy this one, side quest and all.   So far I have spent around ten hours and barely touched the first zone doing side quest and gather materials .  

One thing I liked about the game originally and still today is how much of a MMO feel the game has while being a single player game.   I have played WoW off and on since launch usually getting a handful of classes to cap and then unsubscribing until the next expansion .  Same with Guildwars 2 and other MMOs.  I usually solo most of my way through them or multibox my own party as a personal preference.  So a game like DA:I that has a MMO feel but is single player is right down my alley.

The game plays great on my i5-7400, 16GB RAM, SSD, running a 1060 GTX.  I haven’t had any problems to speak of during my ten or so hours playing the current build.   I personally don’t mind having Origin loaded along side Steam as I do so for some other games, no different than me also running GOG Galaxy, Epic and UBISoft.  I know some people don’t like having to have multiple loaders but I personally haven’t had any problems with doing so over the years.

All in all this game still looks great and plays great and for thr $10 or less that I picked it up for the second time it was a super buy that I don’t regret.",1654228575,1654228575,True,27,0,0.720669209957122803,0,True,False,False

Before downloading the game on Steam, you have to download and install the launcher from EA website independently. Sometimes Steam & Origins can't sync whenever you want to launch the game. That's why you always need to open Origin first then start your game.

Game is fun. Story is meh, not as good as the previous installment but the characters is what I think is the main selling point of this game. Your interactions with them is what makes the game very enjoyable, I could even say it's better than the gameplay.

Gameplay wise, this game is more of a hack & slash game than top down RPG. Even thought you have the option to do that 90% of the time going third person and hacking & dodging your way to your enemies is better than watching your protagonist going straight to high level enemy and instantly getting 2 or 3 shotted by them. Because of this I think the game is leaning more to DA2 instead of DA1, which as a huge DA1 fans I'm a little bit dissapointed tbh.

That said, I have always been more invested in the story then the gameplay. So it's only fitting I will rake a bit on it here first. The game is prone to some of the most annoying gliching I have witnessed. Enemies get stuck in walls. You get stuck in walls. You get stuck on a horse. You get stuck IN a horse. A Boss NPC, which defeating was crucial to finishing a quest, got stuck in a celling once, and the excitment of the fight simmered down as it was basically reduced to me spamming wall of flames, since it was my only spell that went through the celling. Remember to save often, never trust the autosave.

As for the story- I think it's does a good job to take you on a fun, sometimes a little bittersweet journey with a diverse cast of characters. You will probably not like all of them, but it's hard not to like any. And hating a few of them is almost as entertaining- you even get to punch them sometimes. Inquisition has some of the best characterwork in all of Dragon Age in my opinion, and hate them or love them you are bound to get invested in some of their character arcs. Or just laugh at them squabbling in the background, as you make your way through refreshingly spacious nd beautifully rendered places, a great change of pace from the dungeons in previous installment.

One of the biggest and most glaring issues though is that you don't get to have a dog this time around, which pains me deeply. You get to have one of the ugliest lizard-horses in existance, and I say that in a very loving way.

It is a Shakespearean-level drama, pure agony of trying to save someone, who you hold near and dear to your heart,  from themselves and miserably failing in the process. Relatable unhealthy relationship pattern with which I've struggled all my life.  

I felt genuinely depressed after the final credits of the game. I had to drink a lot of scotch to cope with all the grief and helplessness and it tasted salty from my tears. Spent a couple of months like that, and it got better over time, but still hurts.  A lot. 
10\10 would strongly recommend, best magnificent bald heartbreaking elf in the history of video games.

And still… this game has all the other aspects of an RPG gem. And I  just  love all of them. From the balanced, challenging, tactical and complex combat system to the amazing castle which you have as your crafting, resting, drinking, shopping, lore reading, party members banging hub. From difficult  and ambiguous moral choices to the open-world's beautiful  locations. From  little cute and dramatic war table mini quests to the astonishing art style, carefully woven in every detail like  game difficulty choice or your standing with party members (styled as Art Nouveau  tarot cards). From the great soundtrack to the impressive voice acting (I've been a fan of Gareth David-Lloyd’s voice since his role in “Torchwood” around fifteen years now, wow!).
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2781098929
I am not  a fan of this particular game series. I was not really impressed by DA1, felt rather okay-ish with DA2, but DA3 has completely and utterly won me over with its amazing narratives and magnificent, although tragic plot revolving, this time, around elves, being not so great (again), and true freedom being very elusive or even unattainable. No matter if you are an actual slave in Tevinter,  or bounded by indoctrination from cradle to grave Qunari zealot, or an ancient entity, chained with guilt, and  unsuccessfully trying to right its past wrongs.

As for the downsides… guess repeatable and grindy ‘kick demons and close all the green holes in the sky’ fights is not everyone's cup of tea. I've enjoyed them as an opportunity to play with party composition and tactics in a somewhat predictable environment, min-maxing my damage. 
The same goes for the dragon hunts - there are ten of them, if I remember correctly, and although every dragon is different in terms of resistance, behavior and tactics, they all are just gigantic aggressive one-shooting damage sponges after all, and novelty wears off fast.  
And yes, it is a really huge game with a lot of unnecessary stuff, sometimes half baked - some people love it, and some don’t. As a completionist, I was typically over-leveled up to ten levels to the moment of final fight on both of my playthroughs.
I’ve also find ‘Nightmare mode’ way, way to easy  - I’ve actually managed to die there only once (trying to fight cold daemons with my party, build around cryo-cc) and I am in no mean die-hard hardcore gamer, more ‘tell me a story’ difficulty setting type of person.",1653365521,1653365806,True,4,2,0.537961721420288086,3,True,False,False

If you've played Origins or its sequel, you'll know all about the world, lore, style of play, and all that jazz. If you haven't, Origins was a tactical RPG with a phenomenal story, great characters, engaging gameplay, and some serious role-playing chops with genuine choice and consequence. Typical Bioware doing what they've always done best, essentially. The sequel was basically the same, albeit the combat was ""enhanced"" for consoles, and the whole thing was flashier, more visceral, slightly dumbed-down, but still an enjoyable second foray into the world of Thedas. (We won't talk about the copy-paste world design, or the fact that you no longer got to design your own character from scratch because the internet is awash with salty fan-boys pouring scorn upon Dragon Age 2, and it's largely common knowledge at this point.) I enjoyed it despite its flaws, and I still think it had a great story, awesome character progression, and some refreshing quest design.

But... that's all ancient history. What about Inquisition? Yeah, I'm going to do this in list format because otherwise I'll write a novel.

The Good:

1. The world is gorgeous. EA's Frostbite engine makes for some jaw-dropping scenery, and the various biomes are all a feast for the eyes. Arid deserts, lush forests, frigid mountains, and murky undead-infested swamps are all here for your optical enjoyment. The graphics do not disappoint. (Although the character models are weird with everyone wearing lip gloss and looking a bit sweaty. Oh, and ridiculous facial hair.)

2. The story is engaging and the NPCs are both interesting and well-written. The main narrative arc is a joy to play through, and the voice-acting talent on display is top-notch. It's nothing you haven't seen before in a hundred other RPGs, but it's done very well and you're not likely to lose interest (in the story, anyway) half-way through. Choice and consequence is a thing, and your decisions affect the world around you, which is kind of what you want in a sprawling AAA RPG.

3. The music is suitably epic, and while things can tend a little toward the overly bombastic on occasion, it's nothing that'll have you reaching for the volume control. Sound effects are also great across the board.

4. Here be dragons! Unlike Skyrim, in which a few well-placed arrows will bring down a dragon, the high dragons in Inquisition are formidable beasts you have to take apart piece by piece while desperately hoping you don't fall afoul of a tail sweep, a wing buffet, or their lethal breath weapon beforehand. They are colossal engines of destruction, and while you're able to cheese a few of the fights due to dodgy AI, they're challenging opponents who will give you pause to contemplate your own mortality. Few games do dragons as well as Inquisition.

5. Several hours into the game you'll gain access to Skyhold, your own personal fortress you're able to tailor to your specific tastes. During your adventures you'll gather various bits and pieces, and run into a number of NPCs, all of which you can use to enhance the aesthetics and/or utility of the enormous castle you call home. It's a nice touch that really adds to immersion, and sitting in judgement from your throne-room is a power-fantasy that never gets old.

The Bad:

1. The Hinterlands. If there was ever an introduction to a game that seemed purposefully designed to make you not want to play the game, it's the Hinterlands. While beautiful, the Hinterlands is a seemingly endless trudge-fest liberally sprinkled with mind-numbingly dull fetch quests. ""Fetch me some ram's meat."" Okay. ""Go and get a potion from my son."" Okay. ""Kill some wolves."" *sigh* Okay. Pro tip for new players -- don't try to 100% the Hinterlands on your first play-through because it'll suck all the joy out of your life and microwaving your head will seem like a preferable course of action by comparison. Do a little bit, then leave, then come back later and do a bit more, rinse and repeat. Also, there's a high dragon here. It will kill you without breaking a sweat. Come back after you've gained a few levels.

2. Clunky controls do not a good game make. While the controls aren't awful by any measure, they're also not great. Little things like having to continuously tap the 'search' button to find interactable items in the environment (seriously, Bioware, what's wrong with just holding TAB... you know, like every other RPG in the history of the world) become persistent annoyances. And don't get me started on the loot mechanic, which requires you to shuffle your character to within millimetres of a lootable item before the loot icon will deign to function. None of this stuff is a deal-breaker, it's just needlessly irritating.

3. If there's one thing I hate with a passion in modern games, it's bullet-sponge enemies. Pouring endless firebolts into the face of a renegade templar who JUST WON'T DIE isn't fun. Nor is it 'challenging'. You know what it is? Annoying. And stupid. But mostly just annoying. Inquisition is full of such enemies. They're obviously worse on higher difficulties, but even on the lowest setting, enemies will absorb ludicrous amounts of punishment before eventually succumbing, and it seems like little more than a way to artificially inflate both 'challenge' and length of play. Given much of the combat (particularly if you're a mage or archer) involves you standing in one place, holding the mouse button down, and occasionally tapping one of the number keys, having to sit there and watch this play out over and over again is nothing short of boring. And the cardinal sin any game can commit is to be boring.

4. The ceaseless torrent of busy-work. Like most Ubisoft titles, Inquisition is full of collectable stuff. Books, scrolls, trinkets, bottles of wine, crafting materials (of which you need boat-loads in order to craft anything vaguely useful, especially at higher tiers), and other fripperies. All of which is entirely optional for the most part, but it's just another way of trying to bloat a game with pedestrian filler because your core content (the main story quests are amazing) is so sparse. Inquisition is a game that was built around a pillar of gold, which was then surrounded by great piles of rusty junk. Wading through the junk to get to the gold is insufferably tiresome, which is a shame because when Bioware are firing on all cylinders, they're phenomenal. When they're just phoning it in (like here) it doesn't take you long to figure out, and it's an absolute shame because their track record proves in no uncertain terms they're capable of so much more.

Am I recommending Inquisition? Yes, and no. Play it for the story (because it's a quality story), and the NPCs (because they have depth, personality, and their own hopes, fears, and agendas), but expect to spend much of your time on the verge of a boredom induced coma, or hurling expletives at the screen due to the overwhelming mediocrity of much of the game's content, and belligerently stupid nonsense like the horrendous bullet-sponge enemies. And if you're going to get it, get it on sale.

Verdict: A quality narrative with some gorgeous visuals let down by a ton of pointless filler and unnecessary bloat. Not Bioware's finest work.",1650336837,1652624977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my fifth playthrough of Inquisition but only my second of the entire series back to back and this time around I was really, really struck by the truth to the criticisms of this game. Previous playthroughs I was simply excited to be back in the world again but after playing the previous installments recently this game does feel really empty, soulless.

It's not, though. There's a lot of good here. Dorian is a great character that really carries the spirit of DA2 forward. Leliana's arc is interesting (if you side with Mages, though I went Templar this play), especially comparing the jaded, guarded woman she is now compared to the shoe loving, bubbly, windbag of Origins. Iron Bull is fun, Blackwall is softly pretentious and insecure, Cullen becomes a human being. Cole feels like a specific type of fan service of the era, Sera is irritating but layered. The Mage quest is SOLID, super fun, well written, emotional. There's good here.

But you're kind of thrust into things halfheartedly. Varric immediately underlined the problem to me - in the previous games there's world building lol. Introductions. DA2 opened with interrogation, stakes. DAI opens with HEY GO HERE AND HOLD YOUR HAND UP VARRIC IS NOW HERE SEE HE'S FROM A PREVIOUS GAME THIS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL INVESTED OKAY NOW GO FIGHT BAD GUYS. You're thrust in and then.. silence. No banter with your team, no bickering. Varric barely makes quips, conversational tone is gone. Conversations are now easy, predictable, one note. Everyone from the past is just there, all knowing each other, with no build to how we got here. The choices feel unimpactful.

And it just feels empty not because the game is bad but because of the fleshed out world the game HAD.

On a gameplay/menu level they really fixed a lot of the problems in DA2, looping back closer to a style more compatible with the people who played and enjoyed Origins but felt nerfed in the sequel. So that's something. Gameplay is EASY - I play on Hard and could go to Nightmare without much trouble, as opposed to in Origins where I had to go down to Casual mode a few times to make it through. The open world is great, if pretty straight forward - not a lot of secrets, things to rediscover as you gain new skills, but a lot to discover.

For starters, this is not a game for kids, this is a game for mature players. I had to juggle a lot in this game at the same time, my teammates, a whole bunch of different factions that exist in this world, you need to find a way to make everyone appeased with how you handle things, you have to do a lot of small favors for everybody, you need to be very good at diplomacy, also you need to understand what is politically going on between all of these factions and why. Also it is crucial that you listen to what NPC's have to say to you, and then act accordingly, and keep everything in balance somehow.

And then there are enemies. And you have a lot of enemies. Living ones, and dead ones also. Undead, demons, demigods, titans, dragons, whole lot of beasts, you name it. I don't want to scare you off, I'm just stating what you need to expect. This is a game that gives 120-150 hours of pure game play. You will not find that easily in a single player game nowadays. The lore of the game is humongous. And then the plot and the story of current events evolves all the time. As you influence something with your actions, the world around you reacts. If you free a keep from enemies, all of the sudden friendly people will come in, take over keep, set up a tavern and traders will come in, people will start to populate the area around that keep, and also friendly soldiers will start patrolling around keep on trails and in forests. Also you need to take into account the whole history of this world to understand completely what is what and who is who, who likes who, and who holds grudges over something from 500 years ago.

There is a lot of dialogs going on, you can spend hours on reading materials that you find in the game, I read some, I skipped the others. If you want to read everything you would probably spend 500 hours in this game only on reading and talking to NPC's, that's how detailed and big it is. And it is all interconnected, and it all makes sense, obviously someone put a lot of work into this game. This is probably bigger than lore in LOTR. Actually, I'm ashamed now that I bought it for like 7$ when it was on sale. This game deserves full price to be paid. It is astonishing.

I didn't even touch on the RPG part of the game, characters, levels, complexity of fights, skill trees, items, crafting items, crafting materials, world design, and whatnot. A really awesome game, I would highly recommend it for patient gamers that like to explore worlds, but inpatient players might find this game not up to theirs niche. Also, I saw a lot of complains in reviews about Origin login system, and bugs in the game, but I can say that this game works perfectly well for me. Sure, there a few bugs, it would be impossible for such a huge game to have no bugs at all, but those bugs are so small and insignificant, that you will barely notice them, and I didn't have a single issue with Origin login.

The game was released in 2014 and still looks damn good, dragons look really majestic in this game, and I was really sad that I had to kill them because they look as good as they probably can in games, and you actually feel sorry for them, but hey, who is the hero here, right? Also, everything else looks perfect. Huge castles, forests, little fishing villages, dunes and deserts, old dwarfs' ruins, underground mines look better than ""Mines of Moria"" in LOTR. And they created the living world, animals are running around while taking care of food chain, bigger predators will eat smaller animals, villagers go around, farming, sitting around fire, drinking, dancing, singing, its crazy how everything feels and looks. So far I spent 122 hours on this game, but I don't think that this game is boring, too big, or that I had enough of it (like in some other cases). Probably the best game that I played in years. 10/10.",1651666917,1651770030,True,27,2,0.768033683300018311,0,True,False,False

It's a bioware style, story based, choice driven game, with RPG mechanics, and big open areas to explore. It has a central core story, side quests, reasonably decent combat, and really nice looking graphics. 

What I didn't realize then, is the massive identity crisis present within this game. It's not sure whether it wants to be a singleplayer Story driven RPG, or an MMO with massive grinding to do. Maybe I'm wrong, but I fell like the main draw of Bioware games are....the story, and the choices. So having missions being soft-locked due to an underleveled player is pretty crappy. 

Story missions are not generous with XP, so you'll often be fighting just to have enough. Want to do a 45 minute story mission? Be ready to grind side quests for 4-5 hours for it. It's rediculous, and the combat is not fun enough to make the grind fun, as is the case with games like Shadow of War. It's basically MMO combat in a single player game. 

I got into this game because I like fantasy, character cusomization and choice, etc. I got a love for Bioware from Mass Effect and SWTOR. Even SWTOR....and ACTUAL MMO is more generous with XP for those who want to mainly focus on the story. Honestly it kind of ruins the whole game, and makes it rediculously slow.",1631984695,1651683383,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mages' patience is kaput

Only one suspect, one called you

Your glowing left hand, its control

People rally under your command

Not even finished, I'm afraid

Praying your interest has been seized

It's poorly balanced with an exceptionally dull power curve, the majority of the content is pointless having no bearing on the story or self-contained interest, the story itself is pitifully short and vapid, the DLC areas are equally dull and add a platforming element that the movement mechanics of the game does not synergize with. Combat is repetitive, though not as bad as Dragon Age 2. The AI is terrible -- so much so that they will often teleport behind you rather than walk because their pathfinding cannot handle the terrain navigation mesh. The game pays no respect to the lore of the first game which shouldn't be surprising after the second game's disregard of the same. Character stories are perfunctory and arbitrary taking too many queues from the Origins DLC and not enough from the game itself. The ""Power"" system is worthless -- you cannot use it for anything other than advancing the story. There are too many ""collectibles"" which also require tedious backtracking across large and increasingly empty maps.

The story and characters, as much as I saw of it over the five hours I pushed myself to play this game, is as cookie cutter as can be.

Because, I feel one can tell if a game is made with a lot of heart, or just a lot of money. The older Bioware games felt like they were made with compassion. This thing here, is not that.

Not only the size of the world, but the overall scope of the story and the hours of conversations. This is perhaps the most popular game from BioWare. You can easily lose tens of minutes just by running around the base and chatting over companions and side NPCs. If you want to see and experience really everything, reserve an estimated 120-150 hours of free time.

The plot follows the events of Dragon Age II. The mages decided that they already had their teeth full of life in a carefully controlled environment, and their rebellion resulted in a devastating war with the Templars, which has an adverse effect, especially on the civilian population. In addition, when the opposing parties finally come together for a roundtable, someone detonates a magic bomb that kills everyone but one participant - you. A reminder of the dramatic events is the scar on your hand, which glows the same green as the crack at the site of the explosion from which the demons roll.
Although the Inquisition is gradually becoming a unifying organization that wants to deal with a threat that I cannot talk about, your real task is to intertwine complex political kingdoms and races or mages and Templars. Thus, the trump cards of the narrative include the development of the Inquisition from a strange group of heretics, led by four leaders, including someone he presents as a ""messenger of the divine,"" into a powerful non-state political power to be reckoned with.

If you are not a forged expert in the world of Dragon Age, you should study in the Code what each term means, due to the emphasis of the game on the political aspect and subsequent decision-making. It is extremely unfortunate not to know what you are actually deciding when, for example, whether to close the mages back to the Circles, to risk without the supervision of the Templars that they may become demon-possessed monsters, or threaten to develop in the style of the Tevinter Empire. In addition, knowledge of the situation and subsequent decisions significantly affect the opinion of factions and partners on you.

DA Inquisition is a real RPG epic. The megalomaniacal nature of the game does not result from the size of the world and the plot in the style of ""it's all about."" In addition, the roleplay options of your hero are really wide and their use brings inner satisfaction. Inquisition is simply an RPG in the original sense of the acronym - roleplaying game.

It's extremely fascinating to see new people pop up, hear new dialogue, see new missions slap home on the war table because you judged this person or that person. For another thing the romance options are wonderful, it really gives you more immersion into the world itself. The other bit I was impressed by was the in depth roleplaying involved in the game. I was afraid I would boot this up only to find that it was more open world repetativeness, and while I can still see some repeat happening all over the place with fetch quests and the like, there's so MUCH happening that it's easy to just move on and find something you don't feel quite as stale doing.

The modding and customization of armor, clothing and weapons on DA:O is by far the best in the series. This game is in between DA2 and DA:O. One of the OK games from BioWare nonetheless.

It's just not fun.

Combat is bad. It's not as tactical as Origins or 2, and it's not a good or fast paced hack and slash either. It seems like they tried to do both with Inquisition but ended up with very shallow albeit flashy brain dead button mash combat. 
The game is pretty, but IMO kind of hard to look at. It's a little too photo realistic which makes characters look uncanny and environments ""too detailed"" for their own good. With that I mean it's just a little too busy looking. 

And speaking of being busy. WHY is the game loaded with so much meaningless fluff? Claim this, read that, collect those, eliminate everyone here and so on. It's all just busy work. And since the gameplay and combat is so dull, it's not even fun busy work.

I've never gotten far enough to have a meaningful experience with the story, so I can't really say anything about that. But they've done the same mistake they did with 2 still though. Voice acting.
It hardly allows for any roleplaying when you only really get 3 choices in a dialogue, that most of the time are just flavor that lead to the same conversations and outcome.

And also, the UI is garbage. Everything is block and big. It looks like it's built for touch screens or something. And a nitpick, it's too ""modern"" looking. It just doesn't fit into the medieval fantasy setting.",1650303368,1650303368,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can walk around large and beautiful areas but it's predominantly decoration, the ability to interact with world stuff/things/objects is minimal in comparison. However, in comparison to other games, say Witcher 3, Outer Worlds, Far Cry Primal, for example, DA Inquisition holds it's own plenty fine.

Story line tastes of a Tolkien recipe: dwarfs, elves, dragons, ancient ruins, big bad ass wants to take over the world, underdog hero, a well used fantasy formula.

I am a fan of the entire Mass Effect series, enjoyed DAO and some of the highlights of DA2, but there are too many issues here that really hampered my attempts to get into this game.

[b]Knock-off MMO Gameplay:[/b] Melee combat is extremely janky. I was playing as a warrior, and fairly frequently, if I charged an enemy, I'd go off flying because it was an incline. Having more than one melee character on the team is an almost immediate disadvantage; everyone has collision [i]all[/i] the time. This mean that combat with 2 friendly melee players and 4 enemies devolves into chaos as characters struggle to even get in range. It's simply frustrating, and having so few actions per character makes combat very repetitive.

[b]Boring Characters[/b]: This is just my personal opinion: Dorian, Cassandra, and Varric were the only good companions worth having around. Everyone else was either bland or quirky weird. The major issue, that every player will face, is that companions talk so [b]extremely rarely[/b] while exploring that their personalities, whether you like them or not, never have the opportunity to shine.

[b]Open World Game #504:[/b] Why do so many AAA games devolve into collect-a-thons that aren't even good? The whole point of collecting in actual collect-a-thons is that it's a fun challenge to actually obtain each item or that it's something you gather while just traveling. This is not the case in DAI. There are skulls, which require you to scan the area to find, and then gather so that you can just get a small buff in some hidden cavern on one map. There are your average locales to walk to, and then there are extremely dull side quests like leading a cow to a pen, killing wolves, and so many other enthralling tasks. There are portals just randomly placed on maps for you to kill the same 4 enemies from but with higher levels. It's just not fun.

[b]Wasting Time on Purpose[/b]: Imagine if the Normandy was like 5x larger and all of the key npcs were located randomly throughout, and you'd get the player hubs in DAI. On top of this, there are mobile game mission timers that have no reason to exist. Even worse, this game has awful loading times (at least for me); I would wait over 30 seconds just to open a door in the hub area, and if I wanted to leave that menu, it was another 30 seconds. Opening the game? 30 seconds to get to the main menu, and then 30-45 seconds to actually get into the game. [b]It's also bogged down by having to launch Origin to actually play it[/b]. It simply doesn't respect your time.

[b]A Big Bad Guy:[/b] So... who cares about the villain in this game? Main missions are dull, require very little thought, and take way too long to see them through. To be fair, I think all of Dragon Age is plagued by this issue, but DAI definitely suffers the most by having too much filler surrounding it.

[b]A Myriad of Other Issues:[/b] Enemy diversity? How about an enemy tank, soldier, archer, and thief? Maybe a spider? How about the 5 total Fade enemies? Pitiful and boring. How about armor for your team? Oh, there's only like 6 different armor models per class (Warrior, Thief, Mage)? And they all look extremely similar? Perfect. 

[b]Just play Dragon Age: Origins or something else entirely.[/b]",1650215461,1650215483,False,13,1,0.529986083507537842,0,True,False,False

Inquisition is good, although the game can feel like a grind at times if you try to do a lot of the side quests. Inquisition takes steps in the right direction after DAII took a step backwards when compared to Origins (by far the best in the series). 

The characters, both new and returning, are incredibly interesting and they have some fantastic banter between each other and with the world. The companion quests can be pretty fun and they really give you a deeper look at their individual personalities and beliefs.

The storyline is solid, but I wish the Blight and the Grey Wardens still had a more prominent role. That isn't to say the whole templars/mages feud and Big C's annexation of the world isn't interesting, because they are. I just don't particularly care for how played down the Blight and Wardens are after how pivotal they are earlier in the series.

I personally like the open world a lot, but be ready to spend a lot of time traveling to get to quests since they can be very spread out. There are also a lot of fetch quests, but I found that I discover a lot of the stuff just from exploring the maps. You also don't have to actually do all of them, unless you're a completionist or need the rewards. The war table operations to open new areas is a nice touch and makes you feel more like a leader, but it can get annoying to have to head back to base just to get a shoddy looking bridge (looking at you Western Approach). Enemy types are varied from region to region, with some being found only in certain parts of a map. This helps add a little challenge because you need to be ready to fight enemies with various strengths and weaknesses. The only enemy it needed was another Harvester remix to really piss me off.

Overall, Inquisition doesn't bring the series back to how good it was at DAO, but it feels like a true flushed out sequel compared to DAII. It can take awhile to play through if you like exploring but I find it easy to get lost in the lore and quests.

I've never been the type of player to spend a vast amount of time grinding the same areas in levels for all the side quests because it's always boring and tedious. While there are a few collectibles in the game that can become tiresome to collect overall the sidequests are actually interesting. Even if it doesn't serve a purpose like helping out a member of your party carry on goals or thing like that, it's things like finding and marking watchtowers to help build security from bandits in areas, seal demon portals and it actually feels as if you are changing the areas as you complete the objectives. The group spawns will no longer spawn enemies after defeating and claiming little forts that are landmarks throughout the region, help sick villagers and you gain ranks and popularity from it which you can use to gain favors from nobles and other things through more expansive operations. 
Don't even get me started on the story, from how much encounters can change from party loadouts and your actual choices to the little things that change like simple dialog it's always a treat to see what the main quest or your companions quests have in store. Even as a fan of more action oriented quicker games the slower strategic take to combat and building your team in unison with each other to wipe enemies is a satisfaction like no others and there's many different builds to choose from.

This is one of my favourite games. Even with the bugged out achievements and other things, the fetch quests, the Hinterlands [i] in general [/i], the not-very-user-friendly approval system. I can never decide if I like this or Origins more - either it's a tie or it depends on my mood. 

The characters are very loveable - almost everyone grew on me in some way. I liked seeing some old, familiar faces too, and the fact that emotionally, it really pays off in the end to make friends with your companions. (The banter between them when you're out with a party can be hilarious, and companion quests add incredible depth.) There are various sexualities and races among the characters, which is always welcome. ...There STILL isn't an eligible dwarf though, which is a shame and hopefully gets added to Dragon Age 4 or another game in my lifetime.

The main story isn't THE most special, but it's enjoyable, and it has memorable and emotional moments; it's the overrall arch and the villain which are a bit lacking. The DLCs add awesome storylines of their own. It seems, at first, that there are ""right"" choices - either I'm imagining it or the devs try to nudge you in a certain direction -, but I'm intrigued enough that I'll try others, probably on my nth playthrough when I'm trying to get all the romances. I like the dialogue wheel that marks which choices belong to which emotions or motivations, and the fact that you'll run into important things in unlikely places sometimes. The side quests do a very nice job of distracting you until eternity. Honestly - you can get more attached to the story you [i] make [/i], imagine, make choices for, rather than the one big storyline, if that makes sense.

I think I'll always come back to this game - not because it's perfect, but because I'm sappy and will always feel nostalgic and fond about it. 

I'd recommend you get it on sale, though - 40€, really? And look out for any bugged achievements, solve it early so you hopefully won't have to worry about getting the harder ones later on.",1649811014,1649811014,True,1,0,0.525011241436004639,0,True,False,False

I think the combat that is more like a typical third person RPG rather than a top-down one was integrated well with the returning tactics. Still, the way a fight is in practice becomes repetitive and often I never felt the need to plan out a fight; I could rely entirely on my companions using their AI behavior. Most enemies still feel like DA2's damage-sponges. Usually, all that's stopping you from defeating an enemy is not being a high enough level. And this is because Inquisition allocates attribute points for you. Very unnecessary and feels like what they make up for by returning a tactics screen is torn down once again. 

With the characters, there are even more companions, on top of a board of advisors, all of which you can befriend through approval and there personal quests. Most of these have great, distinctive personalities. But I'd rather they kept a handful in greater focus, rather than feeling overwhelmed at not being able to have a tight-knit group because there's simply too many of them. I enjoyed my time with each of them anyways, despite it feeling so little.

The war table involves Power, which you mostly collect through boring fetch quests. ""Collect 10 of this, kill 5 of this, explore 3 of these. Thanks."" And what you unlock is in theory very interesting. I think the politics have never been more nuanced. But in execution, you can usually pick whatever option sounds best, and there won't be any repercussions. Alot of these quests are great in theory, in narrative, but the telling of it is lackluster for how unimaginative it is. The worst case being that of shards. All 114 shards in the game are required to complete one of the sections of the map, to get a bit more of lore and story that you only realize isn't necessary once you finish it.

Still, once you get through all this fluff, there is a heart. It's a bit telling that the best parts of the story only occur through cutscenes, but damn if they aren't fantastic. The voice acting and action, hell even the sound editing makes everything so satisfying to just listen to. The dialogue is very moving when it needs to be. There are moments that stand out as among the best across the series, across all the games and their DLC. True, your main character doesn't have much of a personality. They're a blank slate to be used for any and all moments. This is only slightly remedied in the Trespasser DLC, where a definite end to things can finally happen. But I'll take it, because I still felt a bond to the others along the way. You're encouraged to take a greater role in politics, just like in the best quest, Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts. I'm glad to do so. Glad I stuck through with it, despite all its problems.

One of my favourite games with a beautiful story and great characters. The graphics are good game-play is really fun. The modding in this game can be a little confusing as there is two types DAI and frosty mods, but there is plenty of tutorials on youtube on how to get them to work together. Be wary of mods that you use as I did have a bit of trouble when it came to traveling to Skyhold, the screen would go completely white and you are unable to move or do anything. If you encounter this issue, disable your mods (both DAI and Frosty if you are running both) and the cutscene should work and you should be able to travel with no issues. Just re-enable mods after you arrive there. This game does require Orgin to run as well in order to play it, just an FYI. But overall I would recommend this game,  its worth the money but you can usually find it on sale a couple times a year.

I actually have many more hours than steam shows, I've played through this game a few times on xbox 360 already; on console I have a few hundred hours played and I think am missing only a couple DLC achievements. I wanted to try it out on PC to 1. play the DLCs I haven't yet and 2. just see how it differs

Needless to say, personally I love this game so much. I see reviews comparing it to previous titles but as my first Dragon Age game, I guess I experience it differently having not played the others.
From my perspective it has fantastic replayability, and a decent plot despite a rather lacklustre villain. (Though [spoiler] Solas I think is a fantastic follow-up, Corypheus was definitely more of a hurried placeholder I feel. I can't effing wait for DA4 to see where they take Solas' complexities) [/spoiler]

I'm going to do one of those pros/cons bullet-point lists to save any readers from a dissertation XD 
For me, the pros outweigh the cons though I understand not everyone feels the same way and that's fine. We all consume media in our own ways and to our own tastes.

[b] Pros: [/b]
[b] ☆ [/b] Replayability! This game is so replayable, in terms of RP at least. I very much enjoy trying out different kinds of characters and the different romances.
[b] ☆ [/b] The follower characters all have very distinct personalities and their own motivations for joining. I enjoy the in-depth dialogues about their individual backstories, and their thoughts after each major plotline quest. Almost every character feels like a real tangible person you could actually talk to.
[b] ☆ [/b] Continuing on characters, the voice acting is very pleasing and immersive. They hired such perfect voices for almost every character and I don't find it tedious to listen to the lines every time I play. The field banter is a lot of fun too, it's nice to not just run in silence all the time. Just wish it triggered more, but there's a mod for that.
[b] ☆ [/b] The game is visually gorgeous, even years later. The environments, even on low graphics settings on my potato laptop, are so wonderfully detailed and atmospheric. In particular the lighting on PC is just lovely. 
[b] ☆ [/b] The sound design is very enjoyable; running on different terrains, the background chatter in towns, the light BGM of each zone. The combat sound effects are also excellent, and feel weighty when you hit things. I like the search sound effect, the way it pings and audio-pans when you're close to hidden loot in particular. 
[b] ☆ [/b] The crafting system I find fun, and fulfilling in the sense of the ability to craft a weapon or piece of armour and have it last you several levels. I really like the arms/legs/grip/pommel/etc. upgrade system. A little extra agency and customisation.
[b] ☆ [/b] The character creator is quite nice I think, I've definitely played plenty of games with pretty lacking character customisation. My one gripe is just my wish for more, nicer hairstyles. But that's it really. The black emporium as well is a great addition; it's really nice to just be able to go fiddle with my character's face for free whenever I want. I also like the armour tinting system.
[b] ☆ [/b] I like the combat, the animations are well-done and have good variety to them. Hits feel like actual hits and the auto-abilities of the followers work pretty well. I can't really speak on the tactical camera as I'm more of a guns-blazing player and prefer to leave that alone lol
[b] ☆ [/b] As an LGBTQ+ person myself, I very much appreciate the diversity that's been included in a very normalised and non-dramatic manner. There's a trans character, two gay followers and a couple of bi/pan followers, and respectful discussions around identity that are optional and not pushed in any way that makes it out to be more than it is. Which is how it should always be done, because varied identities and s*xualities [i] are [/i] normal and should be approached as such. I want to see more representation done this way in the media. Not forced tokenisation or grandiose overdramatic depictions; but completely organic and normalised inclusion. 
[b] ☆ [/b] I like the dialogue choice wheel system, it feels satisfying and lends a good amount of agency for RP. The romances are all really cute too, I don't think I disliked any of them. [spoiler] F you Solas you stinky heart-crushing egg [/spoiler] Maybe the ambassador ones could be a bit more fleshed-out I guess? But I don't have any major complaints.
[b] ☆ [/b] I think that there's a good amount of collections and side-quests for people like me, little collection nerds that like to pick literally everything up. I love the codex entries, the world-building is done really well. I like to just sit and read through them and learn more about the ingame history and characters/critters etc., I'm a sucker for a good bestiary.

There are of course, some complaints, but I find that most of the things I have to gripe about are not to do with the game design itself, moreso there are some glitches and little functionality issues that irritate me whilst playing. Some design gripes, but not many.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] ☆ [/b] The war table for me feels too much like a ""set it and forget it"" mobile game. I just don't really like time-gated content like that in any context; DA:I in particular already has a lot of padding in the form of collections and side-quests. Honestly, I've modded the wait-times off. I know that probably counts as cheating but I've played this game so many times and I do not want to deal with the dumb hours-long missions.
[b] ☆ [/b] The looting animation is frustrating to me. I don't need to watch my character bend down a billion times to pick up every herb and ore node and mob loot. Thankfully on PC there's a mod to remove that animation. I highly recommend it.
[b] ☆ [/b] Unless you're like me and don't mind grinding and fetch-quests, you're probably going to get bored fast with the WoW-like ""kill x of this"" and ""collect x of this"" quests. Personally I don't mind it because I'm a brainlet that is not opposed to mindlessly running around doing busywork lol but I included this because I also acknowledge that yeah, some of it is a bit egregious. Thankfully, most of the side quests are optional. You don't have to do [i] all [/i] of them like I choose to. 
[b] ☆ [/b] The search ping for me doesn't extend far enough or highlight long enough.
[b] ☆ [/b] [spoiler] Corypheus is not a good villian. Very, very cliche. I love Solas and think he'll make a fantastic nuanced antagonist for the next game, but it's hard to ignore how boring Corypheus is. I do like the way his face looks with the lyrium in it, but the rest of his design as well is just...odd. [/spoiler]
[i] Functionality issues: [/i]
[b] ☆ [/b] There's a notable audio glitch. Delayed and missing audio on startup, and during some dialogue. There's also one I've noticed where the dialogue audio just jumbles itself up completely and turns into jibberish. The latter is fixable with a reboot, though.
[b] ☆ [/b] Some collectables are inaccessible. A couple of mosaic pieces and some codex entries. There's a mod to fix it but it shouldn't be necessary.
[b] ☆ [/b] Some dialogue, on PC at least, just straight-up [i] does not work. [/i] Sometimes when you interact with a character/NPC, it just...doesn't open. Doesn't start, period. Sky Watcher, the Avvar agent in the marshes, is completely broken on PC. Dialogue won't start, no matter what I do. It bothers me because I like to get all the agents in a playthrough.
[b] ☆ [/b] Sometimes AoE abilities don't cast. I'll place them and they won't happen. 
[b] ☆ [/b] Visual glitches are lower on my list because they're not really breaking the game or anything. But it can break immersion which can be irksome. Just things like textures not loading, armour not loading, T-posing NPCs. Irritating.

After Playing Dragon Age 2, I was disappointed to see all my favourite moments from Origins be butchered, stripped and gutted, turning a masterpiece of a debut to a below average story with repetitive gameplay and decent dlc. However, Dragon Age Inquisition is able to reignite the series and make it much better than what it was previously in 2 and in some cases Origins. After making the most out of the main story and side content (to an extent), DAI as proven to have a strong solid Story, Likeable Characters, More expansive worlds, different Biomes to play around in, Expanded boss fights (such as the unique Dragons in each region), Tons of Party Banter, new crafting mechanics and much more. 

Companions are solid and are varied quite well, with unique banter amongst each other, with NPC. the area they are in and certain quests. 

Crafting is better refined with new editions, adding another layer to the RPG mechanics. 

Gameplay caters to both tactical and action oriented audiences but ultimately puts more effort into a more action packed game for the wider audience.

Biomes such as dense lush overgrown forests, to scorched landscapes, Deserts, Dark rainy Swamps and much more. The Graphics alone help really enhance the detail of these landscapes and on that alone, graphics and biomes is a 10/10, 

Main and Companion quests are good, side quests are either ok or simple generic fetch quests 

Jaws of Hakkon and Disaster in the Deep Roads dont serve much to the story but act as cool side gigs to unlock new gear, more powerful and unique than base game. Trespasser was such an amazing way to end off Inquisition.

The second game (in Kirkwall) was reusing places all the time which was a big problem for many (me included).
This one went semi open world. The open world was ridden with collectibles and meaningless side quests and lost focus. All that content broke the pace of the story. There are some good side quest but they're few and far between.

The crafting system only half works and abilities are the standard thing.

Graphically the game looks okay in ultra setting (aside from the motion blur). A big change from the PS3 version that looked like play-doh paste. Still, i think the aesthetics of the first two game is timeless and a much better match.

The story is quite good but like i said, the focus is lost due to all that side content. Were it not like that it'd feel great. It's still the exact same Templar vs. Mages thingy. It gets a bit old.

Some fan favorites are back but not all of them (R.I.P Sandal and his dad, R.I.P Isabella...). At least Varric is still here (where are the countless cheesy lines though ?)...

There is a multiplayer mode (not mandatory, thank God). It's not even worth talking about past that mention.

Is it a flawed game ? Yes
Is the polish not great in some areas ? Yes
Is the writing inconsistent in certain areas ? Yes
It is a very imperfect game, however, the great parts of the game are worth sticking with the worse ones. 
The writing especially I feel has the soul of the DA franchise still and delivers masterful stories and amongst the most fun characters in any RPGs out there, although it does lag and you can feel the taint of modern EA and Bioware, as well as general triple A, with overtly dragged out sequences sometimes and dialog that feels strange in comparison to itself. 

Is it worth playing however ? Absolutely
It is quite the journey and if you are an RPG fan, this is THE GAME you want to play and add to your list of games that will leave you reflecting on it like crazy. 

If you are unsure, feel free to wait for discounts, cuz don't worry, Inquisition feels like its almost always on sale any time I looked at the new specials. You can get it for barely 6 GBP like I did, which is a steal for the game + additional extensions and 3 DLCs.

Notes: I absolutely adore this game, but I understand it is not for everyone. Played Origins and 2 back in 2014-15, but couldn't get into Inquisition at the time. Then I tried it again in 2019 and finally actually fully played it through in 2020. It is now my favourite in the series and my most played game on Steam. I'm not here for the combat, so I stick it on easy or sometimes use mods to one shot kill enemies. Be aware that a lot of people were disappointed with the combat in this game- for mages, especially. However, I am absolutely in love with the world of Dragon Age because of this game. You can tell the devs love this world, with the amount of details they have put into the different races and regions. The romances I have tried are fun and varied. The score has some amazing moments and fits well into the grander feel of this game compared to the previous two. The main villain is a bit boring, but the overall plot is quite good and it can be fun to bring different companions to the same quest on different playthroughs. 
I think about this game A LOT, considering I haven't played it in over a year now.

[b]Sights & Sounds[/b]
- Depending on what you're doing, the game is either in 3rd person (when exploring towns or holds) or more of a top-down perspective (when battling). The game makes these transitions fairly seamlessly, which is nice. I do have to confess that while the top-down perspective is nice for keeping track of the battlefield while fighting, the world feels much more immersive and larger when the camera angle is in that tighter 3rd person perspective
- The game is from 2014, so it's not going to blow you away graphically. Some environments look quite stunning considering the age of the game, while others look somewhat dated
- More care could have been devoted to the player's character model. Hair--particularly facial hair--looks horrible and clips through armor and clothes. It made the cutscenes often look pretty stupid.
- The music is serviceable. Some of the lyrical compositions are actually pretty catchy, but much of the overworld sounds are largely forgettable.

[b]Story and Vibes[/b]
- If you've played Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, you'll get a lot more out of the plot. I played the first two entries on Xbox and was able to bring over my world states thanks to Dragon Age Keep. That doesn't mean that you won't necessarily enjoy the story if you don't have a saved world state, but your experience will be a little worse
- The story is a continuation of the plot from the previous games. In a vaccuum, its a fairly run-of-the-mill ""forge alliances with difficult partners, save the world from the big bad guy, and maybe bed one of the side characters"" affair. It doesn't really provoke much deep thought or introspection, but it's fine in its context
- I played as a Qunari, which actually did add some interesting flavor to the plot, cutscenes, and reactions of the other characters. After all, when [spoiler]the Herald of Andraste is an atheist cow-man instead of a devout human, a lot of the Chantry will bat an eye[/spoiler]
- Many of the characters are quite poorly-written. All of them are some variation of a dour malcontent with 1-2 tepidly humorous personality quirks and a tragic past. Some are more annoying than others. The game makes a big deal of building relationships with each character, but the only thing worthwhile to glean from those efforts was filling in backstory details

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- I played as a two-handed weapon specialist warrior, and I think this may have been detrimental to my experience. Combat never really felt fun. It was more like a grindy hack-and-slash. I wish I would have played as a rogue or mage instead, or at least gone sword & board for more variety than ""stun enemy, hit it a bunch, repeat as necessary""
- There's a few little puzzles and things thrown in, but they aren't very special. They feel like afterthoughts in many cases
- I don't think I'll be coming back to this game. It took me over 92 hours to complete the main game and DLC, and there wasn't anything special enough to make me want to reconsider. Besides, I'm happy with where my world state is going into DA 4

[b]Overall Impressions[/b]
- The game was stable and ran well. I didn't encounter any notable crashes or bugs
- If you've played the first two games in the franchise, I would recommend trying this game out. I really liked DA: Origins and hated DA 2, and DA: Inquisition feels like it falls somewhere between the two in terms of experience. [spoiler]Luckily, the game gives you an opportunity to kill Hawke. So if you also hated DA 2, feel free to take out your frustrations![/spoiler]
- Overall, I'd say that I recommend it, but with a caveat. if you're already neck-deep in the franchise, give it a go. Otherwise, wait for a sale.

But what I didn't expect was for it to be the stupidest, most entertainingly awful title I've played in years. I made a list of all the dumb, laughably thoughtless moments I enjoyed. I'm so happy I got this on a 5$ discount.

Here's the list:
- In the intro, my character was a prisoner. I was playing a no nonsense six foot tall Qunari woman, someone who likely hates law enforcement with a passion and would never submit to templar or inquisition demands. But I didn't even get a dialogue option to really resist, my character gets conscripted into a suicide mission and just goes along with it.
- The game immediately starts the open world collectathon. It's barely the first part of the tutorial and we're picking flowers for no discernable reason, except that the game will ask for 1000 of them at some point.
- ""We have an intruder."" What??
- How do these stupid gates work? Gates in the sky spilling demons and barely a question asked. Everyone is just assuming a bunch of information because it's a videogame.
- Tutorial story builds up to a heroic moment with people yelling ""Charge!"" and then it's a single, small, anti-climactic fight and a bunch more exposition until the actual tutorial boss.
- Giselle's introduction is random and confusing
- Random burning campfires sitting around in the wilds unattended
- Plant placement occasionally has some thought put into it, but just as often, not at all. The areas aren't varied or complex enough to make placement make sense, so they just gave up at some point.
- You have to unequip weapons and gear to modify it, like some 1996 peasant game.
- Clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop
- Why are there boats? Why is this coastline littered with random boats? Nobody landed, there's no human enemies or human skeletons, they just littered this terrain with boats like there was a viking invasion, but the invasion itself is missing.
- Drops are dumb. Inventory space is limited but items are level locked, meaning you constantly get spammed with unusable items.
- Fade rifts spawn enemies out of reach, blocking progression.
- Several big groups of people join my faction with no rhyme or reason, barely a single plot thread connected to the event. Who are these people? What's going on? I even played Dragon Age 1 yet half of this still makes no sense to me.
- When did my character suddenly get facepaint? Why?
- At one point I walked into a kitchen and the cook was face first glitching through a tub of grapes. This is actually not a complaint, it was pretty funny.
- Dwarven gears spam. What is this, a gear turning simulator? Why is this mechanic here?
- The buffalo escort quest. I've seen bad and awful escort quests, but this one was atrocious. Five out of five stars, phenomenally awful.
- Horse racing was the second worst thing behind the buffalo escort.
- NPCs blocking
- During the haven escape, the secret passage was dumb and it went on forever and everyone kept discussing the secret passage and it was the stupidest thing.
- More random burning campfires in the wild. Is someone leaving a trail of these?  Where are all these fires coming from??
- Wand clipping in cutscenes
- Where did this giant demon army come from anyway? I probably missed an important plot thread? Actually, I have no idea. There's an army of demons now.
- Everyone is super excited when we get to the new stronghold? This makes no sense: the game takes great pain to establish that the enemy has a flying dragon and an ultra-powerful mage. There is literally nothing about this castle that makes us any safer now than we were in haven.
- If this castle is somehow safer, why didn't we go there before the demons nearly wiped us out and killed a bunch of us? Apparently there's just a fully furnished vacant castle, right there, when the plot needs it.
- We just went to war. Even so, everyone is pristine, no blood, no bruises, no sign that any of us have fought anyone.
- The castle is full of copy pasted paintings, which are also spammed elsewhere in the game. Gosh EA, couldn't you afford even a half-dozen extra B-tier painting textures? How can you be so cheap? Carelessness, of course.
- Shards don't mark anything. They are even less than a Ubisoft radiotower, since radiotowers still offer an interesting view. But shards? They don't mark anything. They are sprinkled 100% randomly.
- Glitching up mountainsides
- At one point I checked up on the hot diplomat lady, Josephine, only to find her she standing with her torso submerged into the floor. I giggled and left.
- ""Someone's trained them well."" What???
- Fire damage in water
- Veilfire torches clip through weapons and merge with them
- Are my knockdowns even working? For several enemies, there is no representation of status effects, neither in the sprite nor icons.
- Pickup animations are a waste of time.
- In an entire swamp full of endless death and disease, there is one spot that's 'lethal'? What??
- ""Help X"" spam during combat
- Cannot actually fast travel in the keep
- ""Time to go to the castle."" Says an NPC, while we're standing in front of a castle. Let's be clear, Dragon Age Inquisition. I am humoring you. You're a failure of a videogame. You're a pathetic deflated corpse that's fun to poke with a stick. It's fun to hook you up to electricity and watch your limbs go flapping aimlessly in all directions. I don't take your orders, so don't tell me what to do.
- ""Oh no, Cole is missing, he could be anywhere!"" Or he could literally be five meters away at the edge of the courtyard.
- Injured and dying folks are kept in the open mountain air
- In one of the later areas, I found a cute little tightrope sequence where I had to navigate a narrow bridge. Shame my party cluttered it up and ruined it like the pack of AI-directed mountain goats they are.
- I unlocked a mount only to find that its ears clip through its own horns, the model somehow clipped through *itself*.

The looting animations are annoying just like Horizon Zero Dawn like awesome i just want to pick one Herb of the ground but i MUST stop what i am doing to pick up that one herb

in my opinion this game delivers what i need which is an open world rpg, with character custmization, best suited for casual gamer just to chill and enjoy then show.The story is well, the beginning of the story makes you confused just like your character confused.Many things happened with no or little context and in a short amount of time.But as it proggres you kinda get the hang of what happened or what might happened in this game.The game had one of the best character development and twist in their stories.The game offers some characters with good progression and twist like cassandra, verric, cullen, josephine, and lelliana each of them had an interesting conflict.The game introducing a conflict in which makes us care for the character, and sometimes the game offer a choice which makes us choose an action that effects the relationship for the character and the npc with no or little context.It can became frustrating when you care and wants the best for em, but you dont know what to do because you had little knowledge of what's what and why or who, maybe because of me that dont pay attention to the story written in the books but yeah i sometime had trouble to know what best or whorse (but you can use logic and common sense i guess?).I love the romance option they gave, although you cant romance everyone but hey atleast they make it heartwarming.Like i said before 'tis good but may not be for some lads and lasses.I havent done all the romance due the IRL business but my character had a relationship with cullen, and the game delivers a good romantic story and progression, although i really loved to make one of the council to my party to further enchanced the relationship immersion but it will sufice.The story is good i would say, it needs a little bit more writting for the villains like why they do it, and for whom they do it, what makes them to do so, and so on and so forth. but at the end it is a good story nonetheless.

In conclusion the game has a quality to it's makes me remenicing the SWTOR they're both different but had same soul.I love the game and looking up for the sequel of the game.(i'm currious what will the devs give to us in the next sequel i have hope that they are giving their best and love for the game)

Also the tactical camera is atrocious and the game is unplayable with a keyboard and mouse. But the worst part of the gameplay is definitely the War Table ! What is this ? A 4x strategy game ?

My biggest gripe with this game however is the story and the lore. A lot of it feels like a middle finger to fans of the previous entries.

I will say if you're a young person that hasn't had many actual real RPG experiences you probably wont notice or mind many of these negatives, but if you do fall under that category I would still recommend seeking out better games over this one, there is just nothing about Inquisition that elevates it above meh.

* Big, open world.
* Real time with pause combat.
* Story driven with player choices (that actually matter).
* 4 difficulties: easy, normal, hard, nightmare (u can change it anytime).
* Detailed character customization.
* 4 races: human, elf, dwarf and qunari, with a racial bonus each.
* 3 classes: rogue (dual wield, archer), warrior (2h,  1h and shield) and mage.
* Each class has 4 different skill trees to mix and match.
* Each class gets to choose 1 extra skill tree later in the game (1 among 3, u can't have all 3).
* Cheap skill reset amulet (u can experiment easily).
* Gear crafting, enhancing and tinting.
* 4 different mount categories (with many recolours each).
* A castle as base of operations (lots of customization there too, I would prefer more though).
* 3 advisors (strategy, diplomacy, and espionage) u can assign to war table missions.
* 9 companions for your party (3 rogues, 3 warriors and 3 mages).
* The relationships with your companions are affected by your choices.
* Lots of collections to complete.
* And finally: You may don't want to play with the default world state. If u want to shape it based on your choices in the previous games, you can do that. Visit the official dragonagekeep.com and import your custom world state.

[i]P.S.: I should mention the 3 annoying things about this game too: 
- The game usually crashes at start, if u don't turn off ur antivirus. 
- Many minor bugs that will never get fixed.
- In order to play it, u must be connected to Origin (it runs in the background).[/i]

That lasted about four hours until I realized it's a cliche-ridden Chosen One plot with nothing more complicated than holding one button down for combat and running  to click a single target then run back.  There are no tactics.  The skill trees are bland.  The minute you figure out crafting, you'll never need gold again.

I stopped reading anything after about 10 hours.  Nothing was relevent.  You just find the quest marker and click it.  That's literally the whole plot, except for the rare and excruciating escort mission.  

The characters are fine...some are even fun.  But you completely lose track of any of their personalities because you've spent the last 20 hours picking up bottles, shards, books, rocks, herbs, notes, garbage loot, and animal parts.  

You get mounts.  I collected about a dozen.  Never used them.  They're worse than running.

You can decorate your castle.  Who cares.  You spend 90% of your time in the wilderness digging up rocks and leaves.

You can kill dragons.  But you don't have to.  They have nothing worthwhile on them other than crafting materials.

This was my first Dragon Age game. I consider this the best Dragon Age game because of the tactical view, but that's not the biggest reason to play it. The real reasons to play any Dragon Age game are the story, and the romance options. You're not forced to have a romance, but you're missing out if you decide not to. The most popular picks are Cassandra and Cullen, but there are many others to choose from. There are even LGBTQ2S+ romance options. Something that should come standard in all games that allow you to romance characters, but sadly doesn't. The game is reasonably balanced without denying you powerful tools. The skill combos in this game aren't as bonkers as previous entries, but they are in my opinion more rewarding to pull off, considering you can't just spam them whenever they're off cooldown.

That's basically everything you need to know before buying the game, other than the price of course. The game has been out long enough that you should be able to get it for a very good price when it comes on sale. It regularly goes on sale for more than 80% off.

I used to LOATHE this game simply because I felt it was a continuation of the dumbing down in gaming. DA Origins was amazing and DA2 turned the series into clownshoes and it seemed Inquisition was on that same low level.

I tried to like it at launch but quickly put it away and hated the direction of modern gaming. That trend continued though but now, the larger sum of a decade later, I decided to try this game again since the GOTY edition or whatever they call it was dirt cheap on steam.

And while its still a dumbed down and watered down experience when compared to DA:O when I compare it to all the trash games Ive played in those years suddenly this game isnt all that bad anymore.

It has nice character and team building, a good story and nice quests if you ignore the MMO design pointless quests. The graphics still hold up (although the characters are mostly hideous and facial hair looks ridiculous) and while it was one of the games that started the woke trend Im so used to it being in every media nowadays that it doesnt seem so bad in DA:I.

All in all I went from loathing this game to actually recommending it to others who are sick of the modern dumbed down garbage games. This isnt a masterpiece but its surely a lot better than 90% of what we have gotten in between its release and today.

Another update:
The game has it moments but drags on waaaaay too long, and then there is the trespasser DLC which I didnt even want to bother blasting through to see the story. Sometimes a game can have too much content, just like long movies are bad for having too much filler that should be cut, this game drags its story out just a bit too much and the DLC doesnt feel all that connected to it. More like a teaser for the next dragon age which I have 0 interest in because this developer is dead to me since all their recent games have been disasters.
And the terrible combats gets so grating in the end you just want to get it over with asap each and every time but the DLCs are full of insanely bulletspongy enemies.

So my final recommendation would be get the main game, blast through it just do the main quest and companion stuff and just skip trespasser unless you somehow dont absolutely hate the combat by that point.",1630711906,1645139782,True,0,0,0.369565427303314209,0,True,False,False

It's not without it's flaws, but neither of the 3 games in the series are free of flaws. Here is a quick review for those of you who are still interested in this game. I won't be spoiling anything in the review.

First things first, this game's combat style is sort of a mesh between the action oriented DA2 and the more CRPG style of DAO, you can go into an overhead view if you want to be more tactical or you can go the more action oriented route like in DA2. While combat can be challenging, it can rapidly devolve into you having to grind enemies down instead of having to think tactically, especially on higher difficulties. It can get repetitive but this isn't a unique issue for this game in the series. Overall, it's fun and getting new combinations to work with can spice things up.

Your companions are easily the best part of the game; the writing, stories, banter, and interactions the companions have is easily the best part of the game. There are quite a few hilarious moments involving the characters and you will have fun with them. My only complaints is that we can not see the companion approval meter like in DAO and that the writing for some of the companions can be rather annoying if you don't like their personality.

The open world is pretty generic, with a lot of filler. Not much for me to say here as the issues with this open world are common place among all the other open world RPGs out there for the most part. However the locations do look amazing and there is a wider variety of areas to explore than DAO or DA2.

Now, the main story of the game is...well kinda not the best, but not the worst either. The main antagonist is kinda generic but has a lot of lore implications and creates some nice interactions with certain characters mentioning him. Not the worst character, but he falls victim to a lot of villain tropes. A lot of lore and other information is revealed along the games final act and into its DLC trespasser. If you plan on trying out DA4 I HIGHLY recommend you either play through trespasser or watch a play through of it, its only a few hours at most but it sets up basically everything in DA4. My major complaint though is the way that certain decisions are presented in the game, it makes it hard to justify within a roleplay game that you would go along with then opposite choice. Don't want to spoil anything but when you get to the first major decision in the game you will understand what I mean.

Overall, its a pretty good RPG with great characters, fun combat, and a decent story. I would highly recommend however, that you play the other 2 games first. DA2 is basically a prequel to DAI because their stories start right after each other, and the events of 2 influence DAI heavily. While DAO doesn't have as much of a connection to DAI it does a lot of the major fundamental world building AND it give you insights into certain characters because of information revealed to you in DAO.

- Hinterlands is a terrible starting area and the game as a whole didn't benefit from the open world design.
- MMORPG-like, filler, time-consuming, mindless fetch quests all over the place. Hundreds of side-quests, sure. But they're solved either killing the thing(s) or picking the thing(s). Long gone are story-driven or choices matter quests.
- You barely see anything from Val Royeaux, the most important city of southern Thedas, but a small market square and a few alleys. In fact, it feels like they're avoiding big cities on purpose.
- You can finish the game never venturing beyond Hinterlands, Crestwood and Western Approach. That's right, you can get enough Power from this compulsory areas to continue with the main quest and skip the best (Emprise du Lion, Emerald Graves) and worst (Hissing Wastes, Exalted Plains, Oasis) optional areas with no impact to the plot whatsoever.
- In the end, it doesn't matter what you do outside the main quest, because only your party (3) will show up for the finale. You sided with templars/mages? They won't show up. Did the Grey Wardens join the Inquisition? They won't show up. Orlesian and Inquisition armies fighting venatori and red templars (and sentinels) in the Battle of the Arbor Wilds, always. While in Dragon Age Origins the factions you took sides with, as well as ALL your companions, not just your party, do have a purpose in the Battle of Denerim.
- Playing mage feels utterly straightforward and boring. Dragon Age Origins had arcane, primal, creation, spirit and entropy spells; plus arcane warrior, blood mage, shapeshifter and spirit healer specializations. Whereas Dragon Age Inquisition only has primal (splitted into inferno, storm and winter) and trimmed down spirit spells; as well as less specializations (rift mage, necromancer and knight enchanter).
- Background stories are predeterminated by race: You're a dalish elf, a tal-vashoth qunari, a surface dwarf, etc. 
- They shoehorn you into Andrastianism, or, at the very least, Maker-belief. ""Perhaps your elven gods are aspects of what we call the Maker"". Cringe.
- It carries on from Dragon Age 2 the limited, unintuitive dialogue options and lack of tactical combat. With each entry the series deviates further and further from tabletop-inspired RPG.
- There's a very limited variety of armours, so they all look the same after a while. Which is a shame, because Dragon Age Inquisition has a great art direction, when it wants to...
- In the same vein, no lances or pole arms, eventhough the game does have fully animated lancers and javelineers (Trespasser DLC).
- Caravaggio's tenebrism up to eleven in unlit places.
- Cutscenes and party banter are scarce.
- The ending, the real one, is on the Trespasser DLC.

The game does an amazing job of encouraging you to explore everything it has to offer, without it feeling tedious(for the most part). It has aged very well, and I very rarely encountered any glitches. The combat in Dragon Age will never be the strong point of the series, but doing something as simple as adding a jump mechanic does wonders for traversal. I love just walking around. The mounts feel more slow than they should, but this is a minor complaint. My character's interactions with others was a constant motivation for me to go above and beyond in a questline, to make new friends or a new alliance of some kind.

Overall, I found myself genuinely caring about the state of the world, the factions, and the people presented, all while enjoying how I got to experience it. And I think that's the mark of a very special game.",1644724824,1644724824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age Inquisition is a beautiful game, the story are one of its strength, and the Trespasser DLC wraps DA Inquisition up pretty nicely, the choices on the main quest really makes you think which one is the best for Thedas, there is no good or bad choices all of the choices have their positive and negative effect, but the side quests are hit and miss sometimes they are great the other time they can get tedious and boring, companion quests are great though its nice to get to know your companions and advisors it makes the game more alive, the callbacks to previous two games are pretty nice too. 

Gameplay wise the RPG element is alright inventory management is great, the dialogue options sometimes are a bit basic there are only 3 response kind, joking and jerk wishing that the next DA have a complex dialogue options. the tactics they dumbed it down I love the if else tactic on Origins really make the AI of my companion strong but with the dumbed down tactics I have to manage everything when fighting a boss or dragons. Skill slot is limited to 8 it makes the other skill feel useless because whats the point of unlocking many skills if you can only use 8 of them. 

The graphics are fantastic, it still holds up to other recent games these days. 

Soundtracks is beautiful sometimes i just stay at the main menu for a while to hear the theme song and get in the mood. 

The DLCs, Jaws of Hakkon is pretty great its intriguing to learn about the previous Inquisitor and what happens to them, The Descent a tiny bit boring and dull maybe because I dont like the Deep Roads that much but the end of main quest is wow, Trespasser is like the Citadel DLC of Inquisition it determine what happens to the Inquisition after the main game the only downside is why Trespasser is a DLC? it fits perfectly as an epilogue to the Inquisition. 

Overall I like the game its really great looking forward to Dragon Age 4 I would rate the game as 11/10, here's hoping to see Hero of Ferelden on DA4",1644670084,1644670084,True,1,0,0.509297490119934082,0,True,False,False

The plot itself is fine. I don't think plot is the most important element of a story and this one serves its purpose in casting you as the hero at the center of significant events well enough.

I think what really matters in any story is character. Maybe it's just me but if I don't care about the characters then I don't care what's happening to them or around them, and the main problem I have with the characters here is that I don't have a good sense of why they're doing what they're doing. There's no sense of them actually wanting something and having any actual agency in the story to try and get what they want, and without that I get no sense that they actually care about anything. You can sum up every character's motivation as ""Well, I was passing along and noticed the world was in danger so I decided to help. Whatever.""

I can't empathize with characters like this, they just come across as shallow. But the story keeps trying to bank on an investment in its characters that I don't have, and it makes me cringe.

There's singing. Not just in the background (that's there too and I liked that fine) but there's this scene where things are supposed to be really dark and one character starts singing... and the others join in... one by one... I... I'm sorry, I just can't.

It's like I'm watching a bad Hollywood movie with high production value but really crappy writing: It's shallow and corny and cringe-worthy. Sometimes you laugh and sometimes you cry, but in both cases for all the wrong reasons.

Maybe things get really good as you keep playing but I'll have to put this down for now until my expectations are sufficiently lowered. Which sucks. I really wanted to like this.",1644272540,1644274726,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is not really interactive in the sense that you are basically just using the same abilities once the CD goes down, for every fight. Fighting a dragon doesnt require a different approach to how you use the skills than fighting some wild weak monsters. The combat system is really lack lusting.

I slept on this game until it was $7 USD in 2022. It looks, sounds, and plays amazing. If you're looking for a game to get the MOST bang for your buck: BUY THIS GAME. Having said that there are a lot of flawed facets to this gem. You may be able to play around them and understand the mostly dated mechanics that, in hindsight (7 years later), are poorly done as I have tried to take into account on my playthrough,  [/u]


There's something for everyone to be had in DA:I. This is also perhaps the games biggest downfall: There is simply an extraordinary and overwhelming amount of content in this game. I have never played a game with as much world building, voice acting, writing, and cutscenes. The sheer amount of quests, loot, people, places, enemies, etc. is staggering. I'm ~ 60 hours into my first playthrough and I've certainly made a dent in the story and main quest line but I've got to take a break. 

This game is fantastic but, quickly, a few cons to any new or would-be players should consider:

1. The companion AI is dated. There are some really nice controls to enable/disable your companions skills/spells/and behaviors. While not robust you should play around with them. Some companions skills just straight up don't or won't work. You cannot spec your companions in certain ways with certain behaviors or they will just plain not be viable. You can control each individual character and setup combos/movement/etc. This would render this game unplayable if you planned on using it IMO. I play as my created character 99% of the time and let my companions run their AI that I've adjusted. My playtime would be easily doubled if I was trying to micro everyone. You have to run with a rogue, mage, and warrior in your party to interact/engage with all mechanics in the game. So the illusion of party comp uniqueness is objectively not doable. 

2. Combat loop gets boring very quickly. Pro gamer tip: In this game you just stack every mechanic. That's it. I tried to play a non-cheese build but even then you just stack the guard mechanic/barrier/crit/stamina/leech. Just everything. Then you quickly become unkillable. I cannot die if I auto attack. I'm playing a melee 2h build that I started acting as an offtank. I don't know how aggro control or target switching works even 60 hours into the game. You get stunlocked regularly at least as melee. It's pretty brain dead around lvl 15+; by then my build finally had guard breaking/stacking, stamina and health regen, crit stacking, etc. I've had to leave some dragon fights because although I can't die they would take 30+ minutes to kill. I'll come back to them when I'm way over leveled to defeat them more easily. On that note: enable the trials and enemies kind of get harder? I can't tell but also the difficulty aside from trials is literally just HP/DMG% slider. Mobs become massive DPS sponges. It's not fun so my advice is to turn the game to casual and watch everything just die quicker and save yourself time.

3. [h1]There is a brain cell deleting amount of terrible platforming mechanics.[/h1] They're punishing and stupifying in the worst way. It's like all of the dark souls platforming but way lower risk and reward. The mechanic is tied to so many unfun moments in this game. In the same vein: BioWare has taken a pretty linear approach to many, many areas in this game. Invisible walls and out-of-bounds mechanics are everywhere. You think so many areas are accessible from any which way but that is almost always not the case. You are expected to reach most places through an on-rails designed way but this is never stated. 

Tying into this terrible platforming experience is both: 

4. There is a ton of exploring to be done and had and you're rewarded for exploring with, again, an overwhelming amount of easter eggs, hidden collection items, and loot! I am guilty of trying to break games and find every secret and always second guess and backtrack every quest in case I missed that one item or companion or quest. DO NOT DO THAT IN THIS GAME because...

5. This game suffers from a major loot problem. 
Looting has an animation.
""Searching"" for loot has a mechanic and animation.
 I am constantly just slamming the ""V"" key to search. Millions of times in the last 60 hours. Literally just constant V. You will always be pressing V. 
Most loot from the ground/mobs/chests/exploration is RANDOM and 99% of the time is not worth the time.
This is insufferable in the year 2022. I just stopped really looking for loot. That inaccessible loot crate is guaranteed to be full of garbage. Lookup whatever items you want a pursue them for endgame. Otherwise upgrades and crafting are plentiful. 

6. Mounts are useless. Seriously. They're slow, you can't loot or search for loot on mounts. They get stuck on terrain. Get a movement skill and use it. I use charging bull to get around without the faster upgrade and its way faster than the mounts. Its suck they poured so many assets into the dozens and dozens of mounts that are objectively bad.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk I hope this has been helpful if you're considering the game. Although I listed a ton of complaints I would play this game if you haven't. It's such a snapshot of game design and its incredible in its ambition. I can only hope so many more gaming experiences are like the first 60 hours I've sunk into this. Here's to 60 more hours and the hope that the next Dragon Age isn't a product of EA's shitbrain design and corporate greed. I won't hold my breathe that whoever is left at BioWare can capture me like this game did. If so this is as fitting of an end to Dragon Age as any.

After the story progresses and you open up dialogue in skyhold, it gets good. Combat is still kind of terrible due to the AI, but i managed to make it work by picking picking and building companions that manage to stay alive without me interveining on nightmare, so i can focus on an inquisitor class that requires a lot of managing(assassin). Took me 80 hours and 4 abandoned playthroughs to start having fun, so id say its still not for everyone. original review below.

Completely gutted the tactics system, which was a large part of the appeal DAO and even DA2 had for me.

I tried to play this as an action game instead. Planned to build my companions to combat their own inept AI instead of the enemies. But I never got that far, because exploring this game is just so draining!

There's this big map with almost nothing in it! Collect 20 shards, close 20 rifts, etc etc whilst riding around on a horse inspired by a flaw of skyrim(It's hooves have a magical molasses enchant on them). It's such a shame that this game is open world, I always loved dragon age for having a more focused story and sidequests that added to it.
The game feels like it's all filler. Maybe main story missions pack more of a punch, but those are locked away behind a mandatory 'power' requirement. How do you get power? Exploring and sidequests...
People will recommend to skip 95% of the games content, be it the avalanche of fetchquest 
sidemissions or boring puzzles scattered throughout the maps. But playing a lore-driven rpg game (it sure isn't combat driven), and then skipping out on the vast majority of content just doesn't sit well with me.

It's like it's not even trying to be a dragon age game. I can't believe that with it's terrible  re-used environments and dull enemies, I STILL prefer dragon age 2 over this.

As someone who likes story-rich games, it's truly a fun one to play! Almost everything you say and do has some kind of effect on the story. If you want to know more about the world after playing DA:O and DA2 then this has you covered, if you're patient.

What I will suggest is, if you are worried about the game being grindy, don't try to 100% collect everything, and take breaks. Kind of like an MMO, maybe you come back to it after a few weeks, maybe you want to fill in some time finding some shards.

Don't approach this like other games where you think you can just play this game and only this game until you're done. It's okay to play it differently, set yourself up for a marathon and take breaks with other games.

But Bioware should just give up on making videogames for a long while and just stick to other material till they get their stuff together. No matter how epic the story is, or how great the characters are, or even how the graphics are just pure eye candy, NOTHING should take priority in the eyes of the people except gameplay (especially in an action rpg) And unfortunately the gameplay in this one is by far the worst in all Dragon Age games. They dumbed down the tactical combat of the previous ones even further and made this one a Frakenstain abomination of action (complete with dodging,blocking) and pseudo optional ''tactic'' camera which i NEVER used in my 146 playthrough on NIGHTMARE (which should tell you something) The AI deserves its own golden nobel in the pantheon of gaming for being the absolute WORST GARBAGE AI i have ever seen in my 20 years of gaming! COUNTLESS times they stood in the line of fire of an angry dragon or chased a poor fucking helpless goat that minded its own fucking business across the map, and MANY more things that make me angry just remembering them. And you cant even customize their tactics unlike the previous games so they make their own decisions which half the time SUCK. The controls are unsurprisingly pretty awful on PC since this game is completely consolized so you either get a controller or suck it up like i did since i needed the space pause option like the previous games. Glitches and bugs are abundant in this one with characters suddenly being paralyzed and doing nothing till you take control of them, texture bugs and loading issues, down to options randomly resetting themselfs to defaults. To sum it up this was a incredibly dumbed down, poorly made, caricature of the previous entries with only the great story and characters remaining.

Inquisition was the game that caught my eye and inevitably dive into the Dragon Age series. After playing Origins and II, this game doesn't exceed the greatness of DA:O but it does feel much more better handled than DA:2. 

This game definitely still has the same gameplay aspects as Origins, but the decision to rework the tactics system is a double-edged sword. While it does feel easier to focus on your main character while letting simple tactics system do all the heavy-lifting for your companions, the original tactics system that lets you basically program your companions actions down to the order of spells still hits different. Story-wise, Inquisition has a significant edge over DA:II. You are no longer restricted to a single race nor to a fixed backstory. You can once again play and mold your character to your preference.

Since this game was made on a newer engine, graphics, game design, and performance is without a question better. That said, that isn't enough to cover up the fact that the so-called ""open-world"" still feels very lacking. Side quests are littered with fetch and gather missions that sometimes, if not all the time, feel like a chore. Not to mention the time it takes for the war table missions to finish. (Thank god for mods.) 

Although, I absolutely love the characters. They were well-written, and grew to really like them all, both as party in combat or back at the home base. Maybe this is because of nostalgia associated with the continuity of the world and my characters' decisions from Origins and II, to Inquisition, but the story really got me hooked.

All the factions that are arrayed to oppose or aid you have literally all gone to shit because of B-movie Idiot Ball shenanigans, which, of course, can only be solved by you and your A-Team of Randos. Your character has the charisma of a paper bag. Dialogue options aren't really accurately written so your character will veer wildly between bullheaded moron and obtuse crybaby. I leave cutscenes feeling like I need to send my character to a psychiatrist. It's a shame, because the environmental design is gorgeous. This is also the only Dragon Age where the character design and armor/clothing aren't eyebleedingly atrocious, but that's not saying much, considering. Others have touched on the grindy aspect so I won't, but christ. I think I would have enjoyed this game if it had been upfront about how dumb it is. As it stands, the repetitive gameplay perfectly compliments the contrived, poorly-written scenario. Oh, well.",1643484808,1643484808,False,21,5,0.64894479513168335,0,True,False,False

It is great early game but there's some severe lack of QOL additions that were clearly needed in the game. I'm copy pasting this from another review and I never used these mods as I had no expectations to research this before playing but here's a list of mods to use:
instant war table shenanigans;
quicker looting;
improved radius for looting;
huge inventory capacity;
bugs be gone;
more experience gained (10x);
speed launch (skips the intro and goes directly to the main menu);
party banter;
and the one I wish I got sooner, faster attack speed tier 3.

I haven't completed the game but the story, as far as I can tell, is pretty good. There's a few lows but there's more highs than lows, in my opinion. I think one of my favourites parts so far is the Winter Palace mystery. I wouldn't say it's as good as I've seen others say it is but it is a high point of the game. Needless to say, the story is nothing to scoff at and they have done a really good job of making the Dragon Age world feel open and fleshed out. It is a VERY long game though, and I don't even think I'm close to the end with 57 hours clocked. I'm at the point where I'm getting burnt out and just want the game to end. 

A big issue with the game feeling so long is the gameplay. The Dragon Age games have always been very MMO-like(less-so Dragon Age 2 but very much Dragon Age 1). In this game, the gameplay is so fucking grindy. I've seen other reviews point towards enemy health being a big cause of this, and I agree, but I would also say that damage is through a majority of the game very underwhelming, specifically with abilities you can get throughout the game. Rogues have been severely nerfed, mages are either really good or really weak depending(on what? No idea, I just know my mages are 50-50 on doing high damage or low damage), and warriors just dominate the game I feel like. Specifically with warriors, I somehow built Cassandra to be able to have full guard and never lose any of it, basically becoming invincible when guarded. My mages and rogues(including my MC) would die in just a few hits and were weak throughout the game. Not to mention, there are ZERO healing abilities as far as I could find. You can only heal with potions, which are limited between resupplying, and the AI is not very careful with its use. This wouldn't be an issue if travelling across the map didn't take so fucking long. Back-tracking to a camp to resupply only to have to run 5-10 minutes(even while on a mount) back to where you were, TO FIND THAT THE ENEMIES HAVE RESPAWNED is just not fun.

I think the overall issue is balancing. Even up to level 20, I was not able to defeat even the first dragon in the game, which is level 12, because it has so much damage and health. On top of this, the loot you get throughout the game is absolutely pathetic. Anything that is better than you currently have will most likely be a higher level requirement than your currently level, and crafted items are always better but tend to be expensive to make. Enemies just have so much health and virtually all loot is just pure junk. It's not a particularly engaging and motivating game.

Lasty, the combat is just clunky and awkward. There are *tons* of times where I would just fly in a random direction would attacking or I would get stuck behind an obstacle unable to hurt the enemy while still being right in front of them(invisible walls on every environment detail?), with more on top of these two particularly annoying details. I can't tell if all of this is bugs or just bad gameplay design but the gameplay is just sooooo clunky. I genuinely think Dragon Age 2 tops this game by a million times.

To summarise the gameplay:
-It is too grindy
-Virtually all loot sucks and is pointless junk
-Enemies are too tanky
-moving around the world takes forever even while on a mount
-they removed healing spells and potions suck as a main healing method
-the combat is clunky and awkward
-rogues have been nerfed into the ground and mages are hit or miss

I do like the characters in the game, though. Cassandra is your typical chantry-loving character. She mellows out throughout the game but she isn't the best starting out. Sera is such an awkwardly written character and I can't tell if they wanted her to be sarcastic or if she's intentionally such a goofy and awkward character. Unfortunately I ended up romancing her as with the character I made I was sort of pushed in her direction so... awkward. Solas is ""okay"" but I unfortunately [spoiler] know the plot twist with his character so his likeability is irrelevant for me[/spoiler]. The rest I can't say much about. I didn't end up using Varric a lot but he is lacking the charisma in this game compared to Dragon Age 2. Dorian, Vivienne, Ironbull, Blackwall, and Cole(who I constantly forget about which is as fitting as it can get) are all boring from my experience. Apparently Ironbull is a really good character but I never really used him and it takes forever for the party banter to occur.

Music and sound design is great, although the combat sounds can be weird at times. The visual design is really good, however. 

Overall, this is a very underwhelming game. I got it on sale and I can't say I was cheated. It just isn't as good of a game as it has been hyped up for me over the last almost decade. As far as Dragon Age goes, it seems to do justice to the continuity of previous games and the lore but the gameplay is just so fucking atrocious. I can only assume the next Dragon Age will be a sell-out pay-to-win MMO because I don't understand this gameplay that borderline feels like I'm playing an actual MMO, especially with how the War Table works in this game, which I did not talk about whooooops. There's too much filler(mostly running around in silence and constant back-tracking) for me to say this is a particularly good *game* but it is a good story.

Get it on sale. A weird tangent to go on, but I gotta say Bioware has really gone down hill over the years. I don't know what the hell is going on with the company but it's an embarrassment. I think I can summarise this game as being a weird chimera of ideas. I'd have enjoyed it as a much shorter game. It starts off strong and nose dives real quick once you realise you are just going to be running around doing MMO busy work for 99% of the game.",1643462905,1643462905,False,3,0,0.524822652339935303,0,True,False,False

I don`t know who to blame for this - the idiot who wrote the story, or the idiot who read it and was like ""Hmm, this looks decent."" The DLC-s drop down the rating of this game SIGNIFICANTLY. I strongly recommend that you DO NOT play the DLC-s if you want to keep your sanity in check. It will only make you mad, if you invested so much into the characters.

Other than the DLC parts, its an mediocre game at best. About 30h longer than what it should be. A lot of side zones and quests are there just to fill in the gaps the main story couldn`t fill. It was more interesting listening to your companions bitching about each other than listening to the entire so-called 'plot' this game had.

There is a lot to do and a lot of places to explore, but just copy-pasting same stuff all over, just in different looking zones, does not help one bit.

And then, there are bugs and glitches. One would think that for a game released in 2014, most of these would be fixed...but nope. Here are just some that I encountered:
- Fatal crashes. Happened over 30 times.
- Lighting not correctly used. A lot of places are way too dark or way too bright. Reflections do not work most of the time.
- Textures having problems with deciding when to load
- Rendering distance is absurdly low
- Cutscenes are capped at 30FPS
- NPC-s losing their ability to speak randomly
- Randomly missing object from the hub area (NPC-s, storage, and everything except walls really)
and many many more.

I am angry at the dev team that forgot about this game after they grabbed all the cash and never returned to fix the mistakes.

Are there problems, for sure 100%, but personally I feel the positives of an amazing companion list, great story and pretty good combat far outweighs the negatives, though the negatives are prevalent.

The companions have interesting backstories and are really well written, there are also quite a few romance options overall but they do have their own preferences so I would search that if you want. There are also advisors to the Inquisition that you meet, they each take a certain aspect of responsibilities and have their own quest line, which is very good to see; their main purpose gameplay wise is to be selectable in a war-table real life timer minigame, which does suck as it uses irl time rather than in-game.

Story is really good, especially the dlcs which I feel are better than the base story, especially the final dlc Trespasser which is straight up phenomenal, as it has unique great ends to the characters and the Inquisition as a whole, depending on choices made previously and within the dlc itself.

Combat is a mix between action and pause, issue command style which melds pretty well but does pertain to having camera issues when in the pause mode. Fun to fight, can get quite challenging, like the open world dragon bosses which are a blast and epic and provide unique loot; extra challenge modifiers were introduced which changes certain aspects for an increased chance in rare loot.

The music is also amazing, again especially in trespasser, but also as a whole.

The biggest negative by far is the open world, it feels too barren though really nice to look at while exploring with many varied locations, not enough side quests were placed in and what is there are mainly 'find notes that gives a quest' or a fetch style quest; don't include many interactable npcs. Definitely the content here is the weakest part but you are able to skip a large amount of it and focus on the main and character quests should you desire. The loot a lot of the game dropped from the open world is also worthless, you rarely seem to get much and when you do it is many, many levels higher than you currently are leading to frustratingly finding nothing overall, as when you reach that level you will have already found better equipment.",1642613636,1642613636,True,0,0,0.491935461759567261,0,True,False,False

Its attention to detail, player choice, believable and fleshed out characters, environmental design and variance, branching dialogue trees, relationship dynamics, and worldbuilding all put other RPGS to shame. There are so many details here that even mentioning all of them would take too long to type, but I'll mention my personal favorites.

1. The Dragon Age Keep. This online tool allows you to alter the ""world state"" for your playthrough, based on choices you made for previous games. The changes that I had in my ""canon"" playthrough, for example, are completely different than the default world state the game launches with. This adds so much replayability not just to this massive, 80+ hr game, but also to the others in the series.

2. The Companions. The companions have always been my favorite part of a Dragon Age game, and the same is true here. More dialogue, more characters, more deep dives into morals and personal belief systems. You'll find yourself playing chess with a General one minute, then debating the importance of your people's history with a Lesbian Robin Hood the next. 

3. The Environments/ World. I'll just get this out of the way- Inquisition is *huge*.  The continent of Thedas is massive. It has some of the biggest maps I've ever seen, and each one has a different environment. From deserts to lush rainforests, snow capped mountains and mires filled with undead, Dragon Age's world never gets boring, which is important because of-

4. The Story. Easily the longest story/ campaign in a Bioware game, clocking in at double the length of Dragon Age II and Mass Effect III, it fills that time with an engaging, rich narrative. It sets up the stakes well, plays to the chaos that comes with such events, and has multiple ways to change the way the story progresses. From choosing factions to ally with, toppling kings, and rising to political power, this game is stuffed to the brim with story.

Now, unfortunately, comes the ""but wait"". My single, major, unfettered criticism of the game is its combat. While the standard combat is light years better than Dragon Age II, and it still includes Origin's slower style of combat with it's ""tactical mode"", Inquisition's attempt to meld the two, (while admirable), doesn't mesh as well as it seems. Transitioning to the tactical mode during combat is often clunky, and the controls itself are somewhat... jerky. Not to mention, towards the later levels, regardless of equipped weapons or difficulty settings, the combat begins to drag. I've played the game on Casual, Normal, and Hard. All began sloooooowing down towards Level 16+.

Regardless of the combat, Bioware created easily one of the best RPGs I've ever played. It supplanted Skyrim as my number 3 game of all time, only behind Fallout New Vegas and Red Dead Redemption II. 

This game is easily a 9.5/10. 

I'll leave you with a quote, as applicable here as in the game, and a testament to the moral choices you'll make: ""All of this happened because of fanatics and arguments about the next world. It's time we start believing in this one.""

First thing I noticed are the controls. You want to play with mouse and keyboard? Make sure you remember Wolfenstein 3D from the early 1990's and how to move around because this is worse. Seriously, it is worse, by a lot.

The quests and gameplay are a joke. It is so cringy. Others have described this already.
But who of the developers thought it is a good idea in a character-driven RPG to go around and collect things? Collect this, collect that, now you have 6/23 this or that. It is the cover-up for bad gameplay and bad writing I think, it drags the game out.

Then there is the aesthetics of the game. While the graphics are nice for the time it was made, the design choices are so ridiculous I really had to laugh out loud while looking at most or the equipment.

I really liked Dragon Age (the first part) but this is just a joke and a cashgrab. The developers and the publisher should be ashamed and should retreat to a monastery to repent for their crimes against humanity (I do exaggerate, but just slightly).

This is perhaps my 7th playthrough and the camaraderie, humour, compelling backstories and romances are still touching to revisit. Trespasser and Deep Roads have some of the best dynamic soundtracks and I'm a creature of habit. DA:I is definitely my favourite DA game overall, and it's very much subjective because DA:O has some of the best writing and engaging back stories for each race the Warden was born into. DA:II is great in story and more nuanced with consequences but I wasn't a fan of the gameplay mechanics. I wouldn't approach DA:I as a newbie to Fantasy RPG's because its not as immersive and can be underwhelming if you miss the story beats of previous games. 9/10, will always romance the Egg.

Game was on sale during winter season on 2021, I'd played the base game and was left with a good impression on the ps4 thus I bought it once again for PC since it included Trespasser.
If there's anything I regret, that is not knowing the two DLCs before are Frostback Basin and The Deep Roads, I was too hasty to get to the point in the main story. Just keep in mind you'll need to save a different save file and never start on Trespasser if you have not complete those 2 maps. They do not really hinder with the main plot of the Inquisition but Trespasser does, so if you're just a main story only person, you can go with that. 
I have not played DA:O but I heard it's a better game than DA:I all the way so I'll be starting on that sooner or later once I'm done with both DLC maps.

Back on DA:I. Overall the background lore is extremely rich, it connects back to DA:O then DA2 where I should have bought as well since it features Hawke. But the main plot and purpose of the Inquisition is just quite off, like it's there for the sake of being there. The coincidence of certain time events is just over the top. Rich background lore, an off present-lore.

Combat is, ok ish. I'm used to real time active combat so there's many times this game does not work in my favor when the fights are too hard. Micro-managing 4 characters is amazingly difficult. My suggestion is to have 2 tanky frontlines, a mage and an archer. An assassin is almost not worth it unless it's Cole. My Inquisitor was an assassin and she just dies 24/7. Crits a perfect 27k but dies in 2 shots. But my strat is likely not the best either, I just rambo glass cannon everything with Varric as a god backliner dps. He's likely the easiest to build since he's only capable of wielding Bianca, thus there are good upgrades that's only dedicated to him. His ability to drop mines with Artificer is great to get aggro off him. I would definitely suggest building a support mage, you'll very much need it for Trespasser.
Game definitely does not lead your hand and tell you what to do so it may be hard for casual players /like me/ even on normal mode. But simply tactics should be more than enough for you to clear the game, even if it's a dps-focused comp. 

It's a fun game overall, had some minor frustrations but it will not be a good game if there's no challenges at all.",1641570871,1641570871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm so sad I didn't have the patience to find out what this game was about. I picked this game up on sale as it was a great bargain. I decided to research if anyone else had the same problem I experienced from days of old, low and behold a whole Sub Reddit with people complaining about slow or confusing game-play after the first hour ( I thought the same ). After reviewing these forums pertaining to DAI early game I realized the consensus was 8 hours of game play or getting to Skyhold is when you can decide if you like it our not and LET ME TELL YOU THIS IS TRUE. I found myself at about 7 hours and started to realize what the game was and its potential, then Skyhold, an hour later I was hooked. Please give this game a chance it has so many detailed features and if you haven't played it in an age where its hard to come across a game that is actually developed properly this is your ticket. LOOKING AT YOU RPG FANS. I highly recommend this game to any Dragon Age fan or RPG fan. Give it until you get to Skyhold to decide what you think, it is a slow paced game at first but it goes from 0 - 100 after 8 hours.",1641527918,1641528970,True,22,0,0.706316053867340088,0,True,False,False

The most important aspect to discuss is the story, this being the third title in a renowned franchise. I've only played this one and Origins, and the story of the first game is definitely better, but that isn't to say that Inquisition's story is bad. The power-level caps necessary for story missions certainly slows the game's pace at times, but the missions themselves are usually pretty exciting and fast-paced, making up for this. The characters around your custom protagonist are the true strong point in this game, and the legacy characters brought in from previous games are all further developed. Most side missions are a step down in storytelling, but the main plot and the individual plots of your companions are all well done.

Gameplay-wise, this game is both an improvement upon and a step back from Origins. The combat is much less clunky and a lot more fun, and the game's difficulty is a lot more consistent throughout. The dialogue wheel is easy to use and understand, but it gives a lot less depth to responses than is present in Origins (though part of that is due to your character having a voice in this game). The open world has more stuff to do in it than some of the open areas in Origins, but this game's open world is a lot like that of Mass Effect: Andromeda (that's not a good thing). Lastly, the engine used for this game (Frostbite) is poorly optimized for anything other than shooters, which means this game's character animations aren't exactly the best. They're leaps and bounds better than those of Andromeda, which uses the same engine, but they're still not great.

I think that Origins is the better game, but this one is certainly worth playing if you enjoyed the first. Everything you want in a good Dragon Age game is here; romances, interesting companions, a compelling plot, and a good mix of realistic medieval-type fantasy with sweeping, Tolkien-esque high fantasy. I would definitely recommend this game.",1641522066,1641522066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is what I look for in an RPG, hands-down. Honestly it only suffers from some slowness due to an unnecessary number of sidequests in the base game, the main villain within is only so-so, but the lore, characters and how you impact the world is what makes this game magnificent.
The romance mechanics are pretty sweet too, and a wonderful part of this game. You can have an array of different characters to romance in terms of orientation.
Character creation I find somewhat limited for nowadays, but back when it came out it was pretty good.
Combat is average, nothing to write home about.

I HIGHLY recommend you get the Trespasser DLC, otherwise you will miss not only an amazing DLC but also an essential (imo) conclusion to the base game. Not only that, I found the writing of the DLC superior to the one in base game, maybe because it's shorter and more focused, but it worked better for me anyway.

Visuals: 4.6/5 (graphics are naturally a bit outdated by the time of this review)
Music: 3.8/5 
Story: 4.1/5 (overall, I felt that the base game could have been better, Trespasser's story however is a 5000/5))
Gameplay: 4.0/5 (mechanics are fairly simple and easy to learn, not especially challenging)
Gameflow: 4.1/5
Replayability: 5/5 (you can always try completely new decisions in each playthrough that heavily impact what happens story-wise)
Neurodivergent friendly? : 4.5/5 (there is a section of The Descent DLC that can give headaches because of the background noise, specifically the ""Bastion of the Pure"" entire floor)
LGBTQIA+ friendly? : 5000/5!!!

Like, it's nice that they made the game more open world, but they did it with a super undetailed map and mini map, i accidentally walked into a fight with a dragon that was not marked on any map. I thought at first that it was super nice there were tons of side quests all over the hinterlands, until i realised that they have no dialogue choices other than agreeing or not, and have nothing to do with the main plot or the rest of the game.  I'm having a hard time feeling immersed in it, there's so much to do in this game, but a lot of it kinda has no point and i don't want to bother with it. 
I'm playing this immediately after the first two, so I might be a bit biased since i'm comparing it to those(and skyrim, it feels like they were trying for that vibe and missed) and i have hella anxiety so the issues mentioned above and the sheer number of side quests in one area is probably stressing me out a bit.

Update: Currently on my second playthrough of Inquisition. It's funny, while going through Origins and DA2 again I could not wait to reach Inquisition, but now I'm here I'm not as hyped as I was while playing towards it.

What stands out for me is the graphical quality, the music and the development of all the different companions. I also really loved the voice acting for the player character (the British one). Weaker points would be (for me) the more generic story, conversation options are not as varied/original as Origins, and the many tedious side quests that do not add much value to the game.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend it. It has some flaws but also good improvements in other areas.",1607794028,1640981908,True,2,0,0.526180088520050049,0,True,False,False

I kept playing it because the mods I have installed helped me bypass what I didn't like so I could jump straight to what I wanted the most - the companions bantering and bickering every five minutes.

I got these mods:
[list]
[*]instant war table shenanigans; 
[*]quicker looting; 
[*]improved radius for looting;
[*]huge inventory capacity;
[*]bugs be gone;
[*]more experience gained (10x);
[*]speed launch (skips the intro and goes directly to the main menu);
[*]party banter;
[*]and the one I wish I got sooner, faster attack speed tier 3.
[/list]

Now lemme talk a little about the best part of this game: The characters.

It took me a bit to get the companions I wanted, Sera and Dorian. I kept Cassandra because she is hilarious in her own right. Everyone else kinda... falls short in being interesting and/or entertaining, except for Iron Bull. Varric is alright if you keep him around Cassandra.

Leiliana and Josephine are very interesting characters and they kept me engaged into their storylines. I even ended up romancing Josephine and it was very, very cute - especially with my character being a Qunari. Cullen however is plain as a door and unfortunately I just couldn't force myself to keep talking to him.

Morrigan also shows up eventually and she is a delight as usual. She was a very needed addition to the game and I wish she showed up sooner and in a bigger role from the get-go. That woman oozes charisma and I'll forever simp for her.

Most of the cast can be very boring, depending on what you find entertaining, including the sociopath Solas. The inquisitor is kind of a dark hole of charisma depending of the choices you make and, please, do yourself a favour and use the british female voice for the inquisitor for a much better experience.
I dig chav accents so Sera made me laugh out loud more than once. She is a huge brat so keep that in mind, but her interactions with Cassandra made these almost 60 hours of gameplay more than worth it.

Now... the rest.

Everything else is more of a single-player MMORPG and unfortunately the enemies can be very tanky for absolutely no reason. I really wish I had the attack speed mod from the beginning, but at least here I am telling you to not make the same mistake as me. I played as a two-handed warrior just bashing everyone's brains out and I still felt underpowered with my boosted experience and somewhat powerful weapons. I genuinely dislike how 'hammer'spongy these enemies can be, especially in the DLCs. Come on, now. 

Walking around is also slow, doing the side-quests... I mean, I just wish they were more engaging than just 'go there and fight that demon' or 'close that rift... again'. It offers little to no reward but thankfully with mods you can just bypass all of this very easily. 
Some of the treasure hunting can be fun like the shards and the asterium thingies you find during your strolls along the planes of existence in this game but I know it is not for everyone. Eventually I got bored and just got a mod to unlock the doors using the shards with a lot fewer items than the game originally asks you to.

The story is the usual [i]""I was chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool and shootin' some darkspawn outside of where I wasn't supposed to be when a big bad evil guy who was up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood.""[/i] I genuinely had zero interest in knowing more about it until the Winter Palace, which is a fun drama mystery waiting to happen that could've been easily the main aspect of this entire game and made it so much better but alas, it is just a mission and it's... okay.

Most of your choices actually matter but what good does it do to the overall experience when the game is boring? Read up on the characters and if you enjoy some of them then I'd say to go ahead and get this, but, just know the game just ain't that good or mechanically fluid at all.

I don't know who thought the 'lets make the character sit down and loot' animation was any good. Thank the modders for the work they do otherwise I'd have never played this for more than 30 minutes.",1640976450,1640976505,True,99,11,0.72574615478515625,0,True,False,False

-It's repetitive and slow. Enemy health bars take forever to drain; I just sit there holding M1 pressing A and D, slowly watching their health drop. 
-Poor balancing with the classes and you cannot change character('s) classes (or at least I don't know how to) 
-Lots of walking around and horses are slow asf.
-Have to use Origin
-No healing in combat. Only way to heal is to go back to camp and rest resulting in even more repetitive gameplay and walking

I never played an game like this before and was honestly pretty worried that I wouldn't like it like. 350 hours in, 3 fully done play through and almost a year later I got say this is my favorite game of all time now.
I love all the characters we can befriend and build friendships with them. I love all npcs we can get close to. Some of them I didn't really understand their character my first play through but after the second I grew fond to them after actually giving them more time and attention. Sometimes you can't get around to befriending everyone in one playthrough so it's nice to go back and try to learn more about the ones you missed. Also the banter between party members are great. Heck even the banter between the npcs you pass down the street are super interesting to listen in on.  

  I love how open the world is and how almost every corner that would seemed to be empty has something there. Normally some loot but sometimes a fun little lore bit! 
Fighting is pretty good for the most part. Fighting the dragons are the best part :3

Last problem that starts to get on my nerves after a bit is that the maps are gigantic and yet you move incredibly slowly, there is no sprinting either, just mounts and those mounts move really slowly and also have a 3 second animation to get on them and there is no mod to fix this

I'm Korean

It's a very easy RPG to enter Dragon Age, and I think the party play system is a well-made game because you can learn more intuitively than the Divinity Originals and other games. Of course, the bizarre level design of the inland area or the collection elements and insincere sub-quests that are a little cumbersome to do the second round are very disappointing. Still, I finished the first round of this game and am playing the second round and waiting for Dragon Age 4. It's a game that's worth enough, so I recommend it if you're interested.

We are publishing a series of attacks to help the founders of the new Dragon Age.
It will be helpful for those who want to complete all the contents with the shortest possible movements.
In addition, there are writings that help first-time visitors, such as how to get colleagues quickly, how to get horses, and how to get things.
I think it'd be good if you came and watched.

I bought this for PS4 when it released, and I remember sinking 60 or so hours into the game, and just being completely disinterested in the story line. I then played Witcher 3 for the first time and was in love. When I completed that game, I felt like I needed to continue my story here and realised only a few hours into continuing that I approached the end of the game.

  So, my first experience was being so into the completionist grind that I lost total track of what relative progress I had to an end game goal. It never felt like I was nearing an end. There wasn't a narrative arc that felt like a peak was coming - in fact when it ended I was so underwhelmed that I figured I must have not have been paying attention. 
 
  Well, it's been several years and I thought I should give it a fair shake and try the game again. It's absolutely unplayable. I forgot just how mundane every movement and interaction with simple objects and UI's are. It's an RTS game, that plays in a hybrid  - and while it was revolutionary at the time it's aged like milk. It's a grind, the plot is garbage, the gameplay is clunky and it's just an absolute waste of your time.

It does have its issues but I enjoyed the story and the characters. Bit annoying that you needed to get the dlcs in order to get the full story, but I guess thats typical of EA and modern gaming.

This is a negative review due to the fact that I literally cannot get this game to launch. I have reinstalled so many times and maybe for every 100 attempts to launch I have managed to get it running once? Then 2 hours later after closing the game, without any changes or updates, it wouldn't launch again. From what I have read this is mostly due to issues with Origin? After trawling through different websites and trying each fix and contacting support I haven been able to properly play this game. 
If i could actually play, i would recommend for sure. Really hoping the next game is more accessible, but I don't have high expectations.

It's a good game but not as good as the previous dragon age(s). The dialog is OK, the combat is OK, the world is OK although it feels a little empty at times. Almost like a low-pop MMO game. The most interesting class (Knight Enchanter) got nerfed by the developers but you can semi-unnerf it via mods.

There are some interesting quests and characters, they shoehorned in some ""romance"" plots which were kinda meh.

I have loved this game for many years. I never knew it had a co-op. I got really excited when I saw that I could play this game with someone. I instantly purchased a few copies for my pals and was super excited to get started. And then disappointments started falling on us one after another.

1) You must login to Origin to play this game
2) Coop is actually some crappy dungeon crawler with in game purchases, looks more like a crappy android game, than anything anyone who loved the main story could ever enjoy.
3) Origin is probably the crappiest software I have ever used. After going through the severly buggy application without any luck finding each other with friends, we tried the web app, we could not find each other until we were switched our accounts to public (thank god noone uses any real data in the form), but even then there was no option to add each other as friends.

Friendless and sad we were not able to play the coop, even though we bought this game thinking we would be playing the epic story.

Gameplay: 5/10

Final rating: 6.2/10

* I have decided to not complete this game as it's an insult to my intelligence and a dire waste of my time. Much to EA's advantage because if I had, the final rating would be a lot worst. 

Pros: The graphics are Okay(if you appreciate that lip glistening should be on male lips, cotton textures and nearly everything else). The game is somewhat immersive if you manage to ignore that men should wear lip glistening. Inquisition is generally a big change compared to the first and second game of this franchise. It's open-world and not linear like DA 1 and 2. This one sets its focus on exploration a lot more than just completing quests. It resembles an MMORPG, playable offline rather than a linear experience. The multiplayer options are working correctly. 

Cons: I will just say that a lot of new mechanics were added to the DA franchise, likely with great enthusiasm from the EA dev team, but with very little success. The mouse/keyboard option is possible but the keybindings are not pre-positioned correctly. A lot of precious time has to be spent in configuring them to work the way they should. The targeting is even worst than Dragon Age 2: Normally, when clicking to melee-attack an enemy, the character is expected to move directly to the enemy and attack it. instead, you need to use the WASD keys to move close to the enemy first & then manually attack it. Or use a dash skill, but in any normal solo RPG, this should not be required. I get the sense that DA Inquisition was first built to be online-friendly but that's not an excuse to implement an inconsistent targeting system. It has a major impact on the combat system. Also, the loot is difficult to see. It takes an eagle eye to not miss anything when walking around. The sound output lowers considerably when having conversations with Quest NPC's, forcing me to lift the volume every single time I'm given a quest & lower it down in semi-panic mode when sound effects happen later on. The compass is garbage and has you check your main map very often as you turn your character around to adjust the cursor's direction. Sometimes, the whole party along with all NPC's around suddenly slow down for no other reason than it being a bug, nothing to do with hardware or anything else. The interface and general feel of the game is slowness-incarnate otherwise.

To EA: Please stop developing RPG's. It's clearly not your field of expertise.",1639916630,1640294494,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

Music, art (all the tarot cards look fantastic, I adore the style), voice acting, individual companion stories (those vary from great to just good).

Cons:

Your character is a blank slate with zero personality, especially compared to your companions. I miss Hawke something fierce whenever I'm forced to listen to the generic remarks my Herald of Andraste makes.

Your companions are a diverse bunch. You have Varric (best boy), you have Sera (best girl), and the rest are pretty great too. A lot of it is voice acting, which is 10/10, as it always is with Dragon Age.

BUT you also have Cullen, who is suddenly in favour of freeing mages [i](after Ferelden Circle AND  Kirkwall, like WHAT; did you need a romance line with him that badly?).[/i]
You have the Qunari who have a MAGE leading a group of spies and who are, apparently, now accepting of things like gender equality, female fighters, and more! And that would be a beautiful thing if we didn't have a whole Stan in DA: Origins man-splaining to the Warden how women can't fight and how mages are leashed and bound under the Qun. What the hell happened to that??

The main plot is just boring, in my opinion. I mean, you can have a simple let's-save-the-world story and make it work but you have to put effort in it! The only enjoyable thing for me was catching references to the previous games. But they are so few and far between, they just start making you sad the more you encounter them. But don't worry, there are like 5 of them among tens of hours you will spend playing this game. Just don't miss them. [spoiler] I almost cried when I saw my Hawke. Wish I could just take control of him and go be epic somewhere far from the Inquisition.[/spoiler]

Fighting system is bleh. Every enemy encounter is flashy and colourful and also looks like every single one you previously had. Character models have 3 animations for the weapon type they use and they are stiff as hell. Remember those sweet moves your mage Hawke performed when they used different types of attacks? They're gone now.

And the MOST disappointing thing is that NOBODY. SAYS. A WORD. EVER. The cooldown on companions' banter is 15 MINUTES (or more). You're just wandering the countryside with people who don't comment on ANYTHING and have no opinions other than their approval/disapproval stats. My party encountered a dragon fighting a giant on the coast of some whatever-place and nobody said a THING. In DA 2 there would've been a cutscene.

Such a disappointment. All you get is an empty open world with silent companions and a lot of hill climbing. Don't recommend playing it unless you have trouble sleeping or consider holding W for hours while simultaneously bashing V to highlight objects you can interact with a fulfilling gaming experience.",1639267668,1639590737,False,11,0,0.537804722785949707,0,True,False,False

multiplayer is a separate game and the servers are awful. I've recently been completing levels only to find the ending not being able to load successfully and the lobby crashes thus losing everything we did on that map. In addition, there aren't many player who play and also it is extremely grindy and barely possible to complete your first map with a small group of players. If you cannot find friends good luck solo. I promoted my heroes a total of 32 times and just barely able to complete threatening difficulty solo. There are like, 4 more higher difficulties I cannot touch and most likely never will. Not to mention there is hacking in multiplayers. People run and one tap everything and sometimes the game just ends once you start, you rejoin the lobby gaining 30k exp (leveling from 1 to 17) without even playing. So again, I'd rather not play multiplayer anymore. It is no longer supported. It's kinda like diablo without weapon drops since highest DPS is like 270 which is very low damage.

There is so much content besides the main story that I haven't completed it all yet. The graphics are still beautiful in today's standards. There is some things I do not like though, like holding down left click to attack instead of just right clicking on an enemy for continuous basic attacks like the older games. Having a mount is cool and all, but it is hardly faster than you on foot in my opinion. 

The story is amazing, the companions all have a unique story themselves. I wish there were more romance options to be honest. I romanced Blackwall first, he turned out to be a dick in the end. Then I went for Cullen which I should have done in the first place, he was such a sweetheart. One problem with the main story is the crashes. I've crashed several times just going through the main story, luckily this game auto saves quite frequently so it wasn't too annoying to deal with. Killing dragons is awesome too, they're not like puny Skyrim's dragons that is for sure. Dragons in this game is literally a force to be reckon with.

Even with the main story done, I still have so much to do and I will complete the rest in time. Here's hoping that with Dragon Age 4, there will hopefully be action combat. Micro-managing characters is a bit meh, but you can build your companions enough for them to stand on their own. I can't say that for harder difficulties though.

If you play, get out of the Hinterlands as soon as you can.  

I have now played this twice. First time was ~140 hours because I was grinding and completing the side missions. Second time was ~ 30 hours by ignoring them.   I played the second game thinkng I made bad choices but  my first impression was still how I feel. 

 I waited to play the game because I  heard its a pointless grinder and discovered they were right.  For this game, Bioware rejected what makes their games great and replaced it with an open world I didn't connect to. From a company that had everything from how you treat a reporter in the first of a trilogy to genocide affect the fate of the galaxy, a game where all choices don't matter is a let down.  I only truly connected to  interactions with characters I knew from previous DA and the beautiful maps. 

PROS -

Excellent map design with variety not only between maps but often very different within the same map. 

The maps are beautiful.  The rolling sand dunes of a desert map are as impressive as the views from a beachside cliff in a forest.  

Excellent AI pathmaking for companions and kept me from ever getting stuck as well. 

Many challenging and interesting creatures to destroy. I appreciated that a pride demon  has different vulnerabilties and immunities than an anger demon.  However,dragons  were a big let down. 

Brings back some of my favorite characters from previous DA games and had great interactions with them.  I almost cried over a kid meeting grandma.

The BEGINNNING of the game is unique and engaging and makes you want to save the world. 

Great acting and character design across the board. Not their fault I couldn't connect to their stories. 

CONS - 
           For every boss, the solution to make them tougher was just make them immune to your abilities.  Every boss battle was a disappointment. A dragon needs to be more than slowly dying from papercuts while it just sits there and throws out a leg every 5 seconds so you move the 1 character it will hit.  

          Level scaling and difficulty is just changing how many hitpoints they have and how fast their armor/shield recovers.  The AI doesn't get any smarter or use the creature's strengths.

              None of your choices matter for the main quest.  Every faction you save is never seen again to help in the fight.  Your first major decision that you are led to believe matters is to support faction A or faction B.  The only effect it has is which of 2 NPCs stands around your base without any dialogue options.   A decision that is supposed to matter is eliminating an addictive substance to save one of the factions.  Even after the game officially tells you that you succeeded, there are literal 10ft tall sources of it everywhere you go  and you continue fighting the addicts.    After the game told me for the third time 'you've eliminated this threat. This time I really  mean it"", it has the same bad guys in the final mission.   After the second time you are told a global problem is solved but the same problem exists in the next mission, you question what is happening.  Times 3-40 when the game has you make the exact same choice and doesn't deviate, it starts to piss you off.  In addition, it is theoretically possible to fail a main story mission but after finishing this the first time, I googled how and its so hard to mess up, there are walkthrough guides explaining what you have to do. 

            The difference between completely destroying one faction and having them join your forces resulted in a 1 line change in the epilogue.  You destroy a major force of good in the world and it has no impact.   You are given the option to help choose a new leader of another major faction. No matter who you choose, the same name ends up leading the faction.

In the first mission, you discover you exist to solve a very specific problem.  You were chosen to have a special ability.  You solve this problem very early and immediately discover it had minimal impact.  The game then has you do it ~ 60 times in side missions and it has no impact on the main story. Even when you mess up, the game gives you a built in do over.   In fact, you could never exist in the world and it would have ended the same way (see spoiler for details).  

SPOILER START***************************************

The entire game's central premise is keeping the big bad out of the Fade. You end the game by fulfilling his goal and sending him there.    Per conversations with Solas,  if he had succeeded the first time when you were accidentally created, there's a very good chance he would have been too weak to do what he wanted and just been trapped there.  The villian of Dragon Age 4 planned this.  He only got  stronger because he had to search for another way.  If you never existed, Dragon Age 4 will start the same way because nothing you did affected anything anyway.  

SPOILER END*********************************************

Everything associated with side quests -
           95% fall into two categories - fetch quest or use your special ability at this location.  There is over 100 hours of these types of missions if you like to look for books or mine 10 copies of an ore type. By the end of the game, you are literally just standing around and pointing on the side quests while your companions fight.  
           Everything you do in a side quests does not matter,. They are here as grinder filler, not to flesh out a world. There is a side quest that involves a cut scene with a goat (only side quest I remember with a cut scene) that I particularly enjoyed but it still doesn't change the world or the story.  There are a couple quests where you save an entire country and not have it matter.  After fighting 75 minutes to save a royal person from having their castle overran, they said thanks  and I never heard from them again and they never showed up to help.  
            The map interface to choose side quests is horribly designed.  Markers are hidden behind other markers, disappear between missions, and you can't even see the name of many of them when you select it until you open the full dialogue.
           The game has you choose 1 of 3 advisors to spend real world time to unlock your side quests.  Who you choose rarely affects anything and they often have different times to complete. You must open the whole mission to see how long it would take them. The game has  you unlock assets to lower the time but its like speeding up a Taylor Swift song while you are combing your hair.  Sure its faster but it didn't sound any better and you still just brushed your hair. 

The companions are 1 dimensional versus every companion in every Bioware game ever.  The space hamster Boo is more fleshed out than these companions you spend hours with.   Each companion is assigned 1 personality trait and about  12 conversation choices for the whole game. There are multiple NPCs with more conversation choices. Like every other side quest, theirs didn't affect anything either. The one companion with any depth is a carryover from a previous DA so they had depth baked in on arrival.

BIoware's history of good vs evil changing your options and companion approval is been abandoned.  The game tells you their approval has changed but there's no way to look at it. The only effect I could find was a change in their first line of dialogue when you click on them. No stat boosts or new dialogue by getting high approval.  One companion really didn't like a choice I made and even after punching them in the face, they stayed.  2nd playthrough I was able to romance a character and not choose complimentary conversation choices. A companion may leave as the result of their own back story but it has nothing to do with their approval.  You randomly discover them missing and decide whether to track them down.

And finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?

But, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin ""integration"" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?

This is the same ""we hate our customers"" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay ""integration"" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. 

DO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. 
If you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.
If you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different ""agents"", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you ""they'll discuss it with their team"". Then you might get your game back. 
But! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.

This [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say ""hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.""

So yeah. Great game. Bad EA.

So if you go to your game on steam, you will see a little gear by the star. (It’s called manage, but whatever.)

Pros:
+ Good ol Dragon Age story with excellent voice-acted characters.
+ Beautiful landscape and world map than DA2, which is miserable consider re-using the same dungeon layout map.
+ Graphics still pretty decent for a 7 years old game.
+ Engaging action battle, mix with RTS element in it.
+ Collectibles and crafting system.
+ Comprehensive dialog.
+ Skill tree.
+ Lot of playtime and don't mention about replayability.

Cons:
- Clunky camera controls that can be annoying at time.
- Weapons, armor, and accessories is not varied its sub-stats, and don't have variety in names.
- Awkward bowing character after acquiring/ recruiting agents.
- Lot of skills is felt like reused from previous games.
- Lot of sidequests felt like unimportant.

Good thing this game is still good even nowadays, and you don't have to play previous installment in order to play this (although it's a direct sequel with some old characters back in this installment). It's fun, it's pretty time consuming if you are a completionist.

Since for Dragon Age fans, DAI is probably a game you'll want to play at some point. However...I can't. I just can't recommend DAI as an RPG. So I'm going to do a full explanation on my reasons. As with most reviews I'll keep spoilers to a minimum, but I won't hesitate to imply or state certain things if its required. If you are not okay with that, continue scrolling. Thank you.

I'm gonna start off with the gameplay, mechanics, that sort of thing. In a word - Garbage. Now the overall, fighting and stuff is seamless, however they have sucked the RPG out of RPG. For starters, you no longer have control over your stats. You gain attributes (Constitution, Strength, Magic etc) purely by picking certain perks, instead of being able to assign them. Second, you only have 8 usable slots on your quickbar. Thats right...8. Thats not counting the fact you'll have 2 or 3 must-haves like the mark of inquisitor, so your reduced even further to about 6. Considering mages are strictly skill based classes, playing as a mage can be infuriating as you try to decide what skills to keep. This gets worse since alot of the cooler skills are situational, like wall of ice or the mines, but impossible to choose because you've given the valuable slots to more universal skills. The graphics are also totally broken. While they 'look good', they are prone to innumerable glitches, clipping and tons of bugging out thanks to the spaghetti code beneath the frostbite engine. Background NPCs will totally break and just freeze like a block of ice. Thats not to say *everything* is bad. When the graphics work right...its frostbite. It looks stunning even in 2021. And the crafting system is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Seriously...the freedom you get in crafting is awesome because what matters is what materials you build the item out of! So you build an item out of rare materials and you get a much better and cooler item. 

1.) World - Let me start off the meat of the review with the world. Now, it has some bonus's being set in the dragon age world, so alot of the world building and setup is already done if you've played DAO and DA2. However somehow Inquisition still manages to make the world seem less interesting and almost...neutered. I'll start with the Qunari. In DAO and DA2, the Qunari were serious. They were well written and logical. They represented order at the extreme cost of individuality. In fact, Sten explicitly stated ""You cannot be a warrior, you are a woman."" to a female Warden. And in DA2 the Qunari continued this trend. However DAI bastardizes them and finishes the softening up of the Qunari that began in Mark of the Assassin. Having female Qunari soldiers, having the Qunari companion embrace a transgender to the point of even having Qunari names for that, having Qunari trying to 'help' those around them. Etc etc. And it's not just the Qunari. The world is filled with massive leaps in logic that make no sense. For starters, the Grey Wardens, who are now emotional toddlers who think its a genius move to not only trust a tevinter magister...but also widely embrace blood magic and sacrifice half their forces in trusting said Tevinter Magister, because...no no get this...they are scared. That's the logic behind it. The Grey Wardens are scared. Also remember that massive war between Templars and Mages thats been brewing since DAO? And fully kicked off at the end of DA2? Yeah that's over before you even get your permanent home base. And you literally just get ""Option A or Option B""? Do you help Templars or do you help mages? There's no real explanation on why they are fighting except ""Templars were mean to mages and so therefore mages are striking back"". There is no nuance and certainly no way to optimize your playthrough to help both. And overall the only real thing that changes on whether you side Templars or Mages is what attire the people helping you close the big rift are wearing and whether you fight dude with swords or dudes with staffs at the end of the first act. Because when you go into act 2 and act 3 all story enemies really change to the real bad guys. 
2.) Story - Story had potential. I'll be honest. But it falls terribly short. In DAO...the story was deceptively shallow. You eventually find out that the main antagonist is not in fact the evil dragon invading your land, but in fact is a very human enemy. DAI essentially has a similar premise, the world is basically being invaded by a very bad person...who has all the motivation and reasoning of the archdemon. Its Dragon Age Origins without Loghain. Its Mass Effect without Saren. Its Fallout without the Master. And what makes it worse? The antagonist is a complete and utter buffoon. A laughingstock who loses every step of the way to the Main Character. Even when it looks like the antagonist has won, it usually turns out to be a victory for the Inquisition in the long run. Like when you get driven out of your first home...then literally in the next scene you get a freaking castle. Also even now I'm not quite sure what the antagonist wanted. He's basically just like ""I'm going to become god and make tevinter great again"". And your like ""No...no I don't think you will."" and you spend the next 60 hours systematically reducing everything he has to ash. Speaking of game time...its far...far too long. The story itself is gated behind 2 systems. The first is levels. And second is power. You have to grind out open world bullshit 'power' to 'purchase' the next world area, dlc area or level. Its asinine. It makes the game, especially the early game an absolute grind. Your just running around...setting up camps, closing rifts on a giant barren open world, getting enough power points so you can do something actually interesting...like advancing the actual story. Overall you probably have 10-15 hours of actual story gameplay...gated behind 40-50 hours of open world bs. DAI does NOT respect your time. 
3.) Characters - I was going to write out how DAI actually did characters very well, and the new characters were fun and engaging...then I realized every character I was mentioning were all from previous games. Morrigan, Leliana, Cullen, Varric, Cassandra, etc. All of which were from previous games. The new characters in the games were...okay I guess? We get a Grey Warden who was good, as was our very own tevinter mage we get as a companion. But the Orlesian Mage was a bitch. Our Qunari companion retconned the Qunari into oblivion. And the elven archer is...an ugly, insane lunatic? Like what is she? She's like Peebee from MEA but somehow so so much worse. I suppose she has a couple fun interactions when she gets pulled out of her comfort zone, but overall shes just a nuisance. I love how its so over the top they even mention it in game how much a sadistic lunatic she is. But the worst part is how much the game wants to force you to love these characters, You can almost never be mean to them, you can ask them to leave or never recruit some of them in the first place but thats the most you'll get. I have no idea...I just cant help but be unimpressed with the new characters. And the old characters just got retconned or otherwise had their entire arcs blown over. I wanted to go into detail on Cullen and Leliana being two great examples of characters who had their entire arcs in previous games ignored or retconned...but it appears I've hit the word limit. 

Overall I'm really torn. But I cant say I'd recommend Inquisition. DAO being a far superior game. IF your a HUGE dragon age fan or your getting into the series and want a full playthrough of all the games, its probably worth it at least once. But I cant honestly recommend it as it cannot stand as a game on its own two feet.

I feared Bioware would dump the story of Dragon Age (3) into the toilet the same way they did to Mass Effect 3. But they didn't. I didn't foresee that it would be a masterpiece of a story, which I hadn't seen since the Knights of the Old Republic.

But it was.

And, if the main plot wasn't enough, all DLCs, especially Trespasser took the lore of Thedas(which was dictated by the Chantry propaganda) and tore it all to shreds, revealing truths, which were hidden for thousands of years. Showing us that we know exactly nothing about the history of this world. All of this is accompanied by great OSt from Trevor Morris. Bravo, Bioware!

Some advice:

1) Dalish female mage must be your main character. The story of Inquisition - and the upcoming 4 - revolves around their history and technology.
2) Get out of the Hinterlands as soon as possible. This is the most boring part, better to leave it till the second Act.
3) Spawn points are fеcked, sometimes it's better to run past enemies in open world, otherwise it might become a long fight with respawning enemies.
4) Team's behaviour and algorithms(what remained of those anyway) are double fеcked. You'd have to micromanage them, or they will die very quickly. Unlike DAO and DA2, party behaviour menu is severely nerfed.
5) Wartable operations have consequences.
6) Google romance options before starting them - you can flirt with everyone, but, depending on your sex and race, your final options are limited.
7) Hard and Nightmare are brutal. More than in previous installments.
8) To avoid game-blocking glitch in the Trespasser, each time before you enter the Crossroads, you must:
+ Disable VSync
+ Switch to window mode
+ At the same time as your character touches the mirror, ALT+TAB to something, Chrome will suffice.
(Hell if I know how this works, but it somehow skips the loading loop and possible crashes)
You can save and switch to normal settings once you're able to pick your teammates.

I’m glad I had the opportunity to revisit it and experience the better graphics on the PC.

I don’t have much to add to what others here have said, except to highlight one or two issues I think are important.

The game is HUGE. I played for well over 100 hours and didn’t get everything finished. That sounds great, but in practice the mechanics of the game didn’t allow the kind of character progression I was looking for. Slight imbalances in the crafting and looting systems became very noticeable as I entered the sixtieth and seventieth hours!

The Black Emporium DLC illustrates the shortcoming. The higher specced weapons are unaffordable in the early game, and vastly underpowered later on compared to the items you can craft.

The combat system is a bit schizophrenic. The tactical mode is really only useful in brief moments of peril, perhaps when finishing off the odd dragon. But the intelligence level of your AI squad is very basic, so you will often just be better off staying in real time and hoping for the best.

If it was possible to string combos of actions together in tactical mode then there would be at least some advantage in using it, but as it is I found myself using it to position mages who were way too close to the action, or to focus the whole team’s attack on one enemy.

The story, the writing and the characters were top notch, even though some of the facial animations were a bit awkward. Maybe it’s just me, but the “romance” was absolute cringe!

The Trespasser DLC was essential to finishing off the story. I hadn’t played it before, and whilst the story was good I felt that my earlier decisions were not really reflected in the writing. For example, my cringey romance with Josephine was completely ignored until an obvious insert where (completely out of context) she kissed me in front of the rest of my council!

The very cheek of the woman!

I’m somewhat exhausted by my trek through Thedas, but I find myself looking forward to the fourth game with interest.

Not worth the $9.99 I paid for it.

Only three starting classes with no easy way to get more classes. No gear to really equip at least early on and hardly any materials to craft your own, and hardly any gear to breakdown to craft your own gear in the first place. Hardly any XP, pay to win store lootbox system, enemies, even at lowest difficulty take forever to kill, fighting mechanics on PC don't seem optimized, there isn't much skill variety or flexibility per class, many enemies will kill you very quickly but you do little to no damage to them, even the archers which would normally be squishy. Ability information while in a run is non-exsistant. For a fully released game it seems like an early access game from a chinese company looking to earn money through the store.

There are SO many side things to do that it swamps the main game. Theoretically, you can finish the MSQ in a few hours if you JUST did that (except they gatekeep with the power requirement) 

fighting was nice. I went back and tried to play origins after beating this and it made me realize how more active this combat is compared to DAO. Though some skills are useless on some party members/a waste of resources due to the AI being a little dumb. Not being able to use premade tactics really hurts the AI i think.

The abilities are nice. they make sparklies on the screen and makes my brain feel good (though the bow rogue is so op)

It is nice to be able to send recipes back to other characters though it does feel kind of cheap using the best recipes on a fresh level 1. [spoiler] Theres also a small exploit that allows you to basically purchase every purchasable schematic in the game as you can load it up and buy the schematic then send it over through the nug and just reload that toon[/spoiler] 

The story was pretty good if short. And like many comments say its like an open world mmo without any players. thats what the side quests felt like too. No real variety area to area just the same 3 things over and over.

I never taught i've enjoyed that much after i saw Dragon Age II but hell yeah. This game is something. Probably best in Genre After 2010's.

Very rich story and also very rich background and world. You start the game as a Herald of Andraste. And you can choose between deity, order or fear. You can make deity focused empires or you can just pillage whole Thedas with the Power of yours or you can bring order to Thedas. Your way, your future. Love, Passion, Drama all in this story. 

Game play is not good as DAO ( Very First Game ) but its combination of two games. So its good and easy. There are very good logical combos in fighting and socializing is everything. So this is very good hack & slash and also pretty good role playing. You choose which way you wish to continue. So i warn you. This is not a just hack & slash or role playing game. Its political and war simulation. Your way will design end-game. There are different end games like other games. Also using Dragon Keep makes you pretty nostalgical. Even you can meet your son in DAO. 

Its also semi-open world. So pretty big area for discover. You can see pretty nugs or meet some high dragons. From little villages to big cities with shady alleys.

- Really nice graphics, Bioware did a really good job of optimising frostbite for an rpg.
- Story is really good; not quiet as good as Origins and II, but still better than alot of other games. The best part of the story itself is the Tresspasser dlc, its full of lore and world building.
- The characters are all really well written with their own inner turmoils
- Really good music, fits the game world really well, despite the similarity to a certain song from The Lord of the Rings
- The gameplay is nice and fluid, I feel like the character builds are better than other Dragon Age games despite the lack of customisation with skill points
- The crafting possibilities are really good as well, it's nice to be able to create from different kinds of materials each with their own benefit

Cons:
- Feels too much like an mmo; too many meaningless fetch quests and can be grindy.
- The over abundance of content can get very tedious especially of you're a completionist like myself
- Lack of skill building, it's all automatic

Story and Quests:
The story, as a whole, strictly follows the ""chosen one saves the world"" cliche, BUT most the individual missions of the main questline are good as standalone missions, as they're quite varied. Some will give you the hack'n'slash experience you're expecting, some will give you satisfying puzzles, some will make you sneak around and solve riddles.
The companion quests are good. I dare say they're much better than the ones in previous Dragon Age games, but as always, they're locked behind a ""friendship stat"", which you will have to grind through boring fetchquests.
The sidequests are mostly terrible, with only a handful of exceptions. They'll make you feel like you're grinding through a MMORPG.
The lore is great, on par with DA:O. It mainly delves into the fascinating history of the Elves, shining a new light on their civilisation and how it functioned before and after they met humans.

Gameplay:
I feel like this is the biggest downside of this game. The game will throw A LOT of stuff at you at once, which will inevitably make you feel overwhelmed. The first area after the intro is massive and if you don't stick to your quest markers, you will likely get bored wandering through the boring landscape fighting boring enemies, collecting boring materials, as you're going to be too low-level to enjoy any of the fun stuff. Same thing happens later, when you suddenly get access to a ton of new areas at once.
You'll definitely feel like you're playing an MMORPG with how much grinding and searching for materials the game is gonna put you through.

Combat:
The combat is very satisfying. Each class has a variety of methods of affecting the battlefield with its own micro management and they're all more-or-less balanced. There's also a lot of room for min-maxing, so if you really want to, with enough determination, you can make your team so strong you'll plow through most end-game bosses even on the hardest difficulties.

TL;DR: If you enjoy the concept of a single-player MMOPRG and don't mind grinding, if you're interested in the Dragon Age lore and if you have a lot of free time on your hands, definitely play Inquisition.

I do have to say that it's definitely a good idea to grind out side quests in order to make sure you're properly leveled up for each big story mission but the good thing about the side quests is that most of them are fairly fun and interesting and they aren't all just the same fetch quest over and over again. And even when they are a ""fetch quest"" they're at least not a complete copy of whatever other fetch quest you may have previously done.

For those who are experiencing problems like game won't launch, It's not a steam problem so no need to keep restarting the app. 

Solution:
(Assuming that your steam is already open and game already not launching)
1. Go to task manager.
2. Look for Origin.exe and OriginWebHelperService, End Task. (I always do it in this order)
3. Run the game.

if didn't work on first try, do it again. Hope this helps!

So about 6 hours of gameplay in I have to quit, and I'll list a handful of the main reasons for this.

1. Controls
So knowing these games and playing DA:O and DA2 I did a bit of research before starting if m+kb is viable, most people say it's not great and you are limited by skills even on m+kb. So I give it a small try for myself, see that the default controls are absolutely terrible for movement, the ui elements are very unresponsive compared to other games so within 20 mins of starting my first playthrough i went for a controller.

I played with a controller until eventually quitting 5 hours or so later. The control scheme is so nonsensical it is mind boggling how they decided to go with it. It really makes me think that the people in charge of the control scheme never actually played the game itself, either that or there is nobody at bioware who is testing and providing critcism on it. Not being able to use the dpad to navigate the majority of menus is a huge system shock that honestly i never got used to. 

It's very hard to describe everything wrong with this but after playing for 5 hours and being endlessly frustrated by pressing buttons that in my head seem to make sense for the menu that I'm shown, turning out to do something completely different played a huge part in me eventually just quitting the game.

2. Combat
Let's just be straight up honest here, the combat is not great, dragon age has never had good combat. In DA:O it was the tactics used during combat that made it fun and this was the same mostly in DA2 but DA2 made things simply look cooler but for the most part both games had reasonably fun combat due to the tactical element. 

DA:I dumbs down the tactical element of the game by reducing the complexity of 'tactics' that you are used to in the other 2 games to a single option to stop using skills at a % of mana/stamina, how frequently the character uses a certain ability and when they should stop using potions. that's it... the awesome part for me, about the previous two games was 'programming' my team mates and even my own character to function exactly how i wanted them to in combat. This was no longer possible in a remotely similar capacity.

Furthermore the tactical mode i was introduced to while using m+kb was no longer possible while using a gamepad, or if it was i had no idea how to access it, which is in itself another issue I have with the game. Simply your ability to control each individual character in combat is incredibly painful, it made me endlessly frustrated at how i could plan out in advance how i would like to approach a certain encounter but the limitation of the control scheme and the user interface made it so frustrating and difficult I found myself dying to relatively easy encounters literally because I could not control my characters, and this was playing on normal difficulty without friendly fire which is far removed from the settings I was used to in the previous games.

3. The open world
There is so much running around, this combined with a looting animation just made me extremely bored and made the game feel very repetitive, I've seen others say it in the reviews before but this combined with the 'go here and get this item' quests make me feel like im playing an MMO by myself and honestly, if i wanted to scratch that MMO itch, I would go and play an MMO with much better controls, UI and UX, with real people not AIs.

4. Motion sickness
I don't know what is wrong with this game but most games do not trigger my motion sickness, sadly this one does even while writing this I've got a headache and my stomach is still calming down from being turned from playing this game, it's something to do with the open world and the camera or something I'm not sure, but needless to say this is a big factor into me jumping ship.

There are more things I could list but I really just want to go move on to a different game now, maybe when I can find the patience to deal with the glaring issues with this game I will give it another go but for now, but at this moment in time I would rather watch a lore video on youtube than play the game to get the story. DA:I is the worst of the 3 dragon age games I have played.

I will say the game looks great though and I really hope I can find a way to play it in the future as i really like the universe and the characters.",1635697005,1635697005,False,35,17,0.582389116287231445,0,True,False,False

Commenters were right: that's about the time when the story became much more interesting. After that, the main part of the story is pretty engaging, and I enjoyed it enough to keep playing. I still feel that the characters are not nearly as engaging or unique as in past DA games. The open world is fun to explore, but some places (such as the Hissing Wastes) are so large and empty that exploring becomes extremely tedious. Overall, I enjoyed it enough to mark it ""Recommended,"" but with reservations. I don't feel that a game should take 20 hours of gameplay before it gets engaging, and there are enough boring parts that I didn't feel it warranted the time it took to play. Usually I like a game that takes a long time to complete, but this one just dragged on when I wasn't working on the main quest. 

I was really hopeful for this game, but it just... I just don't get into it. I know it's a bit unfair to compare it to the first Dragon Age, which was so good... but in comparison, this one just feels like a bunch of exploring and fetch quests. There is no real urgency, and the storyline is rather boring. 

On top of that, combat is so repetitive that it just gets old really fast. I did enjoy this game a bit; it looks pretty good and the characters are decent, but there's just not enough here to make it worth the time it takes. I bought in on a big sale, thankfully, so I don't feel like I wasted too much money. 

Still, I'm 20 hours in and it just feels rather dull. It's a shame, because you can tell a lot of work went into this game, and crafting the world. The Inquisition elements could be pretty interesting and a new mechanic, but it just doesn't work quite right.",1608257999,1635624312,True,0,0,0.62810903787612915,3,True,False,False

1) Unbalanced DLCs.
There are many crafting options and materials. You know how it is, you always try to have the best armor and weapons, and upgrade them. You try to have the best gear possible for your level, so you keep grinding. In the end, when you gather everything necessary, you craft the best of the best, and it is so satisfying.
Yet, the DLC that brings the part deeper than the Deep Roads throws you the most powerful gear ever. I got those equipments about the 40th hours of the game. In the last 80 hours, me and all my party members kept wearing the same armor and using the same weapons. 

No matter what armor I tried to craft, it never was able to surpass the one I was already using. All the crafting materials I collected was for nothing. It steals a huge amount of RPG elements from the game.

2) Art style
In Dragon Age: Origins, the Darkspawn horde had sinister looking Hurlock Generals and Mages. Hurlocks and Gemlocks had a very nice style. They ruined it and turned them into idiot and hollow looking monsters with shields that are triangular or something in Dragon Age 2. They also do that in this game. The whole world is filled with nonsense geometric structures, buildings with pointy stalagmite-looking extensions, sculptures with oversized triangular looking symbols... In DA2, it was just one city, so maybe you can say ""That's their culture"". But here whole Thedas uses this art style and in my opinion it looks really ugly and doesn't have the soul of the first game. It feels very distant. In both DAO and DAI you are at Ferelden, yet nothing looks or feels the same... 

Aaaanyway, these are my issues. Other than that, the game was fine. Not as good as Dragon Age: Origins, but it was fine. And definitely better than Dragon Age 2.",1635336483,1635336839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With the older games fresh in my mind, DA:I was a bit of a shock -- it has a completely different rhythm to it than the first two, and that initially made it very hard for me to like. But settling in, it has a lot of things going for it. The best way to describe DA:I is that it plays like a single-player MMO, but with the heartfelt character interactions and romances you'd expect of a Bioware RPG. 

Cons: There's a needless emphasis on collecting resources and crafting gear when the game throws high level weapons and armor at you at every step anyway--you don't have access to the ingredients to be able to surpass those stats til the end game, when the point is a bit moot. The sidequests and collectibles are largely grindy and unfun. 

Pros: The visuals are beautiful, the lore is deep, and characters are fantastic. I looked forward to returning to Skyhold after every main quest to view any new cutscenes with my companions. The romances are wonderful. I wish there were much more of this sort of narrative and character-based content, and much less of the ""run over there and grab that shard, now run over there and return that ring to that random elf."" At least the main quests introduced interesting mechanics.

All in all, I'd run through the main quest line again just to try out different world states and romances, but I'm never, ever collecting shards and closing rifts ever again.",1635283609,1635283609,True,35,2,0.756973683834075928,0,True,False,False

Emotion is muted and the story feels distant. 90% is merely collecting things over large clumsy to navigate maps. Most battles do not feel exciting either. It also pushes EA's Origin store down your throat.

Update: I followed other reviews and focused entirely on the main quest to finish the game. The main story is great and the graphics deliver.
Nevertheless, the gameplay is lacking because the AI is frustrating, the pathing counter-intuitive and bugs stand in the way of doing what you wanted to.



First: The negative mark is guaranteed for pushing Origin (the store, not the game) onto the player.
It prevents you from playing the game until the Origins store has loaded and (often suspiciously slowly) updated while infuriatingly ironically claiming the store is there ""for you to do what matters, playing games"".
By default the store overlays meta-gaming elements on top of the game and takes you out of the game sometimes. It kills the mood further and thus further UNDERMINES the work of the development team who already struggled with the immersion aspect of the game, making you feel like you're sitting on a chair wasting time playing (as opposed to feeling invested in or absorbed into the game, aka immersed).
In addition the store is marked by valid data collection concerns, the collection of which is in practice non-consensual (while forcing you to agree to it on paper) for EVERYONE who bought the game on Steam because at best, you are forced to install the store.
The player is forced to give up at least the email contact information, but also far far more data that has been controversial for years; such as the store snooping on whether you are chatting on gay forums or have any medical conditions or any other info it can find on your computer. Such spyware components may come and go with store updates depending on the legal battle and battle of reputation between the company and the playerbase, but the spyware accusations themselves - even if proven and won - still distract from base problem that players are no-nuance-less-than forced to install and even run the Origin store if they wish to access the game they already bought elsewhere which is a serious and a dishonest malpractice that bypasses fair competition between companies, takes away from the bought product's main value: the experience and forces the playerbase to give up their personal information.



As I write this second part of the review I played the game for over 60h.
In that time a game would normally overwhelm you with an engaging storyline. You'd fall in love with your party members. You'd have a sense of achievement in your character's attributes and skills. And you'd learn how to defeat a difficult battle.
How does Dragon Age: Inquisition compare?
Over 60h and the game still doesn't feel like it even started, because as a player I'm still doing chores for the game.

I'm placing characters on tasks that have one wall of text of disengaging story and after some minutes it will be done... you know like a mobile ""game"". I can spend points and enter a map which offers even more filler. Collect shards, ingredients, pieces of mosaic, ""discover"" areas, manage inventory, place camps, etc. All of these and more are and feel like having to go to a place and click on the shiny indicator.
Crafting feels like a chore, too.
Even battles feel more in the way of chores than exciting.

The story is spread too thin and has too much disposition that feels disconnected from your character. 

Even simply moving around is annoying as your party members have an uncanny ability to run into you or block your way every time you're not traveling along the same line.

For 60 hours of doing chores in REAL LIFE I could actually be paid enough to do something actually fun... or even buy multiple shorter fun games and actually enjoy my life.
Avoid this game. Try sweeping the floor, washing windows, collecting all the cigarettes of a dirty floor. It's just as ""fun"" as playing this game.

Let me explain. I did a Dragon Age Marathon from Origins and wanted to end it with Inquisition. I ended Origins and Dragon Age 2 in one go (You can look up my reviews for them) but this thing...This was agony to me. When I started the game, I was amused by the looks of it. It was looking great. The locations, effects equipment, etc. but the further I was going into the game the more hate I had for it. The locations are very big and if you want to clear it fully with all of the side quests and collectibles, it will take you around 1-2 hours. 1-2 hours for a friking location KARL. Then don't do collectibles you might say. Oh, my poor reader, there is a location with a quest where you need 126 shards to open the doos and complete the location. Plus, you need to do collectibles and location clearing because you need the influence to open new locations because without the influence you can suck a big fat dice. Instead of doing a linear story, they made a mess of locations where you little by little go through the main thing, forgetting what was in the beginning. The story itself is nothing special and I would call it a copy-paste of Origins. You need to gather different factions into an alliance to defeat a villain with a dragon. Sounds familiar, right? 

The Descent DLC was a good one with a nice story and a beautiful location

- Horrible companion AI involves them sitting and spinning, doing nothing useful

- Orders for companions cannot be queued

- The tactics system from DA 1 / 2 has been removed

- Even when pausing and going into the half-baked tactical mode, companions will abandon your orders to them half the time and do something random instaed

- Building a party / giving companions skills involves a lot of hit or miss troubleshooting of what the dumpster fire AI can actually manage to use reasonably well, rather than what might be fun or interesting

One of the big weaknesses of DAI is how it was basically set up like an MMO in terms of map design and combat mechanics. Gone are the days of grueling tactical combat like in DAO, but it's also less dramatic than DA2. Some would say it strikes a good middle, and maybe it does in terms of the speed and flow of encounters, but they dropped the ball on the other essential part of combat: diverse and dynamic abilities. Yeah, it plays exactly like an MMO now- the devs streamlined all the perk trees (the most unforgivable being the mere 4-5 generic magic trees mages get, instead of schools you get elements? Yayy..) and so instead of really big braining your way through most things, it's more of a battle of keystrokes than anything.
That's not to say that the combat is terrible. It really isn't. But it definitely had more potential than was actually provided.

Like all DA games the strongpoint is the story and dialogue, and for the most part, it does excel at telling a lovely little story. It starts off on a great opening, and also ends on one, and crescendos into a grand finale in the DLC campaign, Trespasser. But there is a middle point between start and finish, and that middle isn't as pretty.

Thankfully, one of the things they still got great was your dear companions, as well as (most of) your non-playable allies. A looot of returning characters in this game, and plenty of news ones. They are diverse, and while the dialogue wheel doesn't have the depth or number of dialogue options that Origins gave you, you can still forge meaningful relationships with them. Ironically, all the main quest antagonists are honestly lame. They're one dimensional, typical arrogant jackasses with a bloodlust and power hunger. Seen it all before. It is, however, worth tolerating these walking disappointments in order to reach Trespasser, which introduces two new antagonist forces, and they are very much worth the wait.

A personal issue with Inquisition is how much of a slogging chore it is to get through any content that isn't main quest or companion quest stuff. And of course, as people are quick to point out, side quests and extra quests are indeed unnecessary fluff. But that's not the point. The point is that most of them -no, almost all of them- just suck. It's really unfortunate, it's a stark contrast to Origins and even 2, which did have a lot of fascinating side quests and interesting stuff to discover.

Is it all really worth it? If you're too attached to how the earlier titles play out, then it might not be for you and that's 100% understandable. I'm not sure I would recommend Inquisition to every DA fan anyway.

If you know what those are, you know I've been around for awhile now and I can tell you, I've played my share of RPGs.

I tried to like Inquisition, but the choice of companions in this game is abysmal. When the game started, I thought Varric was so cliche for the genre. After the other rogues were introduced though, Varric was far and away the best choice for me. Cole and Sera are just downright annoying. I find most of the companions annoying. Blackwall, Solas, and Cassandra are the only one's I liked. Vivienne was okay. Iron Bull might have been decent, but I was triggered every time I heard, ""I know, right"".

The game also suffers from the politically correct agenda as many games, movies, and shows do these days. Story, role, and immersion take a back seat to this agenda as EA/Bioware love to shove that agenda in your face. I may be getting old, but I've always loved a good fantasy book or movie, and I miss the days when the story was the focus. Companies and Corps these days just want to pander to whatever the trend of the day is, trying to put on a good face as if they really care about anything but profit. So the game and story suffer for it.

combat is fun, easy to customize your character with item that can reset your skill tree so you can min max your skill depending on the enemy weakness, you can look at it using tactical mode, this make the combat quite fun.

the downside is useless low level loot in endgame dungeon and vice versa, loot that are too high level on early game. also meaningless side quest where you just follow your minimap without even needing to understand what the side quest is all about, and there are so many of this, i usually do them when tired so can play mindlessly along with close the rift quest.

after playing for 112 hours i realized this game is a train wreck in how graphically taxing it is on my computer, glitches, game play isn't bad, but dialogue bugs out, the game freezes when trying to go to new locations, audio cracks where the audio sounds broken and where it will some times let out a loud squeal, 

my computer initially didn't have any problems until after i started playing, i had my anti virus and super anti spyware run scans every day trying to find whatever it was that was effecting my computer and it couldn't find anything, my computer started to have freezing fits on start up, i thought after removing it and reinstalling a program when my computer relaxed i found the problem nope, dragon age inquisition just got worse after reinstalling it.

pros - occasionally getting 60 fps during game play and a playable 20 to 40 base fps,
game was playable for the first week

Cons - sound cracks, glitches, t poses, dialogue lag, constant freezing during travelling, making programs not respond after exiting the game having to restart the computer to be able to do anything, i had to reinstall skyrim twice after getting this game made the game have very slow loading screens after getting dragon age inquisition, all my games got laggier too

this game is not worth it unless you have an amazingly strong computer, mine was doing acceptionally well until i downloaded this hell spawn of a game, i thought ok once i beat this game i'll remove it, but with how my computer lost some of its response time because of this game, i am never going to redownload it or play it again, its a vampire on your computer, incredibly draining of resources,

I do wish they'd have ""traded"" time used making this a more open world game for more dialogue and interactions between the characters instead.

I barely remember my DAO playthrough but I remember being invested in those characters as well. I'm still invested in the companions here, but there doesn't seem to be quite as much substance and/or there are so many side quests due to the open world genre that I seem to have exhausted most of their dialogue already. It feels lonely walking around with a silent team.

Side quests were ordinary at best, but the main story proved out to be far better than I expected it to be. But still I would rate this game higher than Skyrim any-day. 

The reason for this change of opinion is mainly the Trespasser DLC. That DLC is gem of a story. The astonishing music which plays in the background throughout the whole play-through, is what the main-game lacked---10/10 for the Trespasser's music score.

High-dragon boss fights on High difficulty is the one of the most pleasing gameplay you could ever ask for. Those Dragon fights alone are worth the price of this game. Even, if you don't want to spend too much time on doing the side activities, you could always have fun and challenging time killing the rarest and most dangerous breed of its time.

After playing chunks of boring quests, fighting millions of enemies (humies, elves, quns, demons, dragons, dwarfs, spirits, giants, spiders, ghouls), I would still say, it's one of the most exciting game role-playing-game out there. Not a big fan of the MMOs and how their combat are normally designed, but I truly loved the turn-based combat of this game.

4 known bugs or at lest i've seen a lot.
and one lesser 1
1 you can't click on profiles or anything, so you can't go into the inv to upgrade your team.
to fix you reload a save, or quit to the main menu, or worse case the game will crash.

2nd ai getting bugged into walls and the ground a reloading of the save fixs it, but in rare cases fully quitting the game will fix it

3rd would be things still on the map but you've done that said thing, quitting the game fix's it but it can still piss ya off 

4th the game will always try to install packs even tho they've been installed i've looked all around for fix's even mess with the files to see what was missing, none fix it, as steam thinks it's missing said files.
 
and the lesser one is crash's i've seen about 12 crash's in my time playing this game, mostly when ever the menu bug happens. 


i like the fade and the story, and some of the points you'll need to play the 1st two games on to get,
but over all it was not bad, i think the worse bit i didn't like was waiting for tasks to be done, 
a few took real life days to get done.

all your team has some good bits here and there, but somethings you pick can and will brake your team,
some of can't be fixed later on.

TLDR because this review is going to have some baggage: 4 (5 on a good day)/10. Too much bloat, not enough meaningful content, likes to waste your time, but has some golden moments, though they're too few and far in between. 

I'm biased towards this game. I beat this game three separate times on PS4 (Once in 2015, twice in 2016), and I've beaten it again on Steam (2021). I've convinced 5 friends and one ex girlfriend to play this game/continue their dropped playthroughs to completion. Fuck dude, I practically had a sales pitch, something along the lines of ""This game's just filled to brim with these incredible characters and moments, and just WAIT until you see the REAL ending of the game!"" Up until this year, I considered this game to be one of my favorites. Scenes from my playthroughs lived on in my head. When I tell you that I loved this game, I LOVED this game. 

Then I played through it again this year. Summer hit, I had just read ""The Lies of Locke Lamora"" (10/10 book, buy it) and played ""Masquerada: Songs and Shadows"" (10/10 game, buy it), and I was looking for something to keep scratching that ""Deep Medieval/Renaissance Fantasy"" itch. I saw that Dragon Age: Inquisition was 5 bucks on Steam and immediately purchased it, no hesitation. 

Cue an 100 hour playthrough on the hardest difficulty, 30 of which I actually enjoyed. Let's get the positives out of the way first. 

The soundtrack of this game, especially in the Trespasser DLC, is exceptional. From the opening theme, to the dragon themes, to the fucking Adamant theme; this soundtrack is filled to the brim with bangers. No complaints here. 

Second, the main character and the supporting cast are good... BUT if this was a book or a movie, the MC would be a Mary sue/Gary stu. You can choose a background for your MC but it doesn't really put you in the world like it does in DA Origins. It boils down to sometimes being able to use your background as a dialogue option, even then it's kind of weak. What helps flesh them out a bit more is the voice acting, which is done exceptionally well on all sides. The supporting cast are good, some clearly had more thought than others. They either have a big, massive, bombastic personality (Sera, Iron Bull, Dorian, Varric), or they're a combination of bland and something else (Cassandra = Bland + Hotheaded, Blackwall = Bland + Noble, Cole = Bland + Weird, Solas = Bland + Elf) oh yea, Vivienne is in the game too but she's just a bitch the whole time. Regardless, the party members, and the other supporting cast (Josie, Leliana, Cullen, etc.) get the job done, but it feels like it was cut short. 

Every character has a three step guide to liking the inquisitor. 
1. I don't trust you/I don't like you/People say you're the Herald of Andraste!
2. (After completing their personal quest) You know what? You're not so bad Inquisitor, thank you. 
3. (After progressing to the late game story) You're my best friend and I would literally die for you. (Option 4 if you choose to romance them)

It's inorganic. After every single story arc you're sprinting up to them at home base to see if they have anything new to say to you and most of the time they'll comment on what just happened in the story, lackadaisically at that. At some point they'll ask you to do a quest relating to their character growth and only a few of them are actually good. After you've helped them out and gotten your ""best friends forever"" polaroids taken, they don't say anything else to you until the grand finale (Trespasser). 

Romance in this game is the same, I romanced Iron Bull, Cassandra, Sera, and Josephine. Same shit, literally. You like me?? to You like me!! to ;*. You have to complete a courtship quest for them, and if you're (un)lucky, you might get a hollow, paper-mache sex scene. After you reach the figurative, and sometimes literal, climax of the romance, they greet you with sweet nothingness in the hub world. All of these issues are compounded by the facial animation not aging well at all. Let me tell you buddy, it's BRUTAL. But hey, the ambient conversation the party has while you explore the world is pretty cool. 

Here's where we get into the really egregious stuff. The story is good, but it's a small oasis in a vast desert of tedium. Actual story progression happens with special quests that are often incredibly well written and memorable. The problem is, you have to unlock them by gaining Power, which you get through following the main objectives of every map, completing side quests, companion quests, closing rifts, doing war table stuff, etc. That all sounds interesting but in reality, they're all either ""Go here and get this"" or ""go here and kill this"". All games do that, but this one doesn't add anything to spice it up. And war table objectives are barely worth mentioning. You click on it and then wait anywhere between 3 minutes to 36 hours for it to be completed. Riveting gameplay. 

Maps suck lol. Most of them are limited open world areas with nothing interesting to do in them. A few of them are linear open world, and they're alright but still feel empty. It's all just ""Grab this, fight this, pick this up"". It gets old insanely quickly. They have mounts in this game but they're fucking useless. Ride quickly across the landscape! But miss everything you have to pick up to restock your potions and craft your weapons and armors. Gold feels like it's hard to come by for most of the game and everything feels a bit too pricey until late game, at which point gold can be used to just buy any ingredients you need. 

Combat. Sucks. So. Much. It feels like MMO combat. You have the normal attack which keeps minimal pressure on enemies and you pair it with skills you unlock during the game that use up stamina/mana. It looks flashy, but after the 30th encounter it just becomes grating. Combat never evolves. I've played this game on easy, medium, and nightmare, and enemies have been hit sponges on all three right up until the end credits. Tactical mode is handy until you realize that there isn't much for you to micromanage in fights. Every fight is trivialized by equipping your party with the ""Jar of Bees"". Oh, and this one's really fun, party members will often just stand in place during a fight and do nothing, and/or won't use the move you tell them to use. Fuck the combat in this game, it's a waste of your time. 

Everything else in this game, the two throwaway DLC's (Hakkon/Descent), the crafting, Trials, the ""base-building"", recruiting, upgrading, whatever the fuck else I missed isn't even worth mentioning due to it's samey-ness and blandness. 

But, but, but ,but... The final DLC, the grand finale of the story, Trespasser, did live up to my expectations again. It doesn't overstay its welcome and it feels more focused than the rest of the game. Through playing it, I realized it was the perfect last impression. After 5 years, I didn't remember the taxing combat and the empty environments, I remembered the fun interactions I had with likable characters, romancing Josephine, well written scenes, romancing Josephine, cinematic story arcs, romancing Josephine, and Trespasser. I also think I've played this game to death. Chances are, I'll probably play DA4 to death too. Take from that what you will. 

Oh, yea, sitting in judgement is cool too.

So, Dragon Age: Inquisition (DAI for close friends), is an RPG with multiple open regions. Much has been said about this game, not least because it is from Bioware whose reputation has steadily declined in recent years.
I will share my opinion with you while remaining as objective as possible.

    [*][b]Story & Characters :[/b] Honestly, the story is neither good nor epic. It sits somewhere in between and it’s already pretty good when you see what’s coming out. The biggest criticism that has been made is that you are the ""hero"" from the start. Certainly, but our character will have to deserve this title by his actions so I don't see where the problem is since there is an evolution of your character. Your companions are a real pleasure. We feel the effort made to keep each of them in memory (little thought to Varric and Cassandra). Talking to them between each quest really helps develop your relationships and leads to incredible scenes (spoiler : [spoiler]poker night[/spoiler]). You can of course start a romance, hate them, push them to leave you permanently etc... Nothing to complain about on this side.

    [*][b]Visually :[/b] Frostbite is arguably unloved by a lot of players, it was painful for the developers to use it but the result is there and it works. The game is beautiful and it is sometimes difficult to say that it was released in 2014.

[*][b]OST :[/b] Excellent. On the one hand we have great ambient sounds which confer an identity specific to each place, on the other hand the OST is really well done, you probably gonna have some titles in your head for a while. I don't see what to add and I refrain from posting links to certain scenes where the music really carries the story.

[*][b]Gameplay :[/b] You have a whole bunch of possible builds to try, you will have fun and diversity even if a lot of (bashing) fights are similar. That was for the combat part, now the exploration. Tons of people are complaining because there is too much things to do when you're exploring, I don't think it's a bad point since everybody is looking for something different. You have the possibility to explore and do each quest even the Fedex ones, does this mean you need to do it ? Ofc no. I almost forgot to speak about the crafting system, nicely done : collect plants, minerals, specific items on enemies and you can craft weapons/armors adapted to the situation/incoming boss.

    [*][b]Final Boss (main story) :[/b] A big joke. I destroyed him even in Nightmare difficulty. The fight is forgettable because the enemy is sorely lacking in charisma, fortunately the following cutscene makes it possible to raise the level.

    [*][b]Filler quests : [/b] Way too many.

    [*][b]Difficulty :[/b] As I said for the final boss, there is a lack of difficulty. Don't get me wrong, the game can be hard, but it mostly depends of your class (and therefore the composition of your group) and your equipment. Playing a warrior who just waves his ax has nothing to do with the gameplay of an assassin where you have to really be mobile (which is a good point).

[h3]Conclusion :[/h3]
Players constantly compare it to DAO, no doubt out of nostalgia. DAO is old and stuffed with unnecessary skills, I'm not sure talking badly about the game as you can only equip 8 skills at a time is very reasonable.
Those who say the game is big and empty… big yes, empty ? Certainly not. This game offers a whole new dimension to the universe of Dragon Age : the diversity of its regions which help to enrich the lore. In Origins, the environments were counted on one hand, there is a real attention to detail with information to be gleaned from right to left. A little advice for those who complain that the game is too big : stop going everywhere. If you don't like exploring, learning lore, or even completing area quests, why do you do it since it's not your thing ? Just do the main quest point A -> point B it will save you a lot of suffering.

I recommend this game just for the story it has to tell you and its iconic characters, you will have a good time.",1621604068,1632224895,True,0,0,0.479680240154266357,0,True,False,False

Fighting monsters feels like a chore. If you fought one, you've fought them all. There grunts and there are bosses and if the story didn't tell you, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. There are no varieties to monster tactics. The most engaging fight is with a guy with a shield that requires you to flank it. But everyone else can just be push aside with enough damage. No one has any unique attacks that make you go wow, now that's an intresting monster. They all just have basic swipes and anything that's ranged just fires bolts at you.
I wish rifts/breaches were more intresting. They are all sealed the exact same way. You encounter one, fight monsters, fight wave number two, then press seal. No intresting interactions, same monsters all the time, always two waves, then press a button to seal it. Just wander around and bump into a random rift and seal it. If you're underleveled, tough luck, come back later. You'll get killed.
The inventory system is god awful. There are way too many menus and you have to learn how to navigate the many, many menus just to check what you have equipped at the time, then compare it to what you have in your inventory. I'll try scrolling through my item list and accidentally swap characters instead, which causes the inventory to ""smart sort"" and causes me to lose track of my item.
Enemies drop piles upon piles of useless RPG crap. You'll eventually find some cool stuff, but you'll have to dig through 80% crap that clogs up your inventory and forces you to go back to Haven to sell it all. If you're lucky. If you're in a story locked zone, you'll have to spend time sorting what crap you want to throw out.
Item/ability descriptions are incredibly vague. You have to look up everything on the wiki if you want to be sure you are doing what you want to.
Equipment upgrades are their own items but you can't equip them without using a merchant, which is a pain in the butt, considering how much micromanaging this game requires you to do.
It's fairly difficult to go without a party, in two ways. The companions show up as part of the story vs you stumbling upon them. They sort of show up and give you the option to recruit them, which is nice I guess, but feels odd. And also even if you were to reject them, the enemies will quickly overwhelm you.
I'll still play it and see if it gets intresting. It certainly does scratch a nostolgic itch, but fighting the inventory system and the repetitive sealing of rifts is quite annoying.",1632092616,1632200658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me first say that I tried to play the first couple of Dragon Age games and I was disappointed.  They were far too linear with frequent 'bottlenecks' that had no real way of circumventing (not very RPG like in the modern age).  However I'm glad to say that Dragon Age - Inquisition was much more open and had a satisfying choice of options when faced with an obstacle.  Furthermore the character acting is exceptional and the background stories of the characters are compelling.  In many ways this game seems to have learnt from Skyrim that you need to give multiple choices and an open world to truly engross the RPG player.  It isn't quite as 'open' as Skyrim and frequently you are annoyed by seeing a set of rocks that for some strange reason you can't scale no matter what you do (when you really should be able to).  Also I didn't like the level cap of 27 which made further exploration of the rich and colourful world seem less motivating once you had reached that cap level.  NPCs do provide you with some interesting conversations and you do have choices to make which can affect your approval rating with various people (including your cohorts) dependent upon both your choice of words and choice of actions.  I really liked the somewhat ludicrous diversion of the 'posh dance ball' where you needed to mind your 'p's and q's' in addition there are many humorous moments in the game which isn't always the case in some of the 'stiff and starchy' RPGs which take themselves too seriously.  All in all this is one of the best RPGs I've played (and I've played many old style RPGs like Baldur's Gate/Torment/Icewind Dale as well as Neverwinter Nights, Elder Scrolls series (not the MMO game - it's rubbish!) plus Fallout and Deus Ex series.  I eagerly await the next instalment due out in 2022 or 2023.

It may have been the first RPG in which I actually felt the role playing aspect to be compelling. I played through Dragon Age 2 and was a disappointed with how empty and repetitive the landscape was and how shallow many (all, in my experience) of the side quests were, but if I just didn't bother with any of them and focused on the story quest, I found it to be pretty enjoyable.

The vast majority of the content in Dragon Age: Inquisition that I have experienced resembles the boring, shallow side quests from dragon age 2. The content landscape is a vast sea of blandness. The worst part of it is that progressing the main quest actually depends on you to do them to progress.

*******************
Minor spoilers below
*******************
The straw that broke the camel's back for me is as follows:

After tracking down the leader of a large group of mercenaries based in an old castle deep in the forest, I was dismayed to find that the fights therein consisted of a few encounters, all the same, of a single boilerplate two-handed maul-wielding mercenary that I had seen several times elsewhere in the zone. The leader was yet another one of the same enemy with nothing remarkable about him, including his name: ""Mercenary Leader""

After defeating ""Mercenary Leader,"" I found some low-effort, hamfistedly-written note from another NPC that was giving him orders that laid out in plain English why the mercenaries were there, who was paying them, and where their employer could be found in a text box popup, which I had found to be an overused tool through most of the content I played thus far.

What could have been a dramatic and compelling experience was boiled down to its blandest, most basic possible implementation.

*******************
End Spoilers
*******************

What impressed me about the previous games is how the writers managed to upend my expectations so many times. So far, there is nearly nothing about this game that resembles its predecessors apart from elements of the world, references to parts of the previous games, and inclusions of some of the characters.

The soul of the first game is completely absent. It has all of the bad parts of MMO's of its time and none of the good ones. I say this as someone who played MMO's extensively growing up.

I will probably keep playing a little bit to see if I can figure out how to extract the fun from this experience and report back if I can find a way like I did for DA2, but don't hold your breath.",1632065380,1632066011,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Boring fights. The first RPG were I just switch to the easiest mode to get over the fights ASAP. The tactic mode is a joke. Enemies have often just an endless amount of HP and the fights take ages. What you exactly do does not matter in the most cases.
- Annoying maps with many hills, I was so many hours just running around to find the paths up to the hill.
- Many simple fetch or kill quests as fillers.
- Even more simplified character system than in previous Dragon Ages. The computer allocates even attribute values for you.
- XP-System, if you don't go to the right places at the right time, you get basically no experience. You get no experience for monsters which are 3 levels below your own level. However, in some later areas the monsters level with you. In my walkthrough I just skipped whole maps because I entered them too late.
- The menue: It is console friendly. I give it that. But for a PC user it could be much more user friendly and give a better overview. For example the inventory shows always very few items.

Conclusion:
I don't want to say it's a bad game but the gameplay just kills it for me. Storywise it is ok but not as good as Dragon Age Inquisition. I finished this year Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age II and Dragon Age Inquisition. So if you are a  RPG fan and didn't play Dragon Age Origins - please do it.

Also another title I've bought on multiple platforms because its simply worth it. Dragon Age games have no shortage of replay value and new experiences to make multiple playthroughs unique and interesting. Each playthrough can have many different choices changing some major story arcs throughout the game. It may not be as lore filled or deep of a story as Dragon Age Origins, but it is pretty darn close with major plot twists throughout the story and especially in the DLC. As far as the DLC goes, they are some of the best entries in the series. Overall an amazing title and worth the play, you can find this game often on sale during annual Steam sales.

Maybe closer to 7/10 when it first came out, but the DLC that came later was fairly strong (or at least interesting for the lore). The game has a big world to explore and a lot of story to follow, but ultimately it feels a bit... dead, I guess? Like there are a lot of NPCs you'll pass in towns with whom you can't interact, and plenty of buildings around that you cannot enter. The concept of getting your own base of operations and building it up was an interesting one, but honestly the best part of the story happens in the first third of the game. The end boss fight was rather anticlimactic. The party members are interesting overall, but a few are really lackluster. But because each party member is locked into a particular specialization, you're basically forced to use them if you like their abilities, because none of the other members will get the same stuff. The party banter is probably one of the best aspects the game; mixing up your party composition just to hear the different conversations between the members is highly recommended.

If you never played the prequels, probably closer to a 6/10. You'll lack an understanding of the background story, a lot of cameos with characters from the previous games won't hold any emotional appeal, and the appeal of the lore will fall a bit flatter. The best part of the game, IMO, is seeing the culmination of the actions and decisions from the previous two games. Without that it's basically just another open world fantasy game. Pretty graphics and a plot with lots of political intrigue, so it's above average, but nowhere near as impressive as, say, modded Skyrim or The Witcher 3.

How is the story?

Eh... the first third of the game does a good job with the plot. And some of the big plot events are good too. But the finale of the base game is pretty weak, and the side quests are really boring (outside of the companion quests, which were good). I did like the DLC that takes place a couple years after the end of the game though; even if you never played the first two games, it gives you a nice farewell to the crew of the third and you get to see the outcome of a lot of your choices.

Is it boring ? How long is the play hours?

""Tedious"" is the word that comes to mind after a while. It's a game full of collectibles, and while you're encouraged to go after all of them, frequently the reward doesn't justify the time required. If you're just doing the story and the main sidequests (companion quests), I'd estimate 50-60 hours to beat it. If you go after a lot of the optional stuff (for example, there's one entire zone that isn't even required to beat the game), probably closer to 90 hours. If you're a completionist/masochist and need everything, 140-150 hours. And then add another 6-12 hours for each of the three DLC (and the final one has some replayability).

Hours to dollars, it's a great value. How many of those hours are fun is a bit tougher to say, but it's still worth it if you're looking for a game to keep your entertained for a while.",1631882733,1631882733,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Loots can gets stuck in the ceiling or falls out of bounds. 
Bugged quest objectives and unable to finish it.
Broken Physics. (characters getting launched up in the air for no reason)
Broken Cutscenes. (characters clipping through objects and some texture bugs)
Broken NPCs. (broken animations and unable to interact)
Game Crashes and can corrupt save file. (happened once)

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this game is the fact that your character can form legitimate relationships (friendship and romantic) with others in the game. This isn't an ""oh, we're in a relationship *insert 1 of 3 dialogue cycle options.*"" The relationships you build with characters is fully-fledged, making the gameplay unique and personal.

I respect BioWare's attempt to make something different from DAO and DA2 while keeping a lot of really good and important aspects of the franchise. 

The great:
- The story and lore: We go so much deeper into the world lore than ever before.
- Companions: Great cast of amazing characters.
- Varied romance options.
- The graphics are a huge improvement from the previous games.
- A lot more open exploration than before, with bigger and more detailed locations. The world of Thedas is amazing, and here we get to really feel its beauty and scale.
- Meeting and talking to ""Lady M"" was a huge highlight in all of my gaming history.

The bad:
- Most of the optional open world side quests are very bland.
- Resources collection.
- I did not enjoy the crafting that much, mainly because of the above.
- Main plot is very predictable, but being familiar with some of the main characters definitely made it a lot more enjoyable.
- No more free healing when outside the battle.
- Combat in DA2 felt a LOT better.
- I want to see a LOT more of Orlais cities.

Overall: If you have played previous games, this one is a must. If you heard that DAO is the best one and others aren't nearly as good, that may still be the case, but this game absolutely deserves your attention.",1631371948,1631371948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I fell in love with its world and characters a long time ago, and when first seeing Dragon Age: Inquisition in trailers, I was so excited to get my hands on the game. The series has always had a robust combat system mixed with a rich story set in high fantasy. Things in Origins were epic in scale while events that took place in Dragon Age II may have been more drawn out, but ultimately started and set up an even bigger threat to the world of Thedas. Finally, in Inquisition, we get to see what has and will transpire.

Players take on the role of “The Inquisitor”, known in some circles as “The Herald of Andraste.” The player was the lone survivor of a massive magical explosion that killed numerous people, including a major leader of the Chantry. Because of this, the Fade is now leaking into the living world in certain areas of the continent. The Inquisitor is the only one that has the power to close the rifts and banish the demons that come out them for good. They join up with a group of people set out to do just that, and, in turn, form the Inquisition.

The game focuses on building up the Inquisition with both agents and influence, all of which is done through the actions and decisions the player makes. There are two scales to Inquisition: taking on quests and fighting enemies, and planning out what the army of the Inquisition will do next. Both are massive in scope and will keep players busy for hours on end.

Unlike the first two games, Inquisition is a more open world form. Players will choose where they want to go and then traverse a large map full of open terrain. While here, they can explore and take on quests they find throughout their expedition. All of these quests will offer up experience points for their characters, along with power which is a sort of currency used to do things in the Inquisition management.

Combat is fast, much like Dragon Age II. Depending on the class and weapons the character uses, the play style is completely different. A dual dagger rogue will utilize stealth and fast striking techniques while keeping out of the enemy’s attack range, while a warrior with a sword and shield will want to attract the enemies to them to keep the damage from going to their weaker party members. Strategy plays a large part in Inquisition. Delegating what party members should do and where to go is very important.

The healing is a bit different in Inquisition. Mages no longer have a healing ability. They now rely on protective auras to shield their party from attacks, and health is no longer restored after each battle. Players must utilize healing potions, and must go back to their camps for more when they run out. It makes planning for battle more of a challenge and knowing when to continue on and when to go back to a camp is something the player must think carefully on. Luckily, players can fast travel at any time out of battle, and exploring more of an area will unlock fast travel points and new areas to set up camps.

The quests are varied, and the multiple areas to explore and navigate are massive. The scale to the entire game is huge, rivaling even the largest of open world games. The other great thing is, unlike Dragon Age II, that areas are varied and feel much more alive. We no longer run though the exact same marketplace in Kirkwall, now we are running through the entire countryside of The Hinterlands and other zones, exploring caves, bandit camps and all sort of mystery places.

The massive size of the game doesn’t just pertain to the areas and quests; it is also apparent in the crafting system. There is a full on crafting system, much like Skyrim, where players can find schematics for new weapons and armor, as well as modify their equipment to gain extra stats. It all depended on what modifications is used and what type of materials is used to craft a new piece of armor. So, using bear hide to make coat may give it cold resistance, while using wolf hide may give it fire resistance. Every piece of armor and each weapon looks different from one modification to the next.

Dragon Age: Inquisition is an amazing game. There really is something special about it. I know a lot of people were down on Dragon Age II, but this game redeems every issue you may have had with the last game. The open areas of Thedas never looked better, the story is one of epic scale and done with some fantastic characters, the combat is easy to pick up and challenging to master and the sheer amount of things to do and see is beyond massive. The voice talent is very well done, and the musical score is superb. 

BioWare has said this is the game they always wanted to make, and for me, it’s the best game they have ever made. RPG fans shouldn’t think twice about picking this up, and people looking for a fantasy setting full of things to explore and do should look no further.",1631320649,1631320649,True,19,1,0.654536962509155273,0,True,False,False

Just like Origins, I remember playing Inquisition when it first released and hating it. It was for a second evaluation of Inquisition that I decided to replay all three Dragon Age games this past month, and I'm very happy to say that it was worthwhile, and I'm extremely, extremely excited for Dragon Age 4.

I'll start with what I think is the most important caveat: if you're OCD about completing side content, like I am, make the commitment to stick with Inquisition throughout the first full area. The Hinterlands are terrible, and honestly one of the worst parts of the game. It lends the impression that Inquisition is a lifeless, soulless hunk of fetch quests and blase combat. It's not. Inquisition has some of the best writing in the entire trilogy, and the best cast to boot, but it is, regretfully, one of those games that only really gets going around the twenty hour mark.

There are many things that saw improvements from II, but still fall short of Origins' high standard. The combat is the most pertinent of these; far better than the mindless auto-attack masher of II, you at least have an arsenal of flashy and handy moves to pump your DPS in satisfying ways, but it still, sadly, doesn't come anywhere near Origins' actual requirement for even marginal tactical thinking. 

Among the things that are a dip even below II, the UI is one of the biggest, in my mind. Menus are clunky and don't give you access to nearly enough slots for the amount of space they have available. I know it seems like a nitpick, but this doesn't even feel basic; it feels downright amateurish, like a first draft of a primary school paper. 

Inquisition's biggest fault is how it paces itself. If you want to get to the best part of the game, the main story and companion interactions, you will have to grind through a fat chunk of side filler, and if you're like me and hate seeing unticked boxes, you'll be grinding through much, much more side filler. It's boring, adds only the slightest hint of satisfaction, and feels like you're dumping time into a garbage can. I sincerely hope Dragon Age 4 is smaller in scope with its areas, because Inquisition reaches too far.

What makes it worthwhile, though, are the characters. I've never seen a RPG series so committed to providing a consistent world state over multiple games. There are slip ups and retcons, to be sure, but the attempts Inquisition makes to really carry over choices and consequences from Origins and II is above commendable; it's truly special. Seeing people that swung from friend to rival to brother in the first two games showing their faces is so endlessly endearing, because you get to see their arcs continue, swinging on the trajectory prior heroes put them on before being brought under your influence, for better or ill. 

The small and quiet scenes are the best parts of Inquisition. Playing chess with your general, playing poker with your party members, playing pranks on your home base to lighten the mood. The time Inquisition lets itself breathe while still remembering to tell its story let slip moments of true vision. I loved every member of the party; there was not a single weak link, which is something I very rarely see in RPGs. As the game drew to a close, I found myself clinging for any reason to keep going, which is always, in my mind, a sign of a compelling story.

Unquestionably one of the premier fantasy RPGs of the last generation, and something I'm hoping BioWare can top in this generation. Not quite as concise or consistently excellent as Origins, but bold, daring, and accomplishes things I appreciate far more.

I loved it.

I originally bought in PS4. Played a bit. But the first map just feel like an MMORPG. Large map, fetch quests. But EMPTY.
I don't feel the stake of Dragon Age 1 anymore, nor the more limited but linear storyline in Dragon Age 2. I just feel an empty vessel playing an MMORPG in an empty world. That was 2-3 years ago.

My friends play the multiplayer so they invited me to play again. That's why I purchased it on steam again. I was very busy so didn't manage to play with them. I heard it's getting better after the first map, so I tried again. But still, I can't help but feel extremely boring. I was a Bioware fan but I must say I don't love their writing anymore. I'm just not hooked.

Game mechanics feels like MMORPG. Even dragon age 2 was doing a much better job. At least I could enjoy the combat. Here I feel like I am hitting air all the time. Story is shallow, characters are bland. The only person I care is probably Liliana. Besides Liliana and Cassandra none of the characters are memorable. Even Varric feels like a soulless NPC.

I read somewhere that this game was originally designed to be an MMO and from the first moments of the campaign, it really made sense. Prepare to endlessly grind for meaningless goals such as ""power"" or ""influence"", accumulated by the most bland and boring fetch quests, which make up for 80% of the game's total quests. 

This game really screams ""new era Ubisoft"" and the open world plague that comes with it.

In 45 hours I am maybe halfway through my first run (judging by the soundtrack listing anyway) so it's no light venture even compared with Origins or DA2.

For it must be said that there's very little I prefer in it to the previous games. The plotline is a little more generic, contrived and disparate; the characters are not half as endearing (45 hours and I've still not warmed to any of the romance options); and gameplay itself is rather more irritating, requiring constant mouse-pressing for basic attacks, and a search-ray that makes annoying dinging noises. Oh, and somehow the character designs, especially that of the player character, are a step down from DA2 despite obvious attempts at making them highly realistic.

There is an epic quality to the game which makes up for its failures. Certainly it's a cheesy sort of epic, but the right side of cheesy. The landscapes are just glorious, and I am glad to wander them for the hours required by certain quests. The main redeeming feature is the soundtrack, which I have listened to on repeat for days now, and which has evoked the most emotion of anything during key moments of the game.

In Origins it was like every corner had something interesting in it, and you could feel the settlements/towns were living. In the second game the map was much smaller, but it was interesting. 

Here you feel like in a MMO - big, empty maps, infinetly respawning mobs, so you need to constantly clear it when you want to go from point A to B (just running does not work, as the mobs will always harass and pursue you). 

Maps are filled with boring activities like finding shards, closing rifts (fighting waves of enemies), etc. Those are almost required to progress with the main story, because for them you need ""power"" points, which you spend to unlock main missions. There is, also, a ""war table"" mechanic, where you assign your team for missions, that take some time to complete. You, let's say, click on ""Search for X"" mission, assign someone to it, then you need to wait an hour for it to complete. It is very, very, very, and I will say it again, very stupid mechanic that artificialy makes the game longer. 

Side missions, and there is plenty of it, are mostly ""Go there, kill, come back"", which is kinda sad. Don't look for witcheresque missions with good plot.

And story... It is not that bad, but (I did not finished it yet) I can tell you how I see it - it starts too fast. At the beginning you are a prisoner, 10 minutes later you are a ""lord"", a ""hero"", a ""herald"".  11 minutes later you are at the head of an army of Inquisitors, and you feel like ""Did I miss something...?"". 

Game just feels like it just threw you into the plot, not slowly introduce you to it. 11 minutes later you are at the head of an army of Inquisitors, despite 

Gameplay is very similar to the second game, although you can swith to the ""tactical"" view from the Origins (there is no option for ""basic"" gameplay from Origins), so it depends what you like. 

Music is nice, as in every Dragon Age, so there is nothing to be mad about, and the graphics are okay.

Bugs galore. Bugs. Many bugs. Many, MANY bugs. Fortunately only a short list of gamebreaking ones. The rest are inconveniences that pile up to create an uncomfortable and jarring experience which will take many out of the moment the story is trying desperately to place you in. These include:

-Party AI standing idly during fights (this will happen even if you utilize the pause feature and your warriors who you want dishing out dmg to high dragons will get the worst of it)
-Hideous texture problems in armor, facial anims, environments, etc. (Teeth appearing on the side of inquisitors face is the only one that enhances the experiences for me personally)
-Damage numbers will appear large but the engine is processing too much of the ugly textures and seems unable to register said damage at times. This will often take the fun of crit builds like I initially tried.
-Auto attack will only work at a certain range (archers, mages) and will at times teleport you in front of the enemy causing a potential gameover in bigger fights.

As stated, these aren't gamebreakers, just very inconvenient and will leave players frustrated. As for the plot, it suffers from an odd need for hollywood movie moments; characters in cutscenes will often pose alongside strong musical scores for seemingly no reason. This happens three or four times. Corypheus will leave you wanting more and the game will give you none of it. It will instead waste your time on hundreds of chores as you babysit two entire nations. Romance is... good to a point. Largely depends on personal investment.

tl;dr ~ this entry to the DA franchise is possibly the worst of the current three from a technical level. Unsure how it was approved of but here we are. Purchase on sale and try not to expect too much from it.",1607836031,1629689416,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Original review....
Played game for a couple of hours when I purchased it and it seemed OK (not great). I went to play it again a couple of weeks later and behold it wouldn't load. Checked all the things that the forums suggested to no avail. I've spent more time trying to fix it than play it and have now given up.
It did start to load from Steam when I reinstalled it but as soon as Origin loaded it packed in.
Rubbish
Update May 2021...,
Occasionally I try to load it to see if it'll work, nah. It's the only game I've purchased on Steam that won't work. Don't think I'll get any other game from EA again.
One week later...
For the hell of it I tried the game again, it gets worse, Steam just freezes now when I attempt to open this damned game and end up having to reboot the PC  - twice I've tried and I'm not doing it again.
What a pathetic soul am I - I will try again when I feel better.

For one, the combat sucks. I hate how they changed up the control scheme and feel from the first two games. I know a lot of people say Origins and DA 2 are very different from one another in their combat feel, and they'd be correct to say that. But Origins and DA 2 feel very similar to each other compared to Inquisition, at least to me. Everything feels awkward and the only way to get through the nauseating amount of combat encounters in this game is to just spam abilities because your regular attacks to very little damage. I modded this game extensively to completely change the combat because I disliked it so much and it sucks, because I really enjoyed the combat of both Origins and 2.

The story is okay. I'm a little over 20 hours in at this point and I have yet to feel any attachment to the events of the story or most of the new characters. I'm keeping on for Varric, Leliana, and Solas. Otherwise, the characters aren't really doing anything for me. I find all the romance options to be lackluster, and with this game running on Frostbite, you dont get these up close and personal conversations outside of cut scenes. Instead, you get this stagnant floating third person camera that never moves while you talk to the dozens of NPCs you don't care about. I'm currently working on a play through and I dont even remember the villain's name. It starts with a C, I know that, and I dont care enough to google it. I also don't even think I have all the characters yet. I think Im still missing like two. Yippee.

The amount of tedium in this game is unreal. There are several zones with ungodly amounts of side content to do and pretty much all of them are a chore to navigate. Next to none of this side content is worth doing. It's all just fetch quests and go-kill-this-thing type of missions. The problem is you need to do at least some of them to build up your inquisition power. It's awful. This game did not need this much shit. Slice the number of zones in half and toss out like 70% of the worthless side content and you'd have a concise 25-30 hour game that is much more tolerable to play.

I don't even care enough to type more about this game, so I'll just do a quick mention of some things. Graphics are good, sound is okay. Voice acting varies a lot between characters and is overall forgettable. There are a stupid amount of bugs in this game that constantly hinder my experience. Frostbite really ruined/needlessly complicated aspects of the game.  Frostbite also makes this game infinitely more difficult to mod. There's a huge emphasis on resource gathering for some reason, it's a chore and detracts from any fun you can have in this game. The menus are awkward and way more difficult to navigate. And on top of all this, the game didn't import my world data from my previous games. I tried doing the import world state thing and it didnt work. I was quite surprised when I heard my hero of fereldan was not a human noble but instead a female elf.

A huge step down in quality and a poor excuse for a dragon age game. Let's hope Bioware doesn't make the same mistakes again for DA4. Buy this for like 10 bucks. Or better yet, dont buy it at all, just a read a plot synopsis.",1629576626,1629576626,False,4,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I was disappointed with II, but it was still very much a good companion piece to the original. Inquisition is hard to like. I enjoy the relative structure of the game, it reminds me of my favorite JRPG series; Suikoden, in that you start as an individual with potential and you gradually raise an army and build up a home base with which you can fight against the bad guy. Don't get me wrong, it's a very slim comparison, but I enjoyed the spirit of the plot. What I didn't like about Inquisition was the pacing. It plays like a MMORPG with repeatable fetch quests for resources. The combat was downgraded from II which is a shame, because I like the direction they were going, but in Inqusition it just feels so boring at times. Perhaps I need to play at a higher difficulty. The main quest can be completed in a relative short amount of time, but they bloated the game with various areas of interest that just felt like copy pasted segments of World of Warcraft. The game basically gives you a huge sandbox to play with, but at the cost of an actual engaging plotline. I found myself spending hours just doing basic area quest to build up my army, I feel like I had little to no agency in the grand scheme of things. The game would be better if they tightened up the storyline a little more instead of letting you just play in the sandbox. 

I don't know. It wasn't fun playing it. It felt like work, and thats the opposite of a good game. I wanted to like it so much, but the story, most of the characters and the gameplay itself just feel hollow, empty.

I don't have enough experience with Dragon Age as a series to chime in on that conversation, but it's a similar sentiment to how I feel about Mass Effect Andromeda: An okay open-world cover-based shooter but a very lousy Mass Effect game.

Just from the perspective of playing Inquisition by itself, I'd say it is a good open world RPG game. Combat is fairly accessible though it can be more complex if you want it to be, with the ability to set up commands for your companions and guide them in battle with a tactical view. I've taken the more casual approach and while I have died a few times it's usually because of a large level gap. I will also say that not having healing spells is a very odd thing for a fantasy RPG. There are potions at least, but my companions don't seem to want to use them most of the time.

The world itself is very beautiful and the most enjoyable part for me is how jam-packed each map seems to be with things to discover. I'll go up to one structure, loot it for goods, then step out and see a cave just around a corner. Enemies can respawn fairly quickly which can be a nuisance when you're just roaming around, but as long as you are the right level they're easy to dispatch.

The story itself isn't that interesting to me. You somehow survived an explosion that killed the leaders of the templars and magic users and have to use your newfound power to seal rifts that are letting Demons enter the world. The people that arrested you for being the only survivor have forced you to join their newly formed Inquisition to save the world. Seems silly and desperate, but the gameplay leaves plenty of room for smaller side stories which I've always found more interesting. The little conversations between your companions when you're walking around are amusing to catch. Fulfilling the needs of the people you run across gives the appropriate sense of accomplishment.

They have mounts in the game, which is kind of cool, except I feel like I miss out on the spontaneous dialogue of my companions if I use them. Your companions ""disappear"" while riding so I'd rather just go places on foot most of the time. Kind of disappointing that they didn't just have your whole crew riding horses behind you.

Dialogue trees could use some work. I've gone down some paths that ended my conversation with a person and forced me to go back in just to finish the other available talking paths. I would also recommend getting a mod that zooms in the camera, otherwise you won't be able to see the details on any characters while talking to them.

Overall, it is a far more enjoyable experience to me than Mass Effect Andromeda, made by the same company. I got both on sale in a bundle and I feel that this was the better purchase of the two. I'm enjoying it for what it is: An open world RPG with lots to explore and actual choices to make when speaking to people.

i know i'm VERY late to play Dragon Age, but i have to admit it's really fun. even tho i haven't completed Inquisition yet, i do love the series.

-Some armors have gaps where you can see through them... literally. There is no Character Torso. Only empty void
-Dragon fights are wayyy too easy compared to Origins. But its still harder than Dragon Age 2 to some extent
-No more Attribute Customization. So no more 100 strength 10 Constitution 2 handed warrior
-Character Approvals here are the worst.
-Your Qunari Character is not stoic. But its understandable since you are Tal-Vashoth
-Leliana is somehow alive even if you killed her in Origins

Excellent rpg with vast open world and tons of quests that can be accomplished. Take me more than 200 hours to play, listen to the dialog and story , enjoyable characters and funny talks. I had play all 3 Dragon Age games in the series and I can say DAI is the best among three. I love the companion characters depth of this game. However, plot twist comes too late at the end of main game (for selling DLC, of course, you know). Cons are the game needs to connect to Origin, EA, and DA Keep server make the game too slow to start, random save file crashes and poor mini map that make me frustrate.
Score 9 in 10. deduct the cons above.

- Mythology: Ancient Gods and Goddesses, the Blight, and some other legends are explored in greater detail in this game, with some big surprises.
- Story & Lore: It's a BioWare game. And even though it may fall short to Dragon Age: Origins or the Mass Effect trilogy, it offers an immersive tight plot and rich lore.
- Dialog wheel: A neat upgrade from Dragon Age: II, with some special dialog options if you purchase Inquisition perks, e.g. 'ancient history'.

Cons:
- The 'war table' is atrocious.
- Side quests mostly boring.
- Horse controls are a nightmare.
- Movement feels clunkier and less responsive than in Dragon Age: 2.
- Open World is too big and boring - e.g. collecting shards is one of the most boring things I can imagine.
- Few important decisions.
- There are way too many characters in this game. They are somewhat well-written, but still much less unique and memorable than in Dragon Age: Origins.
- Main antagonist is boring.
- No ethical dilemmas are explored. The story is too linear. Where are the tough decisions, BioWare?
- Collecting 'power' to unlock main story missions is boring. You are forced to do boring side quests.

That might be just me, and I know this is going to piss off a lot of Dragon Age fans, but I also don't like the 'tactical' combat. I would love a more action-based combat system. 'Tacical' RPGs do their best to always remind you that you're simply playing a game. I want the gameplay to feel more like a cutscene - the more action-based and the more immersive, the better. This is why I loved Mass Effect 2 and 3, as well as Red Dead: Redemption 2. And more Dragon Age fans might kill me for this, but why, exactly, do I need to level up and control all 4 characters? In the end, it's the protagonist who makes all the in-game choices - YOU are the protagonist. You are NOT the NPCs. It ruins the immersion, having to manually control your party members for 'tactical' advantage.",1627797387,1628700437,False,1,0,0.506190657615661621,0,True,False,False

So, like most days I was very bored and I was looking for singleplayer choice-based RPGs... and I couldn't find any that I haven't played... then my friend suggested a game called Dragon Age: Inquisition. It was on a pretty big discount and when I saw it was made by BioWare I was like, sure why not? Oh boy, was I not disappointed! I haven't played any Dragon Age games before, just like with Mass Effect: Andromeda (it was so good I bought Mass Effect Legendary Edition), but that did not stop me from enjoying the game. I read about the lore of the world in my free time while I wasn't playing it so I didn't have any hard time understanding what was going on (I do the same thing for many games that I haven't played yet). So the game has pretty good character customisation, way better than Mass Effect: Andromeda's (beware I will compare these two games a lot since they released 2 years apart and are both made by BioWare), the characters are well written, I had a lot of fun and I even laughed a little bit with some of the jokes, they're really good! Now if it comes to me, good graphics don't matter to me in videogames if the story is good, but holy shit for a game from 2014 it either melted PCs at that time or had like a next gen update, because the graphics are fucking gorgeous and beautiful, my PC sounded like a fighter jet only 90% of the time playing the game on all graphics maxed out! I thought the game would be way shorter than it was, if I remember correctly I finished Mass Effect Andromeda with all side missions completed around like 60-70 hours, and if it comes to Dragon Age: Inquisition there were so many side missions, collectibles etc., I completed all of the side missions except collectibles that (I will though) and I was already at 90 hours, fortunately the final boss was a fucking pussy and I have beaten him without a sweat, thanks to completing all side missions and a DLC before fighting him. Pretty weird that he didn't achieve his goal since I gave him like 70 hours of free time... anyways! With buying the game you get 3 DLCs, the first one unlocks a shop where there are most common resources to be bought without you needing to look for them, pretty handy, the second DLC adds a new set of missions and collectibles, and the last DLC which adds around 2 hour long mission that is more of a teaser for the next Dragon Age game (that I'm definitely buying!) which was very cool, more games should do such things.

While I liked that there's a great roster of characters (except Vivienne), it saddens me that their relevance to the inquisition journey is quite low (besides Cassandra and Varic). Would like to see something more in their character-specific event quests that connects their background into the main storyline, rather than just romance opportunities or 'let's learn more about me teehee'

Combat was more strategic than reflexes (e.g., MHW) , which is not a bad thing. I enjoyed planning equipment, building skill trees and putting them into action. The English voice acting is great too! Many games with English VAs comes to me as horridly cringe, but glad to hear that Dragon Age: Inquisition was not the case for me.

I'll admit I wasn't super excited about this sequel (mostly because EA just seems to ruin everything it touches).  The story is *meh* at best. Anything approaching nuance does not exist. In previous games it at least ""felt"" like choices mattered, not in DA:I. Every decision ends with the exact same result. At worst you might run off a companion, but the story moves on unhindered. The game itself is actually crazy short (even with the DLCs) unless you are the sort to spend time running around looking for completion quests and picking up butt loads of collectibles. Friendships/romances lurch along at odd pacing and people bounce between extreme drama then somehow being the dullest folks in existence. The game teeters between holding your hand on missions to offering no help at all and leaving you flailing if you don't understand what they want. The story isn't bad, but it really isn't that good either and the whole thing ends with a cliffhanger because of course it does. 

Also for some reason there were vikings?

The tactics somehow are worse each iteration of Dragon Age and Inquisition is bottom of the barrel. Your options are ""fight"" or ""protect controlled character"". You can turn powers on/off/preferred and you can tell your party when they've had enough potions to drink. That's it. Add to that that I ended up using my controller because auto attack DOES NOT EXIST when using the keyboard. The ability tray is SEVERELY limited only allowing 8 total slots for use. You can't swap them out in combat. You can't manually use them. So if you suddenly find yourself fighting something immune to your power set, too bad. Team movement commands are also terrible. If I select the don't move command and wander more then 5 feet away the champions all reset and start following again. Something that drove me crazy while doing puzzles, they don't trigger buttons if you aren't controlling them but THEY GET IN THE WAY. Combat requires you to either micromanage tf out of your team or only pick fights with things squishier then you. 

Which leads me to the BUGS. Oh my GODS this game is so buggy. Fortunately nothing game breaking but I spent a LOT of time frustrated. My companions would often just stop moving during combat. Even if I switched to them I couldn't get them to move. They would constantly get stuck, fall, or disappear because they got stuck and I'd have to circle back for them. Combat was frustrating because AOE abilities would target weird places and get hung up on things like rocks, steps, trees, the air... I tried to build a second character and suddenly the new character creation tool is broken and won't let me customize anything except the name. World objects just fail to load at random. And the game would occasionally just close. No error, just gone. 

The only thing I found myself loving was the artwork. The art was gorgeous. The murals breathtaking and well implemented. The tarot cards (while I don't understand why they exist lorewise) were just stunning and probably my favorite part of the game. Art easily 10/10.  I wish the rest of the game had the same loving care paid to it.

EA wanted to make a MMO at first, but we all were lucky that they changed their mind. But still, there are a lot of MMO bits and pieces here left. That make almost no any sence, sometimes slow you down.

Pros:
Story is pretty nice, even a few DLCs feel good.
Visuals are great even now.
You can play with controller at last.
Funny characters that all have their place and backstory.
Some choices matter.
Choices from previous games lead to different consequences here.
Little to no bugs.

Cons:
A lot of MMO and collect-them-all activities that make no any sence here.
Location quests are mostly bland and are another leftover from MMO.
Horrible screen tearing in cutscenes.
Female characters look awful and are ugly. They mostly have short hair and faces like some transvestites.
Gays and lesbians, as it is a very important thing in fantasy RPG.. Especially it is idiotically noticeable in one of the endgame DLCs when you are getting in the face a scene and dialogues like: ""Look, these 2 females are actually lesbians, now they are together! Surprise! It is the end of the game, but you have to know this, so important for the story! You can even ask how is their relationship!"" C'mon, WTF?!
Cliff hanger ending is in DLC.

Overall, DA3 is MUCH better than second one, but worse than DA1.
I don't wait DA4, most probably it will be awful.

In your role as Inquisitor, you affect many lives, events, and nations with your choices, which can be vastly different from playthrough to playthrough, especially if you import various ""world states"" (events and choices from previous 2 games) from Dragon Age Keep.

The combat is serviceable; while I prefer more actiony combat of, for example, The Witcher 3, DA:I's combat feels responsive enough while also having the element of tactics (pausing the game to issue commands to your squadmates).

There is plenty of customization; cool weapons and armor (especially if you find some rare masterwork schematics), runes to craft, combat ability trees to explore (with additional specialization options, offering a new skill tree), not to mention the Skyhold customizations.

The shining gem of this game is it's story and characters; all of the characters are well-written, even if you don't like some of them. Each character comes from a different background, offering unique perspectives on life and the world of Thedas, making it fun to talk to them and explore their personalities and what they think. There's even romance options.
But I cannot forger all of the choices you get to make, large and small, world-changing and insignificant, that shape you, the characters around you, and the world of Thedas.

Often games are criticized for being too short but the opposite can be true - a game can be too large and unfocused for its own good. Dragon Age: Inquisition is the epitome of that type of game. It's so full of filler that finding the tasty meat in the sandwich is too much of a chore. The game's constant focus on quantity rather than quality ends up making it feel like an imposition on my gaming time. 

Main Story - there's a fairly decent story here but it's standard RPG tropes. You know the drill - bad thing happens, your character is thrust into the limelight and wacky adventures ensue to prevent the End of the World. Yeah, it's no different here. I don't feel as connected to this story as I did Dragon Age: Origins (note, never played the 2nd game much due to the focus on the action-based combat and the reuse of assets) because I think the Blight and the origin stories in the first title do a much better job of setting the stage to involve the player than this one. It's acceptable as a main quest line goes but it's nothing special. 
[b]Grade: B- [/b]

Side Quests - What are outright horrendous are the side quests. There are so few good side quests that it's criminal - this isn't Bioware's B-Team writing them, this is like the flunkies from a failed MMO writing them and they're everywhere. Even the NPC quests aren't great. There's simply nothing close to those created in DA:O. Instead, they're almost all collection and exploration quests (see below) and nothing has any real meaning. Bioware's games are known for emotionally gray side quests and there are NONE of those here. Even the NPC quests aren't all that compelling. 
[b]Grade: F[/b] 

Zones - EA/Bioware wanted an open world. They got it. It's huge - in fact I think the first main quest zone is larger than all of DA:O. And there are numerous zones, each with a massive area to explore. But it simply doesn't work. Each zone isn't connected to the others, so the zones feel like MMO zones more than a cohesive world (Skyrim). The zones are often pretty, though some are PITA's to navigate. But the real issue here is because these zones are huge, the devs had to try to fit in content in these zones. And they did in the worst possible way. They loaded the zones with nothing but throwaway filler - collection quest after collection quest, finding all the hot spots and closing demon rifts. It's the same quests in every zone and they're tedious, boring and all they do is take up your precious gaming time. This is why the review uses the term ""Imposition"" - more compact zones with a better story would have been far more enjoyable. As a hint, if you ever play this title - get the HECK out of the Hinterlands ASAP. Don't stay there and quest. Most players will be tempted to complete it before moving on which is why it's known as the graveyard of DA:I games. It's huge and boring. Get in and get out. You can thank me later.
[b]Grade: D[/b] 
 
Combat - I truly liked the tactical combat of the 1st game. I hated the combat in the 2nd game enough not to play more than 2 hours of it. This is somewhere in-between. They tried a compromise solution and it shows - it tries to be tactical and fails. And due to the sheer number of combat encounters, playing this is a tactical combat game would get tedious. So it actually plays out like MMO combat, waiting for cooldowns on your 3-5 decent combat skills and otherwise spamming your main skill. 
[b]Grade: C[/b]

Graphics - Pretty good, considering the age of the game. The zones are pretty and the NPCs hold up fairly well. It's not as gritty as Witcher 3 nor does it have the style of a Mass Effect 3 but the graphics are more than acceptable. There are a few spots in zones where I just sat back and enjoyed the view for a few moments (Deep Roads but otherwise the graphics are passable. I played DA: Origins last year and while I know these graphics are of higher quality, I can't say they're any better. There's more stuff onscreen but I don't know that they add anything more to the experience.
[b]Grade: B[/b]

Sound - Voice acting is well done in most cases, though Blackwall has the emotional range of cardboard and Dorian just makes me want to hit him. Other sounds are okay. Combat sounds sufficiently chaotic but there's nothing here that makes me that impressed. Music is generic. 
[b]Grade: C+[/b]

Bugs - EA/Bioware, shame. Seriously, shame. Not because of Origin but because there are still numerous bugs in the game. I had at least 2 quests break. The Tresspasser DLC still has the bug that won't let you zone in full screen. Couldn't interact with quest objects. Frozen characters for a minute. Nothing that prevented me from playing but all annoying and previously documented bugs. I even lost sound in the very last cutscene of the game. The last DLC for DA:I was 2015 and EA just didn't bother fixing numerous, known bugs. I didn't encounter anything that many others have encountered. 
[b]Grade: D[/b]

NPCs - A decent bunch but not up to Bioware's usual outstanding standards. There are 9 companions that join your team but most of them are exceptionally lackluster. In fact, I found only Cole, Cassandra and Iron Bull to have any kind of decent stories. The others were outright boring. They bring back Morrigan and Leliana from the first game and they're far more interesting than anyone else here. Because the NPCs are dull, that makes the romance options pretty slim pickins'. Again, it's not a total loss because there are 3 good NPCs but this group is really quite a significant drop from prior Bioware titles where the NPCs were simply far more interesting. Because the NPCs mean little, that just makes the emotional connection to the game that much less.
[b]Grade: C-[/b]

Now that I've touched on specific areas, I'd like to come back to the bigger picture. DA:I suffers terribly from someone trying to ""MMOize"" a single-player RPG. The zones, quests and much of the combat seems like it belongs much more in a MOO rather than a single-player RPG. If I had passed other players playing the same game I wouldn't have blinked twice. As such, the game lacks focus. I think the devs knew this, which is they brought back characters from the first two games. But they even managed to screw this up. The single biggest supposed emotional moment was to choose which one of two characters died in an event - AKA Mass Effect 1 with Ash vs Kaiden. But in this case the choice loses almost all meaning. First, it's entirely overt unlike the ME1 choice where it surprises you. It seems actually entirely unnecessary to the story and is created only to try to wring out some emotional tears from this dry, crusty title. But here's the real problem - unless you played [spoiler]DA2[/spoiler] you don't know either of the characters worth a darn. In what was to be the most emotional part of the entire title, EA/Bioware rendered the choice MEANINGLESS to many (most?) players. Great job guys, here's the worlds' smallest violin. Another issue was the choice of Divine - the game outright ignored my choice. Why give me the choice then? 

The whole game seems to me like that-  one step forward, one step back. I'd actually like to play a 30 hour version of this game rather than the 80+ (and I finally sped through much of the last 1/3rd due to boredom) snoozefest much of it is. Is it worth buying? Well, on sale this title is less than a tenner and that's great value for your money. But I don't know that it's a great value for your [i]time[/i]. Do I regret playing it? Not really. Can I recommend it? Not really. Will I ever play it again? No. And as someone who has played through DA:O at least 4 times, that says something about this title. Perhaps it says everything that you need to know.  

PS - Note on Origin. Yes, it has problems. I had to put Origin on the anti-virus exception list to get the title to run. That didn't really factor into the review but I thought readers should know.",1627848561,1627848901,False,48,1,0.634500980377197266,4,True,False,False

  But DA Inquisition didn't brought me that sensation of playing another cool game in the Dragon Age franchise. In fact, the game, while looking good in graphics, it has a lot of things that makes you think that you are playing a generic mmorpg instead of playing a proper game. No matter how many tries, the character creation system sucks, it may look that you managed to create a beautiful character and then, while being in the game, you find out that you brought something close to an orc to life as a main character. 

  The voices that you can pick for your character were quite lame (I ended up creating a female warrior-like Qunari and the only two voices to choose from were, one that clearly was a touched male voice to make it sound like a female one and the other was one that sounded like a highly educated british classy lady from the court of Queen Victoria. Both of them sounded horrible and they didn't belonged to the character I was trying to build).

  The game controls, specially the camera, were annoying, both with KB+M and with a controller as well.

  I tried to get involved, but the game felt like a damn chore. Gathering materials when you are supposed to be the leader of a faction, can you get your minions to do that shitty job for you, so you can focus on doing more important quests?

  The combat system, bleh, it felt like a strange hybrid that didn't go well, since you manually have to move your character to keep engaging someone instead of automatically chasing the selected target, which with the clunky camera controls, made the whole thing weird and stressful, rather than fun.

  I also felt that the game tried to push me into liking the initial characters, even if you know the background of some of them due to the previous games, from the orbit of a new main character that never had any sort of relationship with them, it felt awkward. Nobody forms a bond with a stranger so quickly and talks like if you knew that person from all of your lifetime.

  My whole sensation while playing this was just that: a bland experience, typically found on a mmorpg, which I stopped playing a while ago and not that interested into jumping or engaging with one.

Lots of cutscenes and amusing companion diversions, exploration is rewarding (do yourself a favor and turn on the trial that keeps all enemies at least your level though, and the one that gives enemies new abilities if you get bored with combat) and the story itself is interesting. The DLC is excellent. At this point the big reveals are common knowledge, but it's different when you play it yourself. 

The pacing is pretty strange, probably to accommodate players who just want to beat the main quest and move along to the next game. If you allow yourself to be funneled through on that path you'll miss about half of the game's content. If on the other hand you explore and complete every area, companion interactions dry up and the game will nag you to get to the next MQ mission. This is the most glaring flaw in DAI, imo.

And yes, sadly Bioware got hoovered up by EA, so you have to make an Origin account and put their trashware on your rig. Steam and/or EA has streamlined the process so you don't have to screw around with it every time you play, but EA will interrupt you now and then to warn you - gasp! - that you're not connected to them anymore! Oh noes! At least you have access to the VERY cool Citadel, which allows you to customize the state of the game world to suit your playthroughs of DAO and DA2, so [b]your[/b] warden will be referenced, and [b]your[/b] Hawke will turn up to help with one of the MQ campaigns. The always-online state also gives you access in any re-plays to the golden nug, which you can use to carry over various upgrades you find to new playthroughs, if you want.

TLDR: Game is good, a fun iteration of this particular sort of game Bioware does so well. EA's greasy fingerprints on game are kind of irritating, but not that big of a deal in this case.

The main problem is that there are lots of fetch quests without much plot and those annoyed me a lot. They also dilute the main storyline (which can be interesting if it is more compact). The DLC trespasser makes the whole plot a bit better and I wish the main story could be written like that.

As for companions, they are fine I guess, but I do not feel very close to them as compared to the previous two games. There are better written ones, but most of them are returning characters. I also don't quite relate to the inquisitor although I played the whole game twice. Compared to the warden and Hawke, the inquisitor feels a bit too bland for me. (I literally thought of sacrificing the inquisitor in the fade quest although it was not an option. I'm just not as attached to the inquisitor as compared to the protagonist from the previous two games.)

Combat-wise, I'm a bit disappointed as the strategic element is almost all gone. Please bring back the old tactic menu. I also only ever the tactic view as it is easier to control and fight. If they just copy-paste the DA2/DAO combat system, I'd have more fun.

The area that this game did better is the graphics, I suppose. The scenery is pretty nice to look at in many places, and the winter palace is truly stunning. If you are a big fan of the graphics, this game might be for you.",1627458528,1627458528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And the second one, although interesting, is by far my least favorite--namely due to extreme repetitiveness of the environments, the whole idea of ""Hawke"", and general lack of customization that I thought the first one did very well. But the third one, falling in between the two, is still a very good game--and in many ways brings forward some of what makes both of the previous games unique.

The third one is beautiful, no argue there from me. Also, you can make your own character and even be a Qunari which is cool, unlike being forced into being a Hawke. No backgrounds like the first one, but you can still choose your own path throughout the game like you would expect--which nods to what your background could have been. I love the different environments the game takes you to, and there is plenty to do in each. If you are a completionist like me, your first play through could easily take 100 hours (and probably still miss a few things). But, if you don't care about this you could still get a very good, albeit incomplete, game done in maybe 30 hours casually.  

The dragons are awesome--and although I really miss some of the characters in the first one (maybe one or two from the second one)--pretty much all but one or two of the characters in this one really grew on me over time. There are a lot of new aspects to this game, which are all pretty cool. Forts, detailed item customization, a set of trusty steeds, plus your inquisition powers and the war table--that is all pretty neat. I feel like Dragon Age is evolving into something that is completely different from what the first one was (which is what makes me think that the first one will always be my favorite), but the game is still very good anyway.

Personally, I would prefer a remake of the first one (since it constantly crashes on my PC, is a bit ugly these days, and doesn't have Steam achievements) over a Dragon Age 4, but if they can make another one that is at least the quality of the third one then I will be excited to play that one too.",1603051665,1627434038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game runs on origin so if you dislike that you already should walk away. This alone has cause some to have problems with even just starting the game. If you like using controllers then you must understand this game don't have controller support so you will have to download a software just to use one (you can check the forums for how this could be done).

The game play is solid, its different from DA2 (third person/tactical combat) only down fall about that is during combat your just holding one button for basic attacks then casting abilities when you have the manna/stamina. This alone makes all the side quest you can do, the choices you can make, the traveling around the different maps painful. 

Overall it was a great experience except for when you fight a dragon and noticed your team is just going to stand there and die unless you move them around. Also the basic attacking in combat.

The graphics and visual details are so beautiful, especially for being from 2014, and even 7 years later is still an absolutely stunning! Unlike the previous games, the locations and environment are much larger scale and closer to open-world concept. 10/10 in graphics and environmental/character detailing!

Comparatively, the story doesn't feel as choice-reliant as the previous Dragon Age games, but it still meets and exceeds the high expectations. Choices are still there to be made (as per the other games), but some of the choices - even major ones! - don't feel as impactful in the longer run. Most of the recruitable characters are enjoyable and/or unique and interesting in many different ways - some even following through the story with their own character growth and expansion. The expansion material is quite enjoyable, but feels a bit odd in placement compared to the main story. Overall, story still is a solid 8.5/10.

Multi-player IS an option, but be prepared to either not have many others grouped with you (if at all) or be prepared to pull your friends in with you. The concept of their multi-player was a good one: focusing more on being ""agents"" of the Inquisition and completing missions out in the field. But only when there were many people playing. Multi-player CAN be solo'd by certain class choices, but it'll take time and effort to get to that point. And boy, does unlocking those classes/levels feel overwhelming sometimes. When the game was released (and the following year or two after), having others online to join a random game was no problem. But anymore, you aren't likely to get grouped with anyone else. Maybe with DA4 interest peaking, there will be a rush of people as everyone replays the previous DA games. Currently though, due to lack of other players, I'd only give the multi-player 3/10.

Overall, a beautiful game with a immersive story, pleasing environment, and relatable characters and would highly recommend it (and the whole Dragon Age franchise) to anyone who enjoys RPGs!",1626752616,1626752616,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On the con side; there are times I feel the back and forth is a bit over done. There are times where finding the needed path to an objective or new quest holder is too hidden.

What we are going to do is: we are going to make it impossible to use the mouse, we will make it such that for every basic shot the user would have to click the mouse, for every pickup they would have to come to the target using keyboard point blank, click on it with a mouse, inspect the loot and click through it to pickup on each item one by one. Every lootable object would have to be first pinged and then found on minimap and then navigated to, every flower, every stone... and screw the old DA2 ""sparking"" objects, in order to distinguish them in the world from normal textures... no you will be running around, radaring everything like idiot... And about interface.... remember how you could read what spell does by hovering over it in a skill bar? no... that was too easy instead now we have a 15 point interface with 4 screens where you can sit and match the 32x32 pixel images in order to find the spell you want to read on....

I can continue for another 5 paragraphs, but realistically there is a huge problem with the game where the void created by the absence of the ""content"" in DA2 has been filled with chores where instead of ""click and collect"" you have to ""navigate then click, then wait for animation, then carefully study, then collect"". The game is barely fun on PC because instead of going through the story and actively participating you have to relearn what each button does and how to do there simplest tasks. The series has been loosing it's identity and it's charm: is not an FPS (or TPS), because controls are too clunky for that, it is not  a tactical ""mastermind"" because the erased all selections and character building and made the party control awkward at least, it feels like a poor man minecraft with quests, new textures, and significantly reduced amount of blocks.",1626519757,1626519757,False,1,0,0.504635035991668701,0,True,False,False

These choices have a significant impact on the world of Thedas and make the Inquisition much more interesting, as a continuation of the previous stories.

a. interesting and realistic characters, that make you care about them (or hate them etc). They aren't just npcs walking around and saying something. They have a background, desires, goals. Τhey seem alive.
b. rich, deep and well-built lore
c. beautiful lancdscapes and awesome graphics
d. vast world with many side quests. That is a feature that sometimes made me feel tired, because as a perfectionist I wanted to achieve 100% completion of the game. 
e. Both the main game and the dlcs have interesting and well-made stories. And don't forget, the choices you are going to make will change the world of Thedas like never before... (You should buy the ""Trespasser"" dlc, which is like a sequel to the main story)

this plays like pathfinder, divinity or baldur's gate 3. except there's a bit more of an open world. the game is divided into regions where you can explore, collect stuff and do side quests like hunting a frost dragon or helping a farmer/refugee get some medicine.

the more side quests you complete, the more you level up your characters and the more power you get. with power you can follow the main questline or unlock new regions. there's crafting in this game but I'd say it's pretty undeveloped and limited.

the gameplay is fun. the story is well driven, and the characters are really enjoyable. most of them are somewhat interesting, and you can further talk to them with companion quests and such.

 the main problems with crafting are a lack of schematics early game (or even late game) and lack of ways to get materials. although if you purchased the black emporioum dlc the latter is solved. though you'll still need ways to make money.

the specialization quests require you to look for things without knowing where they are. which is shite. and unless you have a guide, one of the major milestones in the game would be really hard to find. notice that you'll also need to do a quest at the war table AFTER you completed haven to even get the instructors to come. all of this is super counter-intuitive. and you might not even notice you can have a specialization. although I certainly did.
as for the crafting, which I of course have a problem with, without schematics or materials there's not much you can do. and finding schematics that are actually better than your current gear is a bit of a hard find. the only way you can get around it is by purchasing the inquisition ""mage/warrior/rogue schematics"" but notice that you'll need four agents in the army to be able to unlock those. (it's not necessary for you to fill in perks to unlock the 4 slots requirements, which again, you won't know unless you've ALREADY played the game). then you'll be able to do some crafting. which is necessary if you want the best armour. especially since some specializations like rogue or the reaver require specialized gear to be really powerful. all of this is, again, really counter intuitive, and requires you to really look around and search the internet.
anyways. so specialization quests are annoying and crafting kinda requires you to look around the internet for it to be truly effective or viable. otherwise, if you're just playing on medium difficulty you might be wasting your time.",1626303693,1626305160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+Story rich

-Combat is just boring and there is a lot of it. The issue is that you will often run into fights where there is no risk of loosing, you just need to hold attack button for sometimes even a couple minutes, since they just randomly give enemies a lot of health, then after half a minute you run into another encounter.
-Inventory management doesn't feel meaningful, over the course of the game you maybe need to update your gear like 3 times, since the gear you find doesn't provide much of an upgrade. There is also a crafting that could make it more meaningful, but it kinda feels like a chore.
-Technical issues: I had one (fortunately optional) dialog broken to the point, where starting it would require me to restart the game, as it would freeze with black screen, no solutions found in internet helped. Also in some cutscenes there were characters missing, so that your character would say something, wait a bit, then just say next line.
-Side quests get repetitive

The game is very ambitious, lots of depth between the characters, if you're a fan of the series im sure you will enjoy it. As a newcomer I didnt really like it without knowing more backstory. The controls seem a little buggy, suddenly the camera would whizz up to stare at the clouds in the middle of combat. Also dont appreciate the issues that come with origin.
I dont feel any urge to finish the game, it just didnt hold my attention like a fantasy rpg usually would. The missions you send followers on from the war table kind of suck and they return with a handful of gold or a flower after 24 hours.
Perhaps I couldnt enjoy this due to the constant monitoring of all the characters stats, armour, upgrades, tactics, going to the base and pause menu every 10 minutes to check they are all super optimised just is not fun especially as crafting was not fast or easy.

The story is really good (Trespasser DLC is a MUST though to get the full ending), dialogues are interesting, fun and sometimes cheeky. Your decisions in dialogues throughout the game don't impact a lot gameplay-wise, but make for more immersion.

The combat is rather simple, but as soon as you get to choose a specialisation its actual fun to explore different builds and smash your foes. Theres very different playstyles available and everything is viable if you play on normal.

Only downside for me is the ridiculous stupid AI of your comrades. It's just annoying to pull out everyone manually in tactical view of AOE's or out of melee range every 20 seconds.

This game is much, much better if you do. This is not one of those 'I didn't play the first two and it was fine!' games. 

On that note, this is probably the worst of the Dragon Age games, though it is the largest and most ambitious. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a Dark Souls 2 situation where they lost the magic, but it does feel a little off. The story is the obvious highlight and is crammed full of fascinating and polarizing characters - Solas in particular is one of the finest characters I've ever encountered, whether you love or hate him. The gameplay is impactful and often surprising, and the combat is fairly fun, especially the archery and controlling the tank of the party.

Where the game stumbles a bit is in the MMO-style side quests and in the balance. I don't want to collect ten bits of meat from randomly spawning rams in my story-driven single player game. I don't want to do a hundred fetch quests, or fetch all the hidden shards in the landscape. It really did feel open world for the sake of being open world, and the game suffers for it. As for the balance, crafting gear is laughably overpowered compared to everything but the very, VERY end-game items in DLC, and that certainly sucked a lot of the fun out of looting.

Having said quite a few nasty things about this game, I feel it's important to acknowledge that I've played it three times, and each run has pushed 70 hours. I am nitpicking because constant exposure has revealed these flaws, not because these flaws are game-destroying. This game is VAST, is clearly a labour of love, and is hard to not fall in love with for its sincerity and exceptional world building.

It is borderline unplayable compared to the other versions or other games I have played. Not sure how much I can tolerate the PC version of an otherwise amazing game. Its nearly a 7 year old game so I don't expect a fix from Bioware or EA on that, and since the keyboard and mouse are the same (but with better RGB) since that time, there is no excuse for this.

For starters, if you're a fan of Origins, don't get this. Storys good, game looks good, and clever writing, my main issue is this game feels more like an MMO, ubsurd material costs, tanky enemies, etc etc. 
But my biggest gripe is the combat...dear lord the combat...

So the combat is janky, and the movement system is just wierd, it feels like it was made for controller, but after switching from keyboard to that, it wasn't any better. And the combats reduced to SPAM EVERYTHING AND LEFT CLICK!

You run forward and back with w & s left and right with q &e and turn the camera with a & d. To use the mouse to adjust camera view you have to hold right mouse button and mouse movement is not linked to character movement.

Also NOTE you have to install Origin to play (make sure to uncheck all the EA spying options)

Looks like it might be cool if EA knew how to program controls.

Definitely NOT recommended!

Load times are insane on my machine. I have a good machine, it has no problems and runs much more graphically intense games smoother and with shorter load times. Any time I load something it take 5-6 minutes, go to a different area, load into a building, start a cut scene, waiting 5-6 minutes, that is not an exaggeration, I timed it a few times before I asked for a refund.

There are lots of help articles on this, only thing I saw that I did not try was uninstalling razer synapse, but if that is causing it, I don't want the game, that is just sloppy coding at that point. 

If you get this game and this happens, try to fix it, the game is worth it, but if nothing works, just get a refund.",1625308960,1625308960,False,1,0,0.491329491138458252,0,True,False,False

If you are experiencing crashing, add an exception to your Anti-Virus for the game executable file. I have AVG and this fixed all game crashes for me. Hopefully they patch this issue later

With that note aside, the game is great (I owned it on the Xbox 360 before this). Runs above 100fps for me consistently with all graphics maxed, however cut-scenes are locked at 30fps.

I also want to mention that when you buy the game here, you also get it on Origin. Some people are making a huge fuss over this as I believe it is not optional, but keep in mind even older games like Dragon Age Origins link to Origin from Steam. This is not a new concept, all Ubisoft game can / do link to Uplay as well. Personally, I don't care so long as I get Steam features but it is something to keep in mind if you don't like that setup.
