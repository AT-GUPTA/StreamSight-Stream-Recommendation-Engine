1210320,159438691,76561197971544967,0,146,1013,72,1013,1709081753,"A very unique game where you craft potions by using ingredients to move along a map.  Each ingredient has it's own path, which you only move partially on if you use the ingredient untreated.  If you crush the ingredients you can move further along the path.  You can also move back to the center by adding water.  There are obstacles that will ruin your potion, or just make things more inconvenient.  It sounds weird, and it kind of is but it's pretty fun and relaxing.  You run an alchemists shop and sell these potions to customers that ask for specific potions / effects.  The effects are stronger the closer you align the position on the map vs. the actual location.  You get new ingredients from a small garden and from travelling merchants.  There's not much more to the game.  Satisfy customers, use the gold to buy more ingredients and make more potions.  The potions eventually become more complex, needing multiple effects.  There are some weird rare ingredients and there are a few upgrades including a whole second map with some new obstacles.  And there are the special things you can craft that require multiple potions be placed into the alchemy machine in the basement.  I believe these eventually lead to the end game.

The major pros are the uniqueness and the relaxing nature of the game.  At least at first.  Also the tactile nature of the GUI is really nice, with you needing to stir the pot, move the pestle back and forth in the mortar, etc.

The cons would be the repetitive nature of the game, and how annoying advancing is later in the game.  You will need to do things like have a potion with 5 effects, get to potions in a maze of bones (things that destroy your potion), and make special ingredients that need lots of very specific and hard to make potions.  At first these challenging things are kind of fun, but it gets old and starts to become tedious and even frustrating.  Losing a potion because you think you can squeeze through an area and having to start over just becomes annoying later on.

So for me, the game is not recommended.  I pushed through most of the 6th alchemy path (out of 10 I think), and just realized I wasn't having fun anymore.  It looks like it was intended to have more things in the game like upgrading the spoon and stuff, but I'm pretty sure that isn't there.  It would have helped the game a lot.  I see this has ""very positive"" reviews, but less then 2% have actually finished it so I think this is mainly based off the early game.",1709082569,1709082569,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

tl;dr
I would recommend Potionomics as I have finished that game, and couldn't bring myself to finish this one.

After playing after it has officially released, still the same cool game, but I think in the late game it does get kind of grindy, particularly there's a requirement that halts your progress and forces you to grind that I just stopped playing. I tried to do some per day, but I just eventually stopped. Idk. Like I would recommend it because it's a relaxing chill game. But finishing it is a different story. 

Played Potionomics while waiting for this game and that game was solid, aside from some QoL issues which I believe they fixed. For this game, though they just had a QoL patch, I didn't really have an issue with. The only thing that I don't know if they updated is when you get too many recipes and you add more pages sometimes it moves your pages and fucks up your organization.

Also still felt unfinished as theres supposedly upgrades but who knows maybe it's behind the halted progress or it was a system they were still implementing to which I say why would you officially release the game?",1632521678,1708924980,False,1,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,True

[b]Explanation:[/b] Potion Craft , to me, is a game where the novelty wears off quickly. I put approx. 22 hours of time into the game but eventually dropped it because of how tedious it became. I wish I could like the game more as the art style and concept is wonderful, but the game feels forgotten about now. 

[i]Here is how my progression went:[/i]

The Beginning (1-5 hours): You spend time familiarizing yourself with the ingredients, and recipes, & the customer requests. Everything is new and sparkly and you have so much fun! Learning the in's and out of potion making is a great process. This is the space where you have so much hope and feel like you'll be obsessed with this for weeks. Although, at the end of hour 2 you've muted the music and put something else on. Listening to one track on repeat is too much. 

The Middle (6-15): Things are starting to slow down, you unlock harder and harder recipes, it's getting monotonous but with recipes you learn how to make things more efficient and less time consuming. 'Haggling' with merchants is a chore, but there are still some interesting and new ingredients out there. You hope you can unlock the tool upgrades soon. 

Middle Pt.2? (16+ hrs): You get tired of everything at this point. You are no longer reading the requests, just keywords, you angrily given them what they want and move on. You are praying for merchants to show up so you can finally get more  ingredients that you can't grow yourself (90% of them). Rapidly you are developing carpal tunnel in your hand and you realize there are no upgrades for your equipment at all. It was never put in the game. The objective of the game became too tedious and complex to manage and eventually you give up. 


If you are still really interested in this game I would suggest waiting for a sale. In it's current state it feels closer to 5-10USD, not 20.",1708835474,1708835474,False,3,0,0.565939784049987793,0,True,False,False

• Also to avoid repetitiveness it would be good to have more preparation options than just crushing. Say, chopping or squeezing juice out

Pros:
-cute af
-chill vibes
-go at your own pace
-many potions to brew
-lots of ingredients

Cons:
-it gets really hard to move around the map
-the alchemy laboratory potions you need get really complex and like hard when you dont know where things are and you ran out of ingredients to get there so you have no way of continuing and so yoube wasted like 20 ingredients good job..
-you have decline customers if you cant make something for them instead of ""hey come back tomorrow and ill have it"" so they get mad but like, dude im sorry! i just cant today! im sorrryyyy

anyway, still good though. i wish i had a cute cat to pet like in strange horticulture. idk, i just love those small details.

The general gameplay loop is awesome: Balancing ingredients and money, exploring the map, creating efficient recipes and upgrading the alchemy machine, all while tending the incoming requests. It's fun up to finishing the final ingredient...

The popularity level should be at about level 12 at that time, which means the last task is to grind ~3000 points to reach level 15. Wiith 39 points every day. The tasks are either ""drag the standard potion from your book onto the scale"" or ""brew this really difficult potion with only 2 ingredients"". It's not difficult to do the latter task, just annoying. The more efficient approach is to actually decline and just make up for it with more tasks in the same time. This shouldn't be the last thing to do to 100% the game. It should be mixing incredibly difficult potions to create [spoiler]the philosopher's stone[/spoiler].

Despite this I 100% recommend the game!

I just wish the finale would be the challenging puzzle, the game promises to be. Maybe there should be a mechanic like ""quality"" that requires a maximum number of ingredients used. That would turn the game into an incredible puzzle paradise!",1707666703,1707666703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art style is unique and I absolutely adore it. So far in my short tenure with the game I havent completed chapter 5 however thats more due to neglect on my part as in most of the other metrics such as popularity and karma im at lvl 15 and +100 respectively , I have hundreds of every ingredient. The reason why I mention these stats is many seem to complain about not being able to optimize or have enough ingredients for some potions. To that I must say, be creative as that is one of the core aspects of the game, and once you optimize and make sure you check inventory of items youre gameplay will be smooth, addicting and satisfying. While you cant budget, when sellers come around prioritize, youll eventually get to apoint that youll be able to buy surplus goods without bankrupting yourself though it may take a bit.

Like if your going to play this blind without a recipe guide on the potions then your more likely to waste materials in later chapters as it asks for more complex potions, so the sacrificing of resources for mere chances of the potion you want is quite drastic and doesn't really make it fun for me anymore.

Doesn't help that instructions are also not very clear, and the objective-fulfilling mechanics are rather wonky. I can be way early game and accidentally unlock multiple Chapter 5 objectives. 

When resources are limited and payoff of rejecting customers so drastic, it becomes very annoying and even possibly anxiety-inducing when trying to maximise the limited resources given. For the amount of ingredients given there are too many objectives at once (trying to satisfy customers, trying to stock up, trying to fulfil objectives, trying to get specific-level potions for the alchemy machine, etc), which demands further stretching of these resources. 

I really liked the idea of the whole thing, and I really tried to maximise my gameplay. I want to be supportive of the devs who put in their time and effort into making this - this game can be quite meditative, but with progression heavily dependent on grinding and overly calculative resource allocation, I can't really find it in myself to say my money was well spent.

I honestly don’t get why so many comments talk about the ingredients being too rare. The point is, you can craft a potion in many ways, if you run out of one ingredient, you can use another. The fun in this game is (for me at least) figuring out all the ways using as few ingredients as possible, perfecting the potions, making brewing as cheap as possible, etc. You also get more and more options to make crafting easier as the game goes on.

As of writing this, players can nominate games for the 2023 Steam Awards. I recently chose my picks for each of the 11 categories and wanted to check out one of these games. That pick was for the Sit Back and Relax Award, for which I nominated the game [i] Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator [/i]. After the slightly difficult experience of [i] Space Ace [/i], I thought I’d take a bit more of a relaxing turn with the next game I review.

In the game, you take on the role of a novice alchemist wandering the world and looking for a place to set up shop. In the town you come to, you come across an old abandoned home that you’ll turn into your alchemy base of operations and Potion Shop. The game begins with a tutorial that helps you learn the basics, which I found very helpful. I had never played this before, so that was much needed. But, from there, the game is pretty straightforward. As you make potions, you move around the Alchemy Map, picking up books for points that go toward skill points. Be careful of the sections of bones, as those will reset your progress, and the potion will fail.

While the game may be pretty straightforward in some places and complex in others, I had a lot of fun. Thankfully, this is one of those games where you can go at your own pace, which I took full advantage of. Also, there was enough of a challenge to this that I could stay engaged. Furthermore, I liked the art style and the music; I found it all quite charming if that's the right word. The mechanics were easy to get used to, too. However, it becomes repetitive, especially around the second half of the game, where you mainly make potions, sell them, buy valuable items for the Alchemy Machine, etc. Plus, getting those final achievements took a lot of work.

In conclusion, [i] Potion Craft [/i] is a fun, somewhat addicting, and unique kind of simulator with challenges but also a calming experience. If you’ve ever wanted to become an alchemist, now you can!

It really feels like manual labor at times. I have joint ache in my fingers, so a way of automating it would have been nice, maybe a magic pestle and mortal that you can buy later in the game (especially before you have to go far distances in the map). Another is how long it takes to traverse the travel line (not sure what it is called). Again it is a manual process, would have been nice to automate somehow late game, and still have manual for refined mixing.

However this game is very grindy if you want to 100% it. I've played this game since beta too. The early game is very fun as you have all the exploration you could want however it is held down by the struggle to get enough ingredients. I think the mid game is best I greatly enjoy the oil map exploration and the flexibility you have with more ingredients and money. Also I loved creating prefect recipes and customising the potions. The late game struggles though. One of my fav parts of interacting with customers is the little story bit you get, the fisherman the brewer the merchants telling you about their lives. In the end game you've run out of things like this and regular customer interactions feel like a slog cus it's all the same stuff you've heard before. I do like the additional requirements they add though. The alchemy machine stuff is fun but after sun salt it gets very grindy and loses it appeal. Plus finishing chapter X and Philosopher's salt are very underwhelming. You get 5000 Philosopher's salt with an effect that's just sort of fine. By the point in the game it's not very helpful and you've probably gotten very good at understanding and using the potion brewing mechanics like whirlpools and adding more base making the salt not that helpful. Plus the reward for finishing Chapter X is exp points which you definitely don't need seeing as you will have maxed out all your skills by the time you do Chapter X. It would have been nice to having something actually useful. A garden upgrade or whatever. Also the fact the save recipe function for salts and rocks isn't working is annoying cus you have to do it manually. I don't think I will boot this game up again after this cus there's nothing left to do. I feel like this game would benefit from the NPC's being just a bit more interesting. The fellow alchemist becomes useless pretty quick once you don't need paper anymore, I feel like it can't be that hard for him to congratulate you on academical progress.

The thrill of discovering new ingredients and optimizing potions, however, quickly wears out. After a few days of play it simply becomes a slog of repetitive mechanics while venturing through a map where the excitement of discovery has plateaued. The addition of oil as a new base is a nice refresher, albeit a very temporary one. 

If that was the only criticism I had, however, I would still recommend the game as it was still quite enjoyable for however long you can bear the repetition, as with any sandbox/simulation style game. The main gripe is how the developers dangle these new mechanics which seemingly promise drastic changes to the game. After they hiked up the price, I was excited as I thought that it meant the update was coming soon. It has been probably over a year now and the only features they added were small fixes and features, while the elusive major update still loomed with no set date. 

As of now, the only things I do in the game is recreate old potions for the same customers, who very occasionally ask for a niche potion that I have to make from scratch. The alchemy set doesn't really add much to the game as it is essentially a disguised grinding mechanic. With all the potential it has, the late-game has essentially boiled down to a glorified Cookie Clicker. The one background track playing over and over also does not do it any favors. 

I do hope that the game developers focus more on replayability instead of novelty, as the game really has potential to be a casual game to play just for a few minutes.

The crafting for some of the late game stones gets absolutely ridiculous requiring obscenely complicated recipes. Don't get me wrong it's fun challenging myself to do that the first few times but when you throw the 5th potion at me that's a 5 effect that just decides to go to a different 5 OPPOSITE corners of the brewing map, the novelty is lost somewhere between the 10th and 11th minute of working on the same fucking potion. Not to mention the reputation grind is utterly ridiculous, as not only to finish the alchemists path you need level 15 which is several thousand happy customers worth, but when you get some ridiculous multi-requirement order like making high grade hallucinogens with one ingredient.

Pros:
- When you start making potions it is really fun.  
- The graphics are awesome and the setting is awesome.

Cons:
Where can this be improved?  TWO AREAS.

- You start with a mortar, pestle, pot, and water.  Add more tools to use in your potion making!!  Add a still, a boiling plate, a hand cranked centrifuge, another pot to mix things separately.  Add an oven to cook your dragons feet, then a nail clipper to clip the nails off of trolls fingers.  Add more stuff to make potions with that can enhance your position on the map or something.  This is the current gameplay: Mortar, stir, water, mortar, stir, water.  C'mon, give me an entire LABORATORY to play with.  

- Take a little inspiration from ""Papers, Please.""  The reputation system means nothing.

- A small complaint in addition, hire a musician to write more songs.  You are selling this game for 19.99.  Have you played Stardew Valley for 14.99?

As for now:

- game doesn't really have late game: at the point of finishing all the stones from alchemy machine you will have all the ingredients in the world and finishing things up will just become the chore. Late game orders for potions will also become more annoying than anything else, because npcs will want lower tier potions, which is the opposite of progression. I do not think anyone playing this game will really be bothered going for potions but with lower tiers.

- haggling could not exist in this game and I would not notice it. What's more, not only it is barely useful, but quite the opposite: you will loose gold and have slower progress by using it. NPCs will be unhappy by paying more for potions which will result in less fame and less clients.

Using the salts to satisfy the picky customers with their limitations on the number of ingredients, and figuring out which recipes are worth saving. The potion book becomes quite full by the end and you need some organisation.

The crafting mechanic is clever and unique, but it is a literal grind. It would help to have a 'fully grind this ingredient' key. But even the tedious late game grind is a kind of optimisation challenge. I found myself ignoring the special requests of customers, saving commonly desired combinations, not haggling, and bulk buying the low-priced ingredients to gain popularity as fast as possible.

There are some aspects that are obviously not fleshed out yet, such as the garden and skill system. Figuring out which effects are compatible is rather confusing and frustrating. The customer orders for vague 'additional effects' are particularly unwelcome.

Unfortunately I find most of them struggle to make the potion-brewing element of the game interesting, often just asking you to discover recipes by mashing different herbs together. Well, Potion Craft is popular because the brewing mini-game is fantastic. They've managed to design a system that is relatively simple but gives the player the ability lots of room to be creative and strategic. 

There are many different ways to make the same potion, so you have to evaluate your priorities to decide which herbs to use. Is it more cost effective to use many cheap herbs or a couple of rare herbs? The customer would pay extra if I used certain herbs, but is it practical? I don't have many herbs usually needed to make a particular potion, should I just turn this customer away rather than make a really inefficient potion?

It's great. I've also rarely seen a shop game that does haggling very well, and I'd say Potion Craft scores mediocre on that. You make more money on each potion by playing a quick minigame where you have to click at the right time. You can choose the speed of the game - higher speed means higher reward but if you make a mistake the customer might end up with a discount. It's adequate, but simplistic and doesn't really feel like you're talking to someone. 

Also the game has a lovely hand-drawn aesthetic, with lots of little touches like the tip of your pestle changing colour based on the herb you just crushed with it. There are also quite a lot of customisation options for your potions like colour, label, shape of bottle etc. 

Overall I really enjoyed the game and am very happy with my purchase. Though one could argue it's a little expensive for the kind of game that it is. The brewing minigame is great, and it has lots of cool features and details I haven't mentioned here. But brewing is the entire game, basically. You don't go out to collect your ingredients, there's not much of a story, and you don't really have NPC relationships. I binged Potion Craft for a day when I started, but after that I had to take regular breaks as it got repetitive. Potionomics is a similar game at roughly the same price point with more variety, including a solid card game, lots of NPCs and even dating mechanics.",1705154277,1705688887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros- 
It's nice to kick back, 
pick your herbs, 
try to make new potions, 
find new ways to optimize old recipes,
chat up vendors and sell to customers. 
Made a potion of Explosive Libido
All of these are pros until you find that a lot of things are just very bogged down by complexity without explanation. 

Cons-
The game kind of just throws you to the wolves and expects you to figure it out as you go. 
I love that style of game, but when one of the first tasks you find to make Nigredo? I think. The recipe is complex, it feels like an achievement when you finally make it, but the you see how utterly complicated the next recipe is and how much more complex they get..... I just stopped there,

This game is a truly amazing take on crafting, and is very fun and unique... but has too many problems for me to recommend it. Mainly, the game expects you to grind a LOT. There is no easy way to do anything in the game for long periods of time. 

You can autocraft, if you have the materials for it. However, theres so many ingredients in the game that eventually, you will not have the materials available for autocrafting. You may think, ""so just stockpile on ingredients!"" Sadly this isn't possible, as the game is INCREDIBLY stingy with ingredients. You get some freebies at the start of the day, but its never really enough. You can buy some from merchants, but they are unreliable as what they sell you is completely random, and the prices they sell them to you at can be utter bullshit. The game is incredibly unbalanced, to the point of often losing profit from selling potions. 

The lategame progression is also horrendous. There is a massive crafting tree through the alchemy equipment, but to get the final item, you must craft every item several times over with NO AUTOCRAFTING. Not to mention, the late game salts and stones youre forced to craft for progression are nigh useless. In fact, the only useful salts are the first two, the rest of them are overpriced trash only there for you to tick a checkbox. 

One last gripe is the final grind. You could have done everything else in the game and be on chapter 10, and by this point youve served around 500-1000 customers. Around this point youre at probably level 12 or 13. For the final task, the game requires you to get to level 15, which requires you to serve THOUSANDS MORE than what youve already done. The worst part is, this was NERFED. They made the grind HARDER for no reason other for the sake of grinding. Really really poor design choice.

So, in general I can say I enjoyed the game. Preparing the ingredients, exploring the alchemy map, mixing them in the cauldron felt very relaxing... for some time. After that it felt more dull and tiresome and then I found myself considering rejecting requests from customers because I just didn't want to spend several minutes doing the same thing over and over and over again. I wish there was maybe a better kitchen mortar allowing faster preparation of ingredients.

The lategame is simply a painful grind. After you create the philosopher's stone and all the salts you only need to reach very high reputation level to finish the last chapter. That requires you to spend several dozens of in game days. Advancing from the 14th reputation level to 15th requires 1250 reputation points while typically one can gain about 45-50 per day. At the moment of creating all the substances you are most likely around 11th level of reputation. That means, if you want to complete the game, you will have to spend almost a hundred of in-game days doing the same thing every day, when all other stuff is done around day 40 and fun from playing evaporated by day 20. You still gain experience and skill points, but there's nothing more to spend them on, so brewing potions feels pretty pointless except for grinding the reputation.

Designers probably did not have an idea to create more challenges at this stage of the game.
I miss content. I miss challenges. I miss promised alcohol base for the potions. This game doesn't feel as if it is done.

If you just want a fantasy kitchen simulator to relax, the game is for you.

1) Early game you have very limited materials to work with, which in turn, limits your ability to explore the alchemy map. Unless you looked up guides to find out where a particular effect is, you won't have enough materials to fulfill your customer's requests, leaving them disappointed and dampening your progress. Not a great feeling.
2) Later in the game, you do have significantly more materials, but at the same time, the recipes you need to make are such a pain. Imagine having to spend 15-30 mins just to make a special potion to serve as ONE of the many ingredients needed to further your progress on a legendary recipe. It feels like work and is so tedious.
3) If you are playing with keyboard and mouse, this game will hurt your wrist. The game requires you to make constant movements with the mouse, such as moving up and down continuously to pound ingredients in the mortar, stirring motion on the pot ladle, clicking repeatedly when haggling, etc. I had to stop playing after a few sessions as my wrist had a persistent ache.
4) The game does a really poor job in explaining the mechanics to you. In order to do well in the game, you have to look up guides or watch playthroughs of more experienced players on youtube. 

On the whole, it is not a bad game. Just very niche and at least for me, can only be enjoyed in short spurts.",1704373379,1704532204,False,0,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

Overall it was solid with an interesting mechanic that was fun to puzzle through initially. It does start to feel quite grindy in the end game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in a cozy game, but this didn't have enough story or variety to make it feel with it for me. I plowed through to get the achievements, but without them I would not have gone on that long. 

There is a good/evil mechanic that is never explained, but it's incredibly easy to miss because of how little it effects the game play. 8t might be interesting if maybe certain effects were locked behind the different paths, of even if your store visually changed as you went further in each direction. As it stands, the difference of just npc dialogue of why they want a particular potion doesn't justify bothering to try the other path, or replying/continuing the game.

It's just mixing potions. Literally that's it. But the process of finding ingredients isn't very fun. There's a map and the ingredients make your potion go different directions to unlock the effects, except some were hard to find but seemed like they shouldn't be?

The use of a map and ingredient-as-pathway for discovering new potions is a stroke of genius and is an unexpectedly natural allegory.

The progression systems are both guided for those who need it, but open-ended, allowing you to do whatever you want and still get rewarded for new discoveries, no matter where you are in the game, provided you have the capacity to make it. The ""talent"" system for leveling up is another nice way of adding progression. Orders from customers become more complex as you progress, so the game has yet to feel stale. 

The art is beautiful, with a medieval-England aesthetic, albeit with much better rendering than most images that the public is likely accustomed to from memes and the like.

- Unexpectedly got addicted to this game. Map exploration requires trial and error, patience, minutia.
- Discovering effects is quite pleasing. Don't stress, mistakes are part of the process.
- Intuitive gameplay. It shows and doesn't tell. Found myself discovering new mechanics naturally while exploring, and without needing to look stuff up online.
- Pacing is very well balanced. But I'm generally a slow player, fwiw.
- Once getting enough ingredients in mid/end-game, you can truly experiment with salts, then plan, calculate, position.
- I find the path planning very fun, especially in the second map. You can use all whirlpools that teleport you to a certain point, and you can use the salts you crafted to modify your trajectory, unlocking infinite possibilities for optimal pathfinding and potion crafting.
- The game lets you develop your own style of pathfinding / crafting. You're free.
- I can spend hours simply re-organizing my recipe book (which becomes crucial (to me) for selling potions efficiently to challenging client requests.)

Вам предстоит пройти путь от никому неизвестного травника до архиалхимика, который познал все стихии. Что мне больше всего нравится в этой игре - лицезрение своей книги зелий в течении игры. Сперва это почти пустой блокнот, который разрастается в толстенную книженцию с кучей заметок. Так же доставляют фразочки клиентов, типа: ""у меня болит попа, не знаю почему, просто болит"". На получение всех ачивок ушло окло 30 часов.
Есть еще мног очего что можно улучшить:
- в данный момент сад выглядит просто как концепт, он в течение всей игры приносит вам в основном самые обычные растения, вы никак не можете повлиять ни на то что вырастет, ни как быстро, тут можно улучшать и улучшать;
- спальня алхимика - этот концепт еще более сырой чем сад, сюда мы приходим исключительно поспать, а раз там больше ничег оне происходит, можно было бы просто сделать кнопку конца дня (в лейт гейме было бы оч полезно);
- алхимическая лаборатория - тут мы изучаем самые крутые алхимические рецепты, которые в конце наших исследований приведут к философскому камню. Неплохо, но скучновато;
- сама карта создания алхимических зелий - тут все хорошо, видел, что добавят изготовление на вине, отлично, больше жидкостей - гибче и интереснее геймплей. Тут однако стоит переработать водовороты, через некоторое время становится понятно куда скорее всего привед тебя очередной водоворот, особенно если он стоит возле закрытых полостей с бонусом на +240 опыта. Так же ждем когда добавится возможность улучшать наши инструменты - котел, ступку, ложку ... отдельное окошко с ними уже есть, ждем когда оно станет полезнее чем ничего;
- ну и ""локация"" приема клиентов - единственная визуально непроработанная. Это просто белый пустой фон - просто поле для творчеста и улучшений, ну самое простое это типичная косметика покупаемая за деньги (в лейте деньги некуда девать). Надо добавить разнообразия посетителей, как их внешнего вида, так и реплик, они уже становятся заученными наизусть к середине игры.
- таланты. Тут нужен полный редизайн;
- музыка. Главная композиция шикарна, я слушал ее около 20 часов. Да, тут всего 1 композиция;
- ну и отдельно хотел бы сказать про лейт гейм. Первые 40% игры очень бодрые на мой взгляд: ты периодически растешь как алхимик, открывая тем самым новые виды растений, клиентов и заказов. Ты изучаешь карту, сохраняешь новые рецепты. А потом вдруг ты переходишь к гонке за репутацией. Потому что у тебя уже есть философский камень и соль, а до 15 уровня алхимика еще добрых 4-5 уровня репутации качать, и это боль. Боль потому что ты всю игру будешь получать от 4 до 7 звезд, а терять на последних уровнях за невыполненый заказ - 9. Чтобы вы понимали, с 14 на 15 уровень алхимика надо 1250 опыта, к тебе приходят в средне 8 болванчиков, каждый в среднем приносит + 5, т.е. при хорошем раскаде за игровой день ты набираешь + 40 опыта. Это если ты выполнил все заказы, и желательно 3звездными шклянками (за 1звездочную доют 2 опыта), и не было сложных заказов, где есть 1-2 строгих правил выполнения. Я утт не говорю про возможно отсутствующие реагенты. В мид гейме иногда была нехватка камней, так как там ты часто заигрываешь с алхимической машиной и некоторые рецепты требует от тебя всю карту по кругу обойти и это дорого. В лейте у тебя условно бесконечные ресурсы и куча никому ненужных денег и все что тебе надо для скорейшего получения наивысшего ранга алхимика - это создать н-ное количество различных зелий, в моем случае по 10 штук 20-ти самых популярных зелий, спамить правой кнопкой мыши как только ты прочитал первых 2-3 слова болванчика (ты уже знаешь что он хочет), потоврить 7-9 раз, вернуться в спальню поспать, на утро каждого 2-3дня можно забежать в сад вырвать сорняки и давай по-новой. В этом марафоне мой совет - сделайте 1-звездочные рецепты сложных зелий - ткх которые надо крутить для получения идеала (зелье вдохновения, удачи, аромата ...), так как соль довольно быстро закончится в этой гонке, а создавать новую как минимум влом. Потому что если вы и сохраняли все рецепты ингридиентов (как делал я), все равно нельзя сохранить рецепт той же соли, ни в цветках, ни в зельях, чтобы хоть как-то ускорить этот процесс, кооторый во-второй раз уже не захватывает. Мой путь от 11 до 15уровня алхимика занял около 3 часов, 3 часов машинального быстрого кликания по схеме (тут так же хочется добавить о полезности закупки растений не по одному, а по 10 или все сразу, создание зелий по 5-10 штук за раз, ускорение/ скипание медленного подхода нуждающихся, быстрая кнопка завершения дня, быстроее перемалывание растений - дайте блендер :) и прочее).

Кто дочитал до этого момента, вам либо нечего делать, либо любите графоманство. 

Игра хорошая, и в ней еще мног очег оможно улучшить, что сделает ее намнооого лучше. Если эта писанина доберется до разрабов или приближенных, пальцы тыкали не зря. Всем удачных экспериментов, и не забывайте докупать страницы.

Pluses: 

- Unique game mechanic - and that counts for a lot for me. Depicting the process of inventing and brewing alchemical potions as a journey around a hazard-lined map is an interesting one, and it allows you to come to a variety of solutions using the materials you have on hand. 

- Pleasantly off-the-clock. Take as long as you like to fulfill a customer request, brew a tricky potion, or discover a new alchemical element. 

- Cozy in a relaxed, tinker-around-with-this way. 

Minuses: 

- It recognizes that you need some sort of save points on the map, but the mechanic is clunky and you often can't save exactly where you want to be - at least, I couldn't see a way to save a position that wasn't a completed potion. 

- After a while, it does get a bit same-y, especially given the lack of non-potion save points. I began to groan when I saw a long-distance brew, and that told me that I was nearing the end of my enjoyment of the game. 

- The tabs system for your potion book is handy, but it gets crowded and harder to use as you brew more potions. Some sort of organization system would be helpful, like second book or whatever.",1704237650,1704237650,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Thankfully, unlike those games Potion Craft doesn't include any up-selling, micro-payments or even a wait requirement. That last can be both a positive and a negative though. 

The game proceeds in days, with each day gaining new plants from the garden to harvest and other resources from peddlers to buy. You are likely to play five to ten days at the start simply to get a hold on everything the game does. However, my advice is:

- Stop playing after every in-game day or two. 

This way you the routine repetition of the game doesn't become monotonous. Potion Craft is fun and can be addicting, just like the online farming games. If you like a game which will slow you down and make you think, Potion Craft is built for you!

- Repetitive after some time
- No clear objective (basically you just grind potions to complete the chapters)

It took me 33 hours to complete 100% of the game, including all achievements. It was really fun in the beginning and it was nice to discover all the parts of the map and all the new effects I could make, but after some time it just gets too repetitive and you start to do things ""automatically"" without thinking too much about it. The game doesn't have an end, so even after you complete everything, you can keep playing and doing the same thing over and over again. There isn't a linear story so, in the end, there isn't an end.

The game is great, I don't know if I would have paid full price on this game, but that is coming from me, who has only done that twice  in the last 10 years.  I think I would have paid full price, I didn't I got it on sale but the fact that I got 60 hours in this game means it was worth full price.

The games not perfect but it looks like there are some awesome updates coming out the end of 2024 and I'm excited for them.  I wish I would see the new base maps and talent trees before then because I think it would be a great addition for today now.

I would say you can get enough enjoyment not 100% this game even after like 30 or 40 hours of just casually  doing a few days worth of potions.  Or you can play this game though a whole weekend.

There where some NPC's that I think I made mad and missed on my GOOD guy run, I'm going to do a new GOOD guy run, there is also a BAD guy run.   I don't know if there is a ""Neutral"" run.

The end game is missing a tiny bit, it is just on repeat for like day 70 to day 130+  and that you can grind though really fasts like in 2 hours of just mass making potions in advance and just speeding the days.  But I took a slower more casual approach to it.

Overall  I think somebody casual speed running this game might it 100% achievement unlocks in like 20 hours, you can probably do it in 8 hardcore style.  But you also can enjoy this game taking it slowly, solving the riddles, and unlocking the hidden stuff all on your own. That's what I did and I got a 60 hours of good enjoyment out of this game.  Hears to hoping for 100s of more hours of enjoyment but I think i have to wait for the big content update.",1704003207,1704008378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also I know it's meant to be a casual game but I'd certainly like a mainline story to keep me more engaged especially through the late-game instead of making the same stones over and over again in the alchemist machine and being forced by a soul-less chapter books to make useless void salt. Alchemist machine is just PURE tedious and offers no new fun things after you've unlocked everything.

Being forced by a objective book to make those, which I don't technically need to nor do I want to(why would I want to make life salt and void salt?) and getting no real rewards for them makes me feel like my action is worthless. All the NPCs lack agency as well and don't really contribute to the story, nor does my action and choices affect anything. The art style is great and the music and game-play is relaxing. With a better (or rather, any, considering that there's almost none right now) story and mainline objective it has the potential to be really immersive and non-tiring.

Also there's some balancing issue as well. How can a potion with a 180-degree rotation that I spent 500 units of moonsalt to make only worth a couple hundreds more than the level 1 weak version? Moonsalt costs over 20 potions to make so adding moonsalt to any customer-requested potions never made any sense.

Also don't know if's intentional game design or not but the garden is pretty pointless starting from the middle game all the way to the late game. Oil map is also too easy and lacking in new content.

1210320,154779373,76561198161496758,0,10,142,0,142,1703911209,"WOW, I am so disappointed in this game. As a fan of dorky little sim games, I had been looking forward to this one for a while. I waited for a sale (bless you Steam, or I would have lost even more money on this game) and only paid $8.99 for this but it still feels like an L. 

I'm not entirely sure what the developers of this game were thinking... You have this wonderful idea for a potion crafting and selling game and, instead of focusing completely on the actual crafting part of potions, you tied ""crafting"" (I use the term loosely here) to a map and exploring said map? And TRUST ME, I hear you when you say ""Well wait, crafting but based on map exploration sounds kind of neat!""; I was with you there buddy, trust me, but let me try to explain through a VERY long winded review. Buckle in.

Now let me nip this in the bud right quick: the map is just that, a map. A paper map. A pirate's map. X marks the spot and all. It's cute and it fits with the style of the game, but you yourself do not explore it, and all movement on this map is tied completely to the loose term of ""crafting"" I'll be using throughout this review. You put your ingredients into the cauldron, be it crushed or not, and then stir to make the potion bottle move across the map. That's the gameplay loop. There are also whirlpools you can choose to move with (they will move you a small distance away) and skeletons/bones(?) on the map that will basically instantly kill you. The crafting happens when you find a bottle on the map and ""craft"" your potion in that spot. It does not matter the ingredients you put in it to get you there, so long as you got there.
This itself is baffling to me. You created a crafting game where the gameplay loop is move around a map? And perhaps I could see /some/ merit in it if you had to use specific ingredients to even craft the potion when you got to it on the map, maybe? But you don't even need to do that, just any old ingredient that will get you from point A to point B will do. 

And then there's the stuff on the map. Jeez bro, what is with this? Was the map too easy to navigate so the devs had to quickly slap some stuff ontop of it that would diversify the experience and drag out the runtime? Navigating the map already takes ample resources to get from A to B; any you'd like, yes, but ample of them. They all have designated move patters associated with them - one item always goes to the left in a silly squiggly way, while another item will always go right in a silly squiggly way and so on - so you already need to use your resources sparingly and in an optimal pattern to get where you need to go on the completely fogged/hidden map. That's well and fine, and could be a fun way to do things: use an item associated with ""wind"" that goes in the direction of potions all associated with wind and discover new ""wind""esk potions. But... then they slapped these skeletons or bones or whatever the fuck they are onto the map and... they just fail your potion almost instantly whenever your giant potion bottle even slightly touches it? And so what that does is it fails your potion and sends you all the way back to the starting point of the map. All your resources used and all your time wasted. And sure, there's a dilute option that moves your potion a little bit, but all it does is move it back to the start point, so in most situations it isn't helping you. If anything, why not make the dilute move you slightly away from the closest skeleton or fail state or whatever it is? It makes the map extremely hard to navigate because, remember, we only have a few set navigation patters to choose from. It also makes it so, when I need to go around a skeleton, I have to use ingredients that I feel would NEVER be in the potion I am attempting to craft (aka so it will move me in a completely different direction on the map). The whole thing feels counter intuitive and, if that weren't bad enough, they throw more at you on this map! Remember the whirlpools I mentioned earlier? (It's okay if you don't, it's been a minute.) Well they have this neat little ability where they can teleport you to another part of the map nearby. Love that! Makes navigating those skeletons a lot easier right? They're probably designed in a way to help the player, as a mechanic, go in the right direction with less resources. WRONG. It's like I said, the map was designed to be counter intuitive. The whirlpools almost always made me feel like a fool for using them. On the perfect path to a potion and want to see where this'll take you? Assuming it'll be closer to the potion? IDIOT xD! BEGONE INTO THE SKELETON PILE! ..... Like... why? Thanks for the gut punch niceplay. :\ 

Speaking of counter intuitive, what's with that tutorial? I'm sorry but LOL what the actual fuck was that tutorial? You teach the player what a mortar and pestle does and then don't teach us about: the whirlpools, the skeletons, the diluting, the auto-craft feature, the reputation system, haggling, the gifting mechanic, whatever was in the basement idk I refuse to play more to find out, etc. And listen, that's not to say that I didn't appreciate them telling me that crushing the ingredients makes them more potent, but you had a whole text box for what I just said in 7 words and then no tutorial for that entire list I just typed up. Why? You already built the UI for the tutorial boxes and everything, all you had to do was type like 10 more things. I'm about to do a whole lot more typing than those tutorials would have taken and I'm doing it for free just to shit atop your game so like... I think it would have been worth your while.
Meanwhile, the real tutorial of the game is given to you via the quest log. Read what to do, do it, book crosses it out, you get progress toward a perk. It works, but it's just so poorly delivered. The perks are very bland by the way. No idea why that's even in the game. Pressure to have it like other game do? Idk it's boring and useless.

It's like... I want to give this game more credit cause I love the art, music, overall concept, good chunk of the writing, and some of the smaller concepts within the game but.. it's just so hidden by a bunch of annoyances that I can't excuse. 
For example: 
Love having a reputation system, but not only did it take me at least an hour to even realize it was there (because again, no tutorial, never pointed it out) once I did finally figure out it was there and how to make it go up or down I not only didn't understand what the point to having a better reputation was but I didn't understand what was making some sales increase my reputation while some decreased it. For example: I had a pretty bad reputation by the time I noticed it was a thing. I fulfilled all requests that came in and chalked up all the extremely bad requests as just quirky writing and moved on, but found out that wasn't the case and started trying to improve my score and reject people with negative requests. I thought the game might be less black and white about things and I fulfilled some requests that I told myself were ""morally grey"" and should be allowed. The game did not agree. Okay, that's fine. I will only give the most goodest and neutralest of patrons my beautiful potions. ""NAY!"" said the game, very loudly into my reputation meter, ""-6 YOU FIEND!"" The fuck?! The dude had an almost identical request to one that gave me a positive score like 3 customers ago. I don't get it. I just don't.

idk I'm running out of characters and at the end of the day, it's just a game that disappointed me. I just don't want someone that was expecting what I was expecting to waste their money and be sad afterwards. This was 1 of 4 purchases I gave myself for the Steam Winter Sale and I feel a bit cheated with all these lame, overused systems in a potentially cool game.

This game is a quite a grind on top of straight out throwing you to the wolves in the beginning. (The ""tutorial"" is a joke.)
Once you waste all your potion ingredients trying to figure out what you are supposed to be doing, your customers are pissed off at you because you don't have the ingredients needed to make anything they want.

Now it looks like you don't want to help the villagers so your morality drops and you get nothing but criminal customers.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1703889047,1703889047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A bit too basic but I look forward to a more advanced and engaging sequel.

-My current frustrations:
too much RNG when it comes to ingredients, it would be nice to tell the npcs you are looking for certain ones or place orders. Anything to influence what ingredients you can get. Rare or hard to get ones I can understand but more common ones shouldn't be so hit or miss unless the game had a seasons or event system that influence the game

-Every single person is a master alchemist with x-ray vision. They know the potion you are giving them and what's in it way better than you do.
I think this is a huge thing the game (and other games in this genre) can improve on. The player should be able to sell whatever potion they want to whomever and doing so should influence the game. I understand from a rudimentary perspective why it is how it is, but they could do so much with changing this.  Selling a fake poison to a criminal and the like. Should it affect your popularity and reputation? Absolutely. Also, why are people with minor pains demanding lvl 3 healing potions? They should be demanding lvl 1's and complaining if you are trying to upsell them a lvl 2 or 3.

It is a simulator so there isn't any in-depth story, and music on loop can get old after awhile.  All in all not a bad game.

Gameplay Rating:
7/10

I recommend picking this up on sale.  The full price seems just a little high, but a sale of $15 or less would be a good time to buy.  You can sink a few hours into it at least.  Maybe more if you have a better attention span than I do.

Explore the map to find unknown potions, figure out how to make those potions with the least amount of ingredients, how to make the highest grade or combined potions and satisfy customers who sometimes make special requests.

Once beyond the main menu, instructions are generally pictorial which can be a bit puzzling. However, a large part of this game is all about exploring and experimenting. All the herbs, mushrooms and crystals have a designated path so being creative in path building to the target is a necessary requirement.

Most strategy is involved with the customers and making money. Though money is not the main focus, it is needed for alchemy machine upgrades, ingredients (herbs, mushrooms, crystals, and especially the much needed potion recipe paper) that need to be purchased. There several merchants that stop by on a regular basis (one merchant per day) who offer specific items. Which items, when, and how much is purchased is all part of the overall game strategy. It is possible to haggle with both merchants and customers (which is explained in-game) but can be difficult for those with slow reflexes. Haggling is not required expect for one chapter list requirement.   

There are ten chapters total, each with a list of requirements to complete. Any requirement from any chapter once completed is recorded. This can be accessed at any time so progress can be tracked. Achievements are game play based and most, if not all, can be achieved while playing. The two reputation achievements are the only ones that need special attention and most likely some grinding.  

Throughout the game play there are progress points earned which can be used to increase money received from customers, increase the rate of map clearance, increase number of level point books and haggling ability.

Highly recommended for crafting buffs especially since there is no grinding needed for progress, only creative thinking. Plenty of crafting to do, lots of exploring needed and enough strategy to keep busy and not be bored. Easy enough for all with focused requirements for progress.

The tutorial teaches you all the ways you can make potions and each potion is unique in its own way because of the ingredients used. The way the game works is that the potions and effects you want to craft are marked on a map, and each ingredient goes a certain direction and certain distance- some have very cool unique shapes and pathways. Use these ingredients to get to your desired effects and make your positions! 

I chose to be evil and do only evil potions, but you can do a good path or a neutral path too. There is so many different dialogues and different customers depending on your route you pick. You can also say no if you don't want to help somebody so don't worry about evil customers wanting to ruin your good reputation- boot them out!

The ingredients decide the way that you play, you move with the ingredients. 
After 20+ hours it gets a bit repetitive, and then you discover the there only two maps, and doing the last few alchemy upgrades are a chore.

In short:
In the beginning you'd be short of cash but especially ingredients. 
Later you'd get some ingredients, but not the ones you actually need. 
Then you get enough of the basic ones. 
Then you'd get exotic ones with weird path which are cool. 
Do you use own imagination with how the potion might taste when you toss in a spicy shroom and couple of hairy bananas... or turd shrooms haha.
There are MANY ways to play the game and to make potions.

So before the 20 hour mark this game is a lot of fun! I think I picked up during a sale when I bought a bunch of crafty choppy games haha. I enjoyed this one a lot.

For the end-game however...
I'm at 40 hours and lingered a lot. I do think the game can be beat, casually, in a shorter play time.
But I have a book full of potions, tiers, and their alternative ingredients, and min-maxed the cost-to-product ratio.
And basically saved all alchemy material potions with their alternatives ingredients.
Honestly, it becomes a massive chore to the philosophers stone and it's salt ,which trivializes the game, but honestly I already have 100+ of every material, why bother.
So the end game kinda sucks as you're spending that much time on the first map, which is a double map tbh, inside ring and outside ring; but you're always using the same passages to get to the outside. More maps which can provide easier alternative plz!
Second map is fun but eh, can only be used for a few ingredients and unlocks pretty late. 
First map dominates 90% of the alchemy ingredients.
Make an ethanol map orso (spirited). Or hot n cold map.

No idea why they made the garden update; you don't care after alchemist level 10 orso when the merchants come with 100+ ingredients and I have money for days. 
Tbh wished I could waste the money on something more prestigious instead of 999+ shrooms. Maybe, getting the merchants to work for me instead. Because the player is this big money sucker, who gets their money from the wealthy people.
The wealthy (good karma) just want to ''hallucinate'' get ''inspired'' and have ''libido'', Or make a horse go fast so they could win races. And a couple of knights needing copium.
Or fix a broken lock with explosive, I dunno how many time I've sold that potion I ran out of all ingredients, use your imagination about that; either clumsy people, a key stealing elf, or they just want to see a lock go BOOM. 
At this point, I would have the healthcare-organisation and IRS at my door, for supplying ''re-creative potions'' and getting all that cash.

So new maps plz.

If you enjoy the cozy atmospheres of medieval taverns, the pleasure of recipe building and optimizations, and the convenience of a game that can be paused at any moment - don't hesitate to try Potion Craft!

The art for this game is beautiful and the concept is pretty simple - combine herbs to travel around a map and generate potions for customers. In your spare time, buy herbs from merchants and brew potions in the basement to work your way to creating the philosopher's stone! I've had this game for almost a year now, and played it on and off through the year. I will say that it's easy to play this game, but difficult to play [i]well[/i]. I've held my breath more than once as i tipped the water bucket, hoping and praying I create a [b]strong[/b] potion instead of a regular potion. I've scoffed at customers for asking for unreasonable amounts of an herb i don't normally use to make their potion, and I've practically weeped trying to balance my stores of herbs with my insatiable curiosity for those hidden areas of my map. Looking back from the top of the learning curve feels good with this game :)

Even though I've felt satisfied enough with the current features, I'm impressed by the dedication and creativity of the developers. They are hard at work with new mechanics like gardening systems and other fun aspects that I'm looking forward to playing!

To ""complete"" the game, you need to craft 6 stone and their associated salt, each time it consumes the previous stone version or the one you just crafted which mean you need to make the first stone 6 times, the second x4, etc. Once you complete a stone, you craft more unique potion with strange combination for the next one.

While the concept is nice and it look good it's basically just an endless grind. You buy page to save your recipe, serve customer with all their unique and complex request that aren't worth it most of the time, then buy ingredient and upgrade to just make more of the same potion that can be done with one click.

(depending on personal opinions)

Graphics: Awesome
Very nice graphics. Wonderful style and really suits the theme of the game.

Audio: Great
Pretty good soundtrack. Not outstanding but nonetheless nice, matches the game pretty well.

Plot: Nice
What does exist of the plot is pretty interesting, but it doesn't come up very often. More story would be way more engaging, enjoyable and negate repetition but so far I haven't noticed a lot of it.

Gameplay: Decent
Can get very repetitive at times but it is really fun to mess around with and just do whatever you feel like. Can also be nice as a fairly mindless, chill activity after a hard day.

Themes: Sometimes Mature
Most of the time it is tame, but occasionally you'll get out of the blue s*xual references. There is also implied violence, including domestic violence, and mentions of theft, alc*hol and murder. 

Skills & Benefits: Average
Includes money and haggling, and good strategy when purchasing the resources you need is important, as well as saving your coin. It is pretty effective at helping people lose all faith and trust in the good of human beings.

It can be pretty enjoyable and if it's on a good sale consider it, but it isn't currently worth it at full price.

The central point is that you explore the alchemy map.  Find new effects, learn how to create all sorts of fascinating potions and then sell them to people.  The problem is, you'd better plan to restart a few times or just use a guide, because if you're poking around the map by tossing ingredients in just looking for something new then you're going to run out very, very quickly.  Really.  Your garden doesn't produce a whole lot each day, you don't have the cash to buy tons of ingredients from vendors even if you work on your trade and haggle skills, and even if you did have the cash their stock is generally small with limited quantities of each item.

If you aren't restarting or using a guide, you will come to a point that you can't produce the potions that people want.  Someone's after a potion to grow plants, but you have only a handful of ingredients to go ""east"" with.  Now all you can do is tell them to take a hike, costing your store in reputation and fame and not really doing anything to help your ingredient situation - hope you enjoy burning several days just restocking while people spread the news that you won't help customers.",1702758262,1702758262,False,2,0,0.485706210136413574,0,True,False,False

Well, almost. Only complaint is that the compose rose on the map panel isn't even mentioned and easy to miss that you can interact with it. Basically, you can sort your herbs by compass direction they go! Instead, for the first 9 hours I played this, I was hovering back and forth in my herb collection to see which would be best herb to help me explore. Way more efficient sorting by compass direction, so its a moot point now for me, but just sharing since it is not covered in the tutorial.

Trying to get Popularity Level 15 is just not fun because at that point in the game you have every recipe for every potion saved and its just clicking through menus. The customers with requirements for potions only make it worse because you lose double the popularity you gain on average by turning them away. So it's just a complete slog. Another annoyance I ran into was through bad RNG I was constantly short on many of the gems that make the high tier potions possible (mostly frost sapphires). My final big late game annoyance was remaking previous alchemy machine salts is just SO ANNOYING. I would have dropped the game if I didn't add a mod that allows you to save the alchemy machine recipes. I understand it's a feature that's intended to be added, but its not in the game now so I can complain about it.   

Hopefully future updates eventually arrive and change my opinion.

When your potion map visibility improves, you can see the hint of a new potion in the distance.  The journey to get there involves destroying precious resources (if you're less than competent like me) and a mad insane dash, but when you reach it it's beautiful.  I really feel like a crazy scientist with a brand new crazy ""invention.""

But then there's the ""job"" part of the game, where you have to remake the same old potions over and over again.  Resource management becomes very important then, and it can get very tedious having to figure out when customers speak in riddles.  A guy who wanted to not be tired won't accept dexterity or swiftness potions, but strength ones instead.  Sure, he came in with a big sword and shield...  But surely a dexterity potion would help him with endurance!

It also seems like the devs have promised a lot of features and updates that just haven't appeared yet.  Granted the game was released less than a year ago so they aren't *too* negligent, I still remember waiting for seven years for Kentucky Route Zero to finish, but it's not that good of a look when a dev promises a lot and doesn't deliver for a while.  Lots of games have stopped updating over the years, makes an end user nervous when another game they kind of like might have the same fate.

All in all, wait for a sale.  It's a fun experience but the ""you're a crazy chemist making new potions and tossing resources into the void to do it"" and ""you're a pharmacist who has to make medicinal potions or rat poison for people while maintaining your stock of ingredients to do it"" parts of the game are in direct conflict.

Look it was fun to begin with, learning the new tricks, exploring new areas, strategizing and optimizing the recipes and potions, yeah I enjoyed it to start.  But  it really quickly turns into a chore...

Here's the main fallback in my view.  There's hundreds of different ingredients, meaning countless possible solutions to make any potion you want for your customers.  Many recipes will use 10, 15, even 20 different ingredients to make your potion, after you painstakingly stir and mix and tediously path to your desired potion.  It's fine the first time, but then you need to make more of the same potion and you're missing 1 of the needed 15 ingredients, so you can't use your quick-create button. Instead, you spend 10 minutes making the SAME potion, tediously, and then enjoy repeating this for the VAST majority of time you spend in this game. 

I held out hope that this problem might be resolved and the game could get more fun and interesting over time.  It did not. I enjoy ""shop-like"" games but this was a struggle.

~

While my review is positive, I do have one major critique of whats there, and possible thoughts, ideas related to it; I'm not sure if the developer will see this positive review, but in the small chance that they might I will offer what I believe is constructive criticism. If your interested in my thoughts, here they are:

If I had to say one bad thing about the game its in relation to the ""morality"" system in place. Its more of a of a should ""I sell to straight up cartoon villains"" or should ""I sell to regular people."" sort of thing, which just feels silly on the face of it.

IMO is its more comical then not. ""Got anything I can murder my brother with?"" is just not a thing someone is going to ask a random ""potion maker""; I understand that the idea is to make it possible to separate the ""good"" clients, from the villainous ones. But it feels too silly to me to be even remotely believable. Surely they would just ask for ""Your strongest poison to take care of a pest problem."" right? Otherwise if you were really a good person wouldn't you be calling the guard on them or something?

Actual morality aside, Game-play wise, it functions as a pass/fail system towards moving your shop towards the intended clientele you wish to service. Moving towards ""good"" takes a long time and making sure you don't accidentally hand anyone trying to kill their nephew poison. Where as you can swing full evil in a fraction of the time by kicking all your regular customers out. I don't know that any specific aspect of this is ""bad"" but it doesn't feel very ""fun"" either since most of the time is incredibly obvious if they are villain or not. When its not it feels more like you were tricked by how not obvious that one person was; Though this is my own opinion and therefore not universal.

As it is it just stands out as a glaring disconnect in my mind when I think about the game.

I'd find it more interesting if you could setup a different shop with the entirely separate clientele in mind. Either via two play thoughts where you can select who you want to sell to in the beginning, or some other mechanic... say an after hours back door in the alley way or something. I can see some players choosing to not sell to these villains, while others might want to only sell to them.

The existing system is more or less designed to move towards one of the two extremes anyway, so separating the two client bases might be more interesting if you could maybe moonlight as a villain yourself, since villain to villain this type of overt dialog makes more sense. So it wouldn't be ""weird"" if simply spoken in a different context.

Or maybe villains could be a ""harder mode"" as a second play-though, where if they fail to complete their ""task"", they might seek some form of revenge, say they might come back demanding you pay for your failure to deliver the most potent poison you could. Maybe they rob you, or cause you some other problem like poison your garden for a few days.

As it is the two groups of clients are only different in what specific things they ask for, and there's size-able overlap, and as more clients and requests are added this will likely only become more prevalent if its not paired with other effects. So adding more unique gameplay for villain vs town-person could add depth to the game.

Or dropping morality/villiany entirely, another possibility is to do something like ""faction approval"" instead. Where you help or refuse service to different ""guilds"" For instance an example, ""thieves guild"" might want you to add ""slowness"" or ""sleepyness"" to the city guard's night vision potion. This could hurt your relation with the guards, but earn you extra money from the thieves, and good, or bad relations with the guilds might change how many customers you get, and how much they are willing to pay. There's a lot of potential for different interesting, and even small ""stories"" in this sort of system.

I'm sure there are other options, and possibilities as well, and some of this may not fit very well with the general vibe of the game, so I understand if its entirely ignored; Its not like I sat down to write this after hours of brainstorming and considering all of the game-play considerations, this is truly me just vomiting my thoughts into the review. I guess I'll stop now since I've rambled far too much as is.

I really do want this to be the best version of the the game it can be, because there's a lot to like in here, and I think there is likely some better way to make use of the two different client bases that the game has.",1701399878,1701399878,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of few games I play that actually works better with a tablet of some sort rather than the mouse due to the way the game mechanics work - that said, there's no need to go out and obtain a tablet of your own just for this game (i just happen to have a pair of tablets from before due to my other gaming and educational experiences)

While there are always issues with every game you play, there are some hints and pitfalls a potential player should keep in mind;

- effects on completed potions can *not* be changed when using said potion as a starting point for another, you can only add ingredients to reach the second or third (up to fifth) desirable effect.

- in light of the above mentioned point, it's better to save your desired potion prior to heating thus completing it.  This will allow you to use the ""continue brewing"" option while permitting changing the original effect's level (assuming you saved the recipe when it reached tier 3 status, downgrading from here is just diluting with the proper fluid), depending on the customer's requirements, before continuing to the final product if there was a requirement of extra effects.

The reason for suggesting saving incomplete recipes that have reached your desired tier is simply to avoid having to create potions from scratch, especially if you need to make something that only required a few extra ingredients and steps to reach... using a completed potion as a base would mean you are stuck with whatever potion you used and chances are you wouldn't even be able to make the desired potion that originally started from a completed potion - result? you have to start from square one having just wasted all the materials to create both the original base and the unusable final product... an expensive mistake if you're running low on the ingredients you used.

Also, by using an incomplete potion recipe as a base, you can skip the extra work required to reach the incomplete base due to the marker being moved instantaneously from the centre to the previously marked point, ie if the potion you need to create was a long way from the centre, an incomplete potion would save you a lot of time & effort depending on the distance (incomplete potion A requires 10 mins to reach, while completed potion B requires 20 mins to reach, or use A to reduce the production time to just 10 mins with less effort required in total)",1701323178,1701323178,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Potion Craft is supposedly a game where you research an alchemy as you brew potions, gather components, and rebuild an alchemy machine to eventually discover a philosopher's stone.
Potions you craft, you sell to customers, as you gain fame and reputation. That's it - these are two different concept, cause if you sell stuff to bad people who want to do bad things, you will be famous - but [i]differently[/i], you know.
You would also gain experience unlocking skills and improving your craft.
The game is, indeed, drawn beautifully.

However, great concept never found any depth in the implementation. You would see an entire game look in LITERALLY first minute of your game - pick a resource, drop it into bowl, grind it, blow the fire, and may be pour some water - all this to navigate some sort of alchemic map, where potions, obstacles and experience points are located. You may save a recipe, so next time you wouldn't have to do the chore. There is nothing more to the map. Alchemy should have secrets, right? Well, no.
There are some more resources rather than 4 basic ones, but they do not give you any benefit or interesting interaction, they offer you just slightly different path on the map.
Repairing the alchemy machine does not unlock anything either, you just have an alchemy machine repaired, that is all.
Skills are uninspiring, more visibility on the map, more gold from sale, more reputation gain...
But then again, gaining reputation is not really rewarding, come on, more customers per day? Why would I even bother, if I can just start the next day with a click of a button?

Wake up, get herbs on the garden,answer your customers, make potions they want, close shop, (fiddle around the alchemy map if you have resources), sleep repeat. It's so simple yet very addictive, the best part about the game is crafting the potions themselves.

once you get popularity 5-6 however, your demand will start to increase, and special ways to make potions become available for extra dosh, making new ways to complete the day, and you have to buy herbs and mushrooms from merchants to keep up demand. the game is a lot of fun.

the most complex part about the game is potion crafting itself which is using the right ingredients to navigate the alchemy map and using all your tools to navigate and craft the perfect balanced potion you want,(water to match the potion just right,Mortar&Pistle to increase the effects of your ingredients,Walking inside rift portals to create shortcuts,using crystals to avoid rot camps which will destroy your potion and so on...)

you do have to explore,try and fail to explore the alchemy map yourself in order to find new potions, which means some failures, walking inside rifts that lead no where, and having ingredients that can go in all directions(think of it as a compass) otherwise you can get starved in order to find some potions that are only in a certain direction.

while trading is pretty much very straight foward and simple, its more of a case of [b] you deciphering what the hell your client wants by their anecdote story [/b] and you selling them the right potion. You either sell the potion, or you haggle, which is just a QTE mini-game but Incredibily necessary once you start buying raw materials so you can get a 40-50% off discount on bulk buys.

one thing annoyed me a lot when reading [b]negative reviews[/b] of this game.
[i] Many people on other reviews are complaining that the game takes a long time to do updates [/i] and honestly, that argument holds little water to me, since the game is already 1.0, and for me any game that reaches 1.0 is considered complete, sure every game could always use more updates and be more feature complete, but thats just unrealistic expectations and people beeing needy and demanding, and i can see why since this game was originally an [i] Early access[/i] game.

people are complaining the game has no story but imo the game dosen't need one, its cute and nice when its there, but thats not why i play games for, its for the gameplay. also complaints about beeing grindy, which also hold no water to me, because if its grindy but the grind is fun, then it dosent matter.

overall great game, this is a chill endless game that you can just boot, make some potions, sell, and have a great time.",1701101106,1701101931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having said that I would add that late game (later chapters) are quite grindy and often the reward for going to the late game isn't really worth the effort to get there, I have put a lot of hours into this game and I think it was a great time but I can also say that you could play this game for 10 hours really and you'll probably by then have experienced all the game has to offer with a few exception.

Gameplay is fun but slightly repetitive although that didn't bother me, artstyle is great and so is the music.

Can't wait to see what happens with the game in future updates if and when they come, I'll certainly come back to this game even after doing everything it has to offer currently.

I recommend this game especially on sale, but it's not perfect.

There a 2 main things this game needs to make it practically perfect.

The game needs a more story telling. After a while you start to recognize the prompt's and dish out what needs to be served. It would be incredible if the game would send you letters from nearby towns reporting strange events or disasters caused by magic, or customers talking about the results of your potions you sold them.

More game play concerning other things besides making potions. Like creating your alchemy garden (Which i believe is an up coming feature.) 
Using alchemy on more than just creating the philosopher stone maybe transforming ingredients.
Using potions on customers, whether it's a poison potion instead of health killing the customer greatly affecting the story and your reputation, or simply giving a customer a love potion to help with your bargaining skills. This type of interaction could affect the story, and allow you to play with the tools you already have to continue exploring the world.

Overall this game is fantastic, but it's a little shallow on the content side. It's great if you just need to relax, but it's not going to draw you in (in my experience,) it'll be a game you boot up for some light fun.",1700963644,1700963644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main gameplay loop is picking ingredients to toss into the cauldron to move the potion around the alchemy map to hit the effects you want to add to your potion. Different ingredients move you in different directions and follow different paths, and you can affect the total distance by grinding them more or less. Ingredients cost money (you get some for free every in-game day) and you need to earn money by selling potions, but the game economy is extremelly forgiving, so you can pretty much do whatever you want. One negative point here is that the game doesn't really change as you keep playing and becomes repetitive after a while. The graphical style is interesting and the music is unremarkable but fitting.

Outside of the unique visual style, the biggest strength of the game is how tactile it feels. You feel the difference between grinding herbs or crystals and pouring water into the caldron.

On the other hand, it doesn't offer a sand box. Meaning, you can't grind both things at the same time, for example. It works more like a puzzle game. And as many puzzle games, once you figure out the rules, the game becomes less interesting.

The recipe book in particular, trivialize the mechanical aspect of the game and makes it a series of repetitive chores. Fortunately, the game doesn't overstay its welcome, and it is very short and sweet. Because of that, the negative aspects don't hinder the good and relaxing experience.

People like me who sincerely enjoy repeating the same task over and over again, not expecting anything to change, but slowly chipping away at clear, if not slow, forward progression. And people who watched the trailer or gameplay, heard the sound that the mortar & pestle make when used, and felt their brain light up with serotonin.

To be absolutely clear, this game can get repetitive very easily, and frustrating at times.

Repetitive in that you're continuously putting the same puzzle pieces in different positions and fine-tuning delicate actions all the time, but also in that after a while... The game just runs out of unique dialogue. Granted, this doesn't happen early, but it does happen eventually. Also, the actual final challenge of the game isn't a puzzle, it's resource-management and logistics. Chaos from even the simplest source can ruin the process and grind all progress to a halt, much like what I imagine a person in the potion-making business would say about potion making. But, y'know, less fun.

Frustrating, in that you absolutely cannot auto-pilot this game. Each action has to be deliberate and thought through, and if you try to take shortcuts it will just re-balance the price and availability of the ingredients in the shop to make sure you don't get any more of that one ingredient that's really good for that type of potion, or that other one that basically just makes the potion for you.

If either of those sound like a horrible time, and not a ""Pshaw, I'll get over that"" moment, I rescind my recommendation.

However, on the topic of things that could be easily patched after I post this review, the slated updates do promise a way to plant and harvest more of specific ingredients, so that might solve a big issue right there. They could also patch in twice the dialogue, seems probable. But these updates have by now taken seemingly almost an entire year to come to fruition. I'm just saying, if you're looking forward to swift updates and relevant, clear and concise (and most importantly public) communication about those updates, Satisfactory is on this very same store, with a different type of optimization challenge.",1700922370,1700922370,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This takes something that would normally be a mini-game within a larger game, and puts it front and centre. The potion making turns into a puzzle and a little journey that you take the potion on in order to make it! But it also makes sure it doesn't wear out its welcome by giving the player ways to save past potion recipes and automatically generate past ones they have made! This makes it fun to try to make the perfect recipe, so the repeated creation of potions never gets bland!

As well as boasting a strong potion making mechanic, Potion Craft also has quite an enjoyable game outside that. There is a nice way to get ingredients, with a relaxing little garden to pick herbs and flowers from, as well as traders you can haggle with. You can also use alchemy to get new ingredients for potions! You run a potion shop where customers will give you hints as to what potion they want instead of outright telling you and you have to figure out the right one. Most of the time it is pretty obvious, but sometimes I just had to guess. Interestingly, some customers will accept different potions and pay more or less depending on how well it fits their situation. You can also get a reputation for giving evildoers potions vs giving regular people potions!

If the gameplay wasn't enough, Potion Craft also has really a really art style, atmospheric music, and really nice feeling controls! The way that you can manually grind, stir and drag ingredients and potions is so satisfying! You can also customise potion recipes and potion appearances! I was surprised that I was able to get 34 hours out of this game, the way it looked, it seemed it would be quite short. If you can ignore the high price, considering it's an indie game, it's quite a fun game to get addicted to for a couple days.",1700893678,1700893678,True,17,0,0.657425224781036377,0,True,False,False

Be the Alchemist your 7-year old former self always wanted to be! Remember the days of mixing everything kept in the kitchen cupboards to make your 'special' potions? Well no need to rummage through the pantry anymore! Potion Craft is a great puzzler to find new recipes, carefully craft new concoctions and efficiently explore new magical effects. Perfect former recipes to use less ingredients and refine to find the ever more potent potion. 

The game features a great array of challenges and goals to keep your progress on track. Buy rare gems or new herbs from travelling merchants that come by your shop daily and find what makes your next potion the potentially potent perfection.

The game is still in early access meaning new features are expected to be added as the game continues to be developed. So far, I have not encountered any bugs of any kind.

Really great!

My potions are too strong for you, traveler.

Potion Seller, I tell you I am going into battle, and I want only your strongest potions.

You can't handle my potions. They're too strong for you.

Potion Seller, listen to me; I want only your strongest potions.

My potions would kill you, traveler. You cannot handle my potions.

Potion Seller, enough of these games. I'm going into battle and I need your strongest potions.

My strongest potions would kill you, traveler. You can't handle my strongest potions. You'd better go to a seller that sells weaker potions.

Potion Seller, I'm telling you right now; I'm going into battle and I need only your strongest potions.

You don't know what you ask, traveler. My strongest potions will kill a dragon, let alone a man. You need a seller that sells weaker potions, because my potions are too strong.

Potion Seller, I'm telling you I need your strongest potions. I'm going into battle! I'm going to battle and I need your strongest potions!

You can't handle my strongest potions! No one can! My strongest potions aren't fit for a beast let alone a man.

Potion Seller, what do I have to tell you to get your potions? Why won't you trust me with your strongest potions, Potion Seller? I need them if I'm to be successful in the battle!

I can't give you my strongest potions because my strongest potions are only for the strongest beings and you are of the weakest.

Well then that's it, Potion Seller. I'll go elsewhere. I'll go elsewhere for my potions.

That's what you'd better do.

I'll go elsewhere for my potions and I'll never come back!

Good. You're not welcome here! My potions are only for the strongest and you're clearly are not of the strongest you're clearly the weakest.

The concept of the game is really fun, you explore a map for new ingredients and the further you go the more complex your potion will become. After you discover a potion you will try to optimize your recipe by using less ingredients, upgrade to level 3, etc. You will sell this potions in a store and also, in this store, you will be visited by different merchants that will exchange ingredients for gold.

The problem for me comes with the Alchemy Machine. You have to grind complex potions to create stones, that are used to create other stones or different salts. Although you can save the potions recipes in your (really valuable) recipe book, this process is really repetitive and kinda boring. Here is an example: [spoiler]To create Sun Salt you first need to create Nigredo, mostly composed by different tier three potions. Then you will use that Nigredo to create Albedo, with again different potions level three and also a combination of potions with multiple effects. Later, you will take this Albedo to create Citrinas, again, created with the previously mentioned stone and different potions. After this, you can finally create Sun salt, with even more complex potions than before.[/spoiler]

As said, the game is really fun at the beginning but I couldn't get pass the chapter 9, I got bored at the last part of the game. If I had to change something to keep me playing until completion that would be the option for merchants to sell stones and salts.

The game is crazy cheap in my region (less than a dollar) and I had more than 25 hours of fun, only based on that it would be crazy for me not to recommend it.

So far, the best potion crafting I have seen in a video game other than mixing/combining X and Y ingredients was in [i] Kingdom Come: Deliverance[/i], where it required a little more effort than that. But even there, you could potentially craft potions watching a video without knowing the recipe. However, in this game you create the recipes yourself by traversing through the map with various ingredients to reach the desired effect, so even if you know where the effect is, you have to manually reach there with the ingredients you have. Despite this unique way of approaching potion crafting and the relaxing gameplay, the game has many issues with balance.
Because you have to explore the map(s) with the ingredients you have, the initial gameplay becomes very slow because you don't have enough ingredients. Furthermore, you cannot experiment enough to find the most efficient recipes, also because you don't have access to all the ingredients. Also, if you turn away customers because you don't have enough ingredients, you lose reputation, and thus less people come to you... it's a vicious cycle. On the contrary, in the late game, you are swimming in money and ingredients, and have no more need to be efficient with your potions, so can afford to waste 5 ingredients for a potion that can be made with one.
It is also funny how as an aspiring alchemist you have no prior knowledge of which potions are on which side of the map. Is Sleep potion closer to Life/Health because it rejuvenates you or closer to Death because it incapacitates you? The character you are playing as doesn't have any clue and may very well be in any other profession unrelated to alchemy.
Moreover, while buying from merchant, the game doesn't show how many of a type of ingredients you have or are using daily in your potions, so your best bet is to buy everything you can afford unless you want to waste a lot of time. There is just no management side of the game, which is a missed opportunity, in my opinion. When you buy new black pages, they get scattered all over the book, so finding and reorganizing them to a side is a painful chore.
The merchants are also not very consistent with their inventory, while customers often tend to ask for similar potions back to back, leaving you always short of certain ingredients, especially crystals. The upcoming Garden 2.0 update might improve the situation, but I am guessing that this dichotomy between early game and late game experience won't be resolved. Maybe a draft mode where you can experiment without losing ingredients until you commit to a recipe will help...",1674820437,1700655022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

5/5 ★★★★★

This game is a great example of inovative game design.
[b]Potion Craft : Alchemist Simulator[/b] strikes a good balance between creative and fun gameplay, puzzle solving, humoristic undertones, and light story-telling.

Grab some ingredients, blend them together to form a path, and explore the [b]Alchemy Map[/b] in search of the potion effects needed to fullfil the requests of your customers. A brilliant mix of planification, optimization, and exploration.

Overall progress is mainly kept through [b]The Alchemist's Path[/b], an in-game checklist, organized in multiple chapters. Each chapter holds set objectives that you must complete in order to progress further into the game, unlocking new customers and new potion requests.

The difficulty of the puzzle aspect does not get in the way of enjoyment or progression, as the player always has the option to ""End Dialogue"" (i.e. to not fullfil the customer's request) if they do not have the necessary ingredients or if the feasibility of the request is not worth the investment with the player's current saved recipes. However, the player will inevitably have to put in time and efforts to craft the harder and more complexe potions needed to progress the story and the more rare alchemical components.

[b]The Recipe Book[/b] is an essential tool for the player, as it lets you save the recipe of any potion you make, and allows you to quickly craft those potions thereafter, or start from a specific place on the map, eliminating the trouble to plan the more difficult paths again each time the player needs to get to a difficult potion effect on the [b]Alchemy Map[/b].
Furthermore, by progressing and unlocking new ingredients, players might want to revisit their early saved recipes and seek to optimize them, which proves truly useful in making the experience last a little bit longer.

The artistic direction is impeccable, both through the game's distinct and clean visuals, as well as through its very cozy soundtrack. The characters are original and quirky, the ingredients are well designed and come with funny descriptions, and the customization options for the potions you craft (bottles, labels, desciptions, names, etc.) really helps in making the game feel unique.

[hr][/hr]
[strike]There is, however, a big [b]negative[/b].

December 2nd 2022, Potion Craft received the version 0.5.0 major update. With this update, the save files from previous versions became incompatible, as a lot of things had changed both on the [b]Alchemy Map[/b] and in the effects of ingredients. In the patch notes for this update, the developpers said [i]""Previously, we've talked about why save files were incompatible with different versions and why we had to reset the alchemists' progress in the game. This time around, with update 0.5.0, we're going to do it one last time. This version will serve as the foundation for all future updates to the game, which means you will no longer have to start the whole game from the beginning after another major Potion Craft update.""[/i]

This announcement did leave some player with a bitter feeling, as it meant they would lose all their progress and need to restart the game from the begining in order to play the final game, but it is understandable given the major changes the game went through during development. Thus, many players started over with a new save file in early december, with the security of knowing that their new game would be compatible with the 1.0.0 version of the game, and that they [i]would no longer have to start the whole game from the beginning[/i].

December 13th 2022, Potion Craft version 1.0.0 officially came out, not without great excitment from us players. But that excitment was cut short for a lot of us when, upon loading in our save file from version 0.5.0, we realized that the Steam Achievments for various objectives in the game did not unlock, despite the requirements being completed. 
This effectively meant that, despite the statement from the developpers, players who began a save file in version 0.5.0 would yet again have to start over to even be able to unlock any of these achievements, which they had already put in the work to meet the requirements for. 
Upon reaching to the developpers regarding this issue, we were given the answer [i]""We are not planning to implement retroactive progress for achievements (at least for now).""[/i]

Needless to say, this left a lot of players feeling bitter and feeling their trust had been betrayed. This alone put a very heavy stain on an otherwise excellent game, and dampened significantly the fun of playing the game, by [i]having to start the whole game from the beginning[/i] anyway afterall.[/strike]


[u]As of December 22th 2022, the achievements have been made retroactive.[/u]

+ Loved the art style, overall aesthetic which really immersed you into the game as an alchemist finding new potions.
+ This is all very exciting, and you progress quite fast in the beginning...

- At some point the progression gets slower, you have to wait to get certain ingredients or just look up the best combinations because the wiggle room gets smaller and smaller the further away new recipes are.
- Due to this the game loop became quite repetitive for me which made me quit after about 8hr.

The game is relaxing and doesn’t require much focus, meaning it is a good game to play while listening to a podcast or talking to your friends on Discord. The mechanics are unique and intuitive and the game doesn’t hold your hand, allowing you to explore them yourself without looking for guidance online. There is decent attention to detail, the game has an original and appealing visual style and gives you some customisation options which are fun to play around with.

All these traits make the game a very enjoyable experience up to the mid/late-game. That’s when issues start to arise. Eventually you start unlocking less ingredients and effects and the more complex potions take more time and effort to brew. The inventive mechanics start to become tedious and repetitive. The game has 10 chapters, around chapter 8 you will have already unlocked every potion and have a recipe saved for it, unlocked every ingredient and accumulated an abundant amount of it and experienced most unique character interactions in the game. The only things you need to do to progress at this point is complete the remaining special recipes, which create salts that assist with potion crafting. Creating these salts requires you to brew unnecessarily complicated potions which is a cumbersome and not really fun process, and since you likely already have all the potions already available there is no real reason to make these salts other than optimising existing recipes and completionism.

It appears the game is still being developed, although there hasn’t been an update in a long time. In its current state the game is highly enjoyable for the first half, which should provide at least 10+ hours of gameplay, decent for the third quarter but not very enjoyable beyond that. Hopefully future updates iron out the late-game because the game has a lot of potential, and at the moment I would give it a 7/10.",1688342534,1700605334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's major draw is its detailed animations that occur with virtually every action the player performs, as well as the novel art style. The way the ingredients transform into an impalpable mush or powder with each motion of the pestle, picking up the processed ingredient then physically dropping it into the cauldron, pumping the bellows to add heat to your concoction, manually stirring the contents, and diluting it with water from a sensitive volume-controlled ladle all contribute to a digitally kinesthetic and gratifying experience that keeps the player engaged, and lends generous control on minute aspects of the potion-building process.

After several hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Potion Craft, in its current state, is a high quality, polished product, but does leave a bit to be desired, as eventually one will have experienced much of what the game has to offer. But considering the game is in early access and the developers seem to be coddling their product and listening to the community's feedback pretty well, there seems to be hope for a much more indulgent experience down the pipe in the future, which has me optimistic. For now, I have faith that Potion Craft is a great foundation for whatever the developers have in store for the future.

Potion Craft creates an exciting atmosphere with its nice soundtrack and very nice visual style. The user-friendly interface and interesting mechanics of potion-making add a certain flavor and depth to the mystical world of potion brewing.
The gameplay begins with fun, however, after 20 hours and unlocking all alchemy stones, it becomes a bit boring. The gameplay gets repetitive, and completing the game for 100% takes twice as long. Despite this, the game deserves a high rating.
I am waiting for the next updates with interesting and new mechanics in the game.

I started to feel that ""Zen"" level of concentration that comes from other activities like playing an instrument, working with tools... or practicing an actual trade, which is what I felt like I'd learned by the time I finished playing. The game recreates that realistic vibe through the physical experience of using your lab instruments. You can stir rapidly or slowly, but with the movement of the mouse and the animation onscreen it's easy to forget that you're not actually stirring. You can pulverize ingredients methodically or even violently with your mortar and pestle, but again, the translation of mouse movement into onscreen action gives a sensation like you're actually working in your own laboratory.

Things start out simply enough, and the mechanical underpinnings of the game stay pretty much the same, but challenge and complexity continue as you progress through the game. This comes from a few different factors. Initially, there's a scarcity of effective ingredients to work with. As you progress further, your toolbox gets bigger but your objectives on the alchemy map get more and more difficult to reach. And as all of those pieces finally fall into place, the game generates new novelty through the sometimes-exacting specifications put forward by your customers - combinations of effects, including/excluding certain ingredients, limiting the number/type you can use, etc.

By the time I got to the VERY end of the game and picked up the last couple of achievements, I kinda just wanted it to be done with... But, then again, there are so many games in my library that I never 100% finish because I feel like it's not worth attaining for the level of effort involved. This was within reach, so I went for it, and I certainly enjoyed all of the hours I put into the game short of maybe the last 2-3 that I did just for the sake of being a completionist. Maybe there's some room for improvement in the gameplay loop all the way toward the end of the game? Either way, I'm not too concerned.

Maybe my only other complaint is that Potion Craft has ONE single music track on a perpetual loop - listening to a 2-minute loop for 30 hours can be tough to manage in large doses. But they've mentioned that that's something they're already working on, so by the time you pick up the game and get to the 10-hour mark maybe your head won't be ready to explode and you won't need to take a day to cool off.

Overall, I enjoyed my time with the game, and I plan to revisit it once they add some of the new features they've hinted at. But that's not to say that Potion Craft doesn't already feel complete in its current state. It was fun, it will be the next time I pick it up, and I feel perfectly fine recommending it at the full price listed.

On a side note... If you like dark humor, feel free to start catering to some of the more questionable people who visit your establishment and asking you to do questionable things. I got a good laugh out of some of the ridiculous explanations customers gave me for a bunch of their potion requests.",1700592280,1700592280,True,1,0,0.525316417217254639,0,True,False,False

However the grind is real, it's REALLY real. Trying to get all of the achievements for this game was genuinely a painful affair. I mean that literally, as the amount of potions you make and the amount of ingredient grinding and stirring can lead to some mouse hand fatigue. There is very little guidance throughout the game, and lots of time saving features are completely hidden, I only discovered them nearly two dozen hours in the game.

You spend A LOT of time just doing repetitive movements. Heating up the cauldron speeds up your potion's travel time across the map, but also activates the teleportation whirlpools so you're better off with the glacial default travel speed. The game also never tells you that right clicking your completed potions and ingredients automatically adds them to the customer scale and mortar & pestle respectively. Later in the game when you have dozens and dozens of ingredients with hundreds of quantities of them, not having any sort of user friendly read function besides hovering your mouse over them is incredibly time consuming and irritating.

There are a few typos in the customer requests as well, while not debilitating, it does take you out of the life sim the game markets itself as. In general you're just grinding for RPG elements that just add a % increase to what you had already in the game. With the exception of your first alchemy machine project, the entire game can really be boiled down to only a handful of very repetitive actions. If you play this game for 2, maybe 3 hours, you've already experienced everything it has to offer- just with slight deviations.

After you finish your first Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, Rubedo, and finally your Philosopher's Stone, you realize that they're really just further ingredients to make the various alchemy salts. However, you only really need moon salt, so you just make 5, maybe 6 of those and you don't have to bother making Sun Salt, Life Salt, or Philosopher's Salt. As you only need one type of these to rotate your potions to the correct angle, and Philosopher's Salt comes so late into the game that you should have hundreds of any ingredient you require to make any potion you'd wish.

Adding onto that, the very last alchemy machine potions are just effects separated by one side of the map to the other. I understand that this is a simple system, but it's just time-padding plain and simple. This game could have been very nuanced with a lot of complex customization features. You could have combined potions to make potion tiers above 5, or utilized your alchemy machine ingredients into super expensive panaceas that could net you the thousands you need to get your alchemy stashes stocked up and ready for the final projects. I also have to imagine that the 10,000+ ingredients really fit into your tiny medieval alchemy shack, and that you're not some time traveling Bezos slave peddling Amazon snake oils to medieval peasants. 

Overall, There's a very fun essence and art style to this game, someone poured their heart and soul into the art style and it does feel thematically accurate. I just feel like it's half baked and a time sink without the level of depth that it first appears to.

NEGATIVES:
There are no satisfying endings right now. Do you hear us devs?! We're waiting!

Unfortunately, actual endings will genuinely probably come in a future update.

The game is also incredibly grindy. If you don't like the grindy parts of, say, Stardew Valley, this might not be fun.

Another thing: don't expect to do anything other than making potions! Originally I thought there might be ways to use your own potions or maybe even trick a customer into thinking you're handing them one potion when you're giving them another (which could be fun with certain customers), but there's no such thing.

Pros:  Runs smoothly with no issues.
         -Some NPC requests are not things I would endorse, but the game gives you the ability to show those customers the door and even sometimes rewards you with the lost income by boosting your popularity. 
          -The various ingredients are puzzle pieces and the puzzle progression to new potion attributes is the right amount of challenging.
         -I love the medieval aesthetic.  It is a beautifully illustrated little game.

Cons:  Some NPCs want help poisoning people or charming folks or helping them in the bedroom.  But you don't have to sell them anything.  Nothing strongly dinged my parental alert system, but YMMV.

Producing the stone isn't quite a simple task and at first glance it shines completely unbearable. After some playing done, the player starts to recognize most of the patterns and required tactics to solve the thing and that's where it hits the head with the hammer - there is a layer upon a layer in a layer, where you have to make it all by hand with quite an overwhelming width to it.

It seems like a simple concept at first glance, but the intricacies of navigating the potion map, plus what your customers demand of you, can be challenging.

Don't get me wrong, I think the game is good, but after playing it some I realised the only reason I have that many hours is because this game is grindy af. It's very cute, and the base is great. I love their vision and idea but we are almost in 2024 and these very solid ideas and features are yet to see the light.

The game technically has a story, but it has no substance or feel. You cannot customise your dwelling, or really get too immersed in its current state. The days are the same, it's the same stuff every day, and the end goal is to make the philosopher salt. But there isn't really any reason to, other than of course making it end. 

It has some very strong and fun aspects already in the game that they hopefully build upon(but also actually release, this is really important). I think the dev team is suffering from overcomplicating and too many ideas that they don't seem able to ship any of it in a reasonable time. I'll definitely change my review once they actually ship these elusive features.

But as it stands, it's OK. And that's kinda it. It's VERY VERY shallow, something really unfortunate in a game that's a full on roleplaying game.

I really love the idea of ""alchemist's map"". Each ingredient has it's wiggling path toward it's base element (earth, wind, fire, etc). Mixing them together to go in a new direction, discovering new potions. That's fill the gap in the magical world that I've been wonder for a long time how (the hell) potion brewing works in the fantasy fictions.

However, what the heck with the super limited resources? To explore this ""alchemist's map"", the player need to stock up hundreds, if not thousands, of ingredients before hand. And the price for buying these ingredients are so expensive.

Adding conditions like ""I only want a potion with 1 type of ingredient"" is not just unrealistic, it's unfathomable that anyone other than a mage or alchemist would come with such a request, and realistically, they probably wouldn't make such an utterly ludicrous stipulation either. The requests to avoid or include a specific ingredient are much more realistic and understandable. Any limits on the number of ingredients are just silly. How is a bloody peasant supposed to KNOW what's in the love potion you just offered them? How are they supposed to KNOW you didn't just give them a health potion? The game uses some direct logic that defies the reality that most of your customers wouldn't be able to discern the effects of your potion until they actually take it.

And the hits to reputation are silly as well. If I refuse service to some idiot who comes in and DEMANDS a potion with only 1 ingredient AND multiple effects and refuses anything that doesn't meet those IMPOSSIBLE criteria, why should I get penalized for telling that customer to go somewhere else? And at higher rep levels, the hits should be LESS, not more. Because your reputation is STRONGER, the complaints of a single person should mean LESS. Here's the simple logic, as your reputation increases, more of the populace will have been your customers and also had good experiences, thus the effect of a dissatisfied customer's complaint will be dismissed by the greater balance of good experiences. This effect would naturally increase as your reputation level increases and customers beyond your town also carry word further.

It might make more sense if these complications were tempered against your trading skill, which at this point doesn't help you much except to acquire gold a bit faster. It would also make some sense that you could haggle a customer down on their requirements, like instead of 1 ingredient, you could haggle for 2, or 3 depending on your skill.

And why is everyone demanding poopshroom when it hasn't even been offered for sale and I've literally never even acquired it? Why are customers demanding impossible criteria that my only option is to refuse? Just for more artificial difficulty?",1697398446,1697399873,False,14,0,0.575934350490570068,0,True,False,False

But once you start pushing the later game, it feels like there's less motivation to keep pushing through more difficult to make potions on the current maps (only water and oil), where the materials expended require a lot of investment (which requires grinding a long section of the sales part of the game). 

The addition of other maps you can unlock as you progress along with the additional sources of materials will probably help with this as the game develops, but in its current form, it can become a slog that requires a lot of patience to progress through with little reward. With that i mind, I'm marking it as TENTATIVE recommend, however, since I think this type of game attracts the sort of player who will be willing to put in that effort, especially as updates help the flow of gameplay feel less slow at later sections (one hopes).

Get it on sale, play to the point it requires you to be teleporting over the death walls with crystals and rotating potions with salts, then wait for wine map. Because Ch. 8 is rough, but completion of Ch. 9 at this point feels so annoying that I'd rather uninstall and wait for the update than continue.

Релиз - скам. Игра не доделана, но играть можно. Настоящий релиз будет позже, тогда лучше и стоит покупать игру.  Без необходимых доработок  игра выглядит так: начало - молитва рандому, чуть дальше - есть деньги, но сидишь без необходимых ресурсов и еще чуть дальше - ты и есть казна, и это по прогрессу где-то на 25% от всей оставшейся игры.
___
[h1] Предисловие [/h1]
Вот это да. Вот это они меня удивили. Вышло обновление 0.5 второго декабря, думаю, дайка сейчас нормально засяду за игру. Прохожу потихонечку, а тут бац - выкатывают 1.0, aka релиз игры. Посмотрел изменения - 1.0 минимально отличается от 0.5 и НЕТ многих необходимых игре фич. Куда они торопятся? Это маскировка под релиз, никак иначе. Воспринимайте так.
Самое забавное, что они понимают недостатки игры: описали, что будет в будущих обновлениях, и их часть касается моих претензий. Но, блин, эта часть должна быть в релизе... Зачем они так сделали? Не ясно. Если бы ради денег, т.к им не хватает по какой-либо причине, то кроме выхода в релиз могли бы цену изменить. Нормальная практика. Хотя они могли себя в капкан поймать, когда  мб заранее написали, что цена на игру не изменится после релиза- тогда понятно. Пока эта плашка с информацией Early Access была - не вчитывался.

[h1]Cписок незаконченных моментов из-за чего игра должна находиться в раннем доступе[/h1]
	> [b]Сад[/b]. Это вообще что такое, зачем это игре в таком виде. Сад дает тебе рандомное количество рандомных ингредиентов. Контроля там абсолютно столько же, сколько в спальне главного героя, а именно 0. По ходу игры ты понимаешь насколько было бы лучше и правильнее, если б алхимик мог настраивать сад под текущую задачу или ситуацию в инвентаре.
	> [b]Скиллы[/b]. Скучные? Определенно. А еще это то, что позволяет сломать экономику игры довольно быстро. Дальше будет гайд. Вы предупреждены: [spoiler]Парочка очков в быстрое прокачивание навыков -> Экспертная сложность -> Все в торговлю почти до конца ->  открываете пятую сложность торговли (если уже есть проблемы на 4, то пропускаете этот шаг) -> качаете до конца торговлю. Может есть куда оптимизированный путь прокачки, но даже этого хватает[/spoiler]. А самое смешное в том, что ломать не особо-то приходится. В начале, да, проблема с деньгами есть и ты не можешь все скупать, поэтому берешь только то, что тебе нужно или если это не самое начало, а час игры, то все, что с низкой ценой. Но потом ты можешь все скупать и у тебя всегда остаются деньги. 
	> [b]Торговцы[/b]. В контексте предыдущих пунктов это прям провал. Если то будет доделано, то лично я с торговцами смирюсь. Почему у них ассортимент настолько рандомный и неясный? Было бы здорово, если бы, например, торговцы в определенные дни недели продавали бы какой-нибудь процент, например, огненных ингредиентов и все оставшиеся % ветряных. А так, получается, что ты вроде как имеешь деньги, а необходимого из раза в раз нет

[h1]Послесловие[/h1]
Исправление всего вышеперечисленного игроку  планировать свои дальнейшие действия куда лучше и естественнее, а не полагаться только лишь на рандом по большей части, не считая центральной комнаты. Вы сами написали в названии Achemist Simulator. Давайте вспомним матчасть - как устроены другие симуляторы. Они предоставляют часть реального мира в мельчайших деталях в конкретной выбранной тематике игры. В Euro Truck Simulator система прокачки простая, да и управление рабочими тоже, но это не вредит основному геймплею. Суть игры - в перевозке грузов, тебе не нужно обращать внимание на все остальное с такой же подробностью. Без разницы сколько твои наемные рабочие получают, неважно насколько у тебя прокачен навык на дальнюю дистанции - все это, еще раз, никак не влияет на перевозку грузом: какой был геймлуп в начале, таким и остался в конце. В данном случае наш текущий подопытный отличается. Т.к игра берет тематику не из нашей реалии, то приходится полагаться на общее представлении об алхимиков. Алхимики - варят зелья. С этим игра справляется, но ведь у нас не бесконечный приток ресурсов для них. И выходит, что вне варки мы должны заниматься получением ингредиентов. Не рандомно, а обдуманно, т.к это неотъемлемая часть геймлупа игры. Не нужно упрощать процесс вашим волшебным деревом в саду, которое каждый день дает ресурсы. Это дешево и несерьезно. С одной стороны упростили, с другой - убрали глубину, которая этой игре выходит нужна

[h1]Пример из игры[/h1]
И теперь вкупе со всем описанным вот вам доп. материал. Типичная ситуация после двух-трех часов игры: ты скупал все или почти все у торговцев (потому что игра позволяет это легко сделать буквально через пару часов), начинаешь новый день, смотришь с какой проблемой пришел посетитель, понимаешь какое зелье ему подойдет, пытаешься сварить и оказывается, что ты не можешь этого сделать, т.к в ту часть экрана ни один ингредиент не идет. Только представьте как бы это легко решалось с персонализированным садом: заранее мог бы посадить ингредиенты, которые скоро закончатся и все, твоя проблема решена
---
[h1]Итог[/h1]
Все, я излил душу. Надеюсь, хаос в обзоре ясно объяснил мою позицию. Игра хорошая, вы не подумайте. Но это не релиз. Само собой, когда исправят все выше перечисленное - подправлю обзор . А сейчас мне сложно назвать эту игру  [b]симулятором[/b].

One of my favorite features in this game is the recipe book! You can buy pages from the wizard and just have a HUGE recipe book. By the end of my first run (~55 hrs) my book was FULL. I just think its so fun making new recipes according to the amount of ingredients you have. The artstyle is also very charming, it looks like its right out of a medieval book or something. 
I will say this:
If you don't like repetition, this game is NOT for you. I love the repetition, grinding up plants and ESPECIALLY crystals is very satisfying for me. You WILL be doing a lot of things over and over for the story progression, because to progress you need to make multi-effect potions for the chapters. I think it's really fun because you need to strategize what direction you go in first, in order to make the most cost effective potions for your crystals and salts.

This game is brilliant, yes even now. I can stay in this game for more than 2 hours per section, just because I got stuffs to do hence the zero hour game play. It has wonderful music, innovative game play, and for me, it is an excellent game in practicing English comprehension. This game is very chill and beautiful.

Because I buy games that updates, that renews, that keeps our eyeballs on it.
[h2]Turned negative[/h2]
1. Not even a small update for a whole year, keep using dev logs to try to keep us expecting it yet making most of the players fatigue because we have no idea when it will update.
2. Raising the price is fine, most indie game raise their price after early access. But those game had been finished before they updated their price. This game is ready to make a huge change, a MASSIVE difference when compare to the previous version, which I consider as INCOMPLETE. In fact, I don't even think they have gone through early access (removing ""This function is ready to be made"" in the game menu doesn't mean you have released officially man.). They are raising their price, before doing any actual things to the game.

The only thing I haven't loved is how the effects are laid out on the map. Which is at most a very mild nuisance.

You have an alchemy map (I assume in our minds) and with its help you navigate and discover recipes. Each ingredient has a set motion path on this map, which can be manipulated by mashing the ingredients and adding more water. The result is a game about trial and error in attempts to create the most efficient recipes to necessary potions. Though you can skip the tedium with typical brews; you always have the option to save the recipe to quick brew later or continue to create and refine your potions from scratch.

I almost liken it to home cooking. Many cooks do not measure, they taste and judge as they cook. I can only assume we are doing the same in this game, knowing certain ingredients do certain things we want and adjusting the brews as they develop. Further, the more you make them and the more new ingredients you discover, you find substitutions and shortcuts to refine your recipes just like home cooking.

All in all, it is interesting and fun. That said, tier 3’s and multi effect potions are a pain (at least getting them efficiently) and currently your ingredients are fairly RNG based. It can be a bit frustrating if you hit a wall, but there are no time constraints that punish you for waiting until you can easily surmount it.

For the very limited game that it is, I can say that, it's a game, it works, nothings obviously broken, and that's worth praising. However, lacking interesting mechanics, one would expect that it would try to make up for it with some immersive qualities. Unfortunately that's lacking as well. You can make your own judgement of the visual style; however, what animations there are, are very limited. Additionally, many basic things that should some audio effects have nothing, some boiling sounds, steam, stirring.

Some of the negative comments have been about the lack of specific resources available for harvest/purchase when needed.  I think the reason for that discouragement is the misconception about the game's genre.  At it's heart, Potion Craft is a puzzle game more than anything else.  Figuring out how to reach specific potion effects without the ideal ingredients is part of the fun early in the game.  Later in the game, you may have better ingredients, but not the ones you have used in saved recipes.  That forces you to revisit some of the easier potions to try for better efficiency.  

This game is definitely not for everybody, but I think it's definitely worth a look for people who like puzzle games.  I wholeheartedly agree that it needs some more exploration and maybe more world interactivity.  Upcoming updates with Talents 2.0 and Garden 2.0 look perfect for that.  I'd love to see some actual adventuring to gather ingredients, meet customers that become regulars, etc.  That might taint the allure of this game's simple relaxation, however.

Potion Craft is a relaxing game where there are no major time limits and this gives you full freedom to come up with creative and innovative new ways to problem-solve in the game. I am over halfway through the game's story by now, and it still feels like I am learning new tricks and workarounds, coming up with my own creative solutions for the problems I face daily. So far I've discovered like, twenty something different kinds of potions and I haven't explored the map fully yet. You can even mix and match various potion types if the situation will allow for it.

The basic gameplay loop is simple enough to get used to quickly. You run a potion shop and collect your ingredients from the garden to begin your day, and then open up the shop for customers. Each customer has a need for a potion that will complete a specific task - but there is often more than one solution to the same problem. You get a recipe book to save really useful brews to recreate on-demand. Merchants will also start visiting your shop after awhile, and they will become your primary means of replenishing your supply of various ingredients. 

In-between fulfilling orders and trying to work mysterious machines needed for the plot, you will have time to explore the Alchemy Map, making this game more similar to an open-world dungeon crawler of sorts. To be fully honest, I'm not entirely sure how best to categorize this game. All I know is, it's definitely found its way onto my favorites list rather quickly.

A new update is going to drop sometime soon that will entirely revamp the Garden and Talents, but so far it seems to have plenty of game in here as it is. If you need something less action-packed that will still work those mental muscles, Potion Craft is a good one to pick up.",1693449094,1693449094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fun of this game comes from not the game itself but how you play it and what you do while playing it. I'll be honest, the game itself is pretty barebones with kind of boring, grindy gameplay (for now, a lot of big updates are coming to make the game more interesting) and you're the one that has to make it fun.

Do you like listening to podcasts? This is an amazing background game to play while listening to them.

Do you have a ""vivid"" imagination? You can name your ""Gluing Potion"", ""Cum"" and giggle to yourself as you sell a comically large bottle of it for a comically expensive price because you haggled with them about dragons or something.

You are a tinkerer and just sell the potions that you create through exploring a map of danger. Strategic navigation becomes essential from time to time but free exploration seemed more fun. In my experience the early and mid-game was intriguing and I loved to just throw whatever I had available into the cauldron to see what effect I could find, but it was different in the late game. Once everything was explored it was a slog to fulfill all of the requirements for a particular potion and the people asking for potions seem redundant (because you are now familiar with what dialog corresponds to what potion). It becomes tedious, however that is not to say the whole game is bad. I really enjoyed my time exploring crafting recipes and questioning how to use the effects I would find.

The gameplay is amazing, if you are looking for a game that isnt stressful. It is very simple, but despite that doesnt get boring. Game gives you plenty of room to experiment, doesnt matter if you want to play as efficiently as possible, or if you just want to chill. 
Aesthetics - 10/10

Each ingredient has a trajectory it takes. In order to brew a potion, you must use the ingredients at your disposal to land on the ""bulls eye"" for the given potion.

It's unique, and I'm glad to have tried it out. To be honest though, I don't see myself finishing this game. It's very repetitive and can get really tedious and frustrating.

In the Demo and Early Access we were promised many features that have still as of ""release"" not made their way into the game. They still say these features are coming but it has been 9 months since the last major update and all we have seen is dev logs. If the game were in a ""finished"" state I'd be fine with this but even in their most recent dev log they stated that the current system used for level ups is a ""place holder"" for what they really wanted. That means we are still playing Early Access and this whole experience has felt like promises were made but not kept.

This is a chill and novel experience but gets stale quickly. The endgame is mostly devoid of meaningful content and requires an absurd amount of grinding to complete the ""Alchemist's Path"" (the main progression system in the game) to the point where 1% of the players who own the game have actually completed it (and really, completing it is not hard; it will just take a shift's worth of clicking ""sell"" to get there).

In the last update (almost a year ago now) we saw a new potion base added (something that had been promised in the Demo and EA) which gives you a new map to explore. Sounds great! The catch: it is significantly smaller than the first map and pretty much only serves to give you a tool to use back on the main map. There weren't even potions on that map that you couldn't find on the original map; just the same potions (not even ALL the same potions) with a shorter distance to get to them (and a different rotation angle that you have to reach to make a ""tier 3"" potion). What is the point then? This seemed like a pretty gift filled with air; just another way to spend time doing the same thing with very little to show for the effort.

I really was enamored by this game initially but with how much was promised and the fact that 1.0 came and went without the majority of these promises being met means to me that the dev team might just get tired of working on this and move on and there is no accountability for them to follow through on the things this game originally told us would be in here.

I hope to come back and change this review again down the line but until then I will say that ""release"" felt like a cash-grab/lie and hope that this team delivers on the promises made to the people who invested in them the first week of EA.",1632341202,1692917875,False,0,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,True
1210320,144402549,76561198043458743,119,6,629,0,597,1692273324,"This game is worth playing, but don't expect to play it very long until they expand on the gameplay loop. It is about experiencing what a nice crafting system could be. What would essentially be a simple side-minigame in another MMORPG, has been purified to it's concentrated form and expanded into a full game in here. Unfortunately, for now I find the game ""finished"" at around mid-game. Everything later than that seems like a more tedious repetition of the the exact same routines. I feel it lacks on a story-wise and the puzzle-wise front. Nevertheless, developers are constantly working on it and posting devlogs, so we will see how it goes. IIRC I bought it on sale, and for that I am grateful -- the game earned for itself. If I had bought it at it's regular price, however, I could have been underwhelmed and disappointed. This game works as a prototype or art form, but to be a fully-fledged, 100% completable casual title it needs some serious core gameloop improvements. Nonetheless, I am happy that I experienced this piece, thus I recommend trying it out... but at the same time -- maybe wait for a sale, or for some major patch first.

Pros:
- Unique and simple mechanics which are fun to play and mesh well together
- Beautiful art and meticulously crafted details shine brightly in this game
- Calm and serene atmosphere without any pressure of time and without inducing a fear of missing out
- Mechanics are generally intuitive, assigning one of 8 attributes corresponding to the ingredient gives this game another layer of depth
- UI and UX are very good, it is just a pleasure to interact with this game

A room for improvement:
- For a game that you most probably spend long time playing during one session, the diversity and amount of music is very lacking. At times it even makes me dizzy listening to the same music on a loop, which forces me to either close the game or mute it. For example dwarf fortress has 18 or so, minecraft has 2(3?) albums while this game, for now, has only 2 very similar tracks.
- It has (a bad type of) grind at times, and from what I have heard and experienced already, the it's even more severe mid-to-late game. Several repetitive in-game days often pass by without much progress and doing essentially the same thing over and over, crafting the same potions but varying the ingredients from time to time, only to wait for a specific merchant to bring you a new part for the alchemical or none of the ingredients you lack the most. I Definitely didn't reach end-game. Maybe I tapped onto the front doors of the mid-game, but for now it gets quite repetitive. I have not unlocked the new alchemical map -- I got tired of doing the same thing over and over.
- It feels claustrophobic at times as well. Seeing the fields outside the windows makes you want to go outside and explore the world. Seeing the bedroom makes you want to interact with it, but it's essentially a whole screen added for the sake of one and only interaction - the bed to skip a day.
- There is a purely cosmetic mechanic of the reputation that has no real gameplay impact, but it has a yet untapped potential.
- There are several places where you can progress, but they feel a bit disconnected. The Alchemist's path feels a to be of little importance and not very impactful. I Breezed though 4 pages (almost half of the book) in one (6h?) sitting almost without noticing it. Talents are a bit weirdly distributed in time: you can reach level 28 and learn >50% of all the talent levels in the first sitting. I guess final levels are the hardest to get, but if not, You may be wondering layer ""what now?"". I see they have plans for new talents so I'm looking for that and maybe some more improvements on that system.
- Haggling is something that you almost always want to do, so there should maybe be some balancing on that matter. 
- Performance: for a game that moves around a bunch of sprites, it has a surprisingly high impact on the my machine. From the simplicity of the machanics and graphics I assumed this game could be played on a toaster. but it felt a bit sluggish at times and ventilators start working considerably louder. I also don't understand the very long load time, somehow? It uses 2.2 GB when in background (on Linux Proton), 85 vt-threads and 20% processing power of a 6 core processor? How?
- There seems to be a lot of content (look at all those potion stickers!), but it's quite inaccessible due to the grind. I find maps to be a bit too big, the trips of potions too long and the lack of different starting points tedious. Maybe if there was some way to move the potions larger distances it would be better. For example some kind of pressure mechanic - when brewing under pressure, the whole map would shrink (or the ingredient path would expand) allowing for travelling bigger distances quicker?
- Alchemical machine is underwhelming. After using it you are left with ""...was that it?""

My ideas for growth:
- It would be nice if the potions crafted in the game had some more uses. A good example is the upcoming feature of the wild growth potion for plants. Crafting a potion of fire or a potion of cold is essentially the same thing but using different ingredients. It would be nice seeing some real impact those things have on the world around us. Libido/love potion could affect bees which would in turn pollinate flowers, or increase a chance of random plants growing. A Potion of strength could be used to break a broken door for the inaccessible part of the house (or the city, read below). A slowness potion could be used to increase the accuracy of using tools, while a speed potion would amplify the effects of paths or something
- If the alchemical machine was more interactive, it could give another dimension to the game. Twisting corks to mix potions in right proportions, pouring out the sludge or sediment from vials, heating and keeping mixtures at good temperature for a certain amount of time, adjusting angles of tubes, lighting up flames and adjusting their height and strength, connecting the tubes, releasing or increasing the pressure and whatnot are some of the examples I would think about adding if I were a part of the team. Maybe instead of buying whole sets of alchemical machines we would buy flasks and components which we would later combine and place on our own? Managing space and using available tools?
- There is an untapped potential of discovering the world's lore while progressing through the game and feeling like a part of the a living universe. Merchants could bring books or tell tales. We could buy paintings of distant lands or explanations of the origin of plants etc.
- There is a place for a story about the mystery of the alchemical cottage and it's previous owner, which we would progressively unravel. Rooms we could unlock, repairs we could make, notes and bits of knowledge from him etc.
- It would be very nice to see some more locations. A city or a village, a cave, a forest, a tavern, a castle and whatnot could be added. Different shops in the city to make use of the earned money and use the potions to interact with NPCs in there. See them walk around and do their things. Haggle for tools with villagers, use strength potion to break the doors of a closed abandoned shop, use potion of nightvision to access a cave, Combine it with the reputation mechanic to make some locations more accessible or restricted than others, for example bad reputation would prevent you from interacting with rightful shop owners but would in turn give you access to the backalley and black market, where you could buy some exclusive forbidden items. With good reputation you could buy certified exclusive goods from good merchants etc.

Ultimately this game is constantly growing, and planned features will probably resolve some of the issues mentioned above, so I'm only looking forward to it! The above critique doesn't impact my positive reception of this game, and I still highly recommend playing it.",1692271994,1692871353,True,10,0,0.595426857471466064,0,True,False,False

I really wanted to like this game - I was drawn to the simulated act of picking plants, grinding them, adding them to my cauldron, and selling potions to customers. But I noticed a sharp drop off in the Steam achievements, with about 50% of players completing chapter 1 of 10 and 1% of players actually finishing the game. I imagine that most people drop off because unfortunately, a lot of the game is a repetitive grind. Pretty much my biggest problem with it is that it feels. so. repetitive.

The game started out great, beautiful artwork and fun mechanics. I enjoyed exploring the map. But then I learned that exploring the map consumed materials rapidly, especially as I traveled further from my starting point - which, by the way, is the same no matter what. You always start at the same point in the map, and by mid-game, you have traveled over the same areas over and over again. It was fun to fulfill requests at first, but then they became repetitive too. Unlocking alchemy seemed promising and I was hopeful as I created the first materials (Nigredo), until it turns out that it just requires the same gameplay but with even more grinding. Now I don't mind grinding when I think the effort is worth it, but this game didn't offer enough ""newness"" to keep me engaged.

Another problem I have is with inventory. I never have enough of a particular plant, which is alright - that's what vendors are for! Except you have no guarantee that any particular vendor will be available when you need them. Which is still alright as long as they appear often enough - except most of the time the herbalist or mushroom guy aren't carrying what I need! My garden will not stop giving me more of a plant that I already have 100+ of, but yields like 3 of another plant that I have 0 of. Lack of control over inventory (being unable to grow or buy what I need even when I have the gold) contributed a lot to my frustration.

Overall, this is a game for some people who enjoy the gameplay loop, and I still think the early game is fantastic. It just didn't have much to offer me past the first few hours.",1692185634,1692185634,False,62,2,0.756595134735107422,0,True,False,False

Love the graphics of this game but as a beginner its quite difficult if you don't have the means to get the information you need and it can be quite frustrating when the requests are to vague, but overall its a very cool game and i would recommend it to friends

If you do need help at the start a good website is 
https://potion-craft.fandom.com/wiki/Potion_Craft_Wiki

The website is a little buggy and the ads are annoying but it really does help.

You have to mix ingredients, brew potions, haggle with customers, and manage your finances. Sounds fun, right? Well, not so much when you have to deal with the most annoying and demanding customers ever. They want potions for everything: love, health, beauty, strength, invisibility, you name it. And they’re never satisfied with the price or the quality. They’ll complain, bargain, threaten, and even try to rob you. And don’t get me started on the ingredients. You have to gather them from the forest, the swamp, the mountains, and other dangerous places. You have to dodge traps, monsters, bandits, and angry villagers. You have to spend hours grinding them, boiling them, stirring them, and hoping they don’t explode in your face. And you have to do all this while keeping track of your recipes, your inventory, your reputation, and your competitors. It’s exhausting!

Potion Craft is a game that will test your patience, your creativity, and your sanity. It’s also a game that will make you laugh, cry, and rage quit. It’s a game that will make you feel like a real alchemist, for better or for worse.

The first bit of play shows a lot of potential but its extremely grindy and gets repetitive very quickly, and this only gets worst over time. The mid game is where the vast majority of people give up because progressing in the game just means potions take longer and are harder and much much more tedious to make. meanwhile the reward for making those potions is... well nothing, a bit more money, which you can use to make more potions. the story isnt effected by the potions you make, nothing special happens or unlocks when you find a new potion, there is litterally no reward other than ""now you can go hunt down an EVEN MORE TEDIOUS POTION! congratulations!"" 

Im not really sure what they can do to fix it at this point but the gameplay just isnt fun. maybe if the level up skills had new and significantly greater effects on the potion making process, and if each potion actually.. did something, like if you could interact with them in some way use them somehow. the game is pretty but for a potion making game there isnt really any feeling of magic. have monsters show up in the garden that we can use the fire/explosion potions on, have pests show up that we need to use poison on. i mean a big update thats been in the works for like a year is supposed to make it so plant growth potion can be used to grow your plants but... why the hell was that not already part of the game, that seems so basic, and thats the only potions they are (tenativly) planning to make actually useable.

[i]-A concerned customer looking at me add the 50th poisonous mushroom to the mix[/i]
[hr][/hr]

[b]Potion Craft[/b] realizes the fantasy that everyone had at least once about living a laid back and simple life in a fantasy/medieval setting.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game is very simple, harvest ingredients, brew potions, sell them to various customers and buy better ingredients to brew yet more powerful/refined potions that it’s incredible no one else made a game around such a simple gameplay loop.

A highlight is as expected the potion making aspect of the game, the brews don’t require a specific thing to make, instead here each component moves a little potion icon on an alchemical map in a certain pattern to reach the desired effect.

The game keeps itself fresh for a little while, adding components crafting which require certain potions with multiple effect to them, discovering the brewing process and optimizing it for each potion, and a haggling mechanic to get some more margin when buying/selling stuff.

[h1]Story[/h1]
It consists only of recurring characters showing up from time to time but besides a few snippets of information nothing of importance is really going on, no overarching plot or seething, nothing.

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
Unfortunately, it becomes really stale really quickly to the point where I felt completing the game was more of a chore than anything else.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
However, the developers have announced multiple additional features that’ll keep the game from being boring once it’s going to be updated.

- Aesthetics. I'm sure that's why many of us noticed this game in the first place.
- The map and path idea is one of the best interpretations I've seen in alchemy games.

[h2]Bad[/h2]
- Gets tedious very quickly. As you progress further and customers asking for more complicated stuff, you can't really skip the marathons needed to complete those potions. You are free to pick what ingredients to create a potion, but that is limited by supply of ingredients, so you shouldn't even save complicated recipes unless it's really, really good. That means 90% of the time you are starting a potion manually, you can't skip any of the crushing stirring brewing labor - to a point I think if I'm doing this irl I'd be crushing the mortar & pestle so hard I'll break them. Funny enough that makes haggling with customers way less brain-draining than making potions. 
- Almost no shortcuts in the game! As I said you're mostly not saving recipes unless very simple / brilliant. Whirlpools are also mostly useless.

Though the game feels like it could easily be expanded to include more shop management, herb foraging, even quest-like aspects, as a stay-at-home dad I also really appreciate that the simplicity of Potion Craft means it can be picked up and put down with ease.

There's a page that suggests the potion set up can be upgraded with new spoons or bellows, but I have not seen anything mentioning it after nearly 30 days! Instead of waiting for traveling merchants, I would have preferred visiting a store to buy ingredients as needed, and see shop upgrades locked behind high prices or prerequisites instead of being caught in the lurch with no money when the sorcerer pops in once a week.

I assume moon/sun salt is what rotates the bottle on the alchemy map.

There are five separate screens, each with its own purpose: a workshop in which to make potions, your store, your back garden, your basement (presumably for those people you really don't like), and your bedroom.  The bulk of the gameplay occurs in the workshop and the store.  So... what do the other rooms do?

The bedroom is where you advance to the next day (that's it...).  The back garden will produce a crop of alchemical ingredients once per day.

And it's with the garden that I have a problem.  You-the-player have absolutely no control of which plants will spawn there.  This is a problem because if you have several people show up requesting the exact same kind of potion, you can easily run out of ingredients (especially if there are only two or three of a given direction in the morning).  A system where you can plant seeds to ensure you get certain plants is sorely needed.

The actual gameplay is great.  To brew a potion, you must choose an ingredient (which can travel across the map in a set path), prepare it, add it to the potion, stir the potion, repeat.  There are obstacles on this map to avoid.  To complete a potion, you must boil your cauldron close to an effect node.  The node determines which effect you get, and your proximity to it determines the potion's strength (on a scale of 1-3).  All of this is explained in the tutorial, which is very helpful.

In your shop, you sell the potions you brew and can buy ingredients.  But be cautious, if you sell poisons to unscrupulous sorts, you'll gain a reputation (and customer base) befitting an evil alchemist.

This is a very relaxing game and has a lot going for it, but the complete lack of control over what ingredients are in stock makes progress VERY (read: EXTREMELY) frustrating.  

Anecdotally, I had six customers across two days all request stone-armor potions, and I could not use the same recipe more than twice because I kept running out of ingredients.  That's in addition to the Stone Armor potion I needed for the project in the basement.

The basement... I'll be honest.  I have no clue why the basement is there.  Supposedly you can make things down there, but they don't seem to have any use and are a real pain to complete.",1689471397,1689471397,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

The recipe book is great but 1. i ran out of space for the book so i had to cram every recipe next to one another which made the icons useless and 2. the game turned from a potion crafting game to a retail shop worker simulator.

Pros:
On the one hand, it's meditative and completely predictable, which I like - vendors come at scheduled intervals, potion ingredients always work the same way, the maps are static. No surprises. For someone looking for a very set game, this is good. I enjoy meticulously organizing my spell book, and it was satisfying to make sure I have potion paths I can deviate from to avoid some of the repetition and grind (I save a recipe just before making a potion, so that if I need a different variant later, I don't have to retrace my steps).

Cons:
That said, I hate the mouse precision. My wrist hurts from mixing and pounding herbs. The accuracy required to get a potion just right is a giant PITA. I frequently slip slightly and miss my level III potions, which is extremely annoying. I also struggle with the haggling for the same reason. Mouse precision is the biggest detractor of the game, hands down.

I also dislike how dim the map is. It's difficult to visually see where the potion locations are - they're marked, but not brightly. They should get large and stick out as you zoom out, instead of remaining proportionate to the rest of the map. I also can't fully zoom out of the water map, either. Definitely annoying.

I wish there was a little more in game guidance - gems were expensive so I hoarded them, never actually realizing that they teleport you. I didn't understand the whirlpools either, until I looked some things up. 

The addition of the oil map seems sort of meh. I wish all the potions were available on both maps. It's nice and all, to have easy access to some of the hard potions from the water map, but in general it seems a little meh.

The complex potions required for the end game alchemy crafting are just unnecessarily tedious. I keep a meticulous spell book, and the spells needed to create the philosopher's stone make a huge stack! Let alone the end game salt.

Neutral comments:
Neutral thing that some might like or dislike: the music is a short loop of medieval-sounding flutes / lutes. It's repetitive, which I'm fine with, but some might find it grating.",1689324478,1689366913,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The result is a game of exploring the unknown and dexterous crafting. Pretty neat.

The game allows you to save recipes (which aren't just the ingredients but also how you used them) so you won't have to mortar & pestle every single potion.",1689060349,1689060349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I installed and played the demo, and I really liked it. I bought the actual game when it came out, but I was unable to play it, because each time when I tried to start it it crashed itself and crashed Steam as well.
Today I bought it again, hoping it might have improved, but now I just get stuck on the loading page and the game itself never starts. I gave up after 15 mins waiting for it to load. My computer was only using about 55% of memory during that time, and the game itself was supposedly using about 10% of my CPU, but the loading screen never got past about 2/7 loaded. 
I'm really disappointed, because after enjoying the demo I was willing to buy the game and wanted to play it, but so far I have been completely unable to get the game to run.
I'm running it on Steam on Windows 10 Home edition and Windows and Steam are all up to date.

I am used to more pvp fast paced-games, but got burntout and wanted to look for solo games
I tried cultist simulator, xcom and some other (maybe I should check stardew valley?!). These seemed like stuff I would enjoy, thematically, mechanically, but I did not exactly work as intended, eventhough those are great games: there were some intrinsic hardship and pressure embeded that resembled the games I wanted to take a break of.

Potion Craft on the other hand fits like a glove to the lvl of casual play I was looking for. You have 0 time pressure, can explore many different ways to do things ""mostly freely"" while still offering challenges mechanically and on resource management. Following the Chapters is a good way to aim for the next steps, but I let myself wander throughout the map seeking for the new potions that I could come across (whilst gathering some extra xp hehe).

Some reviews say it can be repetitive. For me it felt quite the opposite, I was actually very inclined on doing many of the recipes by hand, looking for better procedures/sequences so that I could maybe find a nicer, more optimized path to a potion with the ingredients I had stockpiled.

I feel the UI and design are gorgeous and very helpful to navigate the game [spoiler] once I found out about how the colors work was great to speed things up[/spoiler]. As an RTS player, having hotkeys for recipe book, and other additional data would be a nice +, but nothing urgent. Speaking of the recipe book, I am onto a more extreme customization approach on this matter: at the current state it works, but I would very much appreciate a higher lvl os customization regarding bookmarks, so that more than an icon can fit it, maybe change border color? add a custom shape around the icon? stuff that could differentiate two different recipes for the same potion.

I am on the fence about recommending this game. I think, at any time before the 10 hour mark, I might have rated this game much higher. However, the quest for 100% completion kind of soured me on the experience. Later objectives, such as the max reputation achievement, require mind-numbing levels of repetition, even when using the recipe book mechanic. Most of the late game recipes are less 'challenging' and more 'time sink'.

Even then, the nail in the coffin for me is that the game desperately needs accessibility options or alternate control schemes for those of us with weak wrists. The motions needed for every potion (grinding, stirring) can easily aggravate past repetitive strain injuries, to the point where there are user-made guides on how to write an AutoHotkey script to mitigate this.

The update was announced shortly after the launch and I just haven't played it since because I don't want to see the whole game and then do it again with some added stuff (which, by the update description, is much needed especially for endgame stuff). Disregard my play time since it was a lot of AFK, I played until I reached the 2nd potion base (1st one being water) and it's just sitting here at my library since then.

If it was early access and the update was implemented at real launch, it would be fine. If the update came sooner it would be fine, if you didn't announce it right after launch it would also be better than this. But this way you have a lot of 'stuck' players that have been waiting for months and nothing happens.

I just think the way potion crafting is designed is too repetitive and there's no other elements in the game to keep me engaged. E.g. If I play a cooking game, they add variety by making you prepare different ingredients a different way ... sometimes you have to chop it and sometimes you have to boil it.

Potion Creation system in this game used a map system, the potion as a ship of the map, the potion mark as the destination and a death zone serving in which will destroy the process. There is a reputation system where you can have different customer demanding for different potion. Its hard to run out of things to do. After 12 hours of playing I still have a lot to do and got introduced to more advanced mechanics of the game (in which I will not disclose).

Pros:
- Simple and easy to understand game with sufficient difficulty as level progressed
- Assets, Art style and UI of the game complements each other and forms a great environment.
- Customers and merchants stories to create world building of the game
- [b]THE PESTLE AND MORTAR!!![/b]
- A customized book to keep track of the recipe you have created.
- Great music
- Reputation and Popularity System to change types of customer and a haggling system.
- Potion Customization

Cons:
- Repetitive game play
- Requires a better Recipe book system once recipes pages have become cluttered
- Lack of interior customization
- Need a better sorting system for choosing ingredients (in the late quite confusing to keep track of everything)

Suggestions for future Updates:
- More Sound/ Voices Effects to better enrich the experience
- Needs an Encyclopedia of Potions already Brewed
- More Customization for every stations to better change the atmosphere.
- A garden system where u can specifically choose which plants to grow
- A notepad in game to that the player can write on to keep track of the player's current goal or needs.",1687202910,1687202910,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just want something to where I can turn off my brain, and not have to focus on anything. I was clicking around youtube and looking for games. There was one you-tuber who was an animator, and animated the game. It was a great meme about this game. It made me laugh, so I bought the game and gave it a shot. Its really hard to find more relaxed peaceful games these days. And this is an amazing game if you just want something simple and relaxing.

Cons: You never get to see your potions in action. If you could get the smallest hint such as an image showing the outcome of your potion, the game would be much better. For example, lots of customers want Explosion potions and Wild Growth potions. If the game showed you an image of your customer using your potion to blast open a cave-in, or an image of your customer's crops growing to enormous sizes, that would increase the satisfaction you get from this game by several orders of magnitude.

Also, in my humble opinion, this game would greatly benefit from an Adventure Mode where you take on quests. For example, the King giving you a quest to chase away goblins. You could use an Explosion potion, of course, or you could use a Stone Skin potion to protect yourself during combat. You could even use a Charm potion to persuade the goblins to work for you instead. The possibilities are limitless in this sort of game.",1686407469,1686407469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the rest of the potion was made by taking that wonderful base and pouring water. More, more, more water. More water. Endless deluge of the clear liquid, enough to fill the entire cauldron, flood the lab floor, and ruin your downstairs neighbour's ceiling. In the end, the aquatic ordeal leaves the potion completely devoid of anything it could've been, and you end up pouring it down the drain.

It starts out [b]fantastic[/b]. There isn't much of a plot, you're just a young alchemist who stumbled upon an abandoned workshop (biggest wish fulfillment of 2023) and decided to reopen it. People ask you for potions, so that's what you get them. The brewing system is ingenious: adding ingredients moves your ""potion marker"" on the effects map, and in order to get a particular effect, you have to reach its designated point, and heat the potion up to a boil.

At first, the map is pure joy to explore. You're constantly finding new effects, collecting experience books, finding out how the map itself works, and unlocking milestones that make you move forward in the ""Path of the Alchemist"", which unlocks new NPCs, new ingredients, new merchants.

But then... you slowly start noticing the unmistakable flavour of [i]repetition[/i]. Everybody wants a healing potion. Sure, I can brew you a healing potion. Oh, what's this? I'm out of a critical ingredient! But I can replace it with something else that ""moves right"", I'll just save both recipes so I won't have to do it again. Oh, but in order to get more exotic effects you have to move further into the map. And it's just so slow. So many ingredients just so you can explore the map. The same path, over and over again. Take the ingredient, smash it into pulp, put it in the cauldron, repeat. And again. And again.

Note that many actions are achieved by the ""pumping power of the mouse"" so to speak. So to crush an object in the mortar, you literally have to crush it by holding it with the mouse cursor. Same for stirring, same for pouring water, same for using the bellows. Not only this becomes extremely tedious later on, it also makes crafting tier 3 potions an exercise in ridiculous mouse precision (it's not about the recipe, it's about making the potion marker be [i]exactly[/i] in the right place. Hint: doing it is not fun).

Eventually, a new option shows up: you get an alchemy machine that's supposed to be able to craft legendary recipes. Wow, a gameplay change! Exciting! Until it turns out that those recipes still need lots of ""normal"" potions to be made, and often these potions require a weird combination of properties that will have you make your potion take a very long trip across the alchemy map...

And that's what this really boils down to. Everything is just so shallow and tedious. There is a reputation system, but it's pretty much a bare minimum. There is some dialogue with unique NPCs (including a discount Geraldo del Riviero), but it's quite rare, and incredibly short. There is a barter system with a nice dressing of difficulty levels and topics of conversation, but in practice it's just a QTE, and not a fun one.

Like I said: there's a solid base, but it ends up drowning in an industrial amount of water. There's more to complain about, such as the annoying way the game provides you with ingredients (they're working on this part at least), but I think I've said enough.

To wrap things up - some statistics. This is a game with 17k reviews at the time of writing, indicating a very successful, well-known indie game. And yet, the achievements paint a quite rapid dropoff rate. Some 50% of players have completed the first chapter, only 25% completed the third, 11% the fifth (I gave up right before that)... and only 0.9% have beaten chapter 10, the final one. Part of it is probably because a lot of people are drawn in by the unique art style without considering what kind of game it is, but I think a lot of people simply find the game gets very boring very fast. That's what happened to me at least, and I have an inkling I wasn't the only one.

I liked:
* The gameplay, easy to understand but hard to master. A mix between exploration and puzzle, very satisfying when you manage to find a path to your potion with only a few ingredients
* The progress, the first hours are not repetitive because new options to make potions arrive continuously (either new ingredients or new potion base)
* The art style, simple but beautiful design
* The dialogs with the NPCs are diversified. I did not have the sensation to always hear the same customers after several hours of gameplay, which is nice :)
* Potion customization, it is always more fun to have a ""Fart in a bottle"" than a ""Strong potion of stench""

I didn't like:
* The karma, not very useful, and I didn't like how the game punish you with losing popularity when you refuse to serve a customer who doesn't match your karma choice
* The last big recipes are overly difficult and not fun to make, it is just very long",1685268661,1685268661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

4 hours into the game and I was asking myself ""why I'm even doing this ?"".

When I read about the game and saw the videos/images I thought there would be some kind of story to it. I expected something like what VA-11 Hall-A does where you can piece together some story through dialogues and the gameplay influences it a little.
Maybe a development narrated through the NPCs dialogues, some decisions that would influence the flow of the story, good & evil path, but no. I'm halfway into the main quest and nothing like that, nothing interesting, just literal work.

The art is beautiful, the price is good, the controls although tiring are nice (there is some QoL features, but there could be more, e.g. auto grinding, grinding more than 1 items at the same time, etc), but I felt no purpose to play the game itself if there's no clear story happening.

I remember getting this game before all the updates and achievements and such. It was already the most aesthetically pleasing game I've ever seen. It's genuine art, and what's better, it's the kind of art-style that doesn't age, kinda like pixel-art but medieval. The main gameplay loop was slightly short, but updates to the map and some of the other gameplay elements reworked that beautifully. Plus I got what I was most looking forward to: different bases for potions.

It's not a complex or difficult game by any stretch of the imagination and it's certainly not going to be a challenge, but that's not what I came for anyway. I came for the relaxing atmosphere and beautiful art, and that's  precisely what I got. The gameplay loop is loose enough to allow for mistakes while still retaining every single customer so there's not much need to worry. So far I haven't been in a situation in which I would need to optimize ingredients either. It's just a calm, satisfying experience. The exact kinda thing to wind down and relax.

The graphics look exactly as they're advertised, no corners being cut anywhere. Everything seems like it passes through a filter as a final pass over the graphics, because the paper lines align on different objects despite them moving around, joy to look at. Animations are clean and easily readable.
On top of that, the physics engine is a pure joy to work in, it's incredibly satisfying to throw items into the pot from a distance or bounce them off a wall or ceiling.
And last but not least, the UI is ever so intuitive and fun. It's hard to strike that balance between novelty and user-friendliness when designing UI, but this game managed it.

There's a couple very minor things I'd like to mention so that it doesn't look like I'm just an obsessed fan:
The music can get a little repetitive after a while, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, after all, it's supposed to be  a relaxing game and part of that is being predictable, but one could appreciate a few more tunes to choose from or unlock, something like enchanted forever-playing music boxes you could collect and switch between.
There's some minor hitbox/clickbox issues near the edge of the cauldron and the map, where clicking/dragging on the map will be ignored.
The cauldron also accepts ingredients into it even if they're only placed in front of it (not that you would do this a lot, I was just messing with the physics of the herbs).

No way to give yourself a name, make your shop really your own. Even some cosmetic change up, unlocking some decor, giving your shop a name adding some more player directed dialogue from customers depending on your reputation would really help liven up this game. 

As many other reviews have stated the game becomes very boring after a while, especially as you end up making the same old potions again and again, make anything new or exciting and no one requests it. I think the game also needs a passive way to sell potions. Perhaps leaving them out on the shop counter means people can pick them up and leave cash, maybe its slightly lower than if you sold it directly (and you would not be able to haggle) but it would mean any experimental potions aren't wasting space clogging up the screen. I also find the small handful of customers per day irritating, I want more to sell too. 

In terms of game performance I have one issue I find very irritating. Sometimes, despite being more than centred to a potion icon on the map it refuses to upgrade to II or III which means I either have to stuff more necessary ingredients into my potion to re-centre it or get stuck with a weak potion. It's a pain I am tired of dealing with. 

Overall this game is fun at first but there is not enough to retain my attention. I really want more personality to it, I want to feel like the shop is my own, I want to feel like I am a part of this town, that my day to day means something in the game.

EDIT: After playing the game longer I have realised that a passive way to sell potions you make is what this game desperately needs. Requests are all good and dandy but having only them as a way to sell your potions, kills the incentive to experiment and play around creating potions as no one buys them (the poorly rotating requests is what makes game play so stale.) For this game to be truly a shop sim you need a way to sell of other potions for it to be engaging and enjoyable. 

In terms of resource management it would also be ideal if you could save maybe three variations of potion recipe since then it would account for the stressful resource management element, if the game recognises there are multiple ways to craft one potion it could save a lot of irate game play.",1684205968,1684268892,False,5,0,0.560410261154174805,0,True,False,False

If you don't like games with that kind of feel, this probably isn't for you. It can be somewhat repetitive if you play it a lot, but the updates have added a lot of new, varied and more challenging content to the game to keep it fresh. 

I really love how there's many different ways to achieve the same potion, so you can vary your recipes depending on the conditions you're working with and ingredients you have, and you can genuinely learn little techniques and tricks for achieving the best results. I think the recipe book feature and how it gives you the ability to save recipes, organize them, customize them and take notes on them is a god-tier element.

Some of the things I could see being improved on this game are: Giving us somewhere to store and organize potions you've pre-made and are saving up to either sell in the shop or use for Alchemy. I'd love a little storage room in the shop that's just a wall with some shelves you can arrange potions on, and maybe little labels you can put on the shelves. It'd be both useful and cute!

Would also love a way to be able to request for specific merchants to visit you - maybe make it so you can write a letter asking them to drop by? It's annoying when you're all set with everything you need to complete a level except purchasing something from a specific merchant, and then it takes several days for them to come. Could be something you unlock once you reach a certain level of popularity or something like that.

""exploring"" the space, by experimenting and pushing the boundaries, rewards you both with new effects and with experience. all of these things combine to make you genuinely feel like [strike] spiderman [/strike] you're very carefully preparing a potent brew. and that's not even getting into the alchemy system, which is also pretty in-depth.

The game perfectly capture the feeling of starting off as a novice alchemist and gradually becoming better as the game goes on with the map system of potion-making; at the start it feels unknown and the only way to learn where every potion is located is through trial and error. As the game goes on, you become more and more familiar with the map and it feels more like a well-known path you travel through to get to your potions. The recipe book also adds to this feeling, starting off completely blank and as you go through the game it becomes dense and crammed with different recipes.

The way you create your path to the potions is also another great thing about the game! There aren't any bland ingredients that only take you in a straight, cardinal direction. They all have weird and complex designs that force you to become creative with how you tackle each obstacle.

The only negative I have with the game is the different salts you can make; they change the way you make your potions drastically but they come in too late to make a big enough difference.

More capacity to actually use your own potions beyond selling them sounded nice as well. Maybe even as part of the alchemy process itself?

And while I do have my criticisms of certain things, I still very much recommend this game.
But with that all being said, here were the ""issues"" I had with this game. 
It should be noted that the developer appears to still be tweaking and improving the game, so hopefully these issues will be improved for future players.

• By far my biggest complaint is that endgame is a slog. At day 90 I had popularity level 13, and had created every substance and had 2 or 3 optimized recipes for every potion. However to finish the questline, you need to reach popularity level 15. This took me another 54 days to complete, and it was 90% just quick brewing my saved recipes and throwing them at the customer. The gameplay is so reduced at this point, it's not even worth the effort to fulfill the more exotic requests (Give me hard potion X using only 1 type of ingredient). Just boot them out, take the -9 to your popularity, then fill out the next 19 easy requests at +4 popularity each. It took another 14 days to flip my reputation from +100 to -100 for the achievement, so by that math 40% of my days were spent grinding.

• You get more talent points than what you can spend on abilities. Either cap the player level, or give more abilities for us to buy. One of the talent trees (map visibility radius) is literally useless after a certain point. Talents to increase the popularity you gain for completing requests would help more to address endgame.

• The ""Shop Upgrades"" tab is useless. It makes you think that you'll get the chance to upgrade your equipment (Cauldron, Ladle, Bellows, etc). But the only thing ""upgradable"" is the Alchemy Machine (which is also fully unrealized, as it was clearly designed for more recipes than what is in the game, including a second chemical furnace that never gets used). If you mess up in the Alchemy Machine you make ""Unknown Substance"", which is useless outside getting the achievement. A recipe that gave it a use would be nice. I expected the ability to upgrade my ""copper"" equipment to increase potion efficiency (like making ingredients go further, or grind them together to change their effect path).

• Money is also useless in endgame. You can only really buy ingredients, but if you've optimized your recipes, you gain gold faster than you can spend it. I literally gave up haggling because I had 100k gold and 50~100 of each ingredient. If you could buy expensive reagents from the other alchemist (who SOLD you the machine, so he should be able to make them), that would be convenient.

• There's only 2 potion bases (water and oil), which is fine, but there's no need to list them in a sub-menu, as it makes you think there's more. You could just put them as 2 tabs at the corner of the alchemy map to make it easier to switch between them.

• It would be nice to have a better ""statistics"" page, that gave you an idea of how often you made and sold certain potion effects. I had an feeling that I only sold like 5 rage potions the entire game, while selling dozens of the others.

• I take issue with some of the descriptions customers use.
Asking for improved ""agility"" apparently means they want ""Dexterity"", not ""Speed"".
Asking for improved ""reflexes"" apparently means they want ""Speed"", not ""Dexterity"".

• The game never tells you this, but when making potions for the Alchemy Machine, the order of the effects do NOT matter.
As long as it has the same effect symbols, the machine will accept it. This is helpful to know as otherwise you might try to match the symbol order, which could involve moving to opposite ends of the map several times.

Overall though, I did enjoy this game enough to 100% it. It's charming and challenging, and the fact that the developer is still making improvements means that the game is only going to get better from here.",1682701904,1682701904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a lot of fun with this game at first. You get requests from customers, and have to brew a potion that meets their needs.
To make the potion, you have a map, and you use your ingredients to chart a path round the map to reach the desired effect.
Sometimes a customer will specify the ingredient they want in it, sometimes they’ll specify one they really don’t.

As you meet customers’ needs, you’ll gain more reputation, and customers will start asking for more complicated potions.

You do have a recipe book to automatically brew something you made before, so you don’t always have to do it from scratch. 

The game was really enjoyable for the first while, gaining new ingredients and finding new and more efficient ways to reach the effects you want. 

After a while it started to get a bit tedious as customers started needing new recipes with a maximum number of ingredient types and other such quirks that I couldn’t pull straight from my book. And brewing the philosophers stone and going round all the map getting the right effects was a little exhausting.

But overall, the game is enjoyable for the first 20 hours or so, so I’d definitely recommend it. It’s nice for just little chunks of gameplay here and there instead of a long sitting though. 

And it looks like the devs are working on new features like a garden system that might add some new variety into the otherwise repetitive gameplay loop.

[b]Customers served:[/b]   1400+

---------------------------------
[H1]About the Main Objectives[/h1]
The main goals in game are to create legendary substances and their respective ""consumables"".
There are 5 Tiers of legendary substances and each need all the preceding tier ingredients to make, and you will need to make 2 substances of each tiers to complete the objectives.

i.e. You have just made a Tier 4 substance, and your next objectives will be making a Tier 4 consumable plus a Tier 5 substance.
So you will need to use your Tier 4 substance + 12 potions to make the Tier 4 consumable,
and another Tier 4 substance as an ingredient (making it from Tier 1 to Tier 4 again), + another 12 potions to make a Tier 5 substance. 
This situation happens in every tiers throughout the game, from Tier 1 to 5.

[H1]Why One-click Everyting[/H1]
You will be serving 1400+ customers, so you may not want to brew the potions from map every time.
And for the ingredient potions of legendary recipes, many of them requires you to travel back and forth the map, corners to corners, or 5 different spots on map.
So you will not want to do them twice for any recipes, but save the path of recipes so you can one click it when you need to make them again if needed.
The game becomes a resource management issue, you just need to replenish the ingredients, buying all the discounted goods from merchants everytime, and one click the recipes to serve customers until reaching the final reputation required.

[h1]Reputation System[/h1]
For the reputation system, there are no endings for the good or evil side, no stories or hidden missions to complete, just different types of customers you will encounter.

[h1]Consumables[/h1]
Consumable are so tedious to make, and you may not want to use them on fulfilling the customer additional needs, but just saving them to make legendary recipes. Therefore making the consumables are merely just objectives to complete the game.",1682148310,1682149272,False,29,2,0.697525084018707275,2,True,False,False

Although it's not an earlyaccess game, the dev still keep posting regular announcement for updates because this game is yet too empty. This game has 10 chapters but the only first 4 chapters contains original missions, and the rest of chapters are copy&pasted from those.

First it's not a detailed simulator game, what you going to do is moving your empty bottle icon to a potion icon on the map by using ingredients that each have own direction like some ingredient only move your bottle north, other does south. And also that's all about game.

Your main goal is unlocking achievements and those are mostly creating a new potion so you keep explore a new potion on the tasteless map for many hours with very few new experience. The another mission is fixing your alchemy machine, to do that you also gather bunch of specific potions so you keep exploring over and over, and even fixing the machine doesn't affect the game balance that much, no satisfaction and reward.

It's been over 18 months since the game released, still there is very few contents and material to play, instead the game gives you so much same repeatable task to buy(waste) your time.

Pros:

- Kind of fun to create new potions

- Nice to have some talents and things to look forward to unlocking

- Art style is great (except for background color)

Cons:

- Entire screen is that light ""paper"" color which causes massive eye strain over time. A dark mode would be extremely helpful

- Gets old pretty quick

- Music is horrible and horribly repetitive


TL;DR: Get it on sale and go into it understanding what it is and what to expect.

Edit: Sadly, I had to refund because the eye strain is so incredibly bad. This has never happened to me before in 30+ years of gaming and I know it's because there's nothing to break up the constant stream of light background. Please add a dark mode. Dark mode would make the game 7/10 instantly.

Beware of this: When customer comes up to you wanting a potion you haven't discovered, most of the time you will have to turn them down or use a ridiculous amount of resources only to discover a potion you never needed. This is mostly a problem early on because only a quarter of the map will have been discovered but you will not always have the right resources or enough gold to buy those resources to discover in a direction you need.

This game was a pleasent surprise to begin with and it keeps growing on me. It's easy to understand the basics, and I constantly find new ways of working with game mechanics to get further or be more efficient. This goes really well hand in hand with the fantasy of being an alchemist: An inexperienced alchemist will throw some ingredients, stir around and call it a day. It will work just fine. However, a more experienced alchemist will use maybe half of them but will insted carefully heat the couldron just a little, stir around 3 times (2 or 4 times will cause the substance to fail) add a tiny bit of water, stir some more. Exact preparation routines becomes more important and the substances will get stronger. Everything is very visual and incredibly well executed.

Having to very frequently move the mouse to grind herbs, mix the components in the cauldron and heat it, is one of the most annoying and stupid ""rinse and repeat"" actions I have ever done in a game.

The ""haggling via mouse-click when marker hovers over a box"" mini-game is just another version of this stupidity. I wish I could at least haggle at the very hard setting right at the start, but guess what, you have to bury 15 talent points in that feature just to be able to finally have any sort of  challenge in the game.

Finally, I'm not sure that I'm supposed to take it as a challenge (or a joy) to spend 90% of game-time on ZIGZAGGING AROUND in order to MAYBE head toward what MIGHT BE the recipe that I need for my current customer.

But that sounds like a rant. Let me spew it the way ChatGPT did, just for fun :

""I'm not sure if the game is intended to be challenging or enjoyable when players have to spend a significant amount of time zigzagging around in search of a recipe for a customer. Perhaps there could be ways to streamline the process or provide clearer hints to make the gameplay more engaging.""

Sounds about right.

This game needs a resource that you gain (via sleep or XP ?) and then spend to give you hints (e.g. cardinal directions) to where a certain recipe is on the map. Otherwise you're almost laughing at the player.

The game is apparently still in early access but I honestly don't know what could be added everything is so polished; haven't even encountered a single bug or glitch. There's already a fully fleshed out ""endgame"" with the alchemy machine and if you hard-lined the game you could *maybe* finish in 10 hours so its not lacking in content.

The game is already well worth the $15 price tag (which has been discounted for the past month as of writing) and if any more gets added the devs will need to up that number because it feels a little unfair.

I have started over a few times because there is replay-ability. You can focus on being good or evil by choosing which customers to help and which to turn away and depending on who comes to you, the majority of the potions they want are different. Furthermore, you can craft various potions in an endless variety of ways and save the recipes. Customers will sometimes give you a challenge to make them a potion with only so many ingredients or using a certain type, which increases the strategy and puzzle-solving. I usually hate puzzle games, but this one is really fun because of how open-ended the solutions are. It is fun to find a way to make someone's request work; it feels like an accomplishment. I also like that you have to figure out what potion would meet the customer's needs. The balance and progression are just right. You can also design your potion bottles and the label art to be unique to each potion and/or each time you play, making your potions feel more like your own, personal creation.

30 mins in, I enjoyed the game.
60 mins in, I'm already sick and tired of the game mechanics.

It's NOT worth it.
Early/Late gameplay are so similar, you wont even notice any difference.

Removing all the pretty pictures, the mechanic consist of predefined lines for players to re-draw, unlocking different types of lines to use in unlocking more versatile lines to use.

An original idea, hands down to this. BUT not well imagined to people who want just a casual potion craft experience with or without selling. When you miserably fail to brew a potion that took about 20 minutes to get there on the map... depleting all the precious and valuable ingredients... like me, several times... you rage quit and never come back.

THE GAME IS GIVING ME RSI. Hooooly wow the devs need to add some control options for disabling the repetitive actions you have to take to complete potions.

It's a fun game... to a point. After a certain point the recipes that are being asked for are just mostly frustrating. The alchemical ingredients are hard to get to, and sometimes require items that you may not see for many many days because RANDOM CHANCE IS THE CRUELEST METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION. If you need a certain stone to bypass a wall, and the miner doesn't bring it to you for 15+ days, that's just annoying, it's not fun. You now have to recreate recipes to un-gate yourself instead of continuing to progress.

ALSO NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND SHOULD GO TO THE FINAL SHOP LEVEL. I shudder to think how many hours that achievement takes, it's mind-boggling. I've seen pretty much everything the game has to show at this point, and I don't want to repeat that content for 20 more hours to just get an achievement.

It starts off fun and finishes annoying. I still would recommend it because the game is fun, pretty, and well made... for a while. If you get it on sale, you should play it until it stops being fun.

Also the recipe book reallllly starts to break down after a certain point, as your stackable recipe tabs start becoming very cluttered. Really the game just falls apart in the endgame.",1632384767,1680574519,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game after release is not markedly different. You wake up and collect the herbs from your garden- they are random and only so numerous. You cannot accrue buffs or skills to grow your garden. You don't tend to it. You can also get ingredients from merchants but they are expensive. I will admit that the haggling mechanic has improved since release but it is not enjoyable- I simply don't experience a clench of tread when I consider haggling. There are no quests and nothing to do. People come in and ask for potions. You make them. Day ends, do it all over again. The potion brewing map is fiddly and intolerable.

This game had (has? it's 2023 already) potential. While it is a simple idea, the map exploration using ingredients that give you different and non-optimal movements is actually pretty interesting. The actual sale part is not great but better executed than other games when you need to guess what customers wants from ridiculous vague descriptions.

So it holds up for the first few hours. And then, as reviews from YEARS ago complain about... you can't really progress much because of random and stingy offering of ingredients.
How can you go right when you don't have ingredients that go right? Or the ones that you do are extremely pricey and you can't afford using them in your potions..How absurd to design a game like this, I feel like my time has been wasted, I'm not going to grind for hours to get an ingredient that maybe allows me to get to the place I need to get to on the map.

All you needed to do was give the player a LOT of the basic four direction ingredients. That's it. The design could definitely be improved further with ways to grow the ingredients you want so you have a consistent supply, but if you just gave the player a lot of the basic ingredients you could at least attempt to explore more.

Despite its interesting early game I do not recommend buying this. You will only realize it's too grindy and flawed past the refund mark.",1679722653,1679986730,False,0,0,0.49377596378326416,0,True,False,False

It's a decent game to relax, but not much reason to play it after a while. The upgrade/progression feels weak and meaningless, and there's no difficulty to challenge you.

What you see in the gameplay video is all there is. There's no extra feature, nothing that would feel supergood later on.

Also the potion requests are very limited in what they accept, there's not much room for creativity. Sometimes you're even penalized for adding an extra effect which would seem helpful.

Potion Craft is surprisingly immersive for what it is; the graphics and sound are minimal, but what you're getting is a fantasy science kit that rewards curiosity and experimentation. After your first few potions you'll be eagerly cleaning out the Herbalist's inventory so you can brew more niche and outlandish concoctions. A few chapters in you start to acquire a sense that you're playing with fire and treading new scientific ground.

Sometimes it seems unfortunate that there isn't another layer here - that your experimentation isn't rewarded with emergent gameplay in some other parallel system, like being able to dungeon crawl with your own potions. But for the price I think Potion Craft does what it aims to do: provide a complex but low-stakes experimentation toy that's easy to grasp but also deep without being stressful or demanding to explore.

One time this doesn't really apply is when you're trying to make the end-game potions, which are really far away on the map and need special materials to make, but that's supposed to be changed in a new update with a new map if I remember correctly.

If you are devoting yourself to completing this whole game it will help to have your favorite show or music streaming in the background--it's going to be a long ride.

The RNG elements of the game can be downright cruel and even nonsensical at times. In the late game, customers will make ridiculous demands (some of which might actually be impossible). The money/reputation earned for complying only goes up very slightly while you stand to lose an entire 2 customer's worth of reputation/""honor."" 

If you ignore these requests and the customer leaves, it's only mere seconds to earn back the points, but over the course of a full playthrough it will add up. One can only judge for themselves if spending the minutes trying to craft the perfect potion for a single customer--one that will likely only rarely ever come up again--is worth it over the long run compared to having to recapture the lost points.

The only thing you are really losing is your real-life time as the game remains on an upward trend line towards success as long as you keep serving most of the people.

The timer-based, quick-click, ""haggling"" mini-game will either break up the monotony or really mess up the relaxed nature of the rest of the puzzle-based game depending on your point of view. And, at least at the beginning of the game, it is something you can't afford to skip.

That all sounds a bit negative, but in reality the game is a lot fun if you take it for what it is. But you need to know what you are getting into before buying. That being said, if you want a game that will let you do some organization, optimizing, and problem solving in a unique art style, this will likely be a good choice.",1636300448,1679170354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.

I'm really enjoying the fact that many games have gone for a medieval Europe-like art style. Sure it could become over-saturated soon, but for now it's still fairly fresh! And the music that accompanies this game is fitting and lovely to listen to.

The game loop is satisfying without getting too tedious, at least for me. Exploring the map can be really exciting, and the requests from the customers go up in a steady climb. It's a bit irksome that we don't have access to the Alcohol map (unless I'm dense and just missed it), as you can't 'finish' the game without it.

Соль - 1 щепотка
Масло растительное для жарки - 2-3 ст. ложки
1) Подготовить необходимые продукты.
2) Яйцо взбить с сахаром и солью в течение пары минут.
3) Добавить молоко, хорошо перемешать.
4) Муку смешать с разрыхлителем и добавить к жидкой массе.
5) Перемешать тесто до однородного состояния.
6) Тесто для оладий должно получиться гуще блинного.
7) На сковороду налить растительное масло, хорошо разогреть на среднем огне. На разогретую сковороду с маслом наливать тесто столовой ложкой и жарить оладьи до золотистого цвета с каждой стороны (ориентировочно по 3 минуты), при необходимости добавляя в сковороду масло. Если сковорода позволяет, жарьте оладьи по несколько штук за раз, у меня сковородка маленькая, поэтому я жарила по одной штучке.
8) Готовые оладьи на молоке подавать со сметаной или вареньем.

The role playing adds an extra layer on top that really feels great to have that level of freedom. My criticism would be that I wish the leveling up system was better fleshed out. For example, some kind of leveling with your garden or a mechanic to actually garden in your garden would make that space feel more applicable. Right now it feels like something to click into and out of and not like you're actually interacting with it in any meaningful way. Also a better way to categorize your potions with how they look and in your book would be nice, they have a way to make all ""tiers"" look the same, but I want to categorize the look by ""death"" and ""life"" potions and so on and the freedom to do that or another way to default their looks so it's easy to recreate. The organizing of the recipe book is also pretty tedious and since it's really useful I have to just spend I lot of time clicking and dragging, which is annoying.

Pros: 
The potion brewing mechanic is unique and the problem solving with limited resources is genuinely fun. 
Getting to know the NPCs and their stories had me engaged and the art style is super charming.

Cons:
Relying on the back garden for random small amounts of resources everyday was really frustrating. I kept tossing wild growth potions and ground up plants back there to see if it would make more stuff grow, but nope, I guess that's it.
Running out of resources and having to turn away customers and taking a huge hit to my reputation is also pretty tough.
Also, I ended up doing a lot of stuff out of order simply because I didn't have the opportunity. I finished a large majority of Chapter 4's achievements before finishing Chapter 3 because I wasn't offered the opportunity to [spoiler] fix the Alchemy machine [/spoiler] for a really long time.

I have always been drawn to games that allow me to create and explore, but I never expected a game about potion-making to elicit such a powerful emotional response.

As I began playing, I found myself completely engrossed in the intricate process of crafting potions. The game requires patience and attention to detail, but the payoff is incredibly satisfying. With each successful potion, I felt a sense of accomplishment that I hadn't experienced in other games.

But what truly struck me about Potion Craft was the sense of healing and catharsis that it provided. As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, I often find myself searching for ways to calm my racing thoughts and find peace. And somehow, this game managed to do just that.

As I mixed ingredients and watched the colors swirl together, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. The repetitive motions and soothing music combined to create a truly meditative experience. And when I finally brewed a potion that cured an in-game character of their ailments, I felt a sense of joy and fulfillment that I hadn't experienced in a long time.

Playing Potion Craft felt like a form of therapy, a way to tap into my innermost emotions and work through them in a safe and comforting environment. I never expected a game about potion-making to have such a profound impact on me, but I am grateful for the experience.

Anyways, it kills me to be giving a negative review of a well-made indie game. But the game has a few glaring issues that just prevented me from enjoying it:
1. The central gameplay loop is tedious. Oh my god it's so tedious. You wake up, brew potions, and give them to customers. It's fun for 2 hours until you realize the   e n t i r e   game is just... this. This is all you get. Forever.
2. The game is surprisingly punishing and it does not prepare you for this fact. Honestly, I would even say the tutorial and first few days are almost deceptive. To succeed, you need to conserve resources, experiment with movement patterns, and create alternate plant combinations for the same potion, but it's never really signalled to you that THIS is how you're supposed to play. You find out when you get kicked in the teeth and you're hemorrhaging money, customers, and reputation. I remember looking up what I was doing wrong only to find tons of other beginners asking the same thing.
3. There is a lack of any plot or any other kind of meaningful gameplay progression (disclaimer: I'm only 2 hours in, but I don't see any trace of one).

I cannot stress how much you just do the same thing forever. It's a shame because the game is well-made... I just wish a little more thought had been given to the central gameplay loop.",1676342476,1676342476,False,2,0,0.509512484073638916,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay is gorgeous, silky smooth, and extremely engaging, but it suffers from a lack of a cohesive story and a wider lack of depth in the long term. Towards the end of the game, I found more enjoyment from organizing my recipe book just so than from making potions.

Making potions is intuitive, entertaining, and easily mastered, and there is a very handy and very customizable (aforementioned) book for saving potions to auto-brew later, but brewing becomes a bit tedious in the middle and late game due to a relatively limited (not small, just limited) number of potion types and only two potion bases. Once you find all of the potion effects, then you've explored everything. There are also ""legendary"" recipes that give you special ingredients that unlock easier ways to traverse the base maps and create potions, but they are given to you automatically and act more as a progression limiter than anything else.

TL;DR: I highly recommend the game with the caveat that it suffers from a lack of depth in the late game. It is more than worth the money if you're looking for a relaxing sim.

The promised list of upcoming, really cool features?  Still a promised list only.  Some of the promises seem fairly easy to deliver -new characters, for example.  No voice acting, no complicated animations, no cut scenes, just a new stylish line drawing and a set of behaviors under the hood.  Nope, nothing there.  Maybe I'm missing some tiny thing, but I just can't find it.  And I'm tired of waiting.  Maybe the devs will surprise us tomorrow, and then maybe I can recommend the game.  In the meantime, file this under ""REALLY FREAKING awesome POTENTIAL, no need to buy yet.""

Update:  In the 5 months since my initial review, I haven't seen any substantial change.  Anything.  Sometimes people hit snags, and sometimes there's a lot going on behind the scenes.  But it seems fair to say that development is not maintaining the previous energetic pace that excited me.

TL;DR:  Already a real game, and the development from demo to early access is really promising.  Discovery + skip grinding by saving the steps in the recipe book.  Ingredient stocks start small, so don't mix everything in a game day... just pick new ingredients tomorrow and realize that you don't have to satisfy every customer.  

This game is really good and has developed nicely from the demo (which was cool).  

Playable demo to early access to full release is a potentially awesome path.

 I recently figured out that I can save a combination that has moved the bottle well even if it hasn't made a potion yet.  This lets me checkpoint for tougher potions.

No spoilers, but none of my customers have ever made it down the mountain quickly but safely because that potion is hiding in a corner of the map somewhere.

 It's also really stable -not one single crash or bug yet, and I've played offline a lot more than hours shown.

A fun game which contains more then I thought it would. relaxing and challenging at the same time.
9/10 for me. (ignore my playtime, I played offline for about 30 hours or so).

The detailed review:
You make potions and sell them to adventurers, townfolks, good and evil people for different purposes.
The game contains several mechanics and inner games, complementing each other, which you need to progress in, in order to finish the game (potion discoveries, potion creations, selling to people which has haggle mechanics which I liked and is quite challenging at high levels, and alchemy machine creation and operation which gets very complex at high levels).
The way it works is you have a potion ""discovery"" map, the different potion locations are hidden from you, and the map is full of obstacles which you cant not see until you encounter them.
You navigate this map by brewing different plant and mineral ingredients into your cauldron, anywhere from 1 to infinite amount of ingredients, each one moves your location on the map based on a specific path unique to that ingredient, and you can take part of the path or all of it, and also use water the center yourself a bit in relation to your origin point.
Overall it allows for pinpoint exploration on a fairly large map that is not so easy to navigate with all the thorny obstacles.
You discover potion formulas on the map over time as you progress in discovering it and then you can make that specific potion you discovered and sell it.
There are maybe 30 potions or so, each unique, and you can create mixed effect potions, with 2 or more effects combined.
The customers come to your shop every day looking to buy potions to solve their problems. some are for good purposes and some are for evil ones, and you can decide to sell or not to sell, which affects your overall alignment as good or evil and which progressively affects the types pf future customers who show up at your shop.
At the same time there is a morale mechanics at work, which is part of your advancement in the game, based on how many potions you've discovered and sold, whether or not you've haggled for prices, your advancement with the alchemy machine and what you create with it, and this affects how many customers per day you get, which allows you to sell more potions and make more money.
You get the ingredients daily from your garden which grows them, which at first is all that you have, but as time passes, sellers start to appear and sell you ingredients, and you rely more and more on them, and you need to prioritize what to buy and try to haggle with them for better prices.
might sound a bit complicated, but its really quite easy when you get into it.

The game requires patience for potion discoveries, some strategy for potion creation and sale and some very quick reflexes for the advanced haggling mechanics,
I've played it for about 30 hours, and i'm not done, I estimate im about 60-70% away from full completion, and i paid 9.99 for the game on sale, so I got a about 50 hours worth of playtime for 10 euro (about the same in Dollars) which is a good and fair price.

Recommended.

But the game itself is too repetitive for my taste. It's always the same, but instead of getting more difficult, it becomes more expensive to progress.

If this was my real life job, I might simply not accept the clients with harder demands because they do not provide more challenge, just more time and effort invested.

After a well paced introduction the game starts to slow down, and it keeps slowing down until it becomes unbearable.
The well of new content and mechanics seem completely dry after about 6-10 hours and at that point it feels like you have to be getting close to having seen 95% of what the game has to offer. 

If you then want to see that final 5% you have to face a grind that will take you an untold number of hours to finish, all while doing the same gameplay you did the first 10 hours of play. 

Disclaimer: I gave up after I finished chapter 9 which involved reaching popularity level 12. And seeing that chapter 10 requires you to reach popularity level 15.

I loved Potion Craft from the very beginning. The crafting system is so unique and engaging. Uncovering new effects and ingredients is very rewarding. It is mainly an open-ended problem solving game with countless ways to create any given potion. It is about understanding the core mechanics and to figure a way to create any given potion with as few steps as possible. Great!

However, even though I have reached the last chapter and only have a few more objectives left to finish the game, I have no interest to keep playing. There were certain points in the game where I felt I had to grind in order to progress; make more money, buy more ingredients and uncover more ingredients. There were no new mechanics for a while and no new problems to solve, just grinding. The game does pick up again a few times, but now there are those last few objectives which are only tedious instead of challenging. Making a crazy amount of potions I have already crafted or brewing new ones with effects that I already unlocked. The main issue is the recursive nature of the story required crafting where every higher tier ingredient requires the one from the previous tier compounding in just tedious repetition.

With all that said, I still highly recommend the game since the core mechanic is so good and it still gave me 15-20 hours of enjoyment even if I did not finish it.

Good mechanics, you'll mess up a few times trying to find the right ways of making potions and if you're anything like myself, they have to be perfect the first time.

 I will say no more about the gameplay because I'll be taking an experience away from you. Totally worth on a sale, can also play this one for free through Microsoft's ultimate game pass if you already own it.

I expected something akin to a cooking simulator game with a medieval twist, what I found was something straight out of Cthulhu's fish tank in terms of game mechanics and direction. I can't think of a game to compare it with. It's puzzle, exploration, efficiency, and resource management ground up in a mortar and pestle and tossed into a cauldron of chess-piece movement mechanics, fired up with risk reward. I've not even started with the unlocks and I hear this thing has a basement.

easy recommend, even without the haggle price.",1674693405,1674693405,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1210320,131554986,76561198013277120,0,8,1273,0,999,1683350132,"This is a great game, it should be used as an example of how to make games in many areas: Gameplay mechanics design, art direction, execution...

The game is about making potions. Potions can have different effects based on the ingredients and exact recipe (obviously). There are many ways to obtain the same effect with different ingredients. Effects can be higher quality if you are particularly precise with the steps. You can save recipes you like so that you don't have to do steps manually every time, but the game limits the number of slots you have (you buy more slots as you make money).

Of course, there is a variety of ingredients and not all of them are good for every type of potion. You can get ingredients from different sources, but not all sources are equal. For instance mushroom man only sells mushrooms (not always the same ones), and you have to wait for him to show up. This means you have to tailor your recipes to available ingredients, and you have to maintain a selection of ingredients to cover different types of potions customer might ask for. I think this is a pretty fun aspect of the game. Ingredient scarcity gives you some pressure to think about efficiency, but also it's usually pretty easy to find ingredients if you really need it, so it's not a source of much stress.

The coolest thing by far is *how* the potions are brewed. It's not just a checklist of add this much of this, that much of that... There's a map, and every potion effect is a location on it. Every ingredient moves you in a certain predefined way. So it's about figuring out which sequence of ingredients will get you close enough, and also is something you can repeat multiple times with the ingredients you have. But there are various tools in the game that can modify the path of an ingredient, and there's a huge number of ingredients as well as multiple alternate maps, so you really get to explore a huge space of possible ways to make potions. The map is not revealed at the beginning, so there's an exploration aspect as well.

I think this map idea is brilliant. In real world chemical research there's a lot of efforts to summarize the essential properties of millions of possible chemical compounds, and then use that to automatically discover new reactions. One of the solutions to this, which I find really neat, is to calculate the similarity of all compounds (using the full list of their many chemical characteristics) and use machine learning and/or some fancy statistics to map this to 2D or 3D space so that similar things end up close together. Human brains are very good at comprehending physical space, but not good at comprehending tables of numbers, so this is a great way of leveraging that innate ability to make it easy for you to navigate a non-spatial thing (chemistry). This game is basically a gamified version of this approach. They've gotten the details right so it feels smooth, and it's very immersive to imagine yourself as a medieval alchemist who doesn't really know these modern statistical approaches, but is arriving at them intuitively through trial and error.

It's worth saying that the interface of this game, graphics, music etc. are really beautiful. They're all very polished and animations work smoothly. The controls are pretty good with a gamepad - the only issue is that you can't give a custom name to your recipes without a keyboard. The game is basically ""find the recipe"" (aka combinatorics, if you like math), but with the 2D map abstraction I described. You find the recipe over and over. This would suck if the UI wasn't slick, and in this game it's really slick. It doesn't really get old.

I found that it's a fun game to play with someone as well, taking turns every hour or so. You can play at a slower pace and have a conversation as you play, whether about the game or something unrelated. Most of your brainpower goes to planning and thinking, not fiddling with controls, so the person watching can meaningfully participate. A lot of winning tactics are circumstantial and subjective, so it's not a case of you figure out the solution and there's nothing more to discuss. You can always go back to old recipes or strategies and re-examine them.

Incidentally, pacing is another great aspect of this game. In most things you do, you can choose whether you want to do it with high stakes and more intensity, or lower stakes and more laid back. For example the haggling minigame is about reaction time. If you don't have fast reactions, or maybe you do but don't feel like making the effort that day, you can just choose the smaller haggle margin and get a slower minigame. If you're trying to make some amount of money, it takes you a bit longer, but it's not like the game becomes so slow that it's boring. Or you can go hard with higher stakes and advance faster. This isn't done by going to the game settings and fiddling with a ""difficulty"" slider - it's all part of the game to keep adjusting what intensity you want for each bit.

I'd recommend using a good gamepad for this. Something you do a lot is ""grind"" and ""stir"". Both are done by actually moving your cursor in a circle. I started with a cheap knock off Xbox controller (and also a knock off PS4 controller), and circling with the stick was not very pleasant (still playable). This was one of two games (other one was Sekiro) that convinced to fork over $60 for a real PS4 controller. It was a huge improvement because the coating and spring on the real PS4 analog stick is much higher quality and feels much more ergonomic. I never played with the mouse much - it seems playable, but I get shoulder pain from too much mousing so for me a gamepad is mandatory.

I feel like the game is pretty much perfect for what it is - a puzzle game with an original mechanic that is explored pretty in depth. Because the interface, graphics, audio, controls and other ""minor"" technical aspects are well done, the game feels very smooth and brewing potions for hours is relaxing rather than tedious. It's one of those games that you don't really care about completing, you just want to keep going back to the meditative experience. There is however a generous amount of progression when you want it - the game doesn't force you to progress if you feel like just staying at one level for a while.

I just wish they added voiceovers :)",1674688842,1674688842,True,2,0,0.53063887357711792,0,True,False,False

I spent 6 months designing and drawing up plans for my perfect potion crafting, alchemical game. I came up with some crazy RNG systems to make a potion game that truly felt like anything could happen. It goes without saying that that project was a complete and utter failure because I was over ambitious and had no idea what I'd gotten myself into. The point is, I was proud of the design, even though the game was a flop. And look, I was only 17, but I can tell you with absolute confidence that not in my wildest, most creative mushroom trip, not on the highest quality Intelligence Potion, would I ever, *EVER* have been capable of coming up with the sheer genius that is this game. The system is so remarkable, so unique, that it really beggars belief. The only way you can understand how clever this game is from an alchemical perspective, is to play it.

So go. Play it. It is an absolute steal at its full price. Buy it now, buy it under sale, I don't care, but at *least* give yourself a couple of hours to understand how deep this truly goes. At the very least, get a different Base for your potions, before giving up on it.

That's what I'd like to tell for everyone. It's a good game. The next paragraphs is what I feel lacking of, which is quite long although I know this game is still growing.

For story and/or progression wise it seems to be incomplete. I noticed this 2/3 of the overall alchemist path (or around 40 days in) where the unique interaction stops coming and the loop of the customer is very predicted, just randomized including the merchant. Reaching philosopher stone (and its salt) doesn't feel rewarded amidst the tedious process. At the moment, I'm just playing the exact same loop until reputation 15, which seems to be going to be much longer than I anticipated because I'm in reputation 12 and each increment is 4 without haggling the customers (3 with haggling). Getting extra conditions for extra reputation sometimes doesn't feel worth it because only adds one per conditions, unless it's mandatory.
The teleporters in the map (spiral things which will carry the potion into somewhere else) are mostly useless, especially in outer-larger-area. I assume it's to screw people over, but for someone that can really wait and/or planned the route way beforehand, I feel like it's really just no reason to have it there. It'd be a great feature if they really helped to relocate the potion without using the rocks ingredients (which also do teleports amidst the rarity).",1674313110,1674313110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, however, you will experience all there is to experience by the midway point.

Any continued interest will depend on whether your completionist side gets the better of you.

Because the first 90 percent of the game is good enough that I can overlook the last 10 percent -- for now. Potion Craft is a fun, chill game where you make and sell potions, become a pillar of the community, and use the proceeds to fund your secret alchemical research. It's good for relaxing while also making you think via problem-solving to get around ingredient shortages and find the most efficient recipes.

I have three main complaints. The music is the same short bit on loop for hours on end. Fortunately, a recent dev diary made it sound like more music is on the way. There's also a lot of RNG in what grows in the player's garden and what merchants sell. Some of this is understandable as it makes players be creative, but I went through long stretches when I was bereft of even the most basic ingredients and the garden's yields were paltry. Again, it sounds like this might be addressed in a future update.

My biggest complaint is the late-game grind. There's way too much for too little reward. There are 10 chapters, and you have to reach Level 12 popularity (500 stars) to finish Chapter 9 and Level 15 (1,250 stars) to finish Chapter 10. I completed everything but the popularity requirement for Chapter 10 by Day 59 in game, hit Level 13 popularity (750 stars) on Day 77, Level 14 (1,000) on Day 102, and Level 15 on Day 143. Hours of grinding for no real purpose when I was already awash in cash and ingredients, all to tick one final box. I had to talk myself into coming back to finish Chapter 10. My hope is that the devs put the popularity requirements in as a placeholder and will scale them back when there's more late-game content to add. If not, I fear many players will come to the conclusion the juice is no longer worth the squeeze once they hit the late game.",1674064356,1674064356,True,11,0,0.639557301998138428,0,True,False,False

Besides, my customers won’t tell me what they actually want, so I should speculate the answer from their vague words. This novelty way of playing is really captivating for me, thereby attracting me to explore the map and find the cheapest way for advanced potion and salt material. However, after lighting up every corner on the map and gaining the moon salt and sun salt, I had to finish a diversity of potions which are really really really complex to create superior salt to achieve the ending, but they only provide a little help with my business (thought these superior salts are truly powerful, they are too troublesome to created again).

Potion Craft is a wonderful game where you play as an alchemist on a quest to become successful! There is more than just that, but you find that out quickly! The game is simple to play, mixing ingredients into your cauldron to make new potion effects or perfect recipes you have made. Then you provide these potions to townsfolk who come into your shop to request various concoctions. 

Personally, I think the minds behind this are brilliant with how they put everything together. I have been playing Potion Craft since it first entered early access, and while I took a break from it having completed it before their most recent overhaul, it has become even better now. From what I see on the horizon, it will only get better from here!

Say Hello to the Mushroom Man for me!

Wonderful for those who likes clear progression, and like organizing things. Really enjoyed the customization options for your journal of saved recipes.

Cons:
Some of the customer's requests are unreasonable and/or annoying. For example, they want an Inspiration potion that is simple (one ingredient) but that has multiple suitable additional effects.

Things that could Improve this Game:
- There is a button to save the recipe of an object (salt/stone) but I could never get it to work. Makes creating objects rather tedious even if you have every custom recipe saved.
- As you have a view of the town from your garden having it dynamically change due to the customer's you serve would make the game more immersive. For example. you give a customer an explosion potion to take out a competitor's warehouse and the next day you see a house on fire. Then the owner of the exploded warehouse may come in and request a Glue or Fire-Protection Potion as they rebuild. 
- Maybe have bounty posters posted on the back of the shop (updated or added by Merchant or Knight characters) and see the bounty raise or lower depending if you sold potions to the criminal or the knights. This way you can have mini stories/ particular customers that you are invested in following until the criminal either pulls off the greatest heist or they are eventually apprehended by the Knights.",1673813428,1673813428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought it yesterday and I got bored in 3 hours or so.
Why?
- I ended up searching online after failing to understand the customer's instructions non-stop. I admit I was playing in Spanish, and it might be about translating, but still they were pretty misleading.
- Because of the waste of ingredients, it was hard to explore around the map. I never had enough material left
- Even after looking up online how to advance and be more efficient (something I wanted to avoid) and somehow ending up reaching Nigredo, when I saw the next steps for Albedo I knew I would not complete the game in a thousand years. A real turn off instead of the feeling of a challenge.
Basically, the lack of materials to go around freely and a ridiculous demand of materials to progress (3 effects in 1 bottle to even close the chapter) makes me choose between exploring or selling stuff and get money for extra ingredients. It felt very unfair. I bought it out of curiousity, basically all the system of making the potion, but I wish I could choose the difficulty or at least to have like a separate mode. I like the idea of the shop but at some point I was too stressed to even think who was a good person or not. To make a 3 tier potion just for them to say nah my words have hidden meaning so hurry up and use the rest of plants to try again... simply no.",1673786121,1673786279,False,2,1,0.523809492588043213,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1. Pretty medieval art
2. Soothing music (although there's only 1 theme so I kind of tuned it out after a while) 
3. Potion customization (the bottle shapes and symbols are very cute) 
4. No time limit, so not stressful 
5. You can be as shady as you want and help people melt/explode stolen treasure chests (although with what they pay you, you're getting conned).

Cons:
1. No storyline-- this is what made me stop playing since there's no true end goal in sight. Just a lot of achievements in a book. Which may be a pro for some, but I found myself thinking why I continued playing after the first 5 hours. 

2. Not much instruction-- for some reason, I thought the ingredient description/rarity was what had an effect on the potion level (not the end position of your potion cursor). I only found out after watching some LPs on it. So I wasted a lot of rare stuff early game because I thought rarer ingredients made better potions lol! 

3. Repetitive - Discover new potion, make, sell, spend all the money earned on expensive plant and mushrooms. Waste resources trying to explore the map, miss the perfect position by half a mouse-click, accidentally graze some bones and burn your potion entirely, silently swear and restart. I'm only 7 hours or so into it, but that was a big chunk of my experience XD

Overall: Enjoyed it at first, but instead of being excited to progress the achievements I just found them tedious and stopped. I think it's good as is just for a casual few hours of enjoyment, but it would be more fun if there were more variation of other things-- like more gathering, gardening, visiting other shops/places, maybe some kind of quest line to keep being invested.

It's an alright game, but a bit simplistic. The artstyle is nice but not really worth writing home about, and there's not really much in the way of characterization I've seen thus far. The only actual characters are merchants who don't even have names, and while nice, there's not much to say on them. As for the customers, there's no real conversation there, just a description of what they want.

The haggling system is pretty simple as well, nothing bad about that but it's just not really got anything to it.

The big sell on it is the potion crafting system, which requires you to use different ingredients to traverse a sort of chemical map to find the effects you want. This is actually a pretty fun system, but it's a bit hindered by a lack of explanation. The potency of effects is determined by how you can align your bottle symbol on the map with the effect symbol's bottle. Issue is, there is no explanation I've seen in game thus far for the bottles that are rotated and that prevents you from getting the best of an effect.

Overall, while the Potion system is not perfect, it's the main focus and, of course, saving grace of the game, but it seems like it would be a better fit as an element of a larger game. That said, overall, it's still a decent time filler sort of indie game.

this is very fun in the early game -- its a unique crafting mechanic, and a well thought out one. it *is* good for what it is. but if you keep playing, the novelty will wear off at some point. and then you're left with... what?

the goals are repetitive, theres no story (the ""chapters"" are just collections of tasks to do for the achievement, and once youve unlocked everything theres no purpose to doing it.). the balancing leaves something to be desired; once youre at the higher popularity levels, refusing a single customer -- even if their request is *impossible*, which they sometimes are -- will lose you double what youd get from helping them. past halfway, the game is just grinding. but its grinding that doesnt *lead* anywhere.

there are a few features that seem outright missing. the only way to discard potions, for example, is to melt them down in your alchemy machine to make a new undestroyable item. reportedly theyll be adding in garden upgrades -- which is great, but i feel like that shouldve been in the initial release. the garden right now is essentially useless once you can afford merchants.

I've had enough gold in my playthrough since the end of the first month to clear out the inventory of every merchant that comes by -- even the marked-up items -- and yet, despite also having some pretty optimal recipes for each strong-quality effect, using the most efficient ingredients and using an oil base when necessary, I am often bottlenecked by the scarcity of ingredients, so I can't progress the chapter and have to just wait and hope I get lucky enough for the right merchant to drop by next run. I can see how that variability of ingredients could be fun and push you to approach potions creatively, but serving the same requests a dozen times before you can log off the game is such a drag, you just get pissed off when a patron gives you some oddball request, even with substantial gold yield; and when they don't give you that much gold, it feels like the game is insulting you. This game makes me audibly groan, but I've sunk so much time into it, I feel like I have to see it through. 

And I'm doubly insulted when I sail around the whole water map over and over again to make an ingredient in the alchemical machine, only to see that the ""save recipe"" button isn't an option. And I ask to myself, ""Should I make more than one of this ingredient? No, they would give me that option if I need more than one for the playthrough, right? And I only have so much of each ingredient,"" only to unlock the next recipe and see that I need to make that previous ingredient again, right after I deleted the recipes for the previous one to make space.

The gameplay loop is fun but far too shallow for how much it overstays its welcome. This game does not respect your time.

Seven hours later into the game. I figured out I can make multiple recipes for a single effect. I've decided to brute force the special ingredients by buying a whole bunch of magic paper, more than can even fit on the recipe book screen. I just made five albedo and all the necessary recipes for the philosopher's stone...and the game just crashed on me. Just rebooted the game, and all my recipes are gone.

A calming game to relax to, fun to explore and ruined if you look up too much.

Make potions, sell them to buy more ingredients, make more potions.  The 'exploration' aspect is done very well, the mechanics are simple but still make it feel like you're actually a bit of an alchemist.

Whoever made the physics for grinding down the gems needs a raise.

The only real cons to the game:
'Skill tree' is very bare-bones.  I think they have plans to address that in some post-1.0 updates, but as it is in 1.0 I dare say it almost may as well not be there.
The final couple achievements are maybe just a little too drawn out (Mainly [spoiler] getting to level 15 reputation. [/spoiler] It just got repetitive and more a test of how many recipes you have saved to get through it quickly.
The Haggling system when buying items is a bit TOO generous.  Money becomes meaningless about halfway through the game (But feels decently balanced in the beginning)
Music: There's just one music track.  Kick the volume down and put something else on in the background.

There is a very unique exploration and karma system in this game, the art style is heart warming and beautiful and there are a couple of funny hidden jokes in there! It runs very well and so far is bug free! 

As of current (Jan 7, 2023) ver 1.0.5, I have 44 hours in the game and I have finished all the chapters and everything that the game has to offer... for now. There are a couple things that I think would make the game better and I also have some feedback. 

PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF SPOILERS if you haven't finished the game fully! 

Let's start with suggestions first:
- I'd love to be able to share my recipes with my friends!
- When hovering over an ingredient, it tells you how many recipes use that ingredient (Maybe if you click on the number, it shows you which recipes exactly).

Feedback:
*This is going to include some end game content so please be aware of SPOILERS.
The only part of the game that I did not enjoy was the salt recipes! To me personally, the end result was not worth the effort and time! Here are some details:

- The Void Salt: Being able to remove my path is cool and all but honestly, I have never used this salt and if I did I never saved the recipe! As you get better at the game, you don't really need it!

- The Moon and Sun Salts: I think having a salt that rotates potions if a very neat feature but having 2 types is not really efficient! Why would I spend so much time and resources to make the sun salt when I can make a lot of the moon salt easily. I've never used the sun salt! Never needed it because the moon salt is MUCH cheaper and easier to make!  

- The Life Salt: Honestly, to me personally, half the fun of the game is the risk of dying to bones! If I have this salt then I am basically invincible! And that's unfortunately kind of boring!  

- The Philosophers Salt: This is my biggest complain and the one that actually disappointed me the most! This salt is so tedious to make and the effect you get from it is really not worth it! Why would I use a very expensive salt to correct my mistake when I can just add one or two cheap materials that I have 200 of to do the same thing?

I wrote down a couple ideas that I personally thought would be cool to have instead of these effects: For instance:
- A Salt that lets you remove a potion effect so if you make a mistake while brewing a potion with multiple effects, you have a second chance instead of starting all over again!
- A Salt that either increase or decreases the intensity of the potion! Or one that can ""unbrew"" a potion so I can change the intensity of it! A lot of the times, if a customer was asking for a weak potion that is hard to get to like Luck, inspiration or perfume and I already saved the strongest recipe, I'd just turn them down and get to the other ones because it probably won't be worth the time and effort.

Overall, I do really enjoy Potion Craft and I think it's very unique and has a lot of potential!

Thank you for bringing us joy! :D

So when I saw this game on steam, I expected it to be an amusing diversion that would hold my interest for a couple of hours and nothing more. I opened the game and started brewing at 11:00 am on a Saturday. Nothing to do today, so might as well kill a bit of time.

I especially enjoyed coming up with names for my concoctions. A man came into my store asking for some sort of poison that he could use on some rich people who liked to visit a sauna. After a bit of experimentation, I managed to make a strong potion of poisoning. Since this was a group of people, I naturally chose a bottle that looked like an old timey perfume bottle with the little rubber bulb for spraying. I named this concoction ""Axe Body Spray"" and gave the following description:

Uses: Permanent incapacitation on a room-wide basis
Directions: Stand in the center of a crowd and spray on your person. For best results, apply liberally in a poorly ventilated location such as a locker room or on a bus.

Thoroughly pleased and chuckling to myself, I passed a few more in-game days, filling my recipe book with similarly humorous entries. After a few hours of this I decided it was time for a break. Huh. That's weird. It's still 11:00. Why is it dark outside? WHY AM I SO HUNGRY?

You have the phase where the games actually really enjoyable, things are happening fast such as popularity level ups, skill points to buy, unknown potion to explore and a slight learning curve to understanding the customer (they can be illogical, but its kinda fun and adds challenge to think like a toaster). But soon you'll find yourself repeating tasks too similar to each other to be enjoyable with every dialogue memorized and every potion saved it's like an aim trainer on the path to getting popularity level 15. Don't get me wrong, i think the games quite fun for a good while- just make sure its your type of game.

Currently, youre super dependant on the merchants and their changing stock. Im noticing that they tend to carry the same ingredients, while others (especially early game ones) not quite so much in the later chapters. Id love a way to request Ingredients from merchants, for the next time they came around. Or a way to plant/ farm some myself. Maybe a  way to upgrade the garden in late game? 

The pages of the alchemy book become really busy with recipes. Even when organising them. Id love a way to 'flip the page' and have a second tab of recipes. This would be super helpful when crafting towards the philosophers stone, and more complex salt recipes, so it doesnt become as tedious.

Lastly, some of the villagers are really vague in what they want, and/or i feel like there should be more options correct for what they want. For example, some of the villagers having stuck doors are happy with slipperiness, but most only accept an explosion.

I wish I could tell you that this game has an interesting story- it doesn't
I wish I could tell you the NPCs had engaging dialogue, or that your decisions to create certain potions for them, or deny shady customers actually matters - None of that exists

But, what Potion Craft has is one of the most engaging puzzlers I've seen to date. A SANDBOX puzzle game where the player is allowed to dictate how much automation goes into their shop through the form of recipes. Creating better potions, better recipes, and ultimately filling what one would consider to be the ""Perfect Potion Recipe Book"" quickly become your end-goals as you carve your knowledge into this world as an Esteemed Alchemist.

Over time you eventually prove yourself by creating 'complex' potions that are used in the creation of ""Substances."" These substances are then repurposed into Dusts, which can then be added as ingredients to your potions- effectively unlocking a much deeper and complex game than the player is originally introduced to. Through the form of these dusts, new ingredients, and new goals to create new Substances the player is quickly wrapped up in what you could call ""The Pursuit of Knowledge""

I felt incredibly refreshed delving deeper and deeper into the puzzle mechanics that comprise Potion Craft, and I can't wait to finish my last few Recipes up and finish creating 'The Philosopher's Stone'

My main gripe is that some of the customers tend to all ask for a lot of the same potions, taking up all of your stock for certain directions on the map, which prevents you from exploring and experimenting for days sometimes. Many times I have so little resources that if I were to try to complete the goals, I'd have nothing left to serve the customers, which would cause them to give me negative stars.

Another issue is that some of the requests are very unclear. The game does not give you near enough context clues. One customer wanted something to help him relax, but didn't want sleep potion nor slow potion (which another customer wanted to relax). Another customer's door was stuck, so logically you would think he would want a strength potion ... no, he wanted an explosion potion ... for his own door. And a third customer just said ""give me poison"", but doesn't say why, and it gave me a huge negative rep punishment because they were apparently going to use it for evil purposes, but how was I supposed to know that.

It's very chill and there's something I find very satisfying about the process of running my little potion shop. I will say that progression in this game is limited by the random arrival of certain merchants to your shop, from whom you need to buy key items, and if you don't have the funds together when they first arrive, you simply have to run the shop day-to-day until they return. This means you really have to take it at a relaxed pace - this maybe isn't one for the kind of player who likes to rush progression and complete everything as quickly as possible.
Progression also requires you to make increasingly complex potions, and this requires exploration of the potion-making maps, but if you use all your resources to explore you won't be able to fulfil customer requests, so you must balance your personal research with the running of the shop.

This game is very satisfying and relaxing to play. It has lovely artwork, succinct mechanics, funny ingredient descriptions, (also very unique ingredients), and some lovely characters to get to know. If you liked strange horticulture, this game is rather similar! However, it focuses on the potion making more than the exploration that Strange Horticulture does. There's also some hilarious dialogue you can encounter on your potion-making journey to mastery. I'm still laughing my butt off that there's lore of a brothel owner named Ma'dam Twerks! And the potion her bartender came in asking for was even funnier! This little indie alchemy game is definitely worth every penny invested in it too. While as of right now, you can finish the game off fairly easily, the developers are talking seriously about adding more features in the future, and honestly, I couldn't be more excited for it. Here's a small list:

More potion types!
More potion bases for added later-game challenges!
Monster parts as alchemical reagents!
GARDENING!!
New plant-based and crystal ingredients with new effects!
New NPCs!
New Quests! 

and so, so, SO much more. They're really committed to their game and it shows! 
Plus this is even Markiplier approved! (He made a video of it while playing it!)

I expected way more control over what happens in your shop because I mean, the description literally says, ""You're in full control of the whole shop."" Which is a lie.

Let me tell you why:

You have zero control over which herbs you collect because you aren't growing your own, you are simply harvesting whatever you find in your garden and buy from whatever vendor happens to stop by. You can't mix and match different herbs to create your own which the description also states. You can only create what the game allows you to, which isn't experimenting at all. 

You can choose from different potion abilities to create your own. Example: ""poison/acid."" However, that isn't really experimenting, it's more just combining a few things that your customers aren't even asking for. 

The lack of experimental potions is disappointing because that's one of the reasons I bought the game. 

To wrap up the review, I feel like the game was only fun because it's basically alchemist themed ""Dealer's Life"" which I played before on my phone. 

So, is it fun? Yeah, you'll get a few hours of game play but it gets annoying and you'll soon realize there's a lot about the game that needs revamped. 

Is it worth the price? No. I got it on a sale and paid $11 for it, and I still feel a bit gypped.

Absolutely love the game, but it just doesn't feel quite complete yet - you should probably wait on your purchase.



Likes:
crafting system - simple yet so dynamic and complex. this is the core gameplay, so its fantastic at how polished it is.
recipe system - removes a lot of repetitive work to allow you to focus on optimisation and exploration. though could use a bit more: in-page recipe editing/customisation, continuing a recipe from a particular step, etc.
overall aesthetic and NPCs

Dislikes:
- the garden is a glorified daily free merchant
- potion effect compatibility is a black box; and once youve botched a potion you've botched it for good.
- haggling is a boring QTE that gets repetitive very fast
- pricing is a mystery: you can't valuate a potion by ingredient cost without manually calculating it, and you can't know the selling price until after you've made it
- legendary crafting gets sluggish for higher tier crystals because there's extremely limited recipe automation
- the not-yet-implemented base creates a crater of progression around the point of chapter 8. NPCs asking for potions you can't justifiably craft in water, and just can't in oil
- the music feels like a looping 30 second track :')

- you can't buy/grow components you want. all merchants sell random components and it is very often when you saved a recipe of a potion and you can't use it because you haven't right component. and you have to build all potion path again. it is cool at first time, but for the fifteenth time it's irritating.
- there is a quest merchant that sells quest items and once he emerges you'd better have enough money to buy a quest item, otherwise you'll have to wait another week and simply doing nothing. sell potion for money without any mean. just grinding. The problem is that  you can't find out the price of item in advance.
- reputation. it is simply broken. what is this thing actually do? no one knows. and why i becoming evil when i refuse to sell a potion? i want sell it, but i can't because merchant's didn't sell me right components.
- the game punishes you for exploration and being curious. if you want to find a new effect, you'll have to travel a lot and that will cost a lot of time/money/components and then a customer emerge and he wants a potion, and you can't fulfill his desire cause you spent your components on exploration and you send excuse and you send him with nothing and then your popularity decreases and because of that merchant will have less variety in shops and it breaks the fun completely
- haggling. you always in lack of money and you have to playing this mini-game over and over again
- lack of realism. it is a common situation when you have a customer that looks like hobo and request for clue to repair his shovel and pays me so much so i can buy a couple extremely rare minerals that gnomes digs in dangerous and deep caves
- lack of mechanics. you will know all the instruments in the first hour and that's all. all those instruments will stick with you till the end. same cauldron, pestle and ladle. Nothing will change.
- lack of quality of life features. some of customers demand on some concrete ingredient and name it like ""i want to plant X to be in my potion"". and there i no search in your tool. so you  have to list all your components, each of them to find the right one. Or if merchants emerge and you you don't know what to buy from him cause you have to search for each component in your stash. it will be much more easier for example to show how many of it's goods i have in my backpack when i am hovering a mouse on item.

overall the game is still raw, don't buy it. 
p.s. look at the steam achievements. only 0.5% of all players have a ""magnum opus"" achievement. so it literally means that only 0.5% reach the end of the game.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1672501866,1672501866,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This game is truly very unique, a feel of hand drawn art that has a nice pleasing aesthetic along with the relaxing back ground music allows long period of gaming without burnout feeling that not many games have.

There's no sense of being forced to do any thing. Customers come and asks for potions, if you can't be bothered with a certain request, most often there are alternatives or no big lost even if you just refuse to serve, that said, usually hard requests really pays off, especially ones that request to use only 1 ingredient.

Attainable 100% achievement that only requires 1 continuous game session, no need to play multiple different game sessions to get 100% and no need to worry you will miss certain achievements.

Recipe system is also very unique and beautiful to look at, gives an immersive alchemist (witch/wizard/warlock) feel

Cons: limited adventure feeling, limited to your own shop that has only a few rooms, sleeping area (only 1 function that is to sleep), potion crafting area ( most of your time will be spent here creatively crafting and perfecting different potions), garden (produces some basic ingredients per day), shop area (serve customers and merchants) basement (advance alchemy serves as an game progressive objective)
There are many things I can wish for this game, but to be honest, the game in it's own is good enough, definitely worth the price tag, I'm looking forward and hoping if the developer is able to add more content in the future (seeing the upcoming features it's a good sign), even as paid DLCs, I'll be happy.

Post Release Review:

I have come back to this game after many months of development, and to nobody's surprise it's still great. Better than ever in fact. I truly love all of the work the developers have put into this game and it seems that they wont be stopping anytime soon. 

I understand that this game is not for everybody and it can get repetitive and boring, but for me it is really enjoyable. I think of it as if I was baking something in real life - following a recipe of concrete instructions or experimenting, seeing what works. Just with less physical, sweet treats for me to eat in the end..

What I'm saying is, I played it all the way through when it was in early access, I replayed the whole thing when they added achievements, and i will continue to play it if they add more.
Great game.",1638279664,1672425946,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I had quite a lot of hope for a new cozy game from this title, so i picked it up on sale.

The artwork and premise of this game are great, really charming and I really wanted to enjoy playing it. However, i just didn't. I found the gameplay really repetitive and not very engaging, the tutorial sections missed out some key points about potion brewing and I quickly found myself having to google aspects of customer requests as a couple of them just don't make sense to me (or should really have multiple solutions) as well as having to google the ""map"" because it was way too easy to just waste all your ingredients just to end up in the completely wrong place, meaning you then couldn't fulfil orders and thus not make money to buy more ingredients...

it'd be nice if you could actually spend time gathering ingredients rather then a 5 second click this screen to get 10 random herbs process, it made it near impossible to consistently fulfil orders due to being short of a couple of key items that it's pure RNG if you get (and there aren't too many substitute items either)

I suppose I expected more of reading what a herb is an it's traits, using that with complimentary herbs rather than the description really meaning very little other then (it goes X direction) and once again because of the scarcity of some herbs you'd have to use different recipes each time which requires a lot of manual time wasting in the brewing process. Which on that note is not very accessible, I have no issues with mobility or my wrists but after having to manually brew 2-3 larger potions in a row I had developed an ache, I figure this could be circumvented in the settings but there is no such option (even a click and hold to auto-do the animation would improve this!)

overall this game has a ton of potential to be a really cute, relaxing cozy game but right now I just find it monotonous in the worst way and sadly boring. I think improving the brewing process (such as letting us see the full map so at least we can try and guess our way around rather than being blind) adding depth to the recurring characters (they give you tiny personal tidbits but it's barely present) and making some kind of more interactive way of gathering herbs would make this into a fantastic little game, as it already has so much going for it.

Right now I honestly wouldn't recommend it as it feels like an early access game, though i would love to see where it goes in the future if the developers choose to keep adding to this title",1672413127,1672413127,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll say it right here: This is the exact template that all CRAFTING systems in MMORPGs should be. Instead of grinding out useless items forever, this game shows that you can build a crafting system via NPCs that buy your stuff, until your skill level is high enough to reach the attention of PCs. It's really well developed, and worth the price to play!

This game design should also be put into place for almost any class in MMO:
wizard...a map that leads you to new/more powerful spells
fighter: a map that leads you to new movement combos/attacks
etc.
Instead of ""you leveled up so now you get x ability, you should level up by *FINDING* the ability via a system like this game.",1672410989,1672410989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, there is still something that is missing here for me. I've started the game three times now, and each time, I have become a little bored with the constant grinding and mixing, serving customers and picking or buying new plant stock. You have to do a lot of that in order to progress through the 'chapters' ie. a set of tasks you have to complete to move on to the next stage, some of which are difficult to manage because you run out of herbs really quickly, and buying them in is far too expensive, therefore, your profits become slimmer and slimmer, particularly when you have to give potions away to the 'collectors' so they can level up the stock they can offer you...and then, to afford replacing the very pricey Alchemy machine and its various parts. Yes, it all has a point: so you can level up your knowledge, and the range of potions you can offer, but I feel, at the expense of just 'grinding' through the process until you get bored with doing the same things over and over again. 
There is no story line, or ability to be able to control (very much) how many herbs you'll have in stock at any time...I keep having to 'go to bed' so I can get more herbs from the garden...I feel like I am fighting a losing battle for no end game achievement. Will the King ever have need of my services to produce six strength/stone skin potions that will help his knights defeat a dragon or am I just sitting here and serving a bunch of nitwits who need my potions for silly things, like blowing their front doors open because they've lost their house keys? It hardly feels epic, and I'm thinking that's the hole in the entire thing. 

While I do realise the game is 'unfinished' and that the Devs are planning more content for the coming year (including being able to grow your own plants - this will help a great deal, and I am looking forward to that), it needs a lot more work on the end game achievement factor and some challenge quests, or it just becomes a grindy snooze, fairly quickly.

I understand that Potion Craft is marketed as an outlet, rather than a source of actualization, and so I may have been ""playing it wrong,"" or for the wrong reasons, but it simply did not offer what I look for in a game.

Where I get caught up is that the midgame feels pretty rough in terms of balance. One of the biggest issues (which may be fixed with the upcoming garden update!) is that the garden you get all your resources from doesn't scale its output with your need. You can buy more resources from merchants, but whether they'll have what you need is rng; plus, the merchants are always bringing new items for you to buy, so it seems the focus should be on that rather than spending all your money on restocking. These issues stifle the exploration mechanic and generally slows down the midgame way too much.

There are tons of reviews rightfully praising this game, so let me focus on what I didn't like:

I recommend this game up until about chapter 8, which is when the game becomes grindy busywork. A shame really, the endgame is just annoying and repetitive, because you'll have met every customer by then and they keep coming to you with the same petty problems over and over. I get that its hard fill the game with 100s and 100s of customers, but it would really profit from more different and varied mix-potions that people require and incentive to deliver exactly what they need, rather than just giving them a half-assed potion and hoping for a better customer next in line who needs what you have already pre-made or what you have a recipe on hand for. There really is no reason to spend 10 minutes making the exact potion that this guy needs if I can just give him the ol' HP-pot or even just kick him out. Also making the stones and salts doesn't really feel worth it, but rather cumbersome and annoying.

But up until chapter 8 I highly recommend this game! It is very unique and you will never find a better alchemist simulator on Steam. Well worth the money!",1672332877,1672332877,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Main issues of the game:

* The lack of garden customization in the late game, which leads to rng.
* Salts simply should't be limited for the effort they take, or they should be easier to make again (less ingredients, like requiring no crystals the second time).
* There should be more space for recipes in the book (it will become cluttered). Empty pages could be removed from the book and instead replaced with a button that allows the player to add a new page.
* The popularity requirements become ridiculous later and seem to be mainly for artificially lenghtening the game.
*  Selling should become more automated with time, especially regarding the easy potions. For example, adding a shelf where customers can automatically pick up and pay for their requested potion, should it match.

It gets difficult when merchants don't sell the one ingredient you need, four times in a row, so you have to make substitutions that actually work better than the ingredient I wanted anyway, so you end up buying all you can of that and have to redo all the recipes that you now realize are very costly of the previously used ingredient. 

A few suggestions from my opinion: 

* Instead of waiting for merchants to come to you, they should be available all the time (with more expensive/less wares as to not remove the challenge) 

* People need more reasons, preferably with varying words and personalities if possible, to purchase potions so they seem more human-like rather than not.  

* A quest system would be nice. I know there is the ""Alchemists path"" but what I'm thinking is one that goes through customers for larger requests. Like 10 potions of healing. Then you could get time to make whatever is requested which increases/decreases depending on difficulty and materials cost of what was requested.

* Larger requests. This would not use the quest system (if it were to be implemented), but rather just be a few potions to get right away. This could require balancing, but it becomes a little bleak to know that one potion is all that's needed to do whatever they need to get done.

Overall the game is nice. Would like some different songs as it gets kind of repetitive to listen to the same track again and again even though it fits very well.

- progression is based on completing lists of objectives; each list is a ""chapter"". this is fine. what's not fine is that those objectives seem to always include ""spend a ton of gold on stuff from the alchemy vendor"", who seems to only appear at the start of random days. i felt like there were a lot of days that i was just filling orders for the sake of filling orders, waiting for the vendor to reappear.
- the game takes a lot of time to play. saving recipes will save you a lot of that time. but what if a customer asks for a potion whose recipe you don't have the ingredients for? making the potion manually might get you like 200 gold, but it's going to take a few minutes and you could just refuse them. it sucks losing a few rep, but the 600+ gold i'm about to get from someone who wants a poison potion definitely helps assuage that pain. 
- the fancy recipes in the basement are cool, until you realize just how many times you'll have to make them, even just to progress in the later chapters. hopefully you have enough magical paper to save the recipes for their ingredient potions, because the fancy recipes have a ""save recipe"" button that's not clickable. (coincidentally, this is one of the devs' ""features we'd like to add someday"")
- ""exploring"" to find new recipes is cool, i actually really like it. i don't like that accidentally moving too close to the bone areas will delete your attempt, alongside all the ingredients you already put in the cauldron. some of those might have been the last few you had, so good luck getting back there again.
- don't have the ingredients you need to make half your saved recipes? haha have fun not getting any in the free 20 herbs in your garden, then the vendor not even appearing that day, and then appearing the next day but not even selling that ingredient. time to go remake all those recipes without it. (i had multiple recipes that used spellbloom, and then a solid 5+ days where i did not have spellbloom and didn't have the option to buy it. that was fun)
- the garden is... not worthless, i guess, but bad. free ingredients are nice, but you have no control over what you get, no way to get more per day, no way to regrow within a day... nothing. (yeah that's also in the ""features we'd like to add someday"" list, lol)
- boy howdy i love exacerbating my RSI by wiggling the mortar and pestle, or wiggling the cauldron spoon, or wiggling the bellows. 3-4hrs of playing this game made my wrist hurt worse than Path of Exile ever has, and i have some 2-3k hours in that. which imo kind of says a lot.
- there's absolutely no indication i saw (i could be blind) that whirlpools aren't dangerous and can teleport you. usually they teleport you backwards for some reason, and occasionally warp you into the middle of a bunch of bones. so actually maybe they are dangerous. at least their destinations are static.
- gems can teleport you on the alchemy map. i'm pretty sure the game doesn't tell you this. they're rare and expensive, so i never thought to use them, until a gem was the only way i had to move in a certain direction. i spent quite a lot of time carefully navigating through bones before then.
- there's a menu that shows all your alchemy tools, like your spoon, your cauldron, your mortar, etc. the way it's laid out makes it look like there might be tools you don't have yet, and there might be upgrades to those tools. iirc it even says you can buy better tools from vendors. yeah, no, the menu is useless, vendors don't sell better tools that i saw. (oh hey, another item on the ""features we'd like to add someday"" list, kinda weird)


This is already hilariously long and I don't expect you to spend your time reading it. But I do highly recommend looking at the ""The List of Upcoming Features"" newspost from 12/16/22. Have you seen gameplay of this game on youtube/twitch? Maybe played it yourself during early access? Do the features in that list look like things that you thought would be in the game when it fully released? lol. lmao.

That ""Upcoming Features"" list has no ETAs or road map or anything indicating whether or not the features might ever happen, or if they'll happen any time soon. If there's a day where those features are in the game, I'll try the game again, and might like it a lot better. But until then, they did get me to spend $15 and 6.5 hours on an Early Access title, so idk, joke's on me I guess.",1672111197,1672111197,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thoughts: Nice game so far! I love all the plants, though wish you could expand your garden or use certain potions or something to influence specific ones to grow. Good to play for a few hours every few days, though can grow repetitive. Love the potion-making mechanic, and the way that you have to use specific combinations (or at least a bit specific), otherwise the potion may fail or be the wrong effect or just not strong enough, is pretty cool! I can't wait for more plants and customers and maybe even a bit of a story!

Yell and cuss as you fail your ten minute ultimate potion.

Actual review:
I love the alchemy system, it's very interactive and for all the screaming I do there are many times I manage to pull a failure back from the brink which is extremely satisfying.  

Dialogue isn't really repetitive yet, but it is very basic.  Would love to see (and would pay for) an expansion that adds more story/character interactions/insane potion combinations that take you forever to complete.

I think the only thing that really stands out as kind of bland is the ingredient farming, having it more interactive would be nice.  Adding ""fertilizer"" you can craft from potions to make it produce more plants of a certain element or type would be neat.  Every time I go to that screen I wish something would surprise me, but I'm far more excited by a merchant showing up with one new type of mushroom lol

Estimating that it'll take me 10-15 hours in all, unless there's more after the ""chapters"".  Either way, highly recommend this as a relaxing game that focuses more on making the alchemy aspect fun and interactive, but is light on character interactions and story.

Update:

Good: 
The Graphic: The graphic is most likely the first thing a potential customer notices, its pretty unique and reminds you of the medieval times. The artstyle is well made and consistant, the plants and potions look great and the background has a nice claming colour and have a more ""old"" kind of style. Just overall very pleasing for the eyes.

The brewing: Big surprise, in a brewing game, the brewing system is pretty good. But for real, its somewhat addicting but not the craziest thing you can imagine, here come things the devs can change... the brewing system in this game is by far the best one ive ever seen but It feels pretty much the same all the time, making at some point brewing just really... boring. Especially if you have enough ingredients. But as said, its still really fun. 

The music: It reminds me of skyrim or maybe something like WoW, where the music just puts you into the game. Like the brewing system, its not something ground breaking or crazy but it does its job pretty well and deserves to be mentioned.

The bad:
The trading system: Welp, time to attack the game for its lower parts. Starting of with the one, that makes me the most salty: The trading system. When you see how much the devs developed the brewing system, you would think that they would also put at least half the effort in the actual selling part of your potions... but nah. The trading system is boring as hell, to the point where I have more fun reading the despriction of the themes of the trading, than the actual trading. This is so dumb and it would be the best to actually make the trading somewhat more interesting or engaging. 

The leveling: Its not really balanced... or engaging. The skill tree is like the trading system more boring than anything else, but in the case of the skill tree, it feels like a made up one from fourth graders. I really do not care for the progress thanks to that in terms of the actual level. Another thing are the potions the people want from you, its nice to see them being pretty special or unqiue, but getting a bunch of bad ponts in reputation and popularity just because that idiot wants a posion you cant craft or havent even found yet, just feels like a punch in the face. I see why the devs did that, which is why I consider this exact problem to be more personal than objectiv. 
(Quick sidenote, after creating this comment, I looked up the roadmap for the game and found out, that they want to update the skill tree, so Im curios if I can change this comment later on :))

The creation of potions is fun and requires creative thought, but is also pleasing to do. The ingredients and map layout play nicely into the alchemical and elemental themes. The Long arching goals behind the alchemy machine give an interesting set of puzzles to solve, and the customer related quests are interesting if repeated often, but have different solutions that customers will pay different prices for. All in all, pretty fun and captured my interest for a non-stop 12 hours of game play. Literally one sitting.

Edit after completing the game's content:

This is a good game. But possibly the best part about it is the promise it holds for creative and complex content to be added in updates. The current game is a solid base, all the mechanics and systems are functional and enjoyable. Importantly the potion shop-customer interaction system is well designed. It doesn't contain the full range of reactions from customers regarding unique potions that might fix their specific problem in a more creative way. But that is some thing the developers promise in future updates, and would give the game an even greater depth. The garden management would also be great. I really  enjoyed the 25 hours I've put in, but this game is essentially a puzzle game and now that I have saved some really perfected recipes for every customer need, as well as creating the philosopher's stone, and finishing the alchemists path. I've completed all the available puzzles. I eagerly await the developer's adding more nuance customer needs, as that is essentially adding more puzzles to solve.

Edit after full release and 30+ additional hours:

Great game. Continues to get better as more content is added. The full released version contains substantially more puzzles, and more ingredients and uses for the salts made with the alchemy machine. The game is great, and yet even more is promised from the developers in the form of garden management and nuanced customer needs. In the recent release they added some detail to customer requests, but they still don't have extra rewards for potions more specific, for example if a customer asks for a ""potion to make them better in battle"" they pay the same for 3 strength potion as they do for a 3 strength 1 dex 1 swiftness potion. While saying in either case ""this potion is perfect"" when clearly the 3 strength potion is good, but not perfect, as the addition of dex and swiftness obviously would help in battle. The update they actually made is that sometimes the customers will demand the inclusion of specific ingredients or ask for multiple effects. Fine, but not the pinnacle of whats possible for this game. 

All in all, very great game. Worth buying.",1632691653,1671991725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The first and simpler issue is that the game really just isn't finished. The UI has placeholders for upgrades to your tools that don't exist, the prices of some potions are based on a potion base that isn't in the game yet, and one mechant talks about mechanics for the enchanted garden that it doesn't have. While these things are on the development roadmap, these blatant gaps aren't acceptable for a game that's left Early Access.

The second problem, and one that I'm not sure will be solved with time, is that the game just doesn't have enough going on to keep the player engaged for its duration. While the potion-making mechanic is pretty fleshed out, it's not SO deep that it can carry the entire game, and there's very little to running the shop outside of that. Besides potion-making the only other concerns are reacting to the random availability and prices of ingredients, and haggling (which is just a timing minigame). Though even if the economic side of the game had more depth, the game expects you to spend a LOT of time brewing unique potions to make legendary recipes, too much time for the amount of depth the mechanic has.

Once the devs have implemented the missing features, I would be able to recommend the game on the condition that the player is content to enjoy a fun, unique smaller game for a few hours. Those who are expecting a lot of depth or those who would be bothered by not being able to reach the end without a lot of grinding should look elsewhere.",1671950513,1671951179,False,12,0,0.646312117576599121,0,True,False,False

You can play mindlessly at a low level and not really try to get better or progress much and it's very fun, but if you take it a little more seriously the gameplay loop is fantastic. You can make all potions out of as many ingredients as it takes to get you there but as you make more progress you get new ingredients so you can optimize your recipes. Most things involving potion brewing are very satisfying and a lot of the customers will take more than 1 potion, meaning a wizard looking for recovery after battle will accept a health potion, but will pay much more for a mana potion.

First and foremost, the concept of the game is highly appealing to me and I love how 'tactile' it feels. Grinding ingredients feels different depending on its type, and I really enjoy having to physically interact with my equipment. It is definitely the highlight of the experience. Exploring for additional potion unlocks can also be a rewarding challenge.

On to my suggestions.

The garden needs a serious revamp. I see that you have something like it planned for a future update. Without knowing the specifics I'm not sure if this is a situation you have already addressed in this future update. Regardless, I recommend prioritizing this garden update and releasing it ASAP and not waiting for your other planned features to be finished for one 'big update', because the game suffers a lot of pacing problems as a direct result of ingredient scarcity.

My suggestions:

1. Increase both the number and yield of plants as the game progresses. You could do this via a natural progression (as the player finishes Alchemy Chapters) or as an additional perk for the experience tree.

2. Allow players to plant specific herbs that they need based on a list that they've already ""unlocked"" from the corresponding merchant potion quest.

I'll elaborate on why I believe the game's pacing needs tweaked. 

I lose way too much money to merchants because I need to buy so many ingredients to keep up with demand, map exploration, alchemy lab recipes, etc. I hardly ever have enough money to buy lab upgrades and expensive ingredients whenever the merchants show up. I believe the low garden yield is the source of these frustrations.

I believe negative reviews for this game are ultimately because it is extremely slow-paced to navigate the map and ingredients run out very fast. I feel like the game risks overstaying its welcome as a result. 

Additionally, I don't think there's any need to make recipe pages another thing you have to buy and unlock. Make the recipe book infinite by default. This will allow players to easily create multiple 'copies' of optimal recipes using different ingredient combinations and further speed up the game's punishing pace. 

I am running out of motivation to fully complete the game because it simply takes too long to do anything. I LOVE the concept and whenever I'm in the mood to strategize the optimal way to navigate the map towards my potion goals, I do enjoy the challenge and steady hand it requires. I feel like I should be progressing much faster than I am, though. It can get exhausting after a while to make potions, especially when I'm constantly running out of the optimal ingredients that I've made a recipe for. The ""fun factor"" runs out very fast as a result. It can be so much more fun if I felt like I was able to get somewhere beyond a snail's pace.

Also, some people don't like the haggle minigame. I don't mind it but I am good at these kinds of reflex games. I would, however, recommend an 'easy mode' for people who have difficulty with these kinds of minigames but still need to make a bigger profit. (Seriously, it's far too slow to make money in this game as it is!)

TLDR:

1. Make the garden progressively ABUNDANT
2. infinite recipe book pages. At least, give us FAR more than the default amount of pages at first.



It's possible that you guys WANT this game to take forever to 100% complete and you like the pacing as it is. That's fine. It's your game and your vision for it. I do, however, believe that my suggestions would be the popular opinion of the average gamer who doesn't have a lot of time to spend playing games and wants to feel excited and satisfied with this one.

The core concept and potion-making mechanic are pretty cool...for the first few game days at least. You have a good amount of ingredients and only a few customers, leaving you the ability to navigate the alchemy map. But if you use too many, and the garden/merchant RNG are not with you, you won't be able to make the potions the customers want - losing you money, reputation, and sometimes karma. There were multiple days where I never got enough ingredients to go in one direction, usually the one containing customer requests. This also makes you hesitate on expanding the alchemy map, as you might need those ingredients tomorrow. 

I think the garden should not be random, you should know what you're going to have. Later, add the option to add/change ingredients. Relying on travelling merchants for ingredients is ok, but I wish you were able to buy from an herbalist shop or something.

- The haggle mini game is not necessary. Its some kind of QTE that you cant really fail. So whats the point? Either make it high-risk-high-reward or just leave it
- Why do I loose 3 stars if I let a customer go but get only 1 star if I give them the potion they want? Isnt this a conflict with the reputation system?
- Managing your garden: The ingredients you get are random...in your backyard. I get why they made it random but its still stupid if you think about it: You literally cannot manage your own garden. It would add more depth to the game if you could just manage it manually
- The Alchemy Machine: Why did I waste 1600g on just one part of that thing? What does Nigredo do? Why do I need this? It seems pointless getting and building that if I have no idea how that benefits me
- The exploration of the potions: The best part of the game is the exploration part. You get a map and you can make potions with basically everything as long as you land on one of those potions on the map. Every Ingredient moves your position differently and I think thats awesome. But why are these ""traps"" or skulls in the way? Whats the point? Instead of just doing unpassable walls, you loose your potionprogress if you touch the skulls? Why? The skulls plus the ingredients, which are a) pricey b) random, discourage me from exploring.
- Already made potions should be readded to the pot. Either to start from that spot or they have their own path like the regular ingredients. I have at least 4 potions that I put a ton of ingredients in to explore the map but I cant really sell them as they would get bought for just a fraktion of the costs of the ingredients
- The map structure is just tricky. But besides those exp boosts and the potions, there isnt anything else. It feels like not worth it anymore 
- The levelsystem and those level ""upgrades"" are a joke and not a really good one either. Feel like the profitable level upgade is the only good one.
- Why cant I go to the merchant directly? Or maybe a few of them. Why do I have to wait for one to come to me?

I ""only"" played this game for 4 hrs and I feel like I have seen everyhting. Obviously, this is not the case but for me there is no real motivation to; either decide to struggle my way through the stupid potion map; or decide to save up buying another part of that machine which I dont even know what it does.

While you are still running a shop at the end of the day, profits are easy to come by as you have no operating costs beyond the ingredients, which you get free batches of every day. So you build up a list of recipes and dole out potions to everyone knocking on your door. Then someone asks for something new it's time to get to experimenting. 

The potion making is pretty unique - alchemy effects are spread out on a map, and every ingredient follows a certain path. You have a variety of tools and methods to make slight alterations as you add one ingredient after another, charting a course into the unknown and finally settling on a potion effect you can add to your mixture. Taking a direct route and landing right on the effect gives you the highest selling potion for the fewest ingredients, netting you big profits, so it pays to keep manually making the potion until you've mastered it. Then it goes in the recipe book where, provided the ingredients are available, you can recreate  the potion with a single click. With some savvy trading for more ingredients with merchants you can have a stockpile of everything you need to cover all your clients' needs. 

But all that money has to go somewhere, right? And that's where the game introduces a sort of back-room tinkering aspect. When the shop shuts for the day and there's no more clients, you might decide to brew something truly outrageous just to explore the map and complete challenges, like getting 5 effects in a single potion or finding stuff people haven't even asked for yet. These expensive experiments soak up a ton of ingredients and often then results aren't really useful in the shop. But they work into a narrative relate to every alchemist's dream - making the philosopher's stone. 

Unfortunately, this is where the game can become a little bit of a grind. At times your quest will be locked behind tasks that require specific merchants to come along. Maybe they turn up but you don't have the money to buy what you need, maybe you've got the money saved but you're waiting for days, just filling the same orders for the potions you had recipes for long ago. When you spend more time in the haggling minigame than brewing new and interesting potions, it can start to feel like the game has slowed to a crawl. 

I do like what's here, I love the challenges and I think it's worth playing, but I'd almost want the economy to be even easier because the fun here isn't actually the mundane business of running a shop. It's the late night experiments to create something weird and wonderful.

When I bought the game, I was excited. fictional alchemy had always piqued by interest. Potion-making in video games where alchemy is not the focus often becomes underdeveloped, uninteresting, superfluous, or overwritten after some progression. However, my excitement devolved into frustration very quickly.

The game is not terrible, but its focus is wanting. Ingredients in the crafting system are used as pathing tools for carving out a trail towards your desired destination; the destination being the potion effect you want. With this in mind, it does not matter which components you use for your pathing as long as you get to the right destination; I often found myself making potions of healing with an ingredient described as poisonous. I thought that the descriptions of these items would give me clues on what to use for finding a certain potion type (i.e. the customer asks for Strength, maybe the ingredient will mention making people strong) but this exclusively applies to the few ingredients you have in the tutorial because of the narrow scope at said time.

The process of making potions is interesting at the start when you're mapping out the trails like a novice cartographer, and immediately this fascination turns into tedium. I cannot emphasize enough how this does not give me the feeling of making potions, but putting a jigsaw puzzle together, if the puzzle were constantly rotating with three-dimensional shapes instead of flat squares; it is genuinely fun to find a way to arrive at the desired potion effect, but it is such a long process that making the same effect is no longer exciting after the first few times. Luckily, the developers did think of this, and gave you the ability to save your favorite recipes to be immediately crafted on a hotkey. The fatal flaw in this design is that this recipe book has limited pages which you need to upgrade over time, meaning you will not escape the tedium of finding the same effect over and over until you grind enough to have enough pages to make it bearable. 

And after all that work, the prices you get can be rather terrible, and you are better off haggling the price for a potion that is one tier lower than the one you just spent 10 minutes putting together before realizing that Poison+Fire is not the combination they hinted at when wanting to destroy a monster.

At the very least, it got the frustrating feeling of micromanaging your own business right, with having to evaluate what ingredients you need and just how ""worth it"" it would be to leap across the counter and strangle that ungrateful customer.

Despite all I've said, I will continue to derive fun from this game. I originally did not intend to post a review until I had some hours, but the borderline deceptive core game design made me feel like I had already seen enough. It is not an irredeemable title, but I cannot forgive it for the violin solo it made my heart perform upon witnessing the harrowing display of ""not alchemy.""

Overall, 5/10. Will continue my search for my perfect alchemy title elsewhere.",1671852996,1671853175,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I asked and I received, but I did not get what I was necessarily hoping for. 
As much as I am stoked for the new content to be added, I am somewhat miffed at the way certain things were implemented. For one, the achievements not automatically registering for already completed feats is annoying. Especially for things that can only be done once in a game save such as purchasing alchemy machine parts or completing alchemy journal chapters. Like the fact I have to start a new game is unfair, and somewhat tedious regarding the early game grind. 
And then you have certain things such as bartering still being tedious as the hardest level on top of the fact that the game straight up took away my skills making me have to re-unlock it and not refunding the skill points I spend maxing out my stats. Literally had to build it all back up again. Which is a lot harder to do if you're level 60 and don't have the luxury of smaller xp requirements to level up per level. 
Like I feel like there was a better way of doing it isntead of screwing me over, but whatever.

But in all seriousness, this game is fun. it all went by so fast I legit don't know how I ended up with nearly 24 hours worth of gameplay (at the time of writing this). It just kinda... all fades together. I think i'm on day 90, and am working on making additional Moon Salts so I can make more complicated potions using the water map... which I haven't even fully explored either

I Seriously wish that Steam had a ""neutral"" rating, because my biggest issue with the game, is the nearly 8 gigs of memory it decides to claim as it's own, but only run with 2-3 gigs. I suspect it has something to do with the amount of textures and the game caching them all at once but not fully unloading them. It otherwise runs very well on my 1050, minimal CPU impact, so other than the memory issue it's potato friendly!

TL;DR:
Game is good, minor performance issues, but smooth gameplay.

- It is relaxing. Sometimes I just space out while playing this and a few days pass and I have a lot of money.
- There's strategy to this game. I learn new things to improve efficiency all the time when crafting potions. 
- Potions are cool.
- Game is pretty.
- Geralt

Cons:
- A lot of people have said the customers and I agree. I went the evil route, it seems like customers only ever ask for the same 3 potions. I can't remember the last time I made a potion of growth or light. 
- Figuring out the compatibility of effects is annoying. Maybe there should be a way to obtain a book that lists what's compatible with what. Or if you try selling a potion with incompatible/compatible effects to a customer, a notebook gets updated saying those effects are compatible/incompatible. Like a pokedex for effects? I guess?

Potion crafting is basically a puzzle of moving across a big map to specific points, the challenge being that each individually ingredient moves you across the map differently. To make specific potions, you need to reach specific points that determine an effect. That coupled with the ""experience point"" bubbles to grab as you go, and the general challenge of both acquiring ingredients and making good use of the ones you manage to get ahold of keep things interesting as you try to build up your ingredient supply to go for the costly, over-arching crafts that make up the bigger-picture progression. All the while, you're running a shop to sell potions to folks, requiring that you make quality potions to sell at prices that let you buy out the said ingredients you need.

A way to summarize the gameplay loop is you start a day, grab some free ingredients from your garden, sell to some folks and buy out what you can from merchants. Once you feel you've got a good supply (Or are waiting for certain progression upgrades to show up in said merchants), you start experimenting with exploring the potion map to find more potion effects and marking down shortcuts, or getting to work on making those complex potions you need for advanced recipes.

The content that's currently in the early and mid stage of the game is fun and polished, and other reviews will talk about them more. However, the playable content is enjoyable up to a point where you realize the game expects to you make use of features that's clearly not actually implemented yet: a third potion base and upgraded equipment/garden. 

Customers would demand, say, a tier 3 potion of inspiration. The problem is, without the wine base, you'll have to dump ingredients or use a hard to obtain mineral to reach the that part of the alchemy map, then dump a load of moon/sun salt to rotate it just right for it to be tier 3. What do you get for all that trouble? 500 coins. Declining the customer would net you a pretty hefty penalty at higher reputations too. 

On top of that, creating potions/recipes from scratch requires you to grind a lot of ingredients down, and even with the accessibility feature turned on, you'd give yourself repetitive motion injury by playing this game in a session longer than an hour.

I would not recommend this game until at least these two problems are fixed.

Some potential QOL changes that I would like to suggest though, since these were some of my pain points with the game:

- Blank pages in book be stored separately than pages that have been written to. It's difficult to find new recipes when they're hiding under blank.
- When purchasing from merchants, seeing a count of ""X of this item in inventory currently""

A suggestion (which may be a HUGE stretch but) I'd love to see Twitch Chat integration where chatters can randomly be chosen as clientele for the next day.

Bonus points if you're the kind of person that kind of phases into organization and small things like that, since you basically create your own recipes in the book.
General gameplay is basically trying to optimally maneuver your potion flask through obstacles to discover and trigger various effects on your potions.

Some small tips to help anyone that may be confused about UI bits and any future issues one may come across. Anything I think might be too 'spoilery' for those that like to figure their heads, I'll be sure to black out.

1. The compass points you towards the focal point of the potions in their direction (example, life points to health potion. death points to poison)
2. The whirlpools [spoiler]can be rotated by pumping air into the fire. Careful doing this if atop a potion effect you do not want.[/spoiler]
3. Whirlpools cont. [spoiler]Getting sucked into a whirlpool will warp your potion elsewhere. Upon warping via whirlpool, it will be permanently marked on your map where the destination was for future use[/spoiler]
4. Recipe book pages CAN be discounted, but you may still want to buy a handful in advance to be safe.
5. Be sure to thoroughly explore [spoiler]                  oil.                                     [/spoiler] That way you don't get stuck like I did for several in-game weeks.
6. Any truly disastrous, unsellable potions can be sold to merchants for 0 gold. Otherwise they can't be removed.
7. Adding to a recipe BEFORE you apply the potion effect can let you save an optimized path for further exploration (useful when finding unknown effects)
8. First bartering tier unlock is quite good.
9. Don't waste stones. [spoiler]They're used to teleport the distance that they're ground to. But the merchants that sell them don't bring a lot, and don't stop by as often as the others. Imo always stock up even if they're marked up[/spoiler]

It's a good game, but I can't really recommend it because it is certainly unfinished. Aside from the lack of sounds (when pick up flowers at least), the repetitive gameplay and the randomness, it's missing a very important thing - the story. It is almost non-existent in the game as is, but you could at least tell more stories with the customers coming and going. There are 3 types of customers in the game right now:
1) Merchants: you buy stuff and sometimes give potions for them to bring new ingredients;
2) Random buyers: they tell what kind of a potion they need. Usually there are more than one type of a potion that fits their requests;
3) Story characters: there are only 2 of them in the game - the Fisherman and the Witcher. However, they just disappear (or rather never come back) after a certain number of requests of like 5-8 or something along the lines.

While I understand that the main focus of the game was on the ""brewing"" part of the game - and it is fun for what it is - you could make SO much more even with random customers. A quick example would be something like this: you sell a poison potion to a customer for them to poison their neighbour's well, while the next day another customer comes and asks for an explosion potion to destroy their neighbour's house, because they were poisoned. --And one could make at least a dozen of these overnight.

The game has other flaws as I mentioned, but this one is truly a missed opportunity. If you want a casual game for a couple of hours then yes - I could you recommend this game for its price. Otherwise, you'll be left disappointed.",1671749299,1671749299,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- No plot or story of any kind. NPCs are absurdly dull. Despite the ""reputation"" system being in place, there's no story-driven decision-making in giving specific kinds of potions to specific people (which was so well done this year in ""Strange Horticulture"").

- No variety. Only two maps are not enough. The sequence of all tasks is exactly the same after ~10h. The ""soundtrack"" is one single repetitive piece looped over and over (!!!). There's no equipment upgrades or variations. Why can't I switch my ""wooden spoon"" with some ""golden spoon"" that would work differently?

- No challenge. After ~15h you're rolling in money and ingredients and can do literally whatever you want. The customers with very particular demands are still fun, because they give you fun puzzles to solve (and all of them seem solvable so far, which is a huge plus). But to *get the fun customers to come* you need to grind through hundreds of boring ones. I'd love some ""hard mode"" that only gives you the most demanding customers and is actually punishing in some interesting way if you don't manage to serve them (e.g. limits your potion-making abilities).

This game is like an fried egg. Why? Well, that happens to be my current favorite way to cook and eat an egg. No other real reason.

If you don't like eggs, you're not going to want a fried egg no matter how it's cooked, and if you like eggs, but only like deviled eggs, you aren't going to want a fried egg.

But, if you like a good fried egg than look no further! This is the meal for you.

Potion Craft is sort of like a point-and-click game with elements of planning and exploration. The game can roughly be split into 3 parts: 

- Resource Management
- Planning/Exploration
- NPC interaction

Let's start with the last one. A large portion of the game is interacting with customers, trying to figure out what potion they want and making it for them. The interactions aren't very deep, but they can be fun at times.

The Planning and exploration part of the game is really the ""meat and potatoes"" of the gameplay loop. You have an ""alchemy"" map which starts out unexplored. In the center is a potion of water. By adding different ingredients to your cauldron, you can start to plan out a path for your potion of water to take. Stirring the cauldron starts your potion moving down your planned path, with your eventual goal to be to reveal new potions and prepositionally line up your potion of water with the new potion you've discovered.

The potion making gameplay is a bit more complex than that, but it somewhat fits into the: ""easy to learn, hard to master"" category.

One of the main complexities with the Exploration/Planning portion of the game is Resource Management: over the course of the game, you will find yourself short on certain ingredients and will need to make due with what you have. You also have a strong incentive to make your potions as cheaply as possible. I really enjoy this: there's something satisfying about making an excellent potion with very few ingredients.

For me, the biggest CON of the of the game is that as you explore more of the map, it can be harder and harder to get to previously discovered potions. There's a recipe system where you can save a potion, and without it, the game would be way too monotonous. However, if you've just spent 20 minutes and several expensive ingredients to explore and find a new potion, you probably aren't going to want to save it to a recipe, instead, you'll need to spend another 20+ minutes planning how to get back over to the potion, but this time being resource conscious.

Another hard part of the game (which becomes much harder later) is that sometimes a customer will want a potion you have yet to discover. The game is very smart and doesn't put any sort of time-limit to serving a customer, but it can be daunting to have to explore the map for a new potion when you have little to no idea where it will be (the earlier potions sort of have a system, but as far as I know, that system kinda becomes useless later in the game)

Anyway, to end this rather long and ramble-y review: I really enjoy this game. There are enough new things to keep me interested and the gameplay isn't too demanding.

Enjoyed the resource management and the many different types of customers and orders that came in. The use of reagents being directions on a map was really clever. I did get a bit bored towards the end-game when all there was to do was just creating new recipe after recipe in the advanced alchemical machine, and I also was fairly frustrated with the frequency that the merchants came by. In the start of the game they stopped by daily and often, but towards the middle and end of the game I had practically never seen the wizard or the mineral merchant at all, and the merchants that did come by rarely sold what you were looking for. Part of me thinks this is bad luck, part of me thinks this is a game mechanic to force you to constantly remake old recipes with different herbs. Either way I found that specific part a bit irritating. Other than that though, the game is quite solid for it's 15$ pricetag, and worth the purchase in my opinion. I hear that they are even adding even more content, so if its worth it now it definitely will be even more so in a few months.

Edit: I was right. Tons of new content so far, and either they fixed the encounter rate or I really was just unlucky.

I think it is a great spin on the ""alchemist"" trope, where the player has much more freedom than just following a set recipe. Each ingredient follows a set path and you can chain together different ingredients to reach the same potion effect. If you are running low on one ingredient, just use another. It may not be the most optimal path, but it gets the job done. I also enjoy that the game is not just selling potions to the customer, you also have the option to brew potions for yourself in order to research the philosopher's stone. Resource management is a very big thing in Potion Craft, as you want the recipes you save to be as low-cost as possible and with the most readily-available ingredients so you can use that recipe more often. I also enjoy the characters that come through to buy your potions. They are great at showing the world outside of the potion shop. Some of them might come through, saying that they are a knight and need to be stronger and faster. In that case, you can put two potions into one and create a potion of strength and swiftness. That isn't to say that this game is perfect though.

There is 2 things that bug me: the exploration of the outer parts of the potion map and portals. The outer part of the map is more maze like, increasing the chance for your potions to fail. This alone isn't a deal breaker though. I think that the further you get from the center, the more difficult the potions should be to brew. It's the fact that a lot of these potions require many, many ingredients to get to. So much so that often times I find that brewing a potion from the outer portion of the map does not cover the cost of the ingredients that go into it. A lot of those potions just aren't worth the investment.

The portals also do not make much sense. I'd say a good portion of the portals are either gimmick (just one time use to get some experience) or actively work against you. Some portals send you backwards, away from the potions you are trying to brew, especially the portals on the outer edges of the map. I find myself using the portals less than I'd like to. I wish they were more useful, a good way to save an extra ingredient in the brewing process. Some are designed like that, but I wish that most were designed like that.

Overall, I think the game is great. It's not a game you can spend an entire day playing, but a great game if you want to unwind after a day at work for an hour or two. I don't see myself putting 100 hours into Potion Craft anytime soon, but I do think I'll be playing it off and on for the foreseeable future.",1671562244,1671562244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's just generally a lot of fun and as it is now it's even fun to play in the late stage. However of course it gets a little repetetive with everything and using the alchemy machine kind of feels useless after sun salt, since the salts after are so expensive that it doesn't seem to be worth while to use them since the effect of them can be replaced with using better ingredients and being more careful and if failed just trying again (life salt), and just using an ingredient that takes you towards the potion of choice (Philosopher's salt). I also never really find myself using void salt but that's the cheap one anyway. Although this and many other ""complaints"" I might have seems to be exactly what is going to change in future updates, which is just really great to see.

The game feels like a job where you go up in management but it's ultimately just more responsibility and more hard work.

3 nights in a row, I wanted to play it. I booted it up with the want to play and genuinely enjoyed it for about 45-60 minutes each time. But after that, I'd finish a day (in game) and question why bother doing another day. Progression doesn't feel great. There are milestones like checklists for the chapter of your lesson book and you get skill points to just do more of the same thing -- not even do it much better, just.. more. Nearly every upgrade you get doesn't make the game easier. It makes you have to do the hard stuff more often. You get more customers that want the potions that require specific materials which is great the first time. You do the whole alchemical exploration process to find it and that puzzle solving is fun. It's unique and I genuinely felt like I was brewing and discovering a potion. You can save the recipe to expedite it the next time a customer wants it which was wonderful for easy potions. But the recipe saves the exact process you did - exact ingredients and all. So if you don't have enough of a single ingredient that went a certain direction, you have to do that whole process again and it's way less fun to make a difficult potion the second or third or forth time. If you have the exact stuff, then awesome and you make a ton of money. But money is just more ""progression.""

The game is fun to start but the reward for progression is increased difficulty with little to none of the quality of life or ease you tend to get with progression. And to be fair, there may be things further down the line. I made the first big alchemical machine thing, felt a smidge of serotonin, checked to see what the next one would need and immediately went ""fuck that"".

Haggling consistency is terrible, resulting in easy haggles with excessive speed and nothing but small targets at the start sometimes. The game seems to require you to haggle with the Mage/Alchemist who sells the machine parts, but haggling consistency makes him quite a roadblock. There's nothing to make haggling easier, so the varying difficulties doesn't make sense either and unlocking harder haggle difficulties is a waste with it's consistency issue.

Potion needs outpace ingredient acquisition. Moreso the quantity it almost wants you to spend to just explore the map. The outer ring basically requires stones for their teleport ability, but never seeing the merchant or dwarf to actually get those ingredients and then having those ingredients RNG as more expensive... it's just not a great time.

I am in love with this game, its concept, and its execution. 
It gets the best part of alchemy systems with an interesting game play function. The alchemy map and its progression system is very reminiscent of rouge-lites and their own style of progression, with the interesting premise that you're just an alchemist, exploring the arcane nature of the ingredients with a fun science to it.

My favorite part of the game has to be the fact that you are given many attempts to recreate the potion, and in the most efficient way possible. The only complaint I have is how little and how expensive ingredients are. But I do believe that the upcoming updates will add new ways to get ingredients., so holding my tongue on the topic until anything comes out is a good idea.  

The merchant system is interesting in the way its built, especially around the fact that you have a rotation of customers with these merchants sprinkled in between. Again, my complain from before about the expensive ingredients remain prevalent with the merchants. As well as the fact that I don't see a real reason in keeping price differences if there can't be a regular supply of them. Maybe restructuring the merchant system as a sort of supply line system for your store? That way, prices do matter, in addition to the fact you can set up a consistent supply of one resource that maybe isn't too available in your garden. Or cheap ingredients that are used regularly for movement in the map (the main directional ingredients) 
It would make an interesting market system in the world that we as the players can interact with. 

I digress, I do wish there could be more done with trading than just random merchants.

This game is a very very fun game. It scratches an itch of crafting and exploration in a way that no other game has done, other than maybe the Elder Scrolls alchemy systems.",1671499373,1671499373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn't say so on steam. But it hasn't even been a month and they're showing the next update essentially doubling the amount of maps and merchants, entirely reworked systems, and other stuff.

But, it's still a very good game as is. It's a very calming low-stakes puzzle game absolutely gushing at the seams with style and charm.
The potion brewing itself is very easy to understand and a bit tricky to master, but once you know your supplies you'll find yourself with plenty of tricks to use to make efficient recipes.
Being able to save and edit potions is great fun for immersion. You can change the bottle, label, name, and description of every potion recipe you save and change the default bottle shapes if you like something different. It really does help you feel like a strange apothecary creature if you save recipes of any new potions and go through customizing them. Because why sell a mage a 'Strong Potion of Mana' when you can sell them 'Mana Dew' in a basically soda can? Or subtly insult all the perverts?
It's also cute how the story is done through set NPCs coming by with their own story to make small talk with you. Or noticing the groups that come in. I noticed mages like to come in packs, or how many peasants come in buying expensive light potions. Also yeah you're a general store half the people will come in for glue, grease, lanterns, matches, and rat poison.

As for cons:
Faked a full release.
The music can be repetitive.
Could really benefit from writing normally in the journal, or just having one (the desk in the bedroom has stuff implying you can write in one) to keep track of story beats or who sells what.
Accessibility could use some work. I wish they had a setting for auto-working equipment for people with motion problems. And a setting to make the line that shows the potion's path when you add more base visible. It is a pretty important gameplay aspect and people with poor vision (Aka me) have to zoom in and get close to the screen to see it. These things kind of make it hard to play after a while, I'm reasonably healthy when it comes to my hands but after a couple hours my wrist would be very worn out of repetitive motion.

Downsides only:
1. Only 3 merchants and a few villagers with very limited dialogues. And who the hell is the creepy guy at the beginning of the game who didn't buy anything?? I almost forget about this guy after an hour or so. Maybe he/she will reappear later in the game but i don't have the patience to play any longer.
2. Exploring the map is fun and all, but way too repetitive. I got quite excited when i got the oil map, but it's just the same map as the water one, only the far potions are upright. So i explored the majority of the map only to get those potions, saved all recipes and lost interest. 
3. You cannot save the recipes for nigredo, albedo etc. like bro come on, it's just pure frustration to find all those potion recipes to make nigredo and then albedo and finally moon salt. And when i tried to make citrinitas i found out i have to go through all that to make it. JUST LET ME SAVE THE RECIPE!!

You grind them to modify the path they take, use minerals to warp through hazards, add water to make incremental modifications to your position, and gradually explore more of the map. As you go you unlock more and more potion effects.

This core experience is great: you get asked for a potion that can help unblock a tunnel, or improve someone's combat ability, and then make them something with one or more effects. You buy stuff, help solve problems for your suppliers, and gradually improve your potion shop. You can save a limited but upgradeable number of recipes to save time. So far so good.

The problem is with the mid to late-game content. I explored the whole map pretty quickly, unlocked huge amounts of ingredients, and after that the core gameplay loop became very stale. The mid-game and late-game objectives are all around brewing a LOT of potions with arbitrary combinations of effects, for use in alchemy or for clients with exacting demands. The problem is, there's no exploration by this point: you're just opening up the same map(s) you've seen a million times, going to the same effects you've already used, and trying not to slip up. Half your recipes won't work because you accidentally used a rare ingredient that the merchants no longer stock, and even then, starting from one or two effects out of five doesn't save much time. It becomes routine detail-oriented busywork instead of challenging new exploration.

Overall I really enjoyed the first 7 or 8 hours, but would have preferred it if the game stayed about exploration, and became more challenging and less grindy towards the end. It promises so much, but doesn't quite get there.",1671457087,1671457087,False,2,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

They come to you with their interesting little stories like poisoning someone they dislike, or because they suffer from diarrhea and need a health potion to get rid of it.

You get to harvest plants and mushrooms alike while you can also buy them from vendors coming to your shop during business hours.
As you sell and create potions you also have to upgrade some parts of your brewing station that is there to craft high-tier quality stuff that you need to complete the main quests of the game.

The map on which you discover new potions is the only thing that, in my eyes, is a bit of a negative point.
It can be frustrating to craft potions if you crash into a bone wall because you happened to be a bit too close to it, and you have to restart the brewing from zero again.

 By selling potions you get clients that want their potions for crimes and others to improve their own or the life of others, which results in either a bad or a good shop reputation.
This influences which customers are more likely to appear in your shop.
The worse the reputation, the more customers that desire your potions for bad stuff will visit your shop.
I really did like that mechanic of the game.

The last part that I found frustrating is the higher recipes that require a lot of potions and higher tier stuff that may be a pain to obtain as you can't save the recipes for these.

(And I still don't know what potion this mushroom guy wants, hence why he refuses to sell me more mushrooms.)",1671443486,1671443486,True,18,0,0.69765084981918335,0,True,False,False

Why poison some guards when you can drug them with a mess of effects, but no just 2 stinkshrooms and some water and you've got all you need.

This game has some fantastically implemented mechanical ideas - for example, I love the map exploration aspect of recipe building, and I'm a sucker for any game that involves creative use of limited resources. I truly feel the developers have hit something special with the core of the game. That said, advancing through chapters can quickly devolve into an unsatisfying grind after about chapter 5, and certain features such as haggling only become more annoying as the game drags on. I feel with some pacing adjustments, addition of variety in the characters and writing, and some variation on top of the core features (which again, I do love), this game could really be fun. 

One simple fix to the pacing would be to have the traveling merchants able to be visited at any time by the player. The developers could still maintain ingredient randomness and scarcity by varying what each merchant has on a given day (as well as costs). With the current mechanic, it can be very frustrating when you are waiting for one particular mechant (who sells parts to the alchemist machine) to return to advance the chapters, or when you wish you could just revisit a merchant when you just need one little bump to finish a recipe.

At the start, money is a problem. You barely make enough to get by, having to rely on your garden for ingredients. As you level up, potions sell for more, and money becomes pretty easy to come by.

But towards the end, it gets hugely tedious. I'm at 9/10 chapters done but can't bring myself to put in 5-6 more hours to get the final chapter done. Literally nothing new is being added, it's just the same old stuff, making very complicated potions for the legendary recipes, selling the same old boring potions to the same old boring customers. Same thing every day.

Honestly, for what the game is, cutting down the length to complete would be fine. Otherwise it needs more mechanics to stay interesting through completion.

Mechanics such as tilted bottles and warp stones could be explained more (i.e. at all). Feels like it's still in early access despite the 1.0 release.",1671387014,1671387477,False,4,1,0.584885597229003906,0,True,False,False

Potion making is fun to do for the first time, and then every subsequent time you can automake the potion the same way if you save it. I also like acquiring vast sums of wealth, and although I haven't tried level 4/5 bartering, level 3 is easy enough for me to have only failed one so far, and I barter almost every time. The game looks great as well, at least as far as it tries to (for example: people aren't animated, but the day transition is gorgeous, and the artstyle works). I'm a little mixed about exploration, though it's been lots of fun so far I've reached the point where the unexplored areas are long unsubstantiated corridors so I need to either use a rock to skip through them (which I don't think was explained? though I also mainly skim instructions) or spend a nerve wracking amount of ingredients exploring. The desire to make an efficient recipe goes against the books scattered about, because you can either make sure the recipe you save is worth using or not save the recipe and go back later, though that's probably an early game thing and you'll always have to go back and plan out a better route later on. Anyways, the real thing I wanted to complain about was the abysmal progression system. Somewhat hyperbolic, but I had everything completed for tier 3 except for the ""purchase an alchemy table"" portion by day 5 and the person who sells the alchemy table did it on some double digit numbered day. Now I'm on tier 4 on day 20, having done everything except for ""create the magic substance"" and I have every potion needed, but there's a mineral required that I haven't seen since day 5, where it was marked up and I was only passingly aware that I needed it. The dwarf just showed up, and he had three rocks that weren't the ones required for progression. I almost have chapter 5 finished, and yet chapter 4 alludes me.
So yeah, progression is random and all I can do is get stupidly wealthy off of these bandits who keep coming to me (because I got a streak of bad people and now I'm evil aligned, oh well). Don't get me wrong, I like the game, and I'm almost certain I'm going to put more time in, but these are my gripes. Exploration can feel wasteful in the short run, progression isn't entirely in your hands, though leveling up does spike the request difficulty which I did notice when I hit level 3 in 2 days. Early game ingredients can be scarce, but if you barter every time money is not so buy out anything discounted and probably everything not.

Ever since I was a lad, ive been dreaming of a alchemist game where you get to do all the steps like grinding and distilling and growing herbs-- this game is the closest thing ever to my dream game :D
and the best part is that we get to rename and recolor and relabel, so one can really let loose on creativity and imagination to add custom lore to your own concoctions. 
Also i love how you need pin-point precision to nab the strongest of potions, makes me feel like an alchemist, cautiously and steadily adding milligrams of extract to complete a brew. Perfect!
Really glad that even more features are coming! I truly can't wait.

I have a small idea that may add greater variety to the game: Weather! For example during a rainy day, there can be soft drizzling sound added to the ambience music, certain herbs/mushroom are more abundant in merchant and also in the magical garden (mudshrooms perhaps). Certain haggles are easier/ more profitable as well perhaps mushrooms, weather and fishing. Perhaps even certain ingredients are elevated in efficacy, i.e. moves slightly further in their respective routes.
And have that for different weathers like sunny, cloud, misty, blood storm etc.

Some things that I might reccomend (or heard someone else reccomend) are:
-Mod Support, Letting players add thier own potion bases, ingredients, effects and customers would be fun.
-Wanted Board, Make players pay attention to the customers in line by having a wanted poster/board in the background. Rejecting this customer would give you more good reputation and wouldn't decrease popularity (maybe even increase it cause of you finding a wanted criminal)
-Late Game ""Special"" Customers, A shop can experience a lot of things when popular, some good, some bad, like a robbery or a young aspiring alchemist asking for ingredients to help them make their first potion. Customers that don't just ask for potions. These would be late game as then your popularity is high enough to start gathering attention from a lot more people.
-Finally, Inspectors. Inspectors would see if your shop is good to go, or a meance to society. These customers would require a tier 4-5 Potion of any kind.

Pros:
Fun, easy, satisfying, and relaxing gameplay
A nice, simple yet quirky art style
The one track of music (at time of review) is good and doesn't get annoying
Incredibly fun and unique crafting (kinda needs to be, as it's 80% of the game)
NPCs are well designed, Merchants have quests for more ingredients
Mystery mechanism in your basement that you can repair to create cool stuff

Cons:
No Kobolds (get on it, devs. I wanna see funny lizord)
Can't place potions on the dresser upstairs
Uhhhh... Ingredients can be rough to find enough of?

Suggestions:
More Kobolds because they're precious gremlins and I want them to yip at me and buy funny juice
Shelves in the front desk area to put Potions on instead of just grabbing them from the inventory 
(Asthetically pleasing and easy to access without scrolling through your inventory)
Mixing effects to get different results (3 health, 2 strength makes 5 health, maybe even soldiers accepting stone skin + health/strength when asking for one of them)

Here's a big one, Adaptive gameplay, very small QoL change, but goes a LONG way. Sometimes I find myself lacking some very simple ingredients, specifically windbloom. What if, when a merchant comes in, the game reads what you have in your inventory and gives the merchant more of what you're lowest on, even if it's based on category. Or maybe even using a potion of wild growth to make more of a certain plant grow each day?

Final result 9.5/10, when fully, FULLY released, I hope it gets popular enough to show up on the game awards for ""Best relaxation game"" keep up the amazing work, devs!
And seriously, add kobolds, it would be adorable to see them walk into my store an I only see the top of their head lol",1643492011,1671326621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But what is this game? - Well ... an alchemy simulator? basically you try to get your hands on some herbs, explore how to craft potions and get better at it. BUT the only thing that actually influences the quality of your potions is YOUR actual skill. no values in game help you. Just you, your brain and your finger. If you master the rather simple mechanics of chosing the right herb, grinding it just right AND/OR stirring it on point, you will be a master potioncrafter in no time. If you arent very skilled, you can still play this game. You might need some extra herbs but so far the game is very forgiving, I dont think you can actually lose, as your garden will provide you with some free herbs on a daily basis. 
Damn this game is so good, I have more fun exploring the potionboard than I had in Witcher 3, Skyrim or any other open world game (most likely because I am rather pissed if the world gets too big at some point).

The potion-making core gameplay (95% of the game with a bit of ancilliary stuff which is basically working out which potions you need) is a simplistic maze game where you move through a repetitive and slow process. Unlike many of these high-concept, high-theme indie games, this process never changes or develops, rather you just have to go further into the maze later in the game. Once you have played for ten minutes you have seen everything this game has to offer.

This would be fine if the core gameplay was really fun but it isn't. It's kind of intriguing at first and I like the abstraction of representing chemistry with a maze but ultimately it's just a very basic maze game where you have to go through three steps (always the same three steps) to move anywhere.

I put up with this for a while (14 hours in fact), hoping that the game would develop some new twist on the formula or significantly speed up the exponentially-increasing grind to reach the next level. It did not, and it's a shame.

Pros:
Theming is great - looks and sounds fantastic
Concept of alchemy expressed as a maze input game is interesting

Dependent on tastes:
I really think this would be better if you could buy ingredients at any time - when you end up with loads of money but no ingredients that let you move in a certain direction it's very frustrating.

Cons:
Repetitive beyond all belief
Grindy, with the later recipes requiring a total repeat of ALL earlier ones
Some of the requests can be annoyingly vague: 'I want a potion to stop my fruit from going rotten.' Is that a rejuvenation potion? A growth potion? A necromancy potion? An ice potion? I honestly never figured it out.
The save recipe shortcut doesn't really work as is for any but the most basic potions (the ones you need the shortcut for the least) because you will use so many ingredients you inevitably won't have the same ones next time - again, something that being able to buy ingredients on the fly would help with.",1671215028,1671215028,False,2,0,0.531835198402404785,0,True,False,False

There aren't many games I've purchased in Early Access, the most notable one I can think of is definitely Hades and that became Game of the Year for me. There's also games like Hardspace: Shipbreaker which pretty much released in the exact same state it was in during EA. There are others but these two are the most notable to me.

Potion Craft did [i]nothing but improve[/i] over time. Mechanics were reworked entirely, the alchemical map has changed quite a bit, interactions with customers and what they can order, and the newer reputation system now allows you to be an evil alchemist or a good one which is neat. These devs did what Supergiant Games did and actually paid attention to what their playerbase wanted rather than spitting in their eyes and telling them it's a magic potion to help see better like Blackbird Interactive did.

I haven't yet fully completed the story, I haven't made a Philosopher's Stone yet, and I am very far from done creating my recipes and selling potions to my customers. I will be returning many times over to this game because the gameplay loop is far too satisfying to abandon for my monkey brain.

It's an exercise in tedium.
It's a minigame that is missing its main game.
It's repetitive, slow, devoid of content and full of nothing. 
It's a fluff sandwich. 
It's a chore and feels like a real job after a while. 

I know it sounds harsh, but let me explain.
The first few hours of the game are *amazing*. The game gives you a very simple explanation and lets you have a go at it, pace yourself, play however you want, and for as long as you are working unraveling the initial water chart, figuring the simplests of potions, you really are there. 
It's in the progression where the game falls flat. 
You'd think to expect a story, more mechanics perhaps, some sudden change in stakes that ups the ante and makes the management part of the game more nuanced, perhaps? Perhaps more uses for gold? 
No. That's it. 
You buy reagents, sometimes you are allowed to buy an upgrade for the alchemical machine, which in itself is nothing but a checklist of very specific formulas you have to find in order to progress, and eventually win the game. At some point you will be given access to other base reagents - you start with water - that come with different charts. The charts offer some slight variability, but the recipes in them are the same. 

This game is simply incomplete. It needed more meat, not 900 more random NPCs with a vague backstory and some indication for what potion they need. 
If there's such meat in this game, after 9 hours playing I haven't found it, and that's as far as I am willing to give it until a considerable update.",1671163209,1671163209,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I love grinding up the ingredients so much -- especially the gems! I love that you have to actually tap to break them before you can grind them...and the animation of how it 'forms' is beautiful and mesmerizing. I am addicted and my family has missed me for the past 12 hours. 

The crafting system is really fun, and you can master it over time and patience. I love it. I see high potential in this game as it 'evens' out the bugs and issues and possibly add new features in the future? (no idea if they will)

That being said - here are the hard facts for this game at its current state (1.0):

* It crashes constantly for a lot of people - even those with the minimum requirements to run it. Dev team is working on it, and you can report the issues on their Discord.
I-------->You can save yourself the deep depression of losing your progress by saving as often as you want. (I personally save after every ""big"" thing I accomplish - like a level 3 potion, or a new potion, or a new part).

* Can feel very limited at times, as you get stuck in places, or screw up your inventory and mess around too much trying to brew crazy stuff.

* There ARE glitches. Lots of glitches -- but again, you can report them to the Dev team on Discord, and they seem to take the feedback well.

Overall, this game gets an 8/10 from me. I'm easy to pleasey, though. 

I take off two stars for the constant crashing, and that the fact the answer right now typically is, ""your computer can't handle it/is outdated"". I can play No Man's Sky flawlessly...this game should NOT be an issue, but I honestly just blame Unity - because it's Unity. You can fart and Unity will freak out and stop working.

I highly recommend that patient people like myself ignore the crashing for now if you can run your game for an hour or two without it exploding, and save often.

For those of you who hate anticipating when a crash will happen, or you forget to save often, or you're just not into dealing with crashes - don't buy this game until it improves its stability. Join their Discord and watch for updates.",1671154026,1671154026,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Potion making is superb. Like, I can't stress is enough: get this just to make potions for 4 hours, it is that good. Exploration is done very well. Customer's stories are well written and funny.

However the gem seems unfinished.
There are no shop upgrades, but there is menu describing what you can upgrade.
There is a strange visitor in first week of the game, but they do not show up ever again.
The game has no real ending, and the few last big items you can make are quite redundant at the point when you can make them.
It would seem that half of effects were removed from the 'finished' game, but the icons were left.

Pros: 
- Its relatively fun to optimize your recipes to be as efficient as possible
- The dialogue system is fairly unique as you have to interpret what they want, they don't just tell you ""I want a potion of poison"", at least they don't do that most the time
- The reputation system is quite good and doesn't necessarily punish you for being more of a black market potion shop

Cons: 
- I'm level 52, have a level 12 reputation, and have a fully upgraded alchemist machine. I've unlocked the ability to make rubedo, one lower material than the cap stone ""philosopher's stone"", and yet I've still not encountered any merchant who sells upgrades to your other alchemy equipment. Is there other upgrades in the game? The upgrades section seems to imply that there are. 
- how do you rotate the potion bottles to make them line up with tilted bottles using the oil base? I assumed this would be unlocked when you buy new tools, but I've yet to even come across a merchant who sells them.
- the game is essentially done once you've completed the philosopher's stone and completed the book. This can be very easily achieved in a matter of 15 hours or so, less if you mostly just focus on completing these tasks and you don't just take your time.

I like the visuals and the whole medieval aesthetic. 

If all you plan on doing is burn through your stash of reagents to explore the formula map then this game is a pretty nice way to spend a couple of hours. But if you're looking to progress through the game, then you'll probably find yourself facing a bit of frustration. 

There's way too much RNG involved in this for a game that's tagged relaxing. 

You only obtain reagents two ways: 
1) Randomly generated each game day in your garden
2) Purchase from the occasional merchant whose stock is also randomly generated. 

The customers that come in are similarly randomly generated in their requests so you never know what reagents you should set aside. Sometimes they even ask for potions you've yet to discover and there are no hints on the direction you should explore, so you wind up wasting a lot of reagents just discovering random potions. As a result, your exploration of the formula map is quite severely curbed. 

There also aren't enough perks to levelling up. You get talent points for doing so, which allows you to improve the radius of your exploration, or make sales/purchases more lucrative, but none of these actually address the ultimate problem of no way to reliably increase your reagents or make your brews more efficient. 

Would be good if we had some level upgrades so that a single brew may produce more than one potion, or the garden could be 'tuned' in some way so that more herbs of a certain element/direction will grow the following day to better manage stock. 

That said, we're still in v1.0, so I'm curious and hopeful for more improvements in the future.",1671086736,1671086736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, terrible optimization makes the current version unplayable. Literally - it crashes on launch, and the devs respond to these issues by citing insufficient GPU.

To be fair, my PC is pretty old. But it also runs games like Dishonored, XCOM, Oxygen Not Included, Disco Elysium and The Sims 3+4 with no real issues. I really don't see why it should fail to run a simple 2D crafting game unless some truly terrible decisions were made under the hood.

I have run into a few glaring bugs (such as potions showing tier 3 effect and saying cannot make without an effect) but seeing as its quite a recent release, hopefully these bugs get fixed quickly. 

The game center around making potions, you can harvest or buy various ingredients which will affect the potion, moving it some way around a ""potion map"" on this map there are various affects, navigate your potion to an effect to make a potion with that effect, such as healing, frost, etc. The more on point you potion is the higher the effect level. Potions can also have multiple effects. Say, healing and wild growth or poison and healing. It's not all tedious as you are given the option to ""save recipes"" if you make a tier 3 fire potion you can save it so you can remake it whenever without navigation as long as you have the same ingredients you made it with.

The game encourages creativity and experimentation in a fun way. Unfortunately  at this time I have been encountering bugs with saving potions and creating potions which have made this game not quite fun. I'll try to give it a go in a few weeks and see if these launch bugs are fixed, until then I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game.

Id love to see an expanded perk tree though, 
Id love a tree pertaining to the garden specifically, perks to yield more herbs/mushrooms per collection, an expanded garden or more exotic ingridents that grow more commonly. 

Im in the very beginning stages of the game so im not sure on how many upgrades are avalible from merchants. But im feeling the need for more herbs. 

An expansion to the haggling tree would be nice too; like a miss forgiveness chance upgrade or increase the sizes on the hardest stages ect

At nine and a half hours in (day 46 I think?) I've hit a point where I'm just sort of grinding to get enough resources to conveniently search around for [spoiler]resist poison (I'm guessing?)[/spoiler] so that I can give it to the merchants.  I also unlocked a new base, [spoiler]oil instead of water[/spoiler] [strike]but in my initial testing it seems [/strike][spoiler][strike]to be on the exact same potion map[/strike] it is not the same[/spoiler] [strike]which is not very interesting.[/strike]

That being said, these are my only serious complaints.  My first problem would be easily solved by a limited-use freebie-discovery type thing so if you get stuck trying to find a specific potion (or just hate searching) you can make it happen much easier.  My second problem might not even be a problem, we'll see when I continue to progress.  I also think there should have been a tutorial explaining that the gems teleport your potion on the map allowing you to traverse walls.

Other than that, the game is great!  Very fun, great design, addicting game loop (I played the first 9.5 hours all at once).  Well worth the price for me already, especially on sale, but still a decent pick up at full price.  The dialogue is cute with a few great references, I'm only a bit confused at the morality assigned to some of the stories customers tell you.  It's medieval fantasy so you can assume everyone exists under an oppressive feudal system, but when you help clearly disheveled poor people steal food from castles or run from guards it is considered immoral.  Then helping those wealthy nobles in certain contexts is considered moral.  Robin Hood anyone?  I guess not.
