The new party finder is an absolute wreck as it's not intuitive. On release, this was an open-world pvP game that rapidly devolved into a mish-mash of PvP/PvE and hella bugs in story. The crafting system is the worst grind: frequently 1250 mats needed to raise skill a pip or two, then back out to harvest for hours or buy off of the player-run server-specific trading post which is an absolute free-for-all of end-stage Capitalism at its finest. The 'expansion' is a DLC that allows five more levels, mounts, and  anew zone - about 8 hours of actual game play. 

The world is stunning but buggy as all-git-out. I recommend New World for a decent story, rich NPCs and a gorgeous world... but it's laggy and buggy as Hell at times, with AZG taking over five weeks to fix bugs in MSQ or even the launcher. All in all, if you pay your 50 bucks and get your 40 or 50 hours of story in, you've done just about everything there is save the end-game grinding of 8 or 9 dungeons/instances that you may or may not find a group for based on your in-game gearing.",1708899750,1708899750,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Immersive World Design: The game's rendition of Aeternum, a mysterious island filled with ancient ruins and supernatural forces, is breathtaking. From lush forests to desolate beaches and eerie swamps, each environment feels meticulously crafted and invites exploration.

2. Engaging Combat System: ""New World"" offers a refreshing take on MMO combat with its action-oriented mechanics. Players must carefully time their attacks, blocks, and dodges, adding a layer of skill-based gameplay to encounters with both AI enemies and other players.

3. Player-driven Economy: The game's economy is entirely player-driven, allowing for a dynamic marketplace where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Crafting professions such as blacksmithing, woodworking, and alchemy play a crucial role, fostering a sense of community as players trade resources and goods.

4. Territorial Warfare: One of the game's standout features is its territorial warfare system, where players can join factions and vie for control over settlements scattered across the island. Large-scale battles involving siege weapons and fortifications offer thrilling PvP (Player vs. Player) experiences.

5. Continuous Development: Amazon Games has demonstrated a commitment to improving and expanding the game post-launch through regular updates and patches. New content, including features like expeditions and seasonal events, keeps the experience fresh for players.

Cons:

1. Lackluster Quest Design: Despite the immersive world, quest design often feels repetitive and uninspired. Many quests boil down to simple fetch or kill tasks, failing to offer meaningful narrative or gameplay variety.

2. Grind-heavy Progression: Progression in ""New World"" can feel excessively grindy, especially at higher levels. Players are required to invest significant time and effort into leveling up skills, acquiring resources, and completing repetitive tasks to advance.

3. Technical Issues: The game's launch was marred by technical issues, including server instability, long queue times, and performance optimization problems. While some of these issues have been addressed post-launch, occasional bugs and glitches still persist, but they are working on it.

4. Balance Concerns: Balancing issues plague certain aspects of the game, particularly in PvP combat and faction warfare. Certain weapons and abilities may feel overpowered or underwhelming, leading to frustration among players seeking fair and competitive gameplay.

5. Limited Endgame Content: Despite its promising start, ""New World"" currently lacks substantial endgame content beyond territorial warfare and repetitive PvE activities. Without meaningful progression or rewards to pursue, some players may find themselves at a loss once they reach max level.

Conclusion:
""New World"" presents a captivating vision of exploration, combat, and community-driven gameplay set against the backdrop of a mysterious and dangerous island. While it excels in certain areas such as world design and combat mechanics, it falls short in others, including quest variety and endgame content. Despite its flaws, ""New World"" remains a promising MMO with the potential for further growth and refinement through ongoing updates and community feedback. Whether it can realize its full potential and carve out a lasting legacy in the MMO genre remains to be seen.",1688660596,1708899270,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be fair they didn't anticipate everyone buying it. The pre-sales were average. Most folks didn't get the pre-sale. The game is a challenge. I really do appreciate an MMO where crafting matters. Very few MMOs make crafting worth anything. In this one crafted armor is awesome and challenging. Crafting and harvesting can mean life or death for a city. 

(IMHO Most MMOs failed at crafting. Crafted gear should always be better than dungeon, and raid etc. You shouldn't get the best gear from a fight. Realistically the gear you would get would be in tatters after you beat the crap out of the boss. Now, having a high enough crafting skill should let you deconstruct destroyed armor and make a recipe for it. Dungeons and Raids should drop recipes, mats, lore, etc., not push someone to OP)

So yes, there is a grind because crafting and harvesting matters. Quests from factions and the town work with the grind so you're at least getting something other than mats out of it. The area perks are nice and I do enjoy the story. The music is calming and skills matter. A lot of thought went into the game. There's a current debate over mounts being added. Personally I don't think they're needed. A few more of the warping shrines would be good though.

UPDATE 2.24.24

Still stand by my initial post. The game has only improved. Mounts have been added as well as the flail. It's very hard for me to be bored with the game. Crafting is still essential. (One of the main reasons I'm loyal.)",1635393810,1708789873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, launch day even after all the bugs (that i personally didnt suffer much), the bots all the normal problems mmorpgs get. It was the most fun i had in a launch day i ever had, i've met so many players in my company that even after everyone stoppedd playing or changed servers i still remember their names.

The fresh server roll around, i went in with a no dedication to it in mind, did enjoy it not has much has the launch it self but the leveling experience improved greatly.

Personal pros and cons:
- Combat: i love the combat in this game it feels active and rewarding the hitboxes and register hits can be a bit hiffy with aoe melee stuff but overall i love the combat and its one of the main attractions for me
- Crafting system - crafting in mmorpgs and grinding the resources always been appealing to me and hitting all the caps its rewarding for me. But i know full well that for most people it just feels like a grocery list 
- Open world - this game is beautiful sometimes i just look at some POI's when the light hits just right! Even brimstone that i didnt enjoy earlier on because its desert and not my thing is growing on me the more time i spend on it
- Weapon System - the way you can mix match weapons that scale on the same attribute open up a lot of different builds that you can have fun with

Cons:
- Late Game: not a problem for me but i recognize how most people see it, theres a lack of stuff to do besides either PvP like races, opr, arenas (that got absolutly nerfed to shit coz the devs want to push OPR since its getting mounts in season 5), and wars if you get a good company and get into one. Oh and chest runs that can be get boring if you do them daily but hey you can get cool stuff to make gold from them so thats something riiiiggghht??
- Gearing late game - BIS items can be a bitch to get either from a crafting perspective or buying, anyways requires some sort of farming and changing builds can be expensive too so get a good feel for all the weapons the game has before commiting 

TLDR you like grinding and some action packed pvp with a good company on discord? go for it, i have the most fun when im just fooling around with my company mates
If you get bored of repetite tasks or playing the same popular pvp mode that is OPR (20v20)

Eh already bored. Played 500 hours of season 3 and had my fun. Season 4 was enough for me though. They can't even make a new PvP mode/map after 2 years, that's how piss-poor this development team is. OPR is only so fun before it gets repetitive and stale. They nerfed 3v3s to the point of barely popping anymore. Don't get me started on bugs that are still around since launch days...

Found a great bunch of people to play with and love running around the world doing everything- PvP, PvE, gathering, etc. Newest update added influence races for territories which has revived open world PvP. Hopefully they'll add new OPR and arena maps soon. Mounts are fantastic. Would like to see more frequent updates like Angry Earth but still, game is super fun even with occasional desync and bugs.

[h3]EDIT after 501 hrs and it's Feb 2024:[/h3] No longer recommend this game. Has great bones and exceptionally fun combat but the devs are completely inept- almost as if they don't even play their own game. Making sweeping updates to combat when it takes weeks or months (depending on how much you play) to grind and/or craft gear does not respect the player's time; you could spend a month trying to get a specific piece of gear/wep to drop and they overnerf a single ability, rendering your entire set useless. They nerf already under-performing weapons yet ignored overpowered weapons. They've completely ignored the PvP crowd which is weird as it's a huge part of the game. There are two modes, 3v3 and OPR, neither which have had new maps/modes released and there's no PvP roadmap so who knows. The faction system encourages factions to simp for each other- green teams up with yellow, purp is outnumbered and vise versa which IS NOT FUN in open-world combat. No skirmish system for wars so good luck experiencing that aspect of PvP if you're not part of a larger company. Most of the servers are dominated by gold-buying/selling war loggers who don't even play regularly, they just log on for wars to continue their long, long reign on the server; it's very difficult for other companies, if they're not also war loggers, to challenge them as they have so much gold built up they can BiS gear their entire roster and any mercs who fight for them. They will pay the best PvP players in the other factions to switch, making both war and open-world PvP extremely one-sided and boring.

I played on server Aaru and created a rule for myself to only block farmbots. After 3 months my blocked list is 103 accounts big.

Played this game for nearly 4 months straight. No bots were banned. Learned about people that do RealMoneyTrade in this game (so I got my answer as to why there are so many bots around).

Beware before buying this game. It has no real endgame. Some people will claim ""pvp is endgame"" which would completely invalidate the need of trade skills & dungeons.

The ""endgame"" in New World contains two things
- Mutated Dungeons
- Elite Chest Runs

Most of the ""Best In Slot"" gear is craftable or timegated bought items (you can upgrade named items with 3 chromatic seals that you can buy for in-game currency - 1 per day). You rarely get BiS gear out of dungeons, pvp or Elite Chest runs

If you plan to craft your own items buckle up for a senseless grind against bots because all ressources are globally shared.
And bots is not the problem, there are even people that afk-autoscript farm certain ressources for days

the final point that got me to quit this game is that in the 4 months i was playing the only thing they added to the game was 1 dungeon and one season quest which they will now recycle as content for the next season.
They remodel the Season Quest, make it more difficult and add 10 players only. that it. the drops from that boss are meh at best. 

If you rly want to have a lot of fun in the game you need to spend a lot of time in it bcus crafting endgame items is timegated aswell (daily cooldowns) or you can buy endgame materials from the auction house that is fubar bcus of botting. 
Nearly all materials that are not included in the DLC are worth nothing and endgame materials have inflated prices which gets people to RMT...

 - Rampant duping exploits ruined the in game economy (they have fixed about 10 different dupe exploits by now but there are still plenty in the game). Dupers got a slap on the wrist with 24 hour bans. 
  - Nerfs to increase the XP grind were applied to new players but not people who already leveled. 
  - PVP wars being won through exploits like dragging your game around in windowed mode to make yourself invincible. Or mass reporting the enemy team to trigger instant automatic bans (this is after the devs promised that all bans were manually reviewed and carefully applied. lol). Or the lag exploits that make you invincible to damage by spamming AOE spells. Or the getting out of spawn early before the timer ends exploit. 
  - Dev team constantly puts out patches that they didn't think through, only to reverse them later, while introducing new bugs in the process. 
  - AGS is unable to deal with bots so they do things like nerf fishing profession until it's useless.

I can recommend if you are interested in exploring a really great looking environment, enjoy crafting, can enjoy ""the journey"" to quote an old WOW streamer or if you are a PVPer. There is no monthly sub so it's worth trying and you should do so sooner rather than later as the dwindling server populations will likely convince Amazon to kill off the game before too much longer. For the record, I'd really like to see them turn it around and succeed but it definitely feels like a sinking ship.

The good/bad:

The good:
- The graphics as far as landscapes are great, especially for an MMO and obviously a lot of time and money went into creating those landscapes. 

- The sounds are fantastic, chopping a tree, mining ore and bard music all sounds really good. Zone music is average.

-The leveling experience is good yet confusing at times, probably my favorite part of the game.

- The voice acting is well done though simple.

- Gathering professions are actually a little bit fun, still a grind but it's interesting that the trees fall down and bushes disappear... and respawn shortly after. But a nice touch none the less.

- Melee feels strong, which is odd for a game with magic and guns. But I like having the choice to go that route.

- Jump puzzles are interesting

CONS:

-Plenty of Ocean, lakes and rivers but no swimming?!?! who the hell decided THAT was a good idea?

-Only 3 character slots...WHY?

- The character creation portion of the game is very limited. Probably the worst I've seen in a major MMO in 20 years? You are able to select from two body types (basic male\female). There are about 20 preset faces most of which look weird with eyes too close together, cross eyed and other odd proportions, none of which can be changed. They have around 20 awful hairstyles to choose from, picking one is like picking which president to vote for... which is the least awful. Facial hair is pretty good, they look better than most other games. Eye colors have a decent variety and some odd choices like purple. Skin colors are snow white, various shades of jaundice yellow and a couple each for brown and midnight black. Lastly you can choose from around 5 scars and accessories but half of them you cant see.

- Jumping is really not jumping, it's hopping or maybe skipping.

- New players seem to be shunned by a lot of level gated content, some is the standard dungeons and such but ""seasons"" which are similar to holiday events are oddly level gated.

- Not enough weapon choices for a game that puts so much emphasis on active combat. I went into the game thinking i wanted to play a samurai but quickly found out I was stuck with whatever they gave me (sword and board) I thought ok maybe later but alas, no dual wielding? There went my next idea for a back stabbing rogue... Finally I decided to try a cleric or paladin type. That also didn't work out well as I had to constantly switch weapons to be able to heal. I eventually settled on letting the game's RNG decide what my playstyle should be and that worked out better.

-EVERY name you've ever used, thought of using or could possibly consider using, is taken. Trust me, I've tried several different languages, spellings etc. and the only way to get a name you can deal with is to have either a surname or put random characters in your name. This goes for character names and company(guild) names.

- I have seen very little gear in the game that I like, you'll ALWAYS look like a dumpster fire. So if you like looking good, too bad, you can't even buy decent looking gear.

- combat is annoying as hell. One issue with combat is if there is a height difference between you and your target (fighting on a hill) you will miss point blank many times. doesn't matter if its a sword or a staff or whatever.
a. You fire off a shot at range, better hope they dont move because if they do you'll miss because the projectiles are so slow. 
b. One weapon that is fun to use, the blunderbuss, it's effective and useful. 
c. Staves are barely useful, life staff is ok at healing but that's it. Fire mage archetype doesn't feel like a glass cannon, more like a glass peashooter that sounds really cool, for example.
e. Use the musket to shoot a deer in the head? You better be prepared to do it 20 more times since the damage is so low.

- Pointless 10% XP buff for leveling while flagged for PVP. Just means you'll be ganked by players 30 levels higher than you, nothing competitive or interesting. Purely a open world PVP issue but toxic and brings a deja vu feeling from many other failed games.

- Artifact weapons locked behind 100s of hours of PVP, the only artifact healing staff is locked behind PVP AND the RNG devil.",1705343188,1708229008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]Congrats to Amazon Games for finally releasing them 1st game soul like/action combat mmorpg game placed in the early 16th century with the discovery of New World/America. I wasn't into DarkSouls games so i'm glad there is a mmo of the action combat genre now (which is greater combat btw, not boring).  [b]Working hard while having fun & make history[/b] should be everyone motto but sadly they are not leaded by them own motto...[/i]

[b][i]Game uses EAC which is horrible, wish that AG didn't add this trash to them game especially when the bots & cheaters still lurking the game 3 years later.[/i][/b]

[b][i]IN GAME SUPPORT: nonexistent, there is no petition/ticket support/live support in case you encounter a bug, glitch & need a GM help to fix a item/mission/progress.[/i][/b]

[b]✓︎ Chat:[/b] modern design
- not possible to create custom channels.
- can't close PM tabs & can't disable chat bubbles.

[b]✓︎ Appearance:[/b] characters looking bad, a default body type with few potato ugly head presets, no full customization, no sliders, no full colors palette.
- cant customise character, towns do not have barbershops.
- no First person view, can't zoom in completely.
- can't hide the gear (only the headwear). No tick option to chose if to display the weapons or not.

[b]✓︎ HUD/UI/menu:[/b] one of the buggiest i've ever seen.
- cant resize, relocate, hide hud elements & can't disable the in game popup notifications and achievements which are bugged since BETA.
- Store: remove the ""limited items"", make them permanent, no one fomo for fugly outfits.
- Trading post: no search option for own inventory selling items.
- MAP: can't add saved custom markers & no coordonates.

[b]✓︎ Inventory:[/b]
[i]+ enough space: every town have own storage, 3 houses storage & 3 inventory bags.
+ encumbered status: can exceed the inventory limit but you get penalized: cannot run, dodge, jump & use abilities.
- No custom inventory space can be created which make the inventory a total mess.
- can't access inventory when farming (mining, cutting trees, gathering, fishing) & when in the water.[/i]

[b]✓︎ World exploration:[/b]
[i]+ beautiful detailed areas with amazing lighting & sounds.[/i]

[b]✓︎ Movement, travel:[/b]
[i]- CAN'T SWIM (even 20y ago the mmo's had swimming).
- CAN'T CLIMB (jumping is not climbing, see Conan Exiles).
- for teleportation around the map (towns & shrines) need to be in another town/shrine to can teleport (it's so dumb, just let the players to teleport from wherever they are on the map without forcing them walk so much. 1M+ players left only because of the running simulator issue).[/i]

[b]✓︎ Combat:[/b] 
[i]+ great combat with awesome abilities & animations (but still need to be balanced).
+ i'm glad there is no forced tab-lock target combat & bunch of smashing buttons rotation like in old-classic mmo's.
- no option to hide the combat numbers.[/i]

[b]✓︎ Missions:[/b]
[i]+ not filled with cinematics, which actually is more immersive to talk facetoface with npc.
- mission/quest completion reports need to be delivered-completed when the mission is done, without to force the players to walk all over the map back to the quest giver to finish it.
- sabotage & investigating missions would be awesome, solving puzzles & looking for clues is mandatory on a mysterious island.[/i]

[b]✓︎ Dungeons aka Expeditions:[/b]
+ great detailed areas but with reskined & oversized enemies.
- can't summon players inside the dungeon, have to walk all the way to the dungeon location to get inside & then have to walk all the way to the players actual location-progress inside the dungeon instead to put you at them last unlocked shrine.

[b]✓︎ PvP:  filled with cheaters[/b]
- pvp matches: roll over the other team or getting rolled, no custom matches, it's a completely mess.
- exploiters & cheaters are not getting banned, even reported them with video proofs & they still in game cheating & exploiting freely.
- played other similar pvp games with battlegrounds & there was at least 5 kind of matches, 20 years later from AG i expected more especially when it was advertised at first as a sandbox pure PVP game.",1632761490,1708111984,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Played at launch, had ridiculous queue times and the game seemed sort of half baked. Now I've given it a second chance with Angry Earth out and the game seems to be in a good place.

There's generally people running around, especially in towns, and the chat seems quite alive. 

Gameplay is fun and a nice change of pace from the usual tab target MMO stuff. Life skills are great and fun to use in an almost Runescape like way. Combat is quick and doesn't feature 20 buttons to press for skills which to me is a nice change of pace. It's a pretty if not demanding game, so not sure how optimized it would be on lower settings. 

Definitely worth checking out, and I do recommend you get Angry Earth as well. Wait for a sale if you're hesitant but Angry Earth will give you a mount at level 25 and it's rather handy. ",1632965288,1708078321,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

But, the faction part of the game can become unbalanced so a server with a medium population is required. Servers can lag and the server management is so-so. 

The game is good (PVE) till level 60 (it doesn't take long) then it becomes an insipid gear & craft grind. Past 60 you'll find players running ecr's where a mob of players rush through elite zones easily killing all the bosses; it's a silly loot binge. When playing solo you'll have to endure being mobbed by NPC. There's PVP as an end game but it's dreadful. The ability to connect with other players is poor & companies are basically useless. Expedition runs lack participation. The game is unbalanced (weapons/armor) & it lacks focus (crafting). The lore is boring. There are too many key features that need improvement or revision.

After three playthroughs (I gave it a chance) it's a 2/10. Ignore the developer's glossy & very misleading advertising trailers, this is a mediocre game & too many poor development decisions caused player numbers to plummet. The business model relies on cash grabs via a season pass & questionable DLC's. My harshest criticism; all those associated with the development of this game should reconsider their career choice.

New World, with its promising premise and visually stunning landscapes, falls short of delivering a truly captivating gaming experience. While the graphics are impressive, the overall gameplay feels dull and uninspired, leaving players yearning for more substance.

The Good:

Visual Splendor: Undoubtedly, New World boasts breathtaking visuals. The game's environments are beautifully crafted, with detailed landscapes, dynamic weather effects, and realistic character models. It succeeds in creating an aesthetically pleasing world that draws players in.

Solid Combat Mechanics: The combat system in New World is decent, offering a mix of ranged and melee engagements. The variety of weapons and the real-time action contribute to engaging encounters, adding a layer of excitement to the gameplay.

The Not-So-Good:

Lackluster Quest Design: Despite the visually stunning backdrop, the quests in New World often feel uninspired and repetitive. The narrative lacks depth, and players might find themselves going through the motions without a strong sense of purpose or motivation.

Monotonous Progression: The game's progression system feels monotonous, with a lack of innovation in character development and skill acquisition. The grind becomes more of a chore than an enjoyable journey, and the excitement of leveling up diminishes quickly.

Limited Endgame Content: New World struggles to provide compelling endgame content. Once players reach the higher levels, the lack of meaningful activities or challenges may lead to a sense of emptiness and a lack of long-term motivation.

Uninspired Crafting System: While crafting is a significant aspect of the game, the system lacks the depth and complexity found in other MMOs. Crafting feels more like a checklist than a strategic and engaging aspect of gameplay.

Conclusion:

New World succeeds in creating a visually impressive world, but the lack of innovation in quest design, progression mechanics, and endgame content results in a game that falls short of its potential. While there are moments of excitement in combat, the overall experience feels dull and lacks the spark needed to keep players invested for the long haul. As it stands, New World is a beautiful but somewhat hollow gaming experience, leaving players craving more substance and innovation.",1708048702,1708048702,False,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I took my leveling experience as a way to gatekeep maps. Once I maxed out and hit 65, the world was opened to me. Was it easier? Sure, some areas became jokes but theres still the tradeskills to level. The areas and some quests are useful for unlocking things and gathering materials. 

Lets not forget about  the weapon skills too. Sure, they only go to level 20, but a lot of them are fun. Who cares if its meta if your doing PvE. Find a company or a group of friends you can do stuff with, Its not hard. 

From my experience, every weapon is viable in the hands of a skilled user. I've seen weird builds work really well. It comes down to your perks and people don't get that. 

For PvP, things scale differently sometimes. I like PvPing, I use a musket trap build with an ice gauntlet. It works. Sure, its not meta or anything but its fun and I like it. 

If you're going to take anything away from this review, take this;

1. The devs do seem to care even a tiny bit, the game has improved after all and they take feedback seriously.
2. Play the game however you want. Don't worry about what Joe Rando (heh if you know you know >;]) is doing and use and do whatever you want. 
3. Make friends, Get out of global chat and talk to a company. Join one. Don't Be afraid of factions. Its only a 3 month time dedication. Who cares. Be nice to others and they will be nice to you.

Graphics are okay, optimization is less than stellar. If you have the recommended settings, you can run 60 fps maybe 70% of the time. There's random lag spikes that occur, but without any trend I could figure out. Doesn't seem more or less common despite whether or not I'm in a populated area, in combat, in a new zone, or even consistent timing between spikes.

Once you get to the mid-levels you start to notice the classic gatekeeping paywalls of modern day gaming. Pay $40 for the game and only get 1/4 of the content. Mounts, max level, new areas, classes... Amazon demands a sacrifice first. 

End-game may as well not exist unless you feed amazon their money, and then you start to realize that there isn't much fun in the game regardless, unless you absolutely love New World's style of PvP.

I never thought i'd be that type of person to push the ""this game is dying"" mantra but Numbers don't lie, towns feel mostly empty even at peak times, a shadow of a former life  - For reference: https://steamcharts.com/app/1063730#6m

New world has some nice things going for it, but with little in the way of new pvp content & pve endgame content (not including new dungeons) going on 3 years after launch its now VERY repetitive.

Wars are bland & not really wars.. 50 players is a skirmish not a war & you'll often find even if you sign up you wont get chosen regardless of experience, mostly top players in certain clans 

Open world mass pvp very underwhelming with player caps in effect (if vicinity cap is exceeded players are teleported away)

Outpost rush still no new map only 1.

Feels like PVP has been abandoned, which is odd being that the games premise is about clans vying for control over contested territory. 

With this info in mind i'd strongly reevaluate whether this game is worth your money & time investment, if pvp is your jam don't bother you'll just end up writing a negative review & becoming irritated with the dev, pve on the other hand is somewhat enjoyable but there isn't much in the way of Endgame activities, all content after level 65 just bottoms out.",1666120267,1707763698,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The player count has fallen immensely, and I frankly don't see the game surviving many more years, so I can't get myself to invest any more time into it. It's sad, but it happens.

It's 40 euros for the game and an extra 30 for the dlc - the dlc only includes another tiny quest area and a basic mount with some challenges for the horse. Also, it's an extra 20 to 25 euros to buy a more cooler looking mount, it's about 20 to 25 euros to pay for a costume - and they're awful looking. The store shop is very expensive and if there were no problems or lags with the game I wouldn't mind so much. The gameplay itself and the classes are great and the graphics look amazing I have to say. The mobs are a lot more intelligent too and can dodge better than other mobs in other online games. Dungeons look pretty good but they're not popular. The hair colour shades just don't match at all. White hair looks grey a lot of the time. Light Blonde hair looks a sort of very light green. The bad character customization I can put up with, but the lag spikes is something else for a game that cost me 70 euros. As I said, I've bought loads of games via steam and all that, and this is the very first game I paid for, that has lag spikes. Well I've wasted 70 euros so I just hope they'll fix those spikes.

The janky animation was really a turn-off and game is not really that optimized to run smoothly every update is a hit and miss on performance. The game was heavily dependent on multiplayer content so, when player base goes down, then interest of staying players will also follow the trend.

I liked it at the beginning, it was fun to play, the progression and getting into max level (Lv. 65 as time of writing), Amazon games really did a good job on the environment graphics and ambient and also the life skills/life professions (Gathering and Crafting) which is really satisfying and it's the reason why I kept coming back on this game and play it.

However, on recent updates you will notice that the game feels like it's on life-support now. Repeated events, unsatisfying rewards from Season Pass and much more that makes it boring. Majority of the Cosmetics (Costumes) design are so awful. 
2024 and no swimming animation, (there must be a lore hidden in the game that prevents them from swimming). Some boss fights are hard for just the sake of being hard - no fun involved.

I bought this game because it wasn't supposed to be runescape or world of warcraft but now combat feels like its catered to those that complain about their poor coordination. 

the latest DLC is a farce. they took a spot of land that came with the game. blocked off access and are now selling it back. with 3 new enemy variants that have somewhat new animations, the gorilla, the elephant and the chameleon. the rest are copy paste reskins with vaguely new animations. even the newest frost boss is lazerous now on a spinny chair acting like he is the drummer for led zeppelin without the rhythm.

the mounts are the biggest sales pitch for the game in the sense that they at least make the most intensely mind numbing missions pass by a bit faster. they dont bother to fix their side missions or faction missions any bit more fun but now you can do them 1.5x to 1.75x faster.

every event is plagued with a train of players that hit the world bosses and zap its health down in less than 5 seconds which makes not having the DLC near impossible to fight and get rewards for unless you camp the spawn point and you might be able to participate one every hour or so. even then, if you dont have the DLC, your competing with level 65s that deal way more damage than you, so good luck if you want to get any reward if and when you do get to fight the boss.

The current DLC will be worth it by the time they are ready to sell the next DLC and have installed enough updates to make enough additional content to justify its price most likely but even then, at the end of the day, your a pirate or privateer with no boat that cant swim. your an ice mage that cant freeze water to make an ice bridge. your a warrior with a warhammer that cant bust down walls, your an archer that cant light a building on fire. your a swordsmen that cant deface the enemy banners and no, you are never a rogue. that is not in the game. you are either high enough level that the hostile wild life wont attack unless you kiss their nose or they wont want anything to do with you or your low enough that everything looks at you like a cat toy.",1633074528,1707341940,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat was interesting and varied but there were quite a few bugs that could exploited. But once gathering and crafting got tedious, the game lost most of its charm. I stopped playing for a year or so and came back to see a premium currency to go along with a paid expansion to get mounts and an in-game store. For a $55 game. Fine, lots of games do the in-game store for premium skins. Well this also includes transmogs of existing skins. If I want to change up the skin of the item I'm wearing, I have to buy marks. The smallest quantity I can buy is 5,000 marks. for 6.99. It takes 2,500 to unlock the skin of one item. Not a premium skin, any style you find in game. You can only unlock these skins by buying them, or the Free Season Pass Rewards Track. 1 Transmog Token can be earned at Level 15, Level 50, and Level 100 for a total of 3 Transmog Tokens. That seems crazy low considering how many armour and weapon skins are in the game. I like to change up my style often but I'm not going to pay to do so. I would hate if I unlocked a skin but it had clipping issues with other skins. These tokens need to be earn-able in game. There's also STILL no way to change your hair in the game. But guaranteed if they do, you'll have to pay real money for it. 

End game isn't here. There's not much to do and PVP is extremely unbalanced. I don't do PVP much but I got more than wrecked on multiple occasions because of the weapons I use. I use them because I have fun with them but in PVP I stood absolutely no chance because they aren't the meta and if you don't use the boring meta template then you're going to lose. PVE I was crushing everything around me but PVP I might as well lay down and accept death.

We finally got mounts, but also behind a $41 ""DLC"". So now something that should have been in the game, the devs said definitely won't be in the game, is in the game and we have to pay to use it. And you gain an advantage if you do so.

so 375 hours later, the fun has been sucked from this game.  Every activity is a chore. crafting takes literally hundreds of hours of boring work and i still cant make anything useful.  unless you have a clan that feeds you or are ok with 500+ hours to craft them don't bother.  you have to craft keys to run the dungeons and people are paying to get into teams, and you pay a lot. pvp has gotten rough due to desync issues and i pretty much don't play anymore and neither does my company.  I wanted this to be ""THE"" game for me but its just a grind with no reward.
At face value a new player will enjoy new world... that is until you peel back the proverbial onion and smell its rotten core.  the combat is awesome and both pvp and pve are pretty good minus desync in pvp.  this game offers a lot for people who like to grind , craft and casually fight stuff.  

the reason for the negative review is from the start the game only really rewarded the guilds that owned 2 of the cities,  while the rest of the cities cost money to maintain these 2 cities made millions a week. this caused a huge imbalance in haves and have-nots in pvp, and the auction house was ruined by the people in said guilds because money is no factor when every 2 hours you make as much as a player does in a month of  grinding. 

the worst part and nail in the coffin , they used to gate keep end game pve and players not in the super elite guilds had to be extorted for a slot in a raid they HAVE a key for.  

Finally and maybe my least favorite thing about this game is the way to increase your gear score and collect decent loot.... you join zergs of people many times randoms who then run in a giant loop opening chests and killing a boss here or there with 10x the ppl needed to do so, these groups are impersonal and leave you behind so if you have to pee good luck  its an all out endurance race to loot pixels while putting forth the least amount of effort possible.

Its shit again

EDIT: 
Its actually a great game now. They fixed nearly everything I disliked:
- Good Items from PvP
- no shard grind anymore, instead of M1-10 its M1-3 now
- no expertise anymore
- new push mechanics to declare war. Pushes are fun now
- cross Server OPR is very nice, instant qeue pop. WoW BGs take like 15 mins and you dont find any BGs at night. In new world you can play OPR (BGs) all night.
- The expansion is very nice, I love the themes. Chest runs are fast now.
- Gear Sets are finally in the game. They cost real money tho so keep that in mind.
- not a bug fest anymore
- good economy
- crafting isnt shit anymore
- you can change perks on named items, so its way easier to get BiS now

PvP feels like its been forgotten since launch, no new maps for OPR and balancing dose not exist. Charging for QOL Gear Sets is ridiculous. Every game has got a grind but in new world waiting for a node appear and then race to get it is not fun and probably one of the main reason people quit the game. these are just some examples, much more could be stated.

After having had a not so bad experience from Lost Ark I came in with an open mind. I kinda of wish I could give it a mixed review but since I have to choose it'll be a no.

- The game graphics are honestly subpar to whats being done these days, some might argue its a design style, personally I don't so
- Enemies are pretty boring, with a lack of attacks, animation.
- You will most see the same enemies over and over again.
- The combat is the most bland stuff I've ever seen in an MMORPG, cast fireballs for hours with 3 spells, 6 if you count the fact you have two weapons. This could work in some PVP game with something more dynamic but here it's just slow and annoying I feel like.
- The quest lines are confusing, I somehow got myself in an area that was 45-50 following the main quest line and doing the side quests at level 41.
- Expeditions, which are I'm assuming dungeons, are literally empty it took me hours to find a group and get in finally.
- Going from place A to place B is super slow, even with a mount, fast travel helps but it doesnt work with stuff you haven't seen yet, which I can somewhat understand.",1707059621,1707059621,False,2,1,0.504563271999359131,0,True,False,False

But this game blocks the player from doing this by literally not allowing you to farm a certain item for WEEKS until a certain dungeon is up again. Not to mention the ludicrous amount of money you need to purchase/upgrade gear to have a competent PvP build. Crafting is a fucking nightmare. To craft weapons and armor you need an item that costs and arm and a leg, that can only be bought ONCE PER DAY!

I get that this is an MMO, but holy shit! All of these mechanics are meant to get the player to come back constantly and slowly progress to getting their upgrades. But for people who just want to enjoy the game modes and not grind for a whole fucking month, it sucks ass.

There are bugs AGS refuses/can't fix for some reason. A ""minor"" one that's really annoying is the Magnify bug. It gets rid of a part of your stats until you repair or unequip and re-equip.

The one thing that makes me come back is the combat. The combat feels really good! But I mostly hate everything else. For that reason, I think I'm done. Time for an uninstall.",1703090534,1707030140,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Updated:Roughly 1000 hrs in man i really want to love this game but they make it so hard. Updates just take way to long, fixes just take way to long. The small server sizes cause servers to die quicker which causes mergers to occur faster. Even if you ignore those things the coding and engine this game runs on is just plagued with issues that they just can't fix and it will always have them; perfect example is the duping it was something that happen on release and is still and issue now it just happened recently and the TP had to be taken down. Cheaters, RMTing is not monitored at all in this game and gold is extremely important in this game due to crafting being the end game of gear for the majority of content so it makes the issue much worse. I know everyone loves to say oh the devs don't stop the bots so i have no choice but to RMT this is the same thing said over and over about bots. Guess what if you BAN players who RMT guess what happens; word gets around and people become afraid to buy gold which in turn kills the botters because they will have nobody to sell to. Not to mention the Meta has been Light Dex for months now and they have yet to do anything even though there have been thousands of complaints its actually a joke at this point.

Update: 2k Hours in and unfortunately i have a soft spot for this game but i really can't recommend it to anyone it would be wrong of me to do so. Positives they have made the leveling experience much better but still lacking they have put time into the MSQ but really nobody cares about it and that's not an opinion that's just most players because the MSQ is kind of all over the place and doesn't really have characters you will stick with except Isabella. Combat still the main point of this game its definitely not balanced but it is enjoyable and you can express skill but there are weapons that just simply outshine others at the moment so if you looking for a game like that don't expect it and they are ungodly slow to make any changes. They don't have dedicated pvp dev so the PVP is completely ignored and there has been no new PVP casual map in over 2 years if that proves my point even tho players have been begging and yelling at the top of there lungs. PVE is still extremely lack luster 1 Raid which honestly is debatable it should even be called a raid and nobody does it and its outdated already. The dungeons are very rudimentary they are nice aesthetically but the honeymoon phase of that ends extremely quickly once you have done the same dungeons multiple times. The War/Territory system in the game has been ignored which is the end game pvp and again players have been yelling to have changes and nothing lets put it this way its the end game pvp but only about 5-10% of the player population can join them and not because they are not fun but because they are player gated completely. So if you looking for a game to put thousands of hours into like myself i will save you the trouble i've done it for you and there is that copium that the devs will stop having smooth brains. If you are looking for a game to maybe get 200-300 hours out of it sure it will be fine you won't run into the issues weather it be balancing/tech/content that the long term players have run into but play this game more like a dark souls and move on after you achieved what you wanted. I will warn new players if you like doing dungeons at lower levels good luck this game is very lacking on new players most the player base have been longer term players. Unfortunately due to the many things i mentioned earlier this game has a serious issue retaining new players or just bringing them in. If you look at there own discord it is covered in negativity and if you look at reddit it is even worse. So yea TLDR short term game not for people who want a long term mmo its a buy play move on don't turn back sorta of game.

Pros
Graphics are great, very visually orientated
The ability to be any character you want, you are not bound to one specific design. 
From what time I have played it was a lot of fun
Cons:
I had the game for 3 days, had a blast then it just stopped playing. I will no longer launch. I have done every thing online and still cannot play anymore.
Customer service is unfortunately not helpful. They request information, and then do nothing to assist. I was suppose to get a response within 24 to 48 hours after 3 days I got nothing. They are aware of the issue but have failed to resolve the ability to launch the game.
So would I recommend to another, not at this point in time. There is no support, and with the price you pay it is frustrating to buy something and not be able to use it.

It easy to get started. Almost all games are that way. Then the developer makes you feel like a fish on a hook.  It is is much easier today, than it was to gain level when it was first launched.  It is much more polished today than when it first launched. 

After the first year, I stopped.  I had not involved myself with any of its war for several years.  A new player may find it interesting, as it is part of the selling point.  I myself find no values in it based on my own experience.  

What I do is loiter avoid making any time investment.  Which will be destroyed by the game developer with future changes.  This sentiment had been consistent across many years.  

Crafting system: I stopped investing time into it

Economy system: Pretty stupid how it is in its current state, with clunky interface and functionality.  A horrible way to suffer.

Game play:  Pretty fun in the aspect that you can enjoy some exploration with a group of people. 

pvp: stupid pretty pointless for me.  I had that perpetually turned off as well as never participate in any of the war.  Other still do, but I find the rewards lacking in meaning.  It seems to cater to people who has a desire to play bully, and New World provide like a softcore platform for bully to exercise their desires.  

PVE: OK-Good.  The pve part of this game, is very much run in a large circle.  How it accomplish this is, it offers awards for opening chests. Which are hidden around the map, guarded by monsters and boss.  Everyday, you will have different people organize a group run.  20 people or so just run in a large circle and open chest. 4 hours a day was what I was spending on running in circle looting chests.  Pretty low value game in my opinion.

Skins sales: Outside of making you pay for the game. They offer you ingame purchases.  I initially buy skins and stuff to enjoy the game more, and support the developer.  I had long since stopped.  They do not offer real advantages, but more cosmetics quality of life items.  I hate the art style, but the young kids seem to find it nice.  (I think 14years old is the target audience).  I am 45 so it is understandable.  I cannot support their focus on money.  They design the game and design the updates around making you  pay for these.  So in a way I felt cheated.  Like that time I paid for a tour if Korea, but it was basically 2 weeks of taking me to places to buy stuff, and putting with salesman.

The game maker: Before I bought the game, I understood Amazon to have the fund to do what it wants, and as long as you have never ending money--you cant lose.  My assessment after playing and having to deal with Amazon is as folllow.  Amazon is not your friend.  They look for every means to squeeze more money out of you.  The game is the bait and hook.  There's some balancing to monetizing peole's depravity like casino.  14 years old wouldnt understand how that is a bad thing.  Online game is not regulated by gambling commision so it has a free hand at getting children hooked on gambling.  If you understand the slot machines at the casino, then you can understand how the chest looting is very much a more fancy slot machine.  If you walk around las vegas, you can see how slot machines take up the most space.  It is simple, and effective at holding peolple's addiction.

As long as Amazon is behind a game: avoid it.  I had pre ordered Lost Ark, but simply did not play it after my experiences with Amazon.  100% of my time invested in my virtual life, is pretty much reset to zero.  Imagine working all your life, and have all your money, home, car, and asset erased after 20 years of working hard to build up your wealth and position in society.  Then have it done again.  and again.  ",1637430705,1706885924,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fact that the only options for queued PvP play are 3 v 3 or OPR and that they do not have a persistent zone, astounds me. Such immense loss of potential. PvP should be meaningful!!! 

The skills are sub-standard even when compared to MMORPGS of 10 plus years ago. The graphics are nice, the worlds okay. But in all this game disappointing on most major aspects.

-Some skills are not nearly as rewarding as others (hunting/logging)
-Some are not really balanced (cooking)

Mechs works well and are just the right amount of challenging. The crafting and gathering system is amazing and competitive plus the storage system is kinda cool and keeps you busy. 
My biggest issue is the spawn rate of mobs. At first it is great because respawn is fast. Then at higher levels it is just as fast, which creates issues when you just cleared an area around a boss and all the cleared mobs pop back up mid-fight. This turns a challenging game into several frustrating deaths and spending an hour trying to work around it. There is one instance of this during an MSQ that made me want to walk away from the game entirely. lvl 36 quest being done at lvl 46 and still far too difficult for casual players. I went from happy and excited about the game to angry and frustrated and resentful of the game in a matter of minutes. I have run into a few cases of this but this one MSQ has changed my outlook on the game. Even after finally getting past it and sleeping on my thoughts I still cannot get past how poorly done this one part it and how easy it would be to fix it.

Although many problems from launch have been fixed, there are still many bugs and other things that need some fixing. Particularly the controls. Not sure if its the wonky implementation of the controller but the controls will bug out and all the buttons will change. Only fix is to open up the map, and they go back to normal. Another annoying bug not fixed yet is the menu for items will not let you select crucial options like salvage quite often.

However there is some game here to keep you occupied for a bit with the PvP if you are into that, and the PvE quests littered throughout the beautiful landscape.  Still feels very mediocre though.

I can not wrap my head around paying $30USD to use a fkn mount. Thats INSANE. Something that should BE IN THE GAME ANYWAYS is locked behind a paywall. I already PAID for the game and now they want to charge a HEFTY $30 to unlock mounts. Thats WILD of the developers to DO seeing how dead this game ALREADY IS. I imagine that offering mounts would be a reason for players to return. Dont waste your time and money on this dog turd. LOTS of other better MMOs out there worth your time. This has stood the test of time and its VERY obvious that is just an Amazon cash grab.

The fighting mechanics can be fun. The PvE is a good time for a while until all your quests start getting spread out..... This would have been an amazing game had they not charged you to fast travel. You can only recall to one city at a time ONCE an hour. The homes are INCREDIBLY expensive and require quite a grind. If you wanted to PvP well that sucks because you have spend hundreds of hours leveling up getting gear to even be relevant in a pvp scene. This game is like 20% fun with fighting and antics and like 80% running.... There IS an autorun feature but no auto pathing. The game gets very dull very fast. One day youll just stop playing. Fast travel is INCREDIBLY restricted in the sense it costs a rare resource that can be obtained with $$$$$ We see what amazon tried to do here. AMAZING game but just really poor pay walls and poorly executed. Still a good time for a while though! :) Just not what I thought it was and not what everyone hyped it up to be. In fact all the people that were hyping it up have all stopped playing. Id call this game a cash grab....",1637725997,1706821621,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Basic parts of the game are locked behind group content that no one does, which leaves new players forever at a disadvantage to older players. (e.g. Artefacts that require group bosses or elite zones, heartrunes that require expeditions and no one does these and there is no group finder for this content) and to build a character strong enough to do some of this content solo requires specific artefacts which are locked behind the content you are trying to do and you aren't even able to do lower level expeditions solo because they require a minimum of 3 players.

2. Premades dominate PvP and devs refuse to fix this in fear of premade players leaving the game if they aren't free to dominate solo queuing players. Only one version of the main PvP mode which is so bad that for new players the best way to progress is to do PvE in the PvP map.

3. No group finder for group content and no one does this content anyway. The final part of the main story quest is in an expedition that no one does. So new players can't experience these which out significant time finding a group.

4. Constant inventory management that requires grinding rep to be able to buy a house to increase your bank size. You can't trade items between other characters on your account, so each character will need to grind out rep.

5. Poor quality transmog system designed to extract money from players. To unlock the transmog appearance for a single armour piece or weapon requires a transmog token which is expensive. Very few free transmog items. Dyes are single use only (and available in the cash shop).

6. Story is decent with some appropriately tough parts where you need to work out how to defeat a boss. Later story content after the original main story is better, and all parts can be done solo so they have fixed the problem with the main story requiring an expedition no one does. 

7. Character creation and design is basic, not a lot of options and very behind some of the modern MMOs. 

8. The world is interesting, although there is a derth of enemy designs. All enemies seem to be either wolves, undead (4 or 5 different versions), plant creatures, corrupted (like undead but red) and a few other animals like scorpions or bears. As you progress you are still seeing the same small number of enemy types, even up to the most recent content.

I had fun with the gathering aspect of it and working on trade skills. Unfortunately for me, as I continued to progress and see how the kind of day to do activities worked, it didn't seem all too bright. For instance, upon leveling to max level, you'll find out that the higher level dungeons (or mutations as this game puts it) is meaningless really... you just play for the sake of playing it because the gear (which is the next problem for me) can easily be bought on the auction house. You can just buy the best gear right off the AH. There's no sense of progression and is definitely the reason why a lot of players don't do the higher dungeons in the game which is a big aspect of any part of a PvE. Also, it became kind of pointless to level your trade skills up to craft your awesome end game gear because again, AH has everything you need.
     The PvP is pretty decent except for how everybody ""plays"" the pvp. As a lot of players have stated, the meta is for everyone to run around in heavy gear rolling around the ground... it's pretty damn funny. I try to envision the American Revolution with the red coats and patriots storming a battle field and they're all just rolling constantly on the floor avoiding musket fire. Anyway, it's a game I realize but the PvP is limited to one battleground that you can ""que"" for or you can join pre-made open world pvp groups, which is kind of limited to people who invest a lot of time in the game and have a social circle setup in the game. So you have to, as I've been told by other players, build a name for yourself with clans and other group organizers so you can join the open PvP sessions. I dunno, not my thing... I like to just jump on when I can and play right when I can and not be limited to my social status on the game. With that said, it is an MMO and it works for certain players and that's great. Not a great fit for me right now and the PvE seems to kind of be pointless with purchasing the best end game gear on the AH ( you basically beat the game at that point, no reason to complete other content or farm for anything unless you just like to play the game for the sake of just enjoying and playing the game, which works too).

Oh and one more criticism of the game I'd like to add, you have to buy transmog tokens with real money. I think there are certain events ""sometimes"" you can earn these... other than that, you're really just limited to having to spend real money so you can transmog your gear...definitely a penny pincher idea for the game to do this to the players.",1706735142,1706735362,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

I love this game i have met some amazing people along the way thru all of the good times and bad that AGS have put us all thru. 

From a Vetran that still plays on and off that has been in many wars both won and lost that has played thru all of the content.

Mounts should not be locked behind a Pay wall of the expansion sorry not sorry the game is not worth it just so you can get to the New max level and gain one territory with the tiny amount of content that it brings to the game.

The new Artifact gear is cool and opens up some fun builds for PvP and PvE alike. 
the daily cost of 5k a day and 15k a weak is absolutely Crazy tho and needs to be heavily nerfed. This just forces you to play every day just to farm for your dailys and just waste your time. further time gating Every players ability to get to the point where they could be Geared for war / PvP and have fun in the game.

If your looking to get this game prepare for a Grind like any other MMO some Aspects are worse some are better that others. 
alot of the grind we had in the begging with the senseless time gating due to 0 content besides wars and invasions has gotten better. fortunately for you new players your path from 1 to 65 are much easier shorter and have less buggs. 

From starting this game until you hit 65 however AGS has added virtually nothing for you to do. want to do pvp sure go ahead flag up and get wrecked by some random 65 in one shot maybe two. You have two options put your head down and quest to max or attempt to run a few dungeons here and there, And Farm mats leveling up your skills.

The Combat in this game Is engaging and fun with a high skill celing there are alot of different Intended and Unintended interactions sills can have/ give, so it takes time to fully grasp. PvP is were this shines, Some of the most fun i have had playing this game is Open World PVP just having fun with the frineds i have made thru this game. 

Classes You can play just about anything you want you can re-spec for gold and any time another feature that could be done away with or cost azoth not gold would be nice. however want to be a healer that rocks a Big Ass hammer as a secondary, Do it have fun you level up you weapons separate from your character, this leads to some really fun and interesting builds that can be good in all of the types of content   

End game Congratulations you made it to 65. hopefully you have been gathering ever thing you can get your grubby little paws on because everything is ither expensive or just not on the market dependent on your server. and if you want to take part in the end game content you will need Best in Slot or very close to it ;or you just will not be able to partake in wars, well at least wars that you don't just get farmed in because it a throw war and you will just get slaughtered endlessly. 
you can OPR now!! where you get thrown into a completely random BG with absolutely no balance attempt on AGS part at all... No q type for healer, tank dps, range, mage, none of that your ither on a team with 5 healers or 0 nothing you can do about it just afk farm wood to get your points and move on to the next. 
lastly Mutations a Almost Lazy attempt by AGS to give the game challenging content, however it takes almost no skill to do this content it just takes the correct gear, I can quite literary stick my 9 year old that has never played before on my toon in the correct gear and with a little time she could do it. what few Mechanics are in these doungeons do not change what so ever from the bosses/mobs in the instance. Just Annoying Dammage Modifiers and Pain in the Rear crap like if you dodge you take a de-buff that deals consistent damage or stuns you. Again however if you have the correct gear you can completely ignore this and dodge your life away and not die.... 
the only reason you run these dungeons is to get a in game currency to upgrade gear and a .0001% chance you get a good piece of gear that you can keep or sell. however the sell part is a joke because the the in-game economy is pretty much dead.

Invasions- Consistently seem to have some kind of annoying bug of some kind ranging from un noticible to game breaking dependent completely on how badly AGS messes up a update.(this is almost guaranteed to happen 99.9999999% of the time) these can be fun and will probably the only ""Exclusive"" content a fresh lvl 65 has a chance of getting into constantly. most of the Waring players find this content annoying and Tedious so they just don't do it. 

There are random events that sometimes include a open world raid boss and or the 1 constant open world raid boss

As of now Wars {98% are for the top 2% of the player base}, you can get there you can be in them just know it takes dedication unlike any other MMO that i have played to be able to be one of those players that are in Quality Wars that are Competitive. Not the top company's just the ok guys fighting the ok guys. if you want in with the big dogs you better know some one and be Dam good
---if you want to be in wars that's easy push a territory with 4 or more Friends spend the 5-15k of your Hard Earned money and get Slaughtered that's if you get the Declare from the 2 to 5 other company pushing for a Dec. 

 Overall this game is not Bad, it however is far from Great and AGS does not seem willing to make the Correct calls or to put in content at a faster pace,(that does not Break some part of the game) And provide more in-game late game content for every one to enjoy.
If there was more to do across the board aside for Arenas, OPR, Wars, Invasions and Expeditions (Aka Dungeons) and territory Races for your CHANCE to declare war. Than this Game would be doing better and i would be able to recommend it as a definite yes. However at this time if you don't have a bunch of friends playing or just want to punish yours self go for it i guess. I love the game But i Love the Game for what i Hoped and Wished it Could be The bones are here, but i just don't think that is going to happen any more.

Don't pour your entire life into a game and then trash it when you get bored of it. I have about 60 hours logged so far and I'm mid-level so I will give a beginners take. I haven't played an MMO since WoW and was looking for that MMO nostalgia in a newer game. This game really surprised me. It looks absolutely stunning. The combat system in my opinion is a little different but pretty fluid there is no auto targeting and knowing when to dodge or block an attack is essential. You really have to practice your keyboard/mouse manipulation but its pretty simple once you get a hang of the strike zones. If you're the type of player that likes crafting and collecting ingredients/materials this is the game for you. It's a little overwhelming at first the amount of stuff you can make and you can literally pick, chop, cut anything you come across in the wild. its a little overwhelming at first but after a day or so the system starts making sense. There's a bunch of other non-crafting skills you can improve, you can pick up an instrument and jam out similar to guitar-hero. But If you suck it definitely shows and people can hear when you screw up the notes so practice alone first LOL. 

As much as i like the game I have to say it feels empty sometimes. They really need to revamp the group system. If you want to raid or do dungeons you essentially wait in a lobby or create a lobby and wait for players to join. They really need to come up with a matchmaking system because it seems nigh impossible to ever find people to group with. But sadly i think a large contributor is that this game simply lacks the popularity of the big-name MMO's which is a shame because in my opinion they got so many things right with this game. I think with more content and tweaks this game could really be a huge competitor. Definitely worth the money.",1706622710,1706622710,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game was very enjoyable at first, I'm not gonna lie and I had great time with friends in the early days. The more I played, the more flaws this game was showing so here's the rent. 

Game wants to be an OpenWorld PVP,  but there's no point of running around in PVP. Usually players that are 'PVP On' don't want to fight, they instantly run away or trash talk you for killing them.

From what I understood, it's mostly the same companies that have all the territories but just on different account, because amazon games let them do so.

The game is filled with bugs, by experience, it took them 3 weeks to repair a Main Story Quest bug that was preventing people from doing the actual MSQ. Most companies would have got it fixed the same day, but not for AGS.

The endgame is poor, and has a lack entertainment. 
There's a ton of bots, but grats they are there to sell me the mats, because I had no intention on going around to collect the materiel to craft. 
There's no bank system, so if you got more than 500k on you and sell something, well you lose that money ! :D 

I uninstalled the game today, after a announcement of a new patch, there was no work made on the endgame.
Managers don't listen to their community. People have been asking for three years for a new map to do the OutpostRush. But they keep putting their attention on New Players and creating contents for them, which they didnt ask. 
Don't rent about anything in there discord channel, you might get banned. 

I invested a lot of time in this MMORPG, but I now feel like I'm wasting my time, I see no future for this game. So i got to go..

Good Game so far, Needs more servers to lower que times but over all really fun game 5 hours in one sitting. 6 hours on record when i first wrote this, hundred plus hours later still a really good game. Que times are fixed and the server merge helped payer populations! This is a really good MMO! I will say it does need something low level players can que for like a 3v3 thing for levels 10-19 20-29 -30-39 and so on! but its still a baby MMO and can not wait to see whats to come!
****Update*****
Que times are fixed. 3v3 added, Content for lower levels being added in as we speak! Cant wait to see what more is to come!
***Update****
620 hours into playing and I'm still not slowing down! All the problems I had in my first review have been solved. New stuff gets added almost every month! Constantly changing MMO no in game way to P2W, no monthly subscription, no character boosts, no Tab targeting. Basically if you enjoy a MMO where your journey starts are level 1 and not just end game this is the game! A lot to do at end game but everything you do/collect through level 1-59 matters like crafting mods, resource, and much more! Player housing is some of the best housing I have seen in a MMO including FF14/OSRS/WoW(Garrisons). I could go on and on about the good about this 40$(20-30$ on sale) game but some of the bad is no Raiding yet, so if you like BIG PVE Boss content that is not in the game yet, but as I said they are constantly updating the game. They need to add in Wars/Out Post Rush (BIG PVP BATTLES) for lower levels from 20-59 Currently you can only Que for BIG PVP battles at level 60 and they need to keep adding more unique quests that people can do to get to 60 some new ones are in the game but if you like quests they need to keep adding in unique quests.
***Update****
1800 hours into the game now. Season Pass has been added into the game. 40$ for a Game that I have gotten 1800 hours out of is 1000% worth it IMO. Lower Level content had been added and more is still on the way! 3v3 Que for lower levels now in the game! Just need OPR for levels 20-59 and All my complaints are being answered from my first review!

The ""expansion"" dropped. About a month ago. Hype has died down. Currently sitting at 32,505 players on Steam chart. I put ""Expansion"" in """" because it doesnt really feel like a ""Expansion"" but they're charging us for there mistakes. They said that they would go through each zone and ""revamp"" the MSQ and other Quests because they knew it wasnt good. But then they ""revamp"" a zone and call it an ""Expansion"" and charge us for it. I also think that Mounts should NOT have been locked behind the ""Expansion"" and that Mounts should be for everyone who buys the game. But honestly if they took out Mounts it would JUST be the Revamped zone that they would be charging for. Bottom line this should have been a Update and NOT a Paid Expansion.
(alot of people will say ""you want 2 years of ""Free"" content updates and NOT pay for anything?"" and to this i will say Look at Minecraft. Look at Valheim. Look at EFT. Look at ALL these other games that actually update and fix there game instead of charging the players for there mistakes.)

Content is VERY stale. Doing the SAME daily runs even after the ""expansion"" I do both PVE AND PVP content and the PVP content hasnt gotten anything new for a ACTUAL game mode in a LONG time. It needs capture the Flag, a NEW Domination map, just a new Game Mode. 3v3 is unplayable with cross server still not in the game for 3v3 and again needs a NEW map. PVE Content is fine. But its still bring running the same Dungeons OVER AND OVER because its the only NEW thing. Every time PVE content is added they NEED to add PVE content like a new GAME MODE or a NEW MAP.",1632874784,1706567305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, releasing something that is QOL an improvement for traveling faster and you lock it behind DLC. It's just a ridiculous display of money grubbing greed. Because they KNOW going into it, it's going to give an unfair advantage to those who have it vs those who don't. Thus, tipping the scales in the balance of the player base. What do I mean by that? Well now you have a pay to win advantage especially in PvP circumstances. If a group of individuals flagged for PvP and you're flagged for PvP run up on you, you can't escape. You can try to run but if they have mounts it's pointless. You're not escaping. They will just mount up and run you down. And this is just one example of the issues with directions they are moving in.

You could say ""well just don't flag for PvP"" okay well you're basically saying just don't play part of the game that you paid for. Which is ridiculous. There was another game that did this same thing with mounts, not long after it's player-base got so small it had to go from having a box price to play to free to play lol. I see this one going in the same direction.

honestly this game is not good, its like a 3.5/10.
the armor dye system is total dogshit.
the weapons are so boring to use, and have horrible skill designs.
the enemies are all the same looking skeletons.
getting materials for crafting is boring.
the 3 factions are all the same.
the story is so barebones it feels nonexistent and based on reading books around the world.

the game itself feels generic and like the devs were forced to make everything for low iq players

Great combat. Well-made world. So much to do that you could easily max-level five complete characters and still not have done every quest and activity. Tons of armor and outfits and weapons and other gear. Crafting is still a little grindy (nothing compared to how grindy it was at release), but there are TONS of other ways to get top-level gear. The low level fights quickly become easy, but higher level foes can kill you surprisingly fast with unexpected maneuvers and styles. Even at max level, a solo run through the main story will get your heart racing OFTEN. The story is well-written and voice actors really do a great job bringing their lines to life. The lore is interesting and very deep.

I think this game does not get as much attention as Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls, or Dragon Age, or Dragon's Dogma or any of the other greats of the genre because it was the first Amazon game, and people have a bit of an attitude.

But for an MMO, this is one of the best. Worlds are very busy with lots of players everywhere. Sometimes, during a solo run, you just happen to be headed the same way with the same agenda as another solo. I've had some truly glorious encounters with strangers where we never spoke a word but got the job done as a team before parting ways...each following a separate trail into the mist.

At the time of this review (321 hours of play), I still have several areas I have yet to enter even once. And as far as the many expeditions (group dungeons), I've barely dipped a toe in those waters. Finding a group for expedition runs seems fairly straightforward, but I have yet to try it much. It's a big game, and I haven't gotten into any of the DLC yet.

On top of all of this, lies the various options for PvP and large-group horde-defense modes. PvP can be everything from one-one duels with anyone you run into, to organized 3v3 battles in an arena. For those who want something larger-scale, there are PvP wars for control of the cities between in-game player factions. Another option is the invasion mode, which tasks a large group of high-level players with defending a central castle against a massive 8-wave army of the enemy.

As an added bonus, they have a season-pass system that is actually quite friendly to free-loaders like me. If you care to figure out how the whole system works for leveling your free season pass, you can level up all day every day if you like...completing quests to earn moves on a simple mini-game board.

Not happy with the cost of the DLC, still haven't purchased, hoping for a sale? Still like
to see a first person option. Proper SSD solves load times or hangs. Throwing a spear into the heads of enemies is oddly satisfying - still wouldn't recommend, but I hope that doesn't stop you if your curious, there are issues, but.. there can be some fun too.. that's up to you.
Steam really needs an 'on the fence' rating, that's what I'd change this too)

No and no.. just don't.  I'm gonna try the new stuff, odds are it's still no.  Will update

Partial Update:  I came to play, instead I'm spending a good amount of time looking at load screens.
The stuttering and choppy play (at times) is like no other game I've ever played. 
Revision: upped the resolution to 4k, lock sync to 60fps, there are times when moving or looking around it's not 60fps.

Update:  Well, there have been game play improvements. I've never been one for PvP, really into the PvE.  Still, can't sell items to a vendor, that was one of the biggest turn offs for me.

Update 2: I enjoy the crafting, I will not buy the DLC. One of the memories from release just revisited (roughly) - If another faction takes over the town, it can shut down or lower the crafting stations. I think initially we were forced to join a faction, now you're not. But why? Why should an opposite faction affect my game play when my PVP is 0% and I'm not part of 'any' faction?!

Update 3: Still, you'd think a company this big would solve their latency issues? Ever play Eve Online? Years ago they had issues, and solved them - biggest part was the hardware they were using - They run 1 server, for world wide population. For NW, I can be heading into higher population areas and the screen will just freeze, stops. Know what helps with the latency? Turning off the on screen global chat, switching to area. - revision, never mind, turning off global may not help, and, it shouldn't. I'm 10 minutes into a splash screen trying to teleport to another area.

Update 4: Again, optimization and high latency issues are a real problem here. When I click to play I want to 'play', instead I'm looking at load screens. There's no other multiple player game I own that takes this long to transition to a new area.

With that, I'm still a firm 'NO', expansion content cost more, latency is bad. I'm not running a potato, I work for the cable provider that has the service. I've built computers since the 90's, I know the difference between performance and latency. No vendor to sell loot, at all. Crafting, I do like, I do enjoy that. PVP controlled areas affect the ability to craft, even if you're not in any tribe.

Oh, one last thing. I deleted any characters I had and started a new one. Reached lvl 50, started at this review. Achievement at lvl 50, only 28.2% of players have reached that level. Game is just over 2 years old.. pretty clear it's got a niche set of clientele.

Update 4: So I don't have anything better to do, or, don't feel like it. So the performance issues are resolved but I had to move the game to an SSD. Now running into town full of others isn't an issue.. but still i7-11700KF, 32GB, ASUS Z590-V, RTX 3060 TI - Well over requirements. I'm playing with different weapons combos and just general goof'n off.

Just checked sys requirements, Disk read speed 2500 MB/s, that's 2.5Gb, I know an HDD can't even remotely do that. SSD installed tested @3600

(side note: really odd the low HDD reads seems like latency, Gibb slap for me.
If you run an SSD and have issues then you probably have a bottleneck causing problems. I try to educate folks in game but they get offended quickly. OH, I have an SSD.. okay, what gen? What's your computer specs (or model#).. )",1695527225,1706436850,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are many pro's to the game, but with pro's always comes a few con's. That is what I would like to talk about. Although at the moment I only have 17 hours on the game, I do not intend on stopping anytime soon and this is just what I've seen so far. I am planning on updating this as I progress farther in the game.

Pros: 
- Combat ; Silky smooth, great animations, doesn't get boring
- Graphics ; Beautiful. Words cannot describe how amazing the graphics are. Even on low graphics it feels like Ultra High 4k. 
- Resource Gathering ; Although some people do not like the gathering aspect of new world, I am quite fond of it. Its relaxing, enjoyable. On the flip side, it is extremely grindy.
- Open World ; New World is a massive open world. Different biomes, different monsters. The levels scale in each biome as well. 
- Crafting ; Something that you can do in New World is craft items, resources, weapons, almost anything. It makes gathering worth it. 
- Mobs ; The mobs are extremely diverse and the level's range. Each mob is different to its biomes with certain perks when skinning or fighting. 
- PvP & PvE ; PvE is New World's main focus. As I stated previously, the combat in this game is amazing and never seems to get boring. PvP is also great with a player being able to flag themselves for PvP when joining a faction.

Cons:
- Server Lag ; Server lag is a very big issue in my opinion. I can't seem to get below 70 to 80 ping whilst my ping sometimes skyrockets to 500 or more for an extended amount of time. I usually get good connection with the games I play. The Server lag makes it hard to enjoy the game sometimes. This is the biggest issue in my opinion. 
- Walking ; There is a lot of running in New World. Sometimes you spend more time running to do the quest, than actually doing it. Although there is fast travel, you can only fast travel so much and to a certain area. 
- Resource Gathering ; One of if not the most grindy thing in New World. You will spend hours upon hours mining or chopping down trees just to level up that skill a tiny bit. 
- Economy ; The economy is run by the players. Although the prices can seem a bit unfair, this issue is by far not to big of an issue seeing how it is cool to see the prices change for different items as the game progresses. 
- Questing ; Quests are extremely repetitive. It goes somewhat like, ""Run here. Kill these. Talk to this person. Collect this."" And you have to do that a lot. 

Overall, New World is an 8/10 game with a great focus on exploration, gathering, and combat. 

That is all I have so far. As stated previously I do plan on updating this list as time goes on. If you are looking to buy New World. I highly recommend it. As the game progresses it is sure to get better and better. I do believe it is worth $40 but I recommend buying it on sale as sometimes it can feel like a $20 game. Thank you for reading my review and have a great day.

I didnt expect much from the game, since the game was know to have some issues and the player count and stuff wasnt rly big anymore, but on sail I still want to try it! Now is the time to give and review and sadly prob also the last time I played this game, because I dont want to keep playing much anymore at this point ...
Heres a short summary of what I like and what I dislike about the game:

What I like:
+++ The game is very newbiw friendly, getting to know things and learning new stuff is very easy, I didnt have to google or watch a guide or anything the whole time while playing New World!
+++Graphic and soroundings look rly good I think, its also open world and you can pretty much go whereever u want
++ Like above, u can go explore however u want and find a lot of interesting spots I think, even tho some obviously repeat themselves in each region (like caves and stuff for example)
++ I rly like the crafting, this is what keept me playing in the first place, you can gather almost everything u see in this game and in the meanwhile level up you geathering skills
++ with this comes a great crafting system which allows you to craft armor/weapons and all combat related stuff u want and could need in leveling, which feels pretty good
++ the system releated to gathering and crafting is pretty cool, you level its but crafting/agthering more which then increases the stuff you can gather/craft, which I really liked!
+ The first dungeons I did seemed pretty good, also not to easy but challenging enough which gives hope for later dungeons

What I dislike and why I will stop playing:
--- This game is a running simulator. Whereever I go, I need to run over the whole map. The shrines, where you can port from shrine to shrine are so far form each other, you have to endlessly run and run and run, which is imo the biggest flaw of this game, it got me so enoyed because im gathering so much but im actually running 80% of the time and the rest I actally collect stuff ,very dreadful!!! 
---> this is also why you should buy the dlc, because then you can use mounts, maybe this improves the game but why would they make a system like that, that you have to pay MORE to just get a mount in the first palce??? I dont get it
- After coming from other MMOs like lost Ark or Eso or basicly any other MMO, I think the combat is not that good. You only have 3 skills per weapon (you have a total of 2 weapons) and it just doesnt seem like any skill is involved. You press your 3 skills, swap weapon, do your 3 skills, do 1-2 heavy/light attacks and then repeat. I tink the only skill that New World has is dodging at the right time, so u dont get staggered and dotn take dmg. I just think its not a great system and it doesnt rly feel good, you are imo def not playing New World for the combat ^^
- Gathering levels your skill lvl - Why is this a problem? Well once you gather, you gain pretty good exp, which then makes you overlevel for the sotry main quest, which you should do, which makes it even more boring, which is also not a good system imo

What they could fix imo to make the game a LOT better:
1: Give all players mounts, I dont care at all if dlc get cooler mounts and for example mounts that are twice as fast and none dlc placers, but pls give ppl the ability to move faster over the map. Im mindblowing that this isnt in the game already and even the dlc isnt out for that long I think ... I would rly love to know the reason for that!
2 and follow up to 1: If you dont do that, double or even tripple the amout of shrines over the WHOLE New World map, just do so much more shrines so you can port faster 
3: AND also just make ppl port to any shrine for Azoth, why only from shrine to shrine?? Its just enoying and a bad system imo ...
4: Make gathering an different system so you dont get level exp from that, but exp for itself with some cool rewards maybe, like maybe an Axe Skin for chopping a lot or something? Thats just a quick idea, give some nice rewards for that. Prob some ppl dont agree with it and they like to get exp from gathering, but I think its not good to mix that with questing and stuff, I think that should be sperate 
5. Make Gatherables respawn faster, expec ores, they are always on cooldown and its also rly anoying when you go to a spot, nothing is there and then you walk to the next spot and there is nothing there 2 ... Its painnnnn
6. Maybe better combat with +1 skill for each weapon, that just would be my preference but ya, I def think combat could get better somehow

Sadly there is some stuff I didnt experience yet like endgame, from wwhat I heard its dungeons and pvp, which I also dont know if it is a good idea to make pvp a main source for endgame because not everyone likes pvp, but ya, this was MY OPPINION on New World in 2024!!!

as someone who has played this game for a very long time and hoped the devs would continue to support its casual community and its die hard community, it saddens me to say that i no longer recommend this game because of these reasons.

1. time commitment.      the time you need to commit to this game to get to its current player base level is absurd. even after 1500 hours i still have things to collect and work on. the commitment ive had to this game over the years has taken me away from other games because of the time requirements. it felt like working on a battle pass in another game with such a time and resource sink that the game becomes the only thing you play.

2.  the resource sink.      the resources required to gather in game are absolutly absurd to get to the point as to where you can upgrade your artifacts, i understand they are the penultimate item of a build however if it takes most of the player base over a week to upgrade one item. then id consider that grind worse than warframe for the reason that each upgrade could be meaningless in a few days due to bugs and glitches in the game. not to mention if you wanted to get your usually 3 perk armor set up to max level and get back to running mutations again you need to not only spend the 3 cromatic seals to upgrade them (5k gold each) but you need the proper matrix and the other items to upgrade. this in my eyes is killing the casual community. 

3.  real world money.  the game at base is $40 from when i purchased it the new dlc is $30. round about a total of $70 doesnt sound bad being now a days prices on games for the ammount of content you get in the base game $40 is really good however to get up to the current player base's level you need to get the dlc which in my opinion adds 1/5th of the content that the base game comes with only to give you a slight bump in power and the ability to go back into the old content to try to earn something of value out of it. I.E. artifacts

4.   the community.  in the current state of the game on my server two of the three factions absolutely dominate the pvp and pve. being the one faction that is not one of the ruling ones sucks because its impossible to do almost anything open world because the nodes, named enemies, and loot spawn locations are always picked over and over farmed upon your arrival. this major imbalence in the factions has made the game impossible to get a community together in the first place unless your already going into one of the dominant factions then your going to have a misserable time doing almost anything in the game.


at the time of posting this review i can not recommend you get this game.

Many weapon damage stats cross over, so you can use a Fire Staff and a Shotgun. Or a Bow and a Spear. Without sacrificing damage. You get the idea. The main draw is smashing together 2 different weapons, juggling weapons so you never really get bored. Then choosing 1 of the 3 armor types changes the gameplay even more.

You can even put Elemental Gems into weapons that scales off Intelligence at a weaker but viable scale than using the proper main stat. So you wanna be a Fire Mage with a Hammer? Go for it. Bow and Ice Mage? Yep. So the main draw of making weapon combos is even bigger than you think! 

Unless you're a Healer. There's only 1 main healing weapon, the Life Staff. And 1 free off-healing weapon, Void Gauntlet. You have to buy the DLC to get the 2nd off-healing weapon, Flails. So despite being a very important end game class - and lacking in population compared to DPS - they don't really get to join in the weapon juggling fun.

That being said, I know I have over 400hrs in game so before the knockers try to attack me for that, the only reason I put so much time into is because a friend of mine was foolish enough to buy me the DLC for Christmas. I wish he'd bought me a pair of socks. At least the socks would've been useful.
The combat is absolutely woeful, you still get hit, even if you dodge because the animation has already plotted it's going to hit you. I can not tell you the amount of arrows or leap attacks I've watched back where the arrow or attack will turn 45 degrees with your dodge just so it can hit you. If you utilise a combat skill, you can't break the animation to dodge if you see an attack coming during the utilisation of said skill. There is no escaping it. You just have to hope you can take the hit & keep going, simple as that.
Speaking of dodge! It lacks in stamina, sure, you can get it up to 3 dodges with the right perks but if you use it all up you then need to wait for it to fully recharge before being able to utilise it again, not part way, not half way but fully recharge.
Now I'll move onto what I think is the biggest farce in the whole game, the parkour. The parkour is the most tragic parkour of any game I have ever played (& I'm old, so I've played a hell of a lot of games) For a game so heavily dependant on parkour it is really pathetically implemented.
The other big disappointment is the elite chests. Very underwhelming in their allocation of loot. From my experience (even with a high luck gear set) 90-95% of what you get from looting the elite chests is absolute trash also. You'll spend a lot of time deconstructing the trash to see if you actually found any gems. I've run innumerable ECR runs & very rarely get anything worthwhile from them. What do I do with a common chestpiece with a gear score of 700, I mean come on, be realistic. Why are we getting common items in high tier/elite areas.
All in all, the game looks great. The game plays like trash. The biggest positive this game has is the community. Great community in a poorly made game.

Three months prior to my posting this, a gamebreaking glitch has not been patched; predominantly effecting returning players.

1-Game looks good.
2-Running animation feels awkward.  I feel like the animation goes at 100 mph while my character moves like a snail.
3-They added mounts, but the ability to get one is behind a pay wall.  You have to buy the first expansion for $30 to get one.  The mount is barely faster than the run speed unmounted.  It gets better over time, but I'm not sure how long it takes.  Cooler mounts such as lions or wolves can't be obtained until you're a minimum level.
4-The price tag for the expansion is a bit much honestly.  They didn't add much.  if they plan to continue to charge $30 for one new zone, then I won't be inclined to buy them.  Everything I've read about the new expansion, other than the mount, says it sucks.
5-The addition of the ability to collect sheet music and play the guitar, mandolin, drums and upright bass is awesome.  I REALLY like this.  It's my favorite part of the game.  You can even play with other people.  The buffs you can get such as the ability to carry 100 more weight for 2 hours from the music is a nice touch.  There are other buffs as well.

The PvE is decent.  I will never PvP in this game.  I have yet to do any sort of group dungeon.  I do see complaints here and there about not being able to get a group for the first one.

Leveling up harvesting and crafting skills seems stupid easy so far.

I wish I could give this game a neutral recommendation, but since I can't, overall I'd say it's barely a thumbs up.",1633313458,1706024059,True,0,0,0.555137872695922852,0,True,False,False

Pros:
*You can look like Cpt. Jack Sparrow.

*Very nice nature locations, diverse, climatic.

*Encountered lag only twice and only for a moment. No crashes either while GFX drivers were up to date.

*Very good music (feels like inspirated by the feel of L2 music). And cool ability to play own music, even together.

*Combat system isn't bad, requires skill and some planning. Almost free respecs make choices unimportant since you can change them anytime.

*No P2W. Having to pay extra to get from lvl 60-65 and get a mount is actually better to pay full price in the start.

*Quite nice armors and weapons - everyone will find something to feel good in.
Dungeons (expeditions) are fun at 1st run, especially if the party is understrength.

*Quite big population, game feels alive (but seeing devs merging servers = playerbase is in decline).

Negatives:
*Faction concept (3 factions fighting endless war without a reason or perspective of winning) is STUPID. Lineage2 system was way better since it based only on guilds so it was more entertaining and realistic.

*Quests (both mandatory and optional) are TOTALLY STUPID. Made it to lvl 65 without reading ANYTHING and skipping ALL cutscenes. Just typical go to point A, then collect 8 items, then go to other NPC and so on.

*Most players ""speedrun"" everything. Man - it shall be fun to lurk in dungeons and feel the thrill! Speedrunning is like work, but actually you're only loosing time for nothing.

*Been on few ""sieges"" on Nysa server, Marauder faction. Haven't seen not a SINGLE PIECE of organisation, planning or communication in battle. Just running back and forth in groups. Yikes. Good for 6 year olds. 

*Cities are planned STUPIDLY without any logic. Without memorizing locations you will run searching all the time.

*Housing is useless since houses are shared with other ppl and nobody can see other's house. Their only purpose is to extend storage and give some buff.

*Castles are nonexistent, you got only forts - all similar to themselves.

*UI is mostly ok, but could need some improvements.

*Game throws useless armors/weapons at you all the time.

*If you find out you've landed on a server full of Turks - no way to change it wisely, because you might end up on russian populated server and need to wait 180 days.

*Game is like they ripped off something from every major MMO out there and put it in the Pirate/magical/barbarian/chivalry wonderland.

So if you're looking for a game to immerse yourself for years and do something interesting and satisfactory - this is not the right game. At least for an old warrior.",1705222893,1706008870,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People everywhere, desperate for some gaming kicks. Now, don't get me wrong, contrary to the buzzkill brigade, I was actually enjoying the leveling process. But let's face it, I'm the kind of bloke who grinds away in every game, so take my enthusiasm with a healthy dose of skepticism, yeah? :D

Cut to a few weeks later, and like many others, I waved the white flag. Bugs and exploits were raining down like a plague, and those duping escapades were the final nail in the coffin. I didn't sign up for a game where the market felt like a done deal.

Now, fast forward to a week ago, a mate of mine resurrects his New World odyssey and somehow convinces me to join the madness again. And would you believe it, I'm genuinely gobsmacked – in a good way! The servers got a facelift with a merge, packed to the digital rafters with players on the one we landed in (we can still hop around if we fancy, like game-hopping nomads). They're buzzing with activity! They've flipped the script on all the negatives in a way that I'm absolutely chuffed about. Most crucially, no more crafting keys for dungeon entry! (Or expeditions, if you want to be all official about it.) And guess what? All storages are accessible from every town, so no more absurd journeys lugging around your digital loot. Thank the gaming gods!

If you were vibing with the game at launch and had a soft spot for PvP, I'm giving you a big, fat recommendation to dive back in. You might just be as pleasantly surprised as I am. Cheers to that, my digital compadres!

Now, let's not sprinkle fairy dust on everything. There's still a bit of a downer – the developers seem to be moving at a pace slower than a sloth in a yoga class when it comes to improvements and new content. Sure, there are bugs, but from what I've bumped into, nothing that'll ruin your gaming day. Workarounds are the name of the game. All in all, though, the game's in a way better state than its debut, and credit where it's due.",1705914664,1705914664,True,34,4,0.706720292568206787,2,True,False,False

First things first, Aeternum, the world they've cooked up, is seriously impressive. Massive landscapes, beautiful scenery – it's a virtual playground. I found myself getting lost in the details, like how the weather changes and the sun sets. It's like stepping into a fantasy nature documentary.

Creating your character is a breeze, and there's plenty of room for personalization. As you go along, you'll run into different factions, each with their own stories. It adds a nice touch of drama and makes your journey feel like it's yours.

Combat is a big highlight. It's not your run-of-the-mill MMO click-fest. It's real-time, action-packed, and feels like you're actually doing something. There's a bunch of weapons and skills to play around with, so you can fight your way.

Crafting is a big deal here too. The crafting system has some depth to it, which I appreciate. Whether you're into forging weapons or mixing up potions, there's something for everyone.

What really grabbed me is the whole territory control thing. Player-run companies battling for regions? That's a game-changer. It brings a whole new level of drama to the world, and your actions actually matter. It's not just about you; it's about the community.

Now, let's keep it real – New World isn't flawless. There have been a few server hiccups and balancing issues, but the devs are on it. It's clear they're listening to the players, which is a good sign.

To sum it up, New World is a big, wild adventure. It's got the looks, the action, and this living, breathing world that's ready for exploration. Whether you're rolling solo or looking for a group, New World is carving out its place in the MMO scene, and it's worth checking out.

Now I'm actually able to play the game, but it's in such a sh*t state, I wish I never even tried to start it up in the first place. Within the first two hours I've encountered more bugs than there is under a mattress in the cheapest motel somewhere in Mississippi. That's not all, they actually want you to spend 20 pounds for additional 5 levels, remastered part of the map and a mount so you can finish additional 5-10 quests even faster, uninstall and forget about the game again for a year or two. If you don't buy this scam expansion you're literally left behind and you can forget about PVP, so yeah it's p2w DLC. Combining trophies into one so you can fit them all in your house costs 45k XD like we haven't grinded and spent hundreds of thousands on the trophies alone lol. End game? Yeah let's add additional 50 levels for each profession because apparently grinding to max level 200 wasn't bad enough :D

Exploring is pretty fun, I like the parkour segments. The world is easily the best part of the game (makes sense lol), so many of the environments, especially late-game, are stunning. Sometimes I just ride along the road looking around and listening to the OST. The expeditions are really cool from those I've done. They pose a decent challenge, especially with difficulty mutations, and running them with friends is a blast.

PvP is pretty fun, but usually conflicts are very one-sided. Not to say there aren't some close ones, I've had some really fun back-and-forth moments, especially in influence races (PvP events where factions can fight over territory).

Definitely worth picking up on a sale. Also worth grabbing if you just want a solid game with a vast world to explore.

List of other issues, lag in 3v3 pvp, lag in larger events.
Lag in cities with large number of people.
All the content is generally around 5 man or more dungeons/pvp which you might be unable to play. (and without dlc you will not be able to play it because no1 ques for normal dungeons only mutations which require dlc. So The end game is Mutations which you might be able to play and pvp which you might lag to much to do.

If you have a great computer and the game is on sale give it a go. The pvp can be fun and the mutations can be fun. It is worth 15 to 30 dollars, If you like quests there are alot and the campaign story telling is alot better than it was. They are things that copied from wow classic, but made it simpler or easier/more enjoyable like rested exp is much faster. Leveling up is not a grind.

Play the story, reach max level and your done - plays like a single player game... the only multiplayer aspect that people engage with are daily chest runs, and mindless event bosses. The life skilling is the worst I've ever seen. There's effectively only two dungeons available per weak and they're boring af and long af. The best designed dungeons aren't even for max level which out of the six total there are also only two of. 

It's incredible to me that this game can have such a massive and full world with descent combat and yet there's nothing to do in it. 

The pvp is bad, expected because it's mmo, it's just random team comps that decide which team wins, no one engages in 3v3.

I've found myself sinking more hours than I'd care to admit into the game, captivated by its intricate crafting systems, dynamic combat, and the allure of a player-driven economy. However, despite the substantial time invested, New World seems to struggle in finding its place within the MMO genre.

The game boasts a beautifully realized open world, teeming with both dangers and opportunities for exploration. The combat system is visceral and engaging, offering a refreshing departure from traditional MMO mechanics. Yet, it's in the broader aspects of the MMO experience where New World falls short. The endgame content feels somewhat lacking, and the progression system could use further refinement to keep players engaged in the long run.

While New World introduces intriguing concepts, it appears to grapple with establishing a distinct identity within the competitive MMO landscape. The constant updates and adjustments from the developers demonstrate a commitment to improvement, and the potential for greatness is evident. Despite its current shortcomings, New World is a title that holds promise, and I remain hopeful that future updates will elevate it to new heights within the MMO genre.",1632891868,1705747975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 (a) musket needs to be removed from the game, no nerfs just removed.
 (b) New maps have been begged for but none have come out although new dungeons keep showing up.
2. Crafting
 (a) there is tooooooo much of a grind to get to top level, such that when you get to top level you would rather eat an acid filled cactus than craft.
 (b) there are not enough nodes to farm if you can beat the bots to get them. 
3. Pay to Win
 (a) Any time you can find a gold farmer, buy gold then buy BiS (Best in Slot) gear, weapons etc instead of earning them is a pay to win.

Data issues usually speak to profound underlying problems in the code, bad exception handling practices, and generally sloppy development practices.

The new artifacts are a complete joke, allowing players to become almost invulnerable to many forms of damage. This means the long term players and people with deep pockets regularly crush newer ones, ruining the experience and any sabotaging any chance of a community.

As far as it being a deep MMO, as alleged in many of their promos, there is almost nothing social about playing the game. The only real ""social"" aspect is joining a company to gang-bang newbies or joining a group ""raid"" when 20-100 players follow the leader through strongholds to grab as much loot as possible.

The latest expansions are almost souls-like with their punishing bosses, unless you happen upon their weakness in which case you can almost phone it in, e.g. Mordred can be dispatched in about a minute with a rapier by simply standing next to him, constantly flurring and side-stepping when he tries to attack.

Why should anyone support a company that engineered a problem only to sell the solution?

Mounts should be included in the base game.

The group finder is still poorly designed, and this game is still missing a lot of basic things.

Just avoid this game.

TL:DR - Game is relatively mid.  Play with friends or make some [its really easy.  I've made some nice friends so far lol]  You can't get a mount unless you own the DLC and you need to be level 25 to use it.  So, Get it on a heavy sale if you /must/. [I purchased the game for roughly 30 USD which was the standard edition & included the newest DLC Angry Earth at the time of writing.  Install on SSD if you're buying it.  Combat is like Tera Online;  feels a bit like guild wars 2, tera online, wow, darkfall, mortal online.  It's a giant clusterfuck and I love/hate it. 

Bog Standard mmorpg in terms of story/questing.  Story is a whofuckingcares kind.  Sorry, its not that interactive or nice like in FFXIV where it draws you in.  It is voiced from what I can tell.  So, be ready for WoW questing with voice over unless you skip over stuff and youtube it later. The music playing & fishing is really fun.  Playing music with friends is like the good old days of guitar hero once again.  Genuinely my favorite part of the game.  I have spent about 10 hours doing nothing but playing music at a local tavern buffing people.  Ahh, the good old days of being an entertainer.... I miss you Star Wars Galaxies, my beloved.  May you rest in peace.

It just *feels* like an Amazon Game.  You can hear Jeff Bezoz laugh at you as you spend your money on this buggy game.  Always there.  Waiting...Watching.  Taking any opportunity to poach you of your wallet one way or another, and while its not pay to win [that I know of], some of these outfits that aren't premium kinda suck ass lol.  Hell, even on the premium shop theres only like... maybe 3 decent outfits.  Anyway, 

Cash shop prices [rl USD]:

20 bucks for a suit of armor skins
20 bucks for a mount skins
20 bucks for a set of weapon skins
20 bucks for tool skins
5 - 10 bucks for dyes

it adds up yaknow?



You can't sell stuff to vendors.  Only players via the AH. Better to salvage and craft your own shit than to sell

You can't swim, only walk on the ground underneath.  Apparently they will never add swimming, Yet there's a breath mechanic?

It appears like you can level everything on one character, though I might be wrong.  I'm not that far in [3 days at time of review] 

edit: I was wrong.  Min-max BB.  At least you have 3 character slots to fuck around and find out with.  And respeccing isn't /that/ expensive at max level [iirc its 500c when you're level 65.  I could be wrong, this could be changed.  idfk, i'm not there yet.  I'm going off of my guild mates and  unless you're like a guildie of mine who is never above 200 coin, you should always have more than enough for a respec.

New World, Amazon Game Studios' ambitious foray into the MMORPG genre, has finally arrived on Steam, and it brings with it a refreshing take on the genre with its blend of stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a unique setting.

Visually, New World is a feast for the eyes. The Aeternum, the mysterious and beautiful land in which the game is set, is meticulously crafted with lush landscapes, diverse biomes, and a vibrant color palette. The attention to detail in both character design and environmental elements is commendable, creating a world that feels both fantastical and immersive.

The gameplay in New World centers around exploration, crafting, and dynamic player-driven events. The open-world design encourages players to venture into the unknown, uncovering hidden treasures and facing off against formidable foes. The combat system is action-oriented, requiring skillful dodges, precise attacks, and strategic use of weaponry. It successfully blends traditional MMO mechanics with more action-oriented elements, providing a satisfying experience for players of various preferences.

Crafting and gathering play a crucial role in New World, offering a robust economy within the game. The resource-rich environment and intricate crafting system make every gathering expedition feel meaningful, as players contribute to the in-game economy and enhance their own capabilities.

One of New World's standout features is its player-driven events and faction-based conflicts. Wars over territories bring a real sense of community and competition, allowing players to engage in large-scale battles for control and influence. The sense of agency in shaping the game world is a refreshing departure from more linear MMORPG experiences.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows in Aeternum. While the game has made significant strides since its beta phase, some players may encounter minor bugs and optimization issues. It's clear that the development team is actively addressing these concerns, but they are worth noting for a smoother overall experience.

In conclusion, New World is a welcome addition to the MMORPG genre, offering a visually stunning world, engaging gameplay mechanics, and a player-driven narrative. While it has a few rough edges, the potential for growth and improvement is evident. Whether you're a seasoned MMO veteran or a newcomer to the genre, New World is a captivating journey into the unknown that's well worth the investment.",1705529666,1705529666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not written out of rage, because some boss just killed me one too many times, no! I simply do not enjoy playing this piece of fucking trash! It could be fun, but the movement and the combat is just stupidly annoying and feels like I coded it. You constantly get stunned and trapped by enemys, you get stuck while trying to dodge enemy attacks and beamed away by magic (which you can´t block) because I am FUCKING STUCK AGAIN!!!
Now to be fair, you have to say, the world is very pretty and fun to interact with. Also, the multiplayer runs very smoothly. BUT! All of that might sound fun (which it is) but the combat takes such a big potrion of the game, everything else just submerges in shitty combat gameplay.
Also, the game pretty much forces you to fight, because the whole map is sprinkled with enemys. And when you just want to bypass them, they start running after you and making annoying sounds. And when you decide to fight them, they just retreat and regenerate all lost health and can´t be damaged until they return to their natural rout or something, probably to avoid exploits, but brother! This shit also happens when you are currently fighting. Just imagine this: You are fighting a BIG enemy, doging, blocking, all that, you have almost killed him! He attacks you, so you go back a little and heal (which also feels very lumpy), so he follows you, walking in you direction, so you pull out your ranged weapon, and right before you can get the finishing hit in, he just gets invincible and pisses the fuck off. And this has happend to me numerous times.
Now you might think, then the story must be good...
Let me just say one thing...
I don´t FUCKING know!
It was more boring than being stuck in holiday traffic or the Kardashians.
It is just sad to see a game with that much potential being one of THE WORST I have EVER played! EVER!

For someone that enjoys playing a lot of MMO's, I hated the purpose of a subscription based game because how limited I am with time and don't have all day to play games. I might have 5-6 hours a week to play a game and I don't want my money going to waste on a subscription game that I can't play. 

With New World, you just buy the game and you own it, that's it.

It's very fun to play with friends and it's easy to find a group and some friends on this game to party up and do raids (expeditions), quest, or even just level up your trade skills (woodcutting, mining, etc).

If you're afraid to get this game because of its price, wait for it to go on sale and then purchase it. The DLC will make traversing around the map more fun and easier but you don't need the DLC during the first 25-30 levels of the game.

Not sure how many extra hours I've put into the game now but I think like 50 and I'm already back up to what I was before I deleted the old character. And the story line is a lot different as well so overall I like the game now. I believe the mobs may do different attack but I haven't payed that much attention to it this time around as it is not taking hours on end of killing the same thing to level. 

Old review
TLDR: Grindy game but kinda fun if that is your thing.

Really really grindy, I have over 100 hours and I'm still not max level. You get an exp boost if you are flagged pvp while out questing and you will most likely be killed by a high level character. Crafting is not bad but getting materials is difficult due to the grind to level your crafting skills and all higher level crafting recipes require starter materials. Meaning if I want to make star metal tools I still need to go and mine iron which every one is after so good luck. While I did enjoy the game after 130 hours it got a bit boring, all the monster attacks are similar and they all have a knock back attack. The cats are a reskin of the wolves they even have the same attack though one gives you a bite debuff and the other gives you a scratch debuff, they both do the same thing they cause you to bleed.",1637797927,1705410027,True,0,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

EDIT: Played another ~200 hours. Some updates:
---------------------------------------------------*/
- Mount system is ok. All the decent-looking ones are locked behind a paywall (no surprise there)
- Transmog is SHAMELESSLY locked behind a paywall.
- There's a lot of storyline content to catch up on if you're brand new so you'll probably get your money's worth as an RPG. I HOPE YOU LIKE CHOPPING DOWN TREES.
- The weapon/skill system is kinda meh. There are a couple of cookie-cutter builds that are the only viable options for activity x.
- Trying to get into a (I HOPE YOU LIKE CHOPPING DOWN TREES) decent company that isn't just you and your cousin Phil (who will not shut up about lizards) is nigh impossible unless you're on the cutting edge of the PvE scene. Did I mention that to get into groups you need to have done the thing before? One of those catch-22 situations where you need experience to get groups and you need groups to get experience. I HOPE YOU LIKE CHOPPING DOWN TREES. Good luck to you finding a company that'll take on a new person unless it's one of those spam recruiters.
- Did you accidentally turn on PvP at lvl 54? Lol get wrecked noob. Enjoy getting ganked for the next 30 minutes while you try to complete your quest.
- End-game content is very repetitive and grindy. (compared to GW2 / WoW) You will spam the same dungeon over and over and over and over and over and over. There are like five of them.
- The proxy voice-chat is great for people spamming their Donald Trump soundboard or Carameldansen in every major town.
- I
- HOPE
- YOU
- LIKE
- CHOPPING
- DOWN
- F^&($#*
- TREES
- Still pretty (visuals and audio still gorgeous) and some of the collision bugs have been fixed.
- I'm trying to think of a single positive experience I had (apart from the novelty of unlocking new things, new weapons, new skills, buying and decorating your house) but once you're done with the story, it becomes SERIOUSLY repetitive and boring. (This coming from someone who has been playing WoW since 2006.)

In, summary, I hope you like chopping down trees.
Okay, real summary: 
 - Recommended as an RPG (or Exotic Lumberjack Simulator), but not as an MMORPG.
 - Is it worth the price? Sure.
 - Will you play it for more than a month? Probably not. But there's no sub fee, so you can come back any time, which is a plus.

    ORIGINAL REVIEW:
----------------------------------------*/
The only positive thing I can say about this game is that **visually** it's absolutely beautiful.
The art team did an AMAZING job here.

But the flesh and bones of this homunculus leave much to be desired;
it's made of a the collection of systems don't fit well together.
There are still plenty of things that you will not like if you come from other well-known MMO's:
1. inefficient quest pathing. You will often get random quests on the other side of the map requiring you to run across zones where the enemies are twice your level.
2. irregular and inexplicably sporadic spawn timers (e.g. you fight hard to clear out a difficult elite and his two friends that he summons from a cave and then respawns every time before you can even loot the chest or mine the ore he was guarding. He also brings his friends with every time. Hope you remembered to make a camp nearby so you don't have to run all the way back to your corpse from the nearest town.
So you will get ganked by randomly respawning mobs a lot when you're not getting ganked by other players.
3. weird/buggy player character behaviour especially with jumping and dodging.
4. buggy PvE enemy AI that frequently (gets stuck on rocks or can't find it's way around a tree)
5. Tradeskill grinding is tedious and excessive. I HOPE YOU LIKE CHOPPING DOWN TREES. Also, better hope the town you're in has a high enough level kitchen for you to make the food for that quest or you'll have to run aaaaaaaaaalll the way to another town that YOUR faction controls just to go make that one thing you need for a quest. No problems; you'll have plenty of time to chop down trees on your way there.
6. finding/joining a clan is difficult.
7. The bots and gold-sellers have already infiltrated the game. Soon the regional chat will look like Trade Chat (TM).
8. NO SPRINT. Seriously; you can't run any faster. There is one running speed and that's what you've got from level 1 to 60.
9. No Mounts.
10. Seriously, no mounts.
11. Did I mention there aren't any mounts?
12. Loot RNG is particularly frustrating. There doesn't seem to be any logic behind perk distribution, even for curated quest rewards.

If I only had three words to describe New World, they would be ""FRUSTRATING"", ""BEAUTIFUL"" and ""TEDIOUS"".

A metaphor that feels appropriate is it's like having a really hot girlfriend/boyfriend, but they're also a flat-earther and will remind you frequently of what their starsign says about everything.
They insist on making you wear colours whose names have the same number of letters as the numbers their psychic picked out for them.

Pros:
* Best action combat there is
* Open world pvp is the best content
* One of the best Tradeskill system for MMOs (Fishing, Music, Mining etc etc)
* Satisfying crafting
* Great Audio design/quality
* Great level design for each environment/zones
* One of the best lighting
* Immersive world.
* VOIP
* Good dungeon designs. 
* Traversing / vaulting is one of the best in MMOs as well.
* Casual friendly
* Solo friendly
* Quarterly event - Seasonal contents
* Clean UI
* QOL - inventory management system, gear sets etc.
* Arena, OPR - PVP rewards
* PVE ranking rewards
* Clean Auction House/Trading hall UI
* Every weapon is viable. 

Cons:
* Feels clunky at times due to desync problems
* Server population problem (game feels dead when there's not enough people roaming the world)
* Static NPCs
* Housing not fully utilized
* Camp should be vulnerable/can be attacked when the owner is PVP flagged
* OPR is not fully utilized. 1 map for almost 3 years after release
* Arena is not fully utilized. No ranking/mmr system (1v1, 3v3, 5v5)
* World mobs is using 3 to 5 same move-set
* Re-skin mobs
* Open world dungeons/elite areas is not fully utilized
* Dungeons/expedition becomes bland after you cleared it twice. 
* Expedition bosses does not pose threats. Use 2 to 3 move set the whole fight
* Mutated mechanics is not fun (elemental hazard). Should have different move-set for mobs/bosses instead to every mutation level.
* The only in-game *raid Sand worm is not worth it (rewards is worthless). This content has so much potential.
* Bugs in every content patch
* No gear chase once you reach end game. everything is attainable solo. can craft, can hunt alone.
* Company / guild system lacks depth. There should be guild skills/bank/guild quarters/camp/guild auction.
* Influence pushes/race should be placed in open world forts / castles like the ones in monarch's bluff, everfall.
* Wars becomes bland. Fighting for a wooden fort after almost 3 years? where's the castles --- look at monarch's bluff open world castle. siege equipment should be brought back in the meta. What's the point of having them when the only useful thing are the horns. Bring the cannons, turrets back, add trebuchet etc. 
* Factions are limiting the PVP possibilities for companies. make it that you can fight companies in your own faction. new system that could enable governors to declare hostilities/war, to a company from your faction and other factions. This adds intensity on open world PVPs
* Character progression is lacking

* Summary
Overall, game is great. it just need more polish/add more system that makes MMOs enjoyable.
But AGS is taking so long to fix game bugs/issues, which I think the reason they are so slow releasing meaningful contents. 

PVP is also the one keeping this game alive. They should put time and effort on this. implement new things that could make open world pvp fun. improve the current systems specially influence races. place it on open world castles, POI with PVP quests that makes sense.

Decided to come back and instantly regretted my decision. This game is TRASH!

Update: 01/19/2023:
Server merges occurred again because the game is dead. What's worse is that it takes 2 hours to queue up any dungeon. Don't buy this game. The people are toxic and whats worse is that everything end game requires a party. Can't find a party because there are no players.

Update: 12/30/2022 - 
I had to purchase another server transfer token. That means I've spent $32 to move my character off of El Dorado (US West Region). Amazon Games must be hurting for funding because they have refused to provide me with a token despite their failure. Also, don't play on El Dorado (US West Region); the server is dead.  

Update: 12/26/2022 - 
I came back to check out what was happening in December and to try to get back into the game. I purchased a server transfer to join friends. I use said server transfer token and changed servers. I log out for 15 minutes and then login and I am on the same server that I chose to leave. I contact customer support and they said ""we're not giving out any free server transfer tokens."" What the fuck did I just pay for!?!

Thanks Amazon!

I do not recommend this game. I am 142 hours in and filled with complete disappointment by class imbalance, faction imbalance, and the grind. Please save your money. This game is a complete fumble and genuinely makes me sad. Additionally, various servers have been locked down and do not allow friends to join you, so now you either create a new character or pay $16 for a server transfer even though New World handed out free server transfers... 

If you're dead set on buying, I recommend you do research and dig deeper beyond this post and level set your expectations to be very very low.

Cons:
- Class Imbalance
- Faction Imbalance
- Casters classes are an after thought
- Story is half baked, developers took the super lazy route by leaving ""notes"" to read..... 
- Markets are busted
- No mounts
- Combat is limited to 3 skills on a hot bar
- The grind is real, expect to invest time and be required to group up.
- Limited end game content

Pros:
- Dungeons can be fun
- Crafting has potential
- Skill point trees are basic and to the point
- Environments are beautiful
- Lots of weapon combinations",1667363107,1705265823,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

would i recommend this game? 

simple answer-yes

longer answer- i would only recommend this game to player that either really enjoy lore, RNG crafting, gathering, PVP and players that aren't shy to join/communicate with others in game via joining a company/discord.

i would not recommend it to some one that is antisocial or just don't have a interest in joining up with other players and working together as the end game is rather hard to find a group as a solo (unless ur biss gear). The end game can also get stale quick without a good friend group/community to interact with and keep things interested. example- running the same dungeons over and over. I find the best part of the game for me is the PVP with friends.

As for the people saying its pay to win thats simply not true there's no real advantage to buying anything on their in game store skins do nothing but look pretty there are boosters you can get but its just xp boosters and since most the community was already maxed before they added them not really much of a pay to win. The only thing you could even say is pay to win about the game is the expansion which raises max level / gear-score lets you use artifact weapons and gives you a mount. that being said how is it any different from any other mmo that releases and expansion giving you access to higher level and better gear? some will say well the mounts should be free to everyone and yeah i could get behind that but still not needed there's tons of fast travel points in the game already. All i can say is they asked for another what 30 bucks after 2years and no monthly payments? not a bad deal tbh.

The crafting mechanics is good and gathering resources can actually be fun.

I am not risking it any longer, it never happened to me this before playing any of my games so problem lies on this one.
Shame really, was a game i was looking forward to play.
Edit: I restored my pc to factory setting, reinstalled drives and whatnot so I'm giving this game another chance to see if it is the culprit of those crashes or not.
Edit_2:  Today on the 13/01/2024 I can say that the game has sorted out my major issue which was the freezing, crashing and blue screen although the game does lag sometimes and teleports my character somewhere else, not a major issue as its lag, can be attributed to the large player base of the server,
the addition of mounts really brought the game to another level for me but the microtransactions suck to be fair, it will not make you stronger but will make you cooler so treat it as a skin market hehehe if you catch my drift.

This game repeats some of the things that were done wrong by other MMOs before, such as: floating herbs and rocks; animals dying above the ground level, so you can't loot them; chat being spammed by goldsellers. But in no way it stops there! It goes above and beyond, on getting things to new level of wrong:
Humanoid mobs were voiced by man that was talking in a cup.
Chat helps you ignore people and lose friends, by constantly getting ""why don't you reply to me?!"" from them. And it's ""totally not"" because there's no custom tabs for you to make.
In-game achievement tab doesn't work for half of the time you're trying to access it.
Questing done with great idea of ""can I copy your homework?"" in mind. You might even pick literally same quest x2 on townboard, then go to place, loot x1 of the item you need (and there's only one chest on this pylon anyway), then go back to place to turn them both, to get to know that only one did turn since you had only x1 of the items and you need to run back to loot another one.
Did you just put your hands on this shiny chest? How dare you! Now chest can reject being looted, by not letting you end the action, making you sit in it, till you get bored and let it go. Happens with gathering too!
This isn't place to roleplay either, with amount of premium emotes being sold in Store being higher than those that you get for free. Go back to Goldshire you weirdo!
And so much more!

Yes, this game did hurt me in no way any other before it. It almost drowned me with weight of my bags, when you can't open your inventory in water, but you also can't jump or climb if you're carrying too much. And nobody cares if you looted this chest in the same water. That was a trap!

With latest expansion update you lose access to a location that was part of base game and cannot enter it unless you own said DLC:

I purchased New World for myself and my wife, and we managed to play some 11-16 hours before she received a permanent ban for no reason. The reason given was ""detection of cheating software"", my wife has an average computer with Steam installed and she uses Nexus Mod Manager for her Skyrim and Baldur's Gate 3 installs, and that's pretty much it as far as anything that could be considered dodgy by Easy Anti Cheat. She uses standard Windows Defender, so it's not dodgy anti-virus software causing it either, and she only uses Razer products and I'm sure Razer Synapse would not cause a false flag.

So I can only conclude that Amazon Game Studios have false thought she was cheating based on bugs in their own game or in Easy Anti Cheat. That said, their support is non-existant. Everything is automated and they're hiding from their own customers by not offering any way to reach an actual human being when you have a support case.

We've asked for refunds from Steam and I can only urge you to stay away from this game as it can't be trusted. We were lucky we got this problem only after 10-15 hours and not after 500 hours.

Unfortunately their automatic anti-cheat system seemed to ban me permanently for no reason and the customer support at Amazon just seems to ignore tickets completely, copy pasting the same message over and over again (sometimes forgetting to even add their name to the template message).

I'll have to unfortunately leave a negative review for this occasion as they might have this issue happen to also other players and treat them the same. Had bought the game for two of my friends and decided to spend some money on the in-game store, only to notice they just take the money and restrict access to their game without any proper notice nor support to handle the situation on their behalf as this was clearly an error on their behalf...

If they manage to improve their process on handling such issues I'll probably swap the review to positive as the game itself is pretty good and very enjoyable to play (I had almost 140 hours in two weeks, crazy).

The experience of leveling your character up from 1 to 65 and then questing around the world is qutie the positive experience. On the other hand the game lacks fundamental bases like fast travel points being accessible from the open world instead near a shrine or town, as well and the serious lack of the option to select TAB targeting instead of Aiming have put me down quite a bit since I would expect from a mage class to have TAB targetting. This is what most mage players expect, as well and the option to choose between Aim or TAB Targetting.

The dungeons of the games are fun. The grind fests though for levelling up your crafting is REAL and painful. Especially levelling up your weapons, it happens so slowly that you see almost next to no progress with your weapons due to that. I would expect from the game to provide way faster levelling for your weapon if the max is 20. I see minimal leveling when doing dungeons or quest for my weapons and that is putting me off.

Other than that, the game could really use more variety when it comes to mage classes. Having just four, fire, ice, void and life (where life is heal and not damaging mage class is a let down). I would expect a class like an elementalist who would wield all four elements, and then a void class (which we do have with the gauntlet), necromancer (since we do see quite a bit of necromancers in-game but for some reason they don't have it as class) and so on. Choosing between Fire and Ice for main mage DPS class feels like a huge let down, for someone who does not enjoy Pyromancers or Cryomancers for their mage class.

All the above is as I say, until you reach the zones that are level 60+, this is the moment when this games becomes hardcore Dark Souls type of game which truly turned me away and off from the game. I do not recommend the game simply because the Dark Souls genre is NOT for MMORPG titles. The idea behind an MMORPG is for the player to enjoy their power and not get smashed or destroyed in a quest zone that matches their level. ",1704663960,1705065030,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will likely revisit if/when the developer releases their forecasted cross-world expedition feature, as a solid implementation would substantially reduce the friction associated with finding a group for expeditions.

Blockers to me returning for this new expansion after 1.7k+ hours of gameplay:

* Gear reset (due to meta mixup with vast number of perks changing, bane/resil removal, etc) accompanied by very little in way of new content - reprogging would be very low novelty.
* Looks like I can't do anything challenging solo; still arbitrary floors on # of players to enter an expedition so I can't try to solo tempest for fun. But - no PvE crossplay, so player pool for group play is pretty limited too.
*Extrapolating skills from 1-200 up to 250, adding in a new tier of items and calling it a day isn't satisfying for me in terms of new content for crafting etc.
* UI issues - text is very pixelated, strange things like bags being sorted into headers that don't fit, resulting in things like ""LEATHERW..."" being shown. Something broader may be amiss - the text issue exists with pre-interaction text for gatherables etc as well, but there are also oddities like the skill-gain circle for getting xp when gathering being sometimes really small (but not always.)
* Graphics issues - game looks supersaturated, but only has brightness/contrast configuration. Performance is sub-par compared to other games, probably due to not supporting DLSS (or its AMD equivalent) etc. 

The combat system is kinda neat, but WoW wins for dungeons and BDO wins for pretty much everything else, making New World the Microsoft Surface of MMOs :/",1696542184,1704873650,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still agree with 10/10 running simulator but there are no more server queues. 

Loooooseeeee your social life and get immersed in the world of Aeternum - That is the game, very addictive, having played ALOT of open world pvp ~ I am loving it more and more everyday, too much content LOTs to do and grind.

PVE is also at its best if you have friends to play with and chill.

10/10 - Running Simulator
10/10 - Server Queue Simulator

I'd give a down vote for this game for not having servers in South East Asia or anywhere in Asia, but I did play in EU Servers for 20 hours and I LOVE the game. 
My ping is 180 and is manageable & not lag, but they should really improve server quality and size to reduce queue time.

The good:
- The combat is better than any MMO out there.
- The graphics are better than any MMO out there.
- NW Team pushes updates to try an balance the weapons and skills every now and then.
- World events, influence races (open pvp) and overall interaction with the server community is great.
- There is a lot of stuff to do besides just questing, there is housing, transmog, other game modes like OPR and 3V3 (this last one depends on the server you are on until they get crossworld 3v3s).

The not bad, not good:
- NW Team delivers updates slowly and QA seems non existent.
- Almost every patch comes buggy and delayed by a day or two.
- Crafting and Gathering are huge time sinks.
- PVP is not the priority right now and it's kinda unbalanced.
- Game has cosmetics and a season pass, this isn't that bad as you are not paying every month for a suscription and its entirely up to the user to purchase (it doesn't really offer anything you cant get by just playing).
- Game has mounts now (paywalled by xpac, but it isn't that expensive if you play this every day).
- Game will get cross-world expeditions (dungeons) and a revised group finder wich is great and also should have had from day one.
- Seasonal events are kinda repeated, this MMO has been out two years so this isn't really that bad but yeah.

The bad:
- Performance is not that great, it is perfectly playable but hiccups and other issues do affect the game.
- The game often has very weird and game breaking bugs, this is bad, but if you do play you can help out by reporting said bugs in their official discord channel.
- It should have gamepad support, it has been hinted as coming in this year (2024).

This review comes from a dude that finds WoW/ESO/FF extremly fucking empty, boring and outdated after a few months of playing, and i aknowledge that they are better MMOs in certain things, but they've also been out for years.

I have played this game a lot and enjoyed its MMO-repeat-the-same-type-of-quest action with fun combat abilities and mechanics. I reached max level, enjoy the PvP options, open world and not. Since my previous review there have been many quality of life improvements that have reduced the barrier to enjoying the play experience.

Unfortunately, I still haven't played dungeons much because the improvements and fixes came too late and too slowly and none of my gaming friends play any more, nor do I expect they ever will. However, there are solo options for the main story quests that otherwise would require a dungeon (expedition) run.

I have to say that I've enjoyed the additions and changes to the game play and have now played to level 60 on more than one character (leveling is much faster now). This means I have been through several of the story lines two or more times. I particularly like the added ""Soul Trial"" solo boss fights and additional story driven quest lines; I even used paper and pencil to solve a burning sands quest puzzle at one point.

This is not to say that all the bugs have been fixed. Looting a chest still occasionally fizzles, starting a new character had an issue that required resetting the initial tutorial quest, and sometimes I find a resource node that is frozen or has placement issues. I would say these are infrequent enough to prevent ruining the experience, and at least Amazon doesn't break the game every week with an update anymore.

Pros: It doesn't reinvent the wheel as far as MMOs are concerned and it has taken a lot of things that work well from other games, but what is special about this game is that due to it being swapped from a survival crafting pvp game to a traditional MMO at the last stages of development, the combat in the game is so clean, skill driven, and team oriented. There is no tab to target, and you have to aim all your attacks/abilities. 

Zero pay to win (season pass can give you some mats but its nothing you can't easily obtain) and all micro-transactions are cosmetic only, 

There is grind, as with all RPG/MMO games, but the game has implemented systems over numerous updates that both improve QoL as well as respect players time. It is much easier to get your final endgame set together than it has ever been before. That being said, some items for purchase needed for endgame upgrades are time gated. These items are needed only for max level crafts/upgrades, and are not needed to put a build together as random loot does drop high enough from enough different activities.

Cons: The devs seem to be way out of touch with the PVP side of development and enrichment. There been small updates to PVP with the 3v3 arenas, and the influence races have replaced the old system of declaring war, but we still have one single endgame PVP map that doesn't factor role queue, and declaring war is still gated behind territory ownership and influence race. In the future I would hope that they will add wars between companies on demand, and add a role based queue system to instanced PVP (the role based system exists for PVE instances already.) 

Generating in game currency (aside from working the trade market) is still extremely grindy. New players will feel this in their pockets until the knowledge of how to farm efficiently is learned through trial and error or osmosis. 

Customer service for this game is handled solely through the NW official discord. In my experience the devs have been helpful with in game issues you may have, but whenever they make a mistake with a patch or content launch they punish players for taking advantage of an ""exploit."" In my humble opinion, id like to see them disable whatever is allowing the exploit, but not ban/punish players for things the game allows without cheats or 3rd party apps. 

If you're a prospective player reading this, 99% of you wont get into a winnable war. Until they add queued wars, the content is held by the top 1% of players and is very much social slotting, as it is hard to weigh one player against another in war circumstances even with scoreboards. To combat this, top companies require VODs of you doing wars in order to get a shot at a slot in war. If you have never done a war, you have no vod, and cannot meet requirements for a slot tryout. Also, before you come at me sideways saying skill issue, I got the territory victor drip on both US East and US West regions and have been main war roster for the majority of my time playing. This has just been my experience in competitive companies.

Neither Pro or Con: This game doesn't hold your hand and can be unforgiving. This could be seen as a good or bad thing depending on your personal opinions. I would highly recommend new players to join a large guild regardless of that guilds skill level just to learn from as many sources as possible.",1704824524,1704824524,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Trying to render 1080p on 1440p monitor is not implemented properly, so it's EXTRA blurry. If I want proper 1080p, I have to set my monitor to 1080p before playing. This is annoying.
This game will melt your hardware if you aren't careful, both GPU & CPU.
[b]Cap your framerate to a point that isn't overworking your hardware[/b]; monitor your hardware usage%, temperatures, power usage% and framerates. Figure out a safe & stable framerate for the settings you want, then cap it there.
I highly recommend using MSI Afterburner + RTSS (RivaTuner) to monitor all this. You can set up a toggle-able overlay/OSD(On-Screen-Display). Add the NewWorld executable to RTSS and cap your framerate in there. There's no better FPS limiter than RTSS. These 2 programs are made to be very lightweight and run in the background 24/7, and they work in combination with each other. They're widely used by millions.

I'll happily change this to a positive review as soon as performance improves, and ONLY then.

The game has only gotten worse with every single update. They attempt to fix one thing and end up breaking 3 more things, completely by accident! Not talking about little or petty things here either.

The devs seem to have actually played their game and gotten a clue, but its still riddled with bugs and broken mechanics. Sad. They need to pollish this turd a bit more before its actually enjoyable.

The experience is still ruined by shitty engine mechanics. Mounts are a perfect example. Its clear the game engine was made without mounts in mind. Janky as fuck. All these issues are made worse by high server latency because somehow Amazon cant find the time or money to place one fucking NW server on the African continent.

There is a general feeling of bugginess and shittiness that plagues nearly every second of this game. You have to just walk and bumble around everywhere. Go walk 500 meters this way and kill five things. Then press E on 3 things. Good job. Now walk 350 meters for the next step. You already know the drill. This is the extent of the questing, which you will be doing for a long time.

Doesn't matter what I've done to my settings, I'm constantly stuttering and it never stops no matter where I am or what I'm doing. It makes my eyes hurt. This has made me miss jumps that the game insists on making you do during the questing content which was infuriating.

The crafting is a joke. You will walk around for two hours, fill up your pack, and after refining craft like ten things, make very little progress. 

The invasions and territory system is terrible unless you happen to be available to play video games at the time the game allows you to do them. So if not, well then that sucks because that entire aspect of the game is completely shut off for you.

The combat is abysmal and boring. Just lumberjack away at something while it swings unimpeded through the damage it is taking and staggers you incessantly. It doesn't get better.

The content is you doing chores to get access to higher-tier chores. That's the entire game. Running through a boring map, clumsily flailing at monsters, pressing E on rocks and trees, and waiting five seconds to open boxes.

It ignores the nvidia's control panel antialiasing settings other than FXAA (and propably multiframe-sampled aa), which simply makes all the game blurry no matter if stuff is moving on the screen or is static. 
Blurry is bad, while no antialiasing is also bad. Especially in the game with so much visual noise in the enviroment (bazilions of grasses and bushes). With no antialiasing its just a sea of pixels noise, especially while they try to reflect the sun rays.
Would not have bought it if i knew there is no proper antialiasing in the game. Maybe they will add one in the future. For now it looks ugly - nothing like you see on downscaled images from higher resolutions, which increase the quality of otherwise pixelated ugly mess.
To add insult to injury, be aware that by buying the base game without expansion, you still have to do what others hated till the expansion (running miles and miles on foot without access to mount). So if you want better game experience (not just new content), but actual QoL improvements take price of the game and the expansion into the account. Without expansion you buy what you get for free in better looking mmos (old, capped content as free trial).",1704673747,1704676220,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the bad then get to the good:

Bad
[strike]1. Server latency is terrible and needs to be fixed, apparently it is better than at launch but rubberbanding can be really annoying and affects immersion. Do not blame your hardware unless you have a potato, my fps on an older computer is well over 100 in the world and never below 65 in cities.[/strike] Australian internet was the issue, hotspotting my phone fixed this issue for me. 

Good:
1. Crafting is extremely satisfying, very good audio effects, UI is clean, systems make sense and aren't too grindy but also reward time and effort.
2. The world is beautiful and dense and exploration is rewarded, I really like that it is island based instead of this massive empty world like many other games.
3. The story, atleast for me, is immersive. I like the nature theme and the multiple aspect to each side. The journals/lore you pick up are fleshed out and relevant to the area you are exploring, even minor and side quests are voice acted which just helps with immersion.
4. Music perfectly suits the world, it is understated and really helps with the ambivalence. The music instrument system is also a lot of fun, themed profession music is a great touch.
5. UI is clean, satisfying and simple. The last game I played before this was starfield so you can imagine my relief when I saw the menus in this game. 
6. Combat is satisfying, it's not ARPG but it's also not stand still and press 3, there's levels to it, sound effects are nice and you can choose how you want to play.
7. Classless system, amazing, you aren't locked in and don't have to have multiple characters to try different things. Great design. 
8. Other players are generally quite nice and helpful, someone gave my partner 18k when she went to the first town with a nice welcome message and players have been helpful in dungeons in the over world as well. 

Overall:
An immersive, beautiful world that rewards exploration, crafting and effort. Combat is satisfying, the classless system is great, UI is very clean and music suits the world very well. [strike]Fix the latency/server issues and hopefully this game sticks around for a long time.[/strike] My internet was the problem, it's better to hotspot my phone instead of run an Ethernet cord to my pc, got to love Australian internet.",1704580996,1704668870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i ve never my entire life never complained about a game no matter how luck based or pay2win or hard it was to beat or how many hours it took me to kill one boss. THE GAME IS A TOTAL MESS AND I DIDNT EVEN GET TO PLAY IT EVEN LONGER
NO minimap!! (Even CS has a fkin minimap)
there is NO INFORMATION about resistances on the bosses at expeditions. it doesnt tell u which type is the boss what is what which is which and if u find its totally out of date. VERY frustrating.
Auction house is a total chaos, completly messed up and unorganized, it drains your patience and ur time to look for one specific item in ur inventory to check if its valuable.
i had unlocked my perks on 3 of my artifacts(needs hours to unlock the perks and its 4 of them) , and whenever i tried to equip it poped the mission so i abandoned the mission (it doesnt even give anything its just there infront of ur face thats there wherever u unpin it) and guess what?

Embarking on the journey into ""New World"" is akin to setting sail on a ship with a hull full of hopes, only to find it dashed against the rocks of disappointment. Don't even bother, for the allure of uncharted territories quickly gives way to the realization that this game is a sinking ship of unmet promises, technical hiccups, and questionable design choices.

The initial excitement of exploring the pristine landscapes of Aeternum is swiftly overshadowed by a plethora of issues that plague ""New World"" like a relentless storm. The first and most glaring concern is the lack of meaningful content, leaving players to wander through beautiful yet barren landscapes with a distinct absence of engaging quests or activities. Don't even bother, for the game's potential quickly devolves into a monotonous grind with little reward.

Character progression, touted as a cornerstone feature, falls flat like a deflated lifeboat. The lack of class diversity, uninspiring abilities, and a general sense of imbalance leave players yearning for the depth and variety promised in the game's pre-launch hype. Don't even bother, as the progression system lacks the vibrancy and excitement that should accompany an MMO of this scale.

Technical issues further compound the sense of regret. Lag spikes, server instability, and long queues transform the prospect of exploration into an exercise in frustration. Don't even bother, as the game's infrastructure struggles to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience, turning what should be a seamless journey into a stop-and-start ordeal.

The PvP-centric nature of ""New World"" raises eyebrows and not in a good way. The lack of PvE endgame content and the emphasis on faction-based warfare often feel forced, as if the game is trying to shoehorn players into a playstyle that may not align with their preferences. Don't even bother, unless you have a penchant for the chaotic and sometimes unbalanced world of open-world PvP.

In conclusion, ""New World"" is a venture that promised uncharted wonders but delivers only a sea of disappointment. Don't even bother, as the potential for a truly groundbreaking MMO experience is drowned out by a chorus of unaddressed issues and unfulfilled expectations. Save yourself the regret, for the allure of Aeternum quickly fades into a sense of longing for a game that could have been so much more.",1641807703,1704660706,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is the little details within the game that need to be addressed. From a far the game looks great, the world is fun to dive into and explore. However, once you start your grind you will notice that each and every area of the island feels the same, and the toons to fight are no different. Yes questing is repetitive its an MMO you new here? But with this game they seem to drag on these quests with endless bore of an empty world of enemies to fight and loot. 

The dungeons are fun. Only issue is unless they have a mutation, or you're lucky enough to have friends to play this game with you will be waiting ages for a lobby to fill to complete the dungeon. Huge turn off for me in this game. They cap the amount of dungeons you can do in a day, and there is no options to go in solo and clear it. 

The crafting is fun. For a casual player that just wants to come in and grind a little with levelling their skills I can see the positive aspects of this game. They do not limit you to what you can craft. It is just a huge grind to get there. Crafting and enhancing those skill can take multiple days to gather the needed materials to craft the simplest of gear. A few farm areas to gain the resources and with the servers being empty the majority of the time a casual player can easily farm away. 

Mounts are behind a pay wall. You get them unlocked with buying the angry earth DLC. You can get a free horse,wolf,and Lion once you grind through all the challenges. No options other than that to grind for mounts unfortunately but obviously you can buy within the gem store of the game like every other MMO. The fine detail in the mounts is horrific. Wolf needed horseshoes to run faster. Yes read that again. There is no sound difference when riding other than the sound the animal makes. So always hearing a horse clip glop away when on a wolf is just aggravating af. 

Lastly the graphics. They are terrible. Cut scenes just skip them. The close up rendering of graphics looks like something out of the early 00s and the mouth to voice do not sync. Trees from a far are blotchy no matter the setting you choose and the over all close up imagine is less than good for the amount you will need to spend on this game. It feels like rust or dayz at times with how poorly ran this game is at times. 

This game feels like a chore to play half of the time with little to no reward as to why you're investing the time and energy into it. But at the same time the game can be fun. If we were to be rating it on a star level I would place it right were it needs to be place. 3/5. No more no less. It is fun depending on what you are investing your time in. But for a game that was set out to replace all others...... No where close to it. Dead severs, dead game play. Hopefully the devs can actually address the random crashes in games and add some actual content behind this title or more people will go back to what they know and what they are used to.",1704629502,1704630372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Go to location, kill # enemies, loot chests... like that is it... oh and harvesting, there is a lot of that. Crafting is a nice break from the monotony right until it gets monotonous itself, but is better implemented in some mmos. There are quests that tell you to be a certain level to do it and then you walk halfway across the map only to find out the quests in that zone cannot be picked up until you are at an even higher level. This game is good at wasting time as most mmorpgs are, and there are some good things, but IMO the content is a little weak in terms of variety. I wish there was a teeeensy bit more to the questing and levelling because you cant even grind mobs or pvp to level fast... 

idk, for now im not going to recommend this - even tho I have been having fun with the mechanics itself. Its just a little shallow.

Poor quality, tiny and already empty servers. I could undenstand tiny size of servers, since there is a tiny amount of endgame content, unless you like to cut trees for 80% time of your game experience or play the same two, laggy (servers quality) pvp modes over and over again.

Poor optimization, lack of FSR and DLSS (wtheck, it's 2024, besides that FSR is free...).

Im not even talking about tons of bugs, exploits, etc...
Im not even talking about unprofessional behaviour of their workers called ""Community staff"".

Deleting inconvenient threads, blocking people who reveal bugs in the game and finaly closing official NW forum, because they coudn't handle criticism anymore it is just an example of the state of NW.

Nah, Amazon, nah... Seriously, leave GamDev to the professional and experienced companies.

There's nothing incredibly unique about the game, and the lore/quests are mediocre if I'm being completely candid.

The experience rewards from quests make it absolutely mind-numbing to traverse the world. They have fast-travel, sure. But you rely on Azoth to travel around and it runs out FAST. You can purchase a house in any settlement, but then have to pay like... 500 gold every 4 days to be able to use it. 

IF they add mounts, buy the game. IF they do not; I would only recommend this game if you like spending 10 minutes moving from one quest objective to another.

Definitely one of the better mmos I have played in a long time. The game play is fun, the expedition’s a.k.a dungeons are so different at first gave me early ESO vibes. 

As you get to level 65 and start to really work on getting your artifact gear and open world raids you find yourself involved in a massive group chest runs and harder difficulty dungeons! To try to get the gear piece to make your room even better.

You can change up your weapons at any time if you choose to change up your play style it has different build slots so you can swap on the fly the down side is you need to respec if you go from let’s say two handed dps to a mage. 

The economy in the game is pretty trashed so it’s hard to get gold and you can spend a lot of gold after you get your artifact sadly.

The devs definitely have their issues with the game but I can’t knock them to hard because they are trying so hard on making the game better and better and run smoother for people they honestly are trying to bout their best foot forward.

My wife was really into this game and I think she has 1000+ hours into this game. Unfortunately she ran into a bug with server transferring which costs money. Amazon Game Studios (AGS) asked her to keep trying and keep spending $16 over and over again and she kept getting the error. AGS then went completely dark and kept sending her the same automated email response with zero resolution. When she requested a refund for all that money spent, AGS told her she must reach out to Steam. Then Steam keeps telling her it's an AGS issue to resolve. Since neither Steam nor AGS will resolve this issue, I had my bank stop these transactions. This in turned got my wife's Steam account locked, and AGS banned her from the game. 

Steams customer support is a joke, but AGS is by far worse. They ask you to reach out to them in a discord server, but if the Community Manager Lydia does like your post, they will delete it and move on.  I will update this if I ever see a resolution but I highly doubt it.

It's not so bad that a person doesn't return to play again, buy the DLC, etc and so forth. The devs are clearly trying to make it better... but there is just only so much you can do about some problems, like the community at times. Is it worth your money? Sure. Is it worth the full price? Eh... I want to say yes because they put a lot of work into it, but at the same time they have a problem in changing too much too often just to suit the whims of... others. Sometimes it's a good thing. Sometimes, not as much. A lot of it is middle of the road to be fair. 

For example, the Warhammer used to be a lot better, but it got nerfed in how it's specials operate. Not a deal breaker, since it's still plenty powerful. But when you used to really like a certain method of rotating those specials, only to have it taken away because people complained... feels bad man. When it's a glitchy thing, I understand. Hatchet glitch had to go, as awesome as it was. But hammer? Really? It wasn't even a glitch. 

And people will go on and on about balance, but ultimately player skill undoes a lot of the advantages in some form or another. Same can be said of some of the disadvantages as well, but to a lesser extent. 

Or the markets for example. Sure, being able to freely sell things back and forth as a global market is pretty nice. But part of creating a game with trade networks between companies and their towns is that you don't make instant transmission of items a thing between storage locations. Inclusion of this ability, as nice as it is as well for players I will admit, also removes an entire aspect of tactical planning and strategy in the game. Provided of course the game is meant to have the companies competing against each other. Which, unless something changed last I checked... heh... it was. Competition and cooperation as it were. Well, making items instant transferable basically ruins part of that element. Now there is no reason to level up your towns to attract more people to your faction or company. When a company does level up a town, people like that; but if they lose those levels to an invasion it's an instant RIP for them in chat. Why? Cause the community knows that the only way that town is levelling up again is if the company doesn't just give up and actually tries again... and succeeds without losing to invasions again in the meantime. 

Basically towns have become a place of convenience only now. A spot to teleport to, because apparently walking and running was too much for many. That's fair, I can understand that when there were no mounts in the game, and lore specified that there would be no mounts. But that changed. Now there are mounts, with a DLC purchase. And there are also teleport locations galore to the point where it's a chore to get them all whenever they reset because of some new addition or removal that caused the dev's to reset those locations as well. (Seriously... it becomes quite annoying after a while.)

But teleports are restricted to Azoth, right? 

Well, yeah... but also no. There are free teleports as well as your houses. Proper combination of use between these means you can hop around the map for free for the most part, if you do things in the proper order with a teleport here, a run there, another teleport here, and a run there. Convenient, yes. Game breaking... not quite. But it does remove from the immersion when you are constantly loading new areas from teleporting. Oh, and... just now... apparently teleporting can cause some sort of stack/buffer overflow that can allow an attacker to gain access to your system. Just got that warning from my computer as it shut down the game just a minute or so before writing this new review. 

So that's great. /sarcasm

Here's the deal. The game isn't a bad one. It's fun enough to be worth the money. But it has problems, and those problems might differ based on your perspective and mentality on certain things. But they do have problems, agreed upon mostly by nearly all the community as a general basis. But they are trying to fix those problems. But... sometimes those fixes create new problems. 

If you have patience for this sort of thing, like what will happen with Beta games in general, then go ahead and play it. You'll probably love it, even when you don't have the fondest feelings for it. But don't go in expecting perfection. Definitely not perfection. 

And make sure you have a thick skin too, because the moderators I think have learned at this point that the community can be pretty darn toxic at times, even when the person they don't like is completely in the right. 

I've been at the short end of the stick on that side of things a couple times; but eventually they figured things out and reverted their decision later on on the second time. Lucky me.

Buying 4 copies of the Elysian Edition was untenable in the event we weren't hooked.

We were hooked. As someone with almost 1500 hours in Elder Scrolls Online, I very much appreciate AGS' buy-to-play model as opposed to ESO handicapping players who can't or won't pay for a subscription. Sure, there is a store and a paid Season Pass, but these are completely optional and don't give anything other than cosmetics that you can't otherwise obtain through playing the game -- and the free Season Pass is great. We don't feel in any way punished or deprived for not spending any money beyond the one-time purchases of the game and the DLC (which I also highly recommend, mounts are great).

Gameplay wise, it's like Elder Scrolls, Elden Ring, Diablo, Witcher, Minecraft, and Christopher Columbus had an orgy, and we're not sure who the father is, but they've all influenced Amazon's love child. It's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and has a little of something for everyone--tactical combat, grinding, questing, crafting, fishing, home ownership and decorating, a fantastic loot and transmog system, dungeons, PvP--and it's all optional, as serious or as casual as you decide it will be. From what I understand, AGS has turned an initially terrible launch into a solid and feature-rich game.

It does have occasionally buggy updates, and it's very CPU demanding. Over 2 years in, AGS should have added a swimming mechanic, and there are quests and areas that feel unfinished. But their formula for fun and engaging gameplay, with a beautiful immersive world, is spot on.

Okay, so let me just break it down a little:
1. Combat system is superb. I'd play a singleplayer game with this combat system
2. I really like the traversal mechanics - you can climb, grab the ledge mid-jump, crouch, even fall on the ground and crawl. And this stuff is actually used in gameplay - there're fun jumping puzzles
3. Loot, crafting, interface and overall QoL is pretty good and fun
4. World is sorta victorian / colonial, similar to Greenfall somehow. It's not a classic fantasy, but I liked it - it feels fresh
5. there's a proper story and voiced dialogues
6. Also there's a complicated territorial system I couldn't wrap my head around yet

The expeditions, kind of tie into the population, there aren't many people doing low-level expeditions(AKA dungeons) for me to finish a quest, in which you need at least 3 people to even start the expedition, so you have to wait there until someone finds your group to be invited.  Then for the DLC which I have not bought, but to get/use a mount, you need the DLC. 
Other than that it's a nice simple game.  I just hope more people will start playing the game or coming back to check it out on what's changed.

Saw a comment that says ""mounts are promised way at the beginning, putting it under a paid expansion is not the way"".
FALSE info. Mounts are not promised at the beggining, actually they insisted on ""mounts are not coming and it's in the lore that in Aeternum, you can't tame any animals."" Then they decided to flip from this, which was the right decision imo.

Saw a comment that says; After season 4 game became unplayable, servers are constantly crashing etc.
This is also a manipulative false information. Yeah, servers did crash at the first and second day of the beginning of season 4 due to the event they brought and whole server started farming it like there was 300 players attacking at the same boss at the same time so it did cause some crashes. Annoying, but saying that ""game is unplayable now"" is not a true information. They're all fixed after 2-3 days. Not being able to play the game for a day doesn't make the whole game is a ""not recommended"" one.

Saw a comment that says game is locked for casual players like they can't do territory wars etc. TOTALLY FALSE. 
This is the most casual friendly MMO i've ever played tbh. Territory Wars is a feature for organized clans BUT you can still join them as a casual player. You enlist yourself to a war and clans are picking players from the list for the war. If they can't fill the party with their clan's players, they will pick from the random enlisters (mercenaries). Even with a lower level and gear, you might find a spot in a war as a casual player. OFC it will not be frequent but you still gonna have the oppurtunity.

8 out of 10 Negative comments starts with ""i played the game for 1500+ hours and..."" Bro... you played the game for 1500+ hours and you give negative comment at the end? Bro...

I can totally understand if you don't like the game at all and i'm seperating the honest negative comments, i respect those but many of them are about either a momentary problem like 1-2 days of server issues (which literally every game has), or they played the game for 2000 hours, AGS changed something that he/she didn't like and instantly come here to drop a negative comment. That's not fair.


There are still negative aspects ofc. Like developers feel so slow when it comes to improve things and new content. There are bugs yeah but as far as i encountered, nothing too game breaking and could be worked around.

The game was good for a couple months coming back to experience the expansion, but the end game is stale, repetitive, and boring at its core. The end game content revolves around doing the same exact content that has been in the game since launch.

The New World team has made significant progress over the years but it's still not enough given who their parent company is.

The main problems.

1) Client
There are A LOT of bugs and performance issues.

2) Gear
All end game crafted gear is locked behind artificial time syncs and insane ""coin"" cost. The system is inherently cumbersome and seems to be designed as a more of a method to waste the players time then to actually craft items. New and returning players will find it extremely challenging to craft best in slot items even after playing the game for months.

3) Balance
The game balance is probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had in an MMO. Ranged and light armor builds absolutely dominate in PvP be it open world, outpost rush, or the 3v3 arenas. There are so many problems with the core foundation of how combat works and what seems to be AGS' vision for the future that I would say to not even waste your time PvPing.",1633438078,1704176233,False,0,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

All they had to do was release fresh start servers to eliminate the horrid economies after the bots nuked prices and people that were exploiting on release and they messed that up.

MMOs by design should be a grind from start to finish, that's literally the entire point of the game. Being able to hit level 60 with level 40 gear and barely any weapon levels is insanely unbalanced. Getting to ""end game"" in two days makes crafting useless when leveling far exceeds usefulness of crafted gear. 

I also expecting them to increase the level cap with each DLC to mimic WoW with the feel that there is more to do/progress, but when you are max level all the time, questing seems pointless, especially when you can game the market in it's current state to make loads of money, and then just spam raids to get higher gear score items. What is the point of playing when you hit 60 besides playing the same raids over and over, that is not an end game I am willing to soak time in to, EXCEEDINGLY SO when the time to grind end game far exceeds the time to get to 60. Why would I feel invested in the end game content when it takes me 2 days to get there, if that.

Overall same gripes as day 1 release, with new ones for making the game extremely casual.

There's stuff to collect and do all over the map. Some resources are node while others are scattered by biome(as it were). Mining is node based but plant and hide harvesting is different. There's plants and animals everywhere.

Fishing is super cool. There's fresh and salt water. There's also different types of bait that are more of less rare and used in certain types of water or times of day. There's also fishing spot you have to find that'll give you better fish.

There are no junk merchants. You either hoard your stuff, salvage it(good idea), or sell it to other players.

This game is actually very well made. I can't complain about the gameplay really but I was pretty pissed I gota spend another $30 just to get mounts and max level... Also, a two hour exp booster is five dollars... And there's several kinds of exp... So that bit was really like, wtf Amazon, for real?...

*Advice for marketing team... Give stuff away... Lot's of stuff... The games I've spent the most money on give stuff away all the time. For example, I've spent a few hunduns on Mech Warrior Online and they have events every month that give away free premium time, mechs, and cosmetic items. I just spent another $15 on MWO just in the past two weeks... I also have spent a good chunk of change on Warhammer Total War. I have 2,3 and several dlc packs. They also have free 'heros' and 'Legendary wards'.

I'm not going to spend $5 on a two hour booster... I suggest dropping the booster cost to $1 a day or $5 for a whole week. Make a super booster that costs $8 and gives you an exp boost for every exp type for a week.

I also suggest adding the ability to be different races. I'm a 'Furry' lover and would totally spend $ just to be a Cat dude in a video game...",1704050098,1704140967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why tell me your staff is made up of diverse staff at startup screen, like igaf? Why can't I make a character that looks decent? Why start with weapons I have no desire to play? Too cartoon like for me.

Pros

Good voice acting
Interesting story
Crafting and Gathering system is good
Combat is not your usual MMO style

Cons

Character customization is garbage, everyone is ugly. 
Start with weapons you don't want to play
Not able to create a unique character

1. This game is not worth full price and neither would the DLC considering the base game.( I dont own the DLC but it looks like a free money grab with very little content and just is there to block you from certain content such as mounts and other things)

2. There are still many bugs such as resource nodes not being able to be mined and the points of interest  not showing up on your compass after you do the first dungeon which is a 2021 BUG BTW.

3. You level up too quick here and it is next to pointless to create your own companies if the server is already established with players(which it always will be)

4. For people who use EU and ASIA servers the invasions and faction pvp events happen at times that are not realistically playable for most people so it becomes a dead event or an event where a few sweats can just dominate because everyone else dropped the game because of lack of content.

5. PvP and PvE is very fun especially the way how you assign attributes and weapon play and such but it is still rare for real pvp fights with people your own level if you just started so you will just get broken by max level players when taking points during territory wars.

6. Making in game currency in the game is easy as long as you do all the quests but looks like it falls off after the quests are done so you should use gold sparingly  because it is not an easy grind for end level stuff since they cap you at 10 crafts a day for certain items needed. 

Overall the game is OK at best  but very beautiful and has some cool lore and cut-scenes however all in all it is a game that doesnt really give you the  feel of you can play this for years as an MMO but is instead a like AAA game like COD that has a year lifespan in terms of gameplay and i mean that at the very best if I give them benefit of the doubt.",1704116863,1704116863,False,29,7,0.626707255840301514,0,True,False,False

Economy and crafting are so inaccessible that anyone other than a sweatlord living in the game will have absolutely 0 chance of crafting themselves viable equipment. Example; a crafting trophy which is required to craft viable equipment can be 35k+ gold and you need 3 of these. The average 20-40 minute game activity will give you around 350 gold if you reach a maximum score threshold.

Balance and PvP balance in particular are always in a sorry state and rotate around 1 or 2 particular playstyles being immensely overtuned.

Open world PvP is dead due to there being no reason to partake in it, even influence races boil down to entire companies running quests and avoiding combat due to this being the most effective route to victory. Devs promised to fix this in maybe 6 months lmao.

What it needs asap:

New multiplayer modes. How long can you play the same map over and over again? Who knows I guess we will see. It would be simple to repurpose assets that exist currently, say like Myrkguard. Make an instanced version and bam, new map.

More detailed events. Bro why is this not a thing? Its the most cliched gameplay when it comes to events. Kill X and obtain X trade it in for X, unless you already did it last year then do what youve been doing already because the event doesnt really give you much more.

The dungeons are nice and very thought out. They are challenging where they should be and have the right elements. But the pve is lacking. But It would be simple to update some of the older content to be at level with current level cap. Each week feels empty once you are geared. SImplest patch to gear for btw.

They are trying with the story but bro come on. Story matters, Flesh it out. Lore is a requirement to world building. Even after going through main questline I felt like a bystander helping rather than an adventurer conquering the obstacle.

I think AGS has a pretty steady release schedule when it comes to patches and whatnot but some things need hotfixes. Like some weapons are overpowered and tend to stay that way for far too long. A good for instance is in  the current comp a firestaff user can wear heavy armor and still be ridiculously effective whereas other classes become mediocre when put into heavy armor making them far too strong and almost forcing others to play the same broken class to compete. 

War loggers have ruined wars for everyone. The folks who run in wars rarely log on for any other content and basically pidgeonhold the experience. They play on multiple servers and only log on to play the wars. Winning the wars are extremely profitable leaving them with excess amounts of gold to gear their war parties making the gap between a new war company and their company immense. The entire process seems intimidating since it is players that hold the keys to this content. Some companies are able to hold multiple zones due to the use of shell companies that funnel the gold back to one company. This is broken. I have no idea what AGS can do to fix it but it needs a hard rework. 

Thats it. ITs a good game so Ill still give it the recommend, but I wish there was more to it.

[h3]TL;DR: Games good, give it a whirl[/h3] 

[b]Pros[/b] 
Early Game: The levelling process has been refined and improved since the release of ‘New World’. It’s far more satisfying and streamlined – albeit I tend to skip dialogue.

Combat: The combat is probably my favourite part of the game, it feels more rewarding and skill based than your typical ‘Tab Target’ games. The weapon selection is quite generous and fun to use, all of which feel unique and different. There are some slight balancing issues which don’t seem to be addressed timely.

Visuals: The visuals in the game are stunning, and generally really help with immersion in the game.

PvP: The PvP, hand in hand with the combat is really fun and rewarding as well, positioning, and knowledge regarding abilities and loadouts add another layer.

Endgame*: I think the current endgame content is great, with some selection to make the game more enjoyable:
a)	PvP: 3v3 option / Large scale / and encouraged open world PvP (Races)
b)	Expeditions: Plenty of these to do, with enhanced versions
c)	Chest Runs: Doing chest runs with loads of other people is good fun
d)	Artifact Farms

Trade Skills: All the trade skills are useful and play a part in the game.

[b]Cons[/b] 
Armour: Armour balancing needs adjusting, if you get someone knowledgeable enough with the gear, they can tank about 5 people, with a healer, they’re able to tank half an Outpost Rush team.

[i]Suggestion: Change damage increase from light armour to armour bypass/penetration, or potentially add mods into gear – where other mods are sacrificed, this obviously won’t be as effective on light – medium armour, but vs heavy armour could provide a reasonable counter.[/i] 

*Endgame: While the quality of the content is enjoyable and good, I think there are opportunities for improvement.

[i]Suggestion: Introduction of (a) raid(s) (Not just killing a giant worm) that require a 10 – 20 player team.[/i]

RUNNING.

I recently started playing again, and the experience in 2023 is MUCH better. The game is no longer just a running simulator. There are more quests and a better developed story.  Leveling is much more balanced.

At 40 hours admittedly I haven't reached end-game, nor have I purchased the expansion.  I've really enjoyed running around the zones exploring and harvesting, and what I've seen of the crafting is good.

Combat is ok, but not mind-blowing.  Quests are a mixed bag and the main plot is...somewhere between muddled and forgettable.

Not all what I want in an MMO, but it does a lot right. Crafting and gathering are meaningful, it rewards exploration, the combat is mostly pretty tight. The endgame is very much based around gathering your Best In Slot from various sources and then conquering all of the content. If you're tired of the usual grind, this is a good game to get into. The community is mostly pretty supportive (at least on Lilith) and you're bound to meet some interesting characters; as the party finder is pretty archaic and forces you to get involved with the community (I'm the rare sort that thinks that's a good thing). The combat is simple, and has great action components but not necessarily easy to master; you'll find some fairly challenging solo content as well as group content. My biggest gripe is that the quests are very standard fetch and ""kill x amount of mob"" quests.

___________________

The game COULD be fun, but there are so many glitched quests, bad level designs, and zero storyline. This game felt super rushed from day 1 and every update and patch since then has been to try and fix the hundreds of game breaking issues that were in the game during beta, that they didnt have time to fix. Here we are 3mo later, and many of the glitches and broken questlines are still in the game.

I was really curious about how the the company system was going to work. In theory, it sounds like a cool, interesting idea. But it doesnt take into account how entitled/selfish humans are. Companies have a lot of power, and there are no checks or counters to things the company leaders decide.

Well figured it was time to update this review (Steam kept asking me to) What can I say, the game still suffers from the same problems it always has.  In addition now it feels like nothing you do has any true meaning or reward.  BIS gear is simple to get now, Gold is easy to get, crafting is still bad, PVP is a joke, PVE is redundant. Companies are pointless as there is nothing to work towards togetherv(wars are a joke and usually just win traded or merc'ed out).  Was the original game and xpac worth the money, yes, do they have any staying power, HARD NO.

Played the game since initial launch. It's been a real mess and continues to be so.  I am currently on one of the most populated servers (EDEN), level 60, farmed my GS and Expertise to 590 and have good gear/weps (597 avg) with the right combo of stats and perks also have a full crafted Voidbent set (600 GS) for general content. I have basically participated in just about everything the game has to offer (outside of the new ""Mutations"") which are basically just a rehashing of current expeditions marketed as new content with the only real new mechanic being fire on the ground....

I have maybe played 30 minutes the past week because, well the game is just boring and still very broken.  They refuse to fix basic issues like desync and weapon imbalance.  When 30-40 out of 50 people in wars are running VG/IG, well there might be a problem.  They ask what the community wants and do the exact opposite.  As a player, I was able to weather all the various bugs and exploits and nonsense that came with this game the first few months, but at this point it's clear that the general direction of this game is moving away from what its player base wants.

I love this game. Easily my most played game on Steam. Over 2200 hours so far and I play every day. Always something to do whether running around and gathering materials and crafting or doing 40 v 40 outpost rush battles at 3am. The game is less than a year old and gets better with each patch.  It's much better than when I started in November of 2021 and it was already great then.  

Best of all? Unlike WoW or ESO no classes! You can be a mage one fight and a heavy armor tank the next or a nimble bowman after that by quickly changing your gear and moving your points around.

1. Game idea: You walk and you walk, and pick up a rock
2. Inventory management, probably one of the worst, even worse than BDO
3. Combat one of the worst, and i still cant believe people saying its one of the best (i imagine they only played NW).
4. Open world pvp, is completely non existent, not like i wanted tbh (smth like in Lineage 2 for example)
5. No trinity, no races, no classes, just get 2 weapons GG
6. Very few skills, and swaping to randomy smash skills
7. Dungeons are so dull nearly fell asleep once 
8. Chat systems, one of the worst. Same as in Bless (cant they make it with tabs like in TERA, AION, BNS, BDO, Lineage 2....
9. Finding guilds/clans whatever the name was, you cant in game, you need to check online, on discord like people have time for that. Im in the game, i LITERALLY want everything there dont need to check online whats the point
10. Game runs like shit, i played BDO Full Remastered mode with 100fs in combat, here sometimes wen 20fs (doesnt matter low, medium or high preset i put still ran like crap)
11. Game is mostly focused on Life Skill, LIKE WHY? cant they make a game with dungeons, raids, open world pvp, sieges, wars, CLASSES AND RACES, and every aspect that WILL MAKE I AN MMORPG? you go from quest to quest and WHAT, lets pick these rocks here for some reason.
12. Faction PVP is stupid IMO, in the end people will change faction and like in BnS, OPEN WORLD PVP WILL DIE.

Bugs :

missings Buffs
missing resources in Compass
perks counting wrong when switching gear sets
quest markers of the map
map icons of the map
territory colors of the map
cant interact with some items (E sign not showing up )
broken scoreboard in Outpostrush (20v20 PVP)
achivement notifications for all your unlocked titles pop uü when joining and leaving outpostrush (broken since release in 2021)

general bad things :

floaty controlls
constant stagger

badly designed UI :

perfect salvage notification in the middle of the screen so you can read the text of the next item you want to salvage.
barely any info about your characters stats like crit chance or damage reduction from armor
no health numbers buffs or debuffs in team ui and no role icons in expeditions (have to set them yourself every time).
teammate nameplates are hard to find when theres to many players
you cant check the current player of a expedition lobby before applying

very badly designed aggro system :

taunt will give the enemy a buff that forces them to attack you, but if they are running of to attack someone else they will do that first and then run back to you.
enemys randomly run to someone else that is far away, when you run into a grp first with no one else doing anything

unstable engine :

game can crash in loading screens when pressing any key or mouse button
disconnects  after leaving a expedition
random lag detected and disconnects

missing mmo features :

you cant inspect players gear


i could write more but i already spend to much time 


Edit 9 : after 2 years you think the pvp would be better, its even worse
Edit 8 : tried new player experience on a new server, floating assets, couldnt collect some plants, rare black screen flicker, first mount i see had no animation and just powerslided ...


Edit 7 : a year later and the winter event is still the same, with running to each city collecting presents ...
Edit 6 : Deluxe Edition advertises a Rock/Paper/Scissors emote SET. ( Rock, Paper, Scissors, a light-hearted game with friends or a tool for making difficult decisions.)

a set would contain multiple items, however its only one emote where it randomly chooses one of the 3 so you cant even choose on your own ...


Edit 5 : checked out the new event . you have to go to every city and faire every 18 hours to get your reward,some people dont have that time ....
Edit 4 : wanted to retry playing the game since i got myself a new gpu, 9700k and a 3080 and my cpu is maxed out in town reaching 55fps ..... game runs worse then  the last time i played

Edit 3 : i gave up on the game , the new systems and the winter event made me realize they have no idea how good progression and quests systems should work
they keep adding parasitic systems and shores you have to do daily , thats just no fun



Edit 2 : another broken patch, into the void goes the game
ingame store selling way to many items in this short ammount of time
also i dont get why they are selling so many emotes for an mmo...
they should be free to begin with

Edit : amazon game studios is clearly incompetent enough they are kicking afk player of the server instead of implementing a system to stop the overpopulation of the server

i changed server 4 times i had to delete my level 15-20 chars everytime so i can get a server where there no que 


i had no ques for the last 5 days but now im level 35 and i get ques of 500 people


they havent lerned from the betas
servers are full even the new created ones are full
people still able skin my mob kills ...
you cant dye cosmetic items / skins
you cant transmog items, only skins from the shop or twitch drops or twitch prime
they havent fixed a bug that got reported in the closed beta
you have struggles to hit enemys that are above or below you when you fight on uneven terrain
you can use 2 of the same weapon type with different skins
character creation is very limited like all other western mmos wich is very dissapointing, with no way to change hairstyles or the look of your character after creating it
extremly unbalance pvp , some weapons are extremly overpowered 

game feels like a indie game
bad translations for other languages
no transparency for mechanics skills etc
a lot of bugs, gamebreaking exploits



emotes in my chat are still in the users clients language 
rock paper scissor emote should have been 3 seperate emotes so you can play against others",1632817105,1703844848,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never jumped in when it first came out because I knew there was a TON of bugs and issues. Seems to have all worked itself out. For the most part. I did have a HARD crash at about the 3 hour mark. Still, other than that, no issues. Game play is the same MMO grind in any other game. Combat is about the same. There doesn't seem to be a ""lock-on"" ability so that's kind of annoying. Especially since they advertise the combat as ""fluid"" and it's anything but that. Sure, you can dodge and roll and block but other than that it doesn't serve any big purpose. I guess if you get much higher levels that block may help. Or not. I don't know. It's still decent enough. No MMO has ever made it into territory that combat is aces. Not a single one. 

Crafting really seems to be the heart of this game though. Pretty much every single starting quest is to familiarize yourself with crafting and collecting basics. Helpful enough I guess. Crafting does seem to be very deep and involved so that's a plus. On the downside there's hardly any gear made for people 0-35. It's all top tier stuff and level based, so, meh. 

It isn't breaking any ground in the graphical department either. Many other MMOs LOOK and play much nicer. Even with everything cranked to the highest my 3080 looked at the game sideways and was wondering if it was gonna start something. It didn't. Still, it isn't ugly and it doesn have some really good level and set design happening in the earlier areas. 

If you are thinking about jumping on board it is FUN. It's EASILY worth the $15 asking price on sale right now. If you (or me) can't get that amount of enjoyment out of it we should probably quit MMOs in general. Just sayin. LOL.",1703839233,1703839233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has alot of design that is toxic on the players. Those design punish the players for no reason.

Take for example, the artifact. You have to kill many strong mobs/bosses to unlock the perks on the artifact. After that, you have to use a lot of money to upgrade the artifact. And if you don't upgrade it (because you love all the default perks and don't want to spend tonnes of $ to upgrade to a perk that you don't like compared to the default one), and you abandon the quest (to upgrade it), you lost all the perks on the artifact you work so hard for. And you just lost tonnes of hardwork with a single click without any warning. There is no in-game warning that you gonna lost a lot of hardwork and to double confirm you click. No warning at all. 

Why then you need to abandon those artifact quest? Because there is cap of 5 such quests. And if you already reach the max cap, you cannot unlock the perks for the 6th artifact you collected. So you are forced to upgrade your first 5 artifacts whether you like it or not. 

There a lot of other games that make you feel good and powerful in-game. This game is not one of those. In fact it do the opposite to make you feel sad. The more you play, the more you suffer. This game makes you feel small. I am already at max gear score of 700 and there are many difficult quests and mobs that I still cannot defeat. It is not about group play. There are many difficult soul trials fighting difficult boss that are part of the main quest line that you have to complete solo without any grouping. So what do you want me to do? I already reach the max BIS slot gear on every slots and I still feel difficult to play this game and cannot progress the main quest line. BTW I eventually cleared those soul trial but with a lot of tries and frustration and suffering along the way. I feel so frustrated playing this game than feeling challenged and entertained.

There are a lot of other games that will make you happier and entertained. Not this one. This game inflict more suffering than entertainment and enjoyment. Therefore I don't recommend it unless you are a self-sadist yourself.",1703834043,1703834043,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visual artists would appreciate the World and its lush environments too (and the Crytek devs might learn a thing or two about optimisation from it). MMORPG.com rated highly the game after its DLC release, so I decided to give it a go. It's a pleasing and relaxing game to the point of feeling like a holiday (especially my main high-octane MP competitive game). The gathering and crafting are the best I have encountered so far - no button smashing for half an hour or anything, just press a button and wait a few seconds. Fighting requires some skill but it's on the easier side. The critique of mounts and other ""nice things"" being behind the paywall are not entirely fair because it doesn't have subscription (unlike FFXIV or EVE) but still needs funds for the further development. And no GOTCHAs like in other popular MMOs these days - all fair and square. Do I recommend it? Yes, because I am also betting on this game's future - I believe it will progress from ""very good"" to ""great"" (keeping my fingers crossed).

Obviously big part of the playerbase will not buy this or any other DLC for various reasons, which means that these players will be behind in everything and ultimately they will just stop playing, making the game even more dead.",1632861287,1703813289,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Additionally, if you have a penchant for exhaustive grinding without tangible rewards, coupled with a season pass that leans heavily towards a pay-to-win model, this game could catch your interest.

Update Nov 2023: The game is finally where it should have been at launch. Lame that you have to buy the dlc to get the feeling of a full game. Still one of the better MMO's out there. Thumbs up for the game and thumbs down for shady business practice. I still stand by the rest of the review.

Initially I gave this a thumbs down and I still think the reasons are valid but at 40(now 300+ at edit) hours of game play not including alpha time after waiting for it to mature for a year. Then I give it a hesitant thumbs up.

It's still a soulless game that breaks no new ground. The combat is immensely satisfying. They made a beautiful world. The soundscape is really good. The atmosphere is middling-good. The ambiance is great. The questing system is a baked turd and the story is annoying(Get outta my head lady)).

Sure i had to pay an extra 40$ to make it an enjoyable experience, but it is indeed more enjoyable now. The mount physics and speed are done well enough once you upgrade the mount system thru in game quests.
There are still imbalances to weapons but i can overlook that for now. Probably bothers max lvl people entrenched in endgame progression/pvp alot. It'll get changed eventually. Updates seem to be a bit of a slow progressing along but they do come (sometimes making things worse....to be honest).

And the new appearance system is actually quite good. You can get cpl transmog tokens each season for free or drop a few bucks for extra.

Don't buy this game if you don't want a download simulator. I played many MMO's before but when they have an update, they don't want you to download the full game even for smallest changes. This one expects us to redownload the game few times a week even for a small bugfix.

The queues? Those are inexcusably bad.

Those are definitely reasons why I've completely reversed my opinion of the game for the time being. 

I cannot recommend the game in the state it is in today.

---

UPDATE: This game has seen VAST improvements. Lots of quality of life improvements: mounts, cheaper fast travel, improved queues, fewer client-authoritative decisions, etc.. Moreover, they have added a lot of story and season pass content which gives daily activities to complete, both of which instill more sense of ""purpose"" in playing the game.

My main remaining complaints are: 

1) You really need to play this game on an SSD, otherwise you will notice massive disk activity leading to lag spikes when you enter towns.

2) If you want certain pieces of gear, expect to run the same instance ad nauseum. We've repeated the same instance 10x and still not seen a piece I wanted drop. They really need to have some kind of ""mercy"" system in play. I'm all for replayability, but 10x starts to become a slog.

3) We need more dynamic open world content: more open world boss spawns, or even just things for color.

4) Some of the bugs that crop up are perplexing for a big player like Amazon. For instance, my entire access to the expansion zone was inexplicably reset with an update and I had to redo the quest that opens it back up and reaquire all the POIs. It wasn't a massive inconvenience, but it's annoying when things like this happen.

5) Maybe I'm just doing it wrong, but PvP seems pretty unbalanced. Certain weapon and gear combos absolutely dominate others and it's not a paper-rock-scissors sort of thing.

See my negative review below...but I'm reversing course and i have appreciated all the fixes put in to this game. I now recommend it. 


Previous review: 
I LOVED this game, but now I feel like I wasted my time. This game is fun garbage. Levels 1-60 is a fun grind. After 60, nothing makes sense. 

I was hoping for this game to bring me back to my WoW days...and it did for a time. Levels 1-60 are that boring grind that I absolutely love. Questing is weird because you can't share quests, so making friends and questing is out of the question.

Then there are the bugs. So many bugs and weird glitches. One thing is fixed, another breaks.

Then there is the PVP. This is why I wanted an mmo. I want to play the pvp games. The pvp game is called outpost rush and it is the worst thing I've ever played. Again things happen that don't make sense. For example, you have to kill a powerful ghost on the island to ""lock"" out the other team from scoring points for several minutes. first team to damage the ghost most and kill it gets the perk. Our team runs in, kills the other team attacking the ghost (who only damaged it 25%), finished killing the ghost, and somehow our point bar gets locked instead of theirs. NOTHING IN THIS GAME MAKES SENSE.

Don't waste your time. It was a fun idea...an MMO without a subscription, but this is the definition of ""you get what you pay for"".",1639700446,1703550438,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Adding mounts (must pay), more content, etc. Here is my unbiased critique. This game has had the potential to be good, unfortunately it gives no alternative  to middle ground resources.. its a ladder, must get that to make that to make this to make that but oh you need this resource you can get on the market or farm from chest around the map that will take hours... I spent a lot of time on life skills and it is just not worth it. 

PVP; I love pvp and well this is the thing you give you option slots to load your build, which is really nice. Though if you playing anything but an overpowered build, your screwed. You have to have heartgems, you have to have certain perks or people will just live forever. Combat takes a very long time, and thats because even in this new update healers are overpowered. Healers in my maybe biased opinion are just ovoerpowered. I had 10 guys on a healer, they just soak it up because they heal so much, instant healing with pots, skills, and perks. Its crazy that they are a light build soaking up damage. Healers do dedicate alot of time to just healing but on the side also have to potential to put out damage. 

In short, dont waste your time this game keeps updating and """" BALANCING """". PVP is broken, life skill takes foreverr with really little positive return. Mounts I believe are pay wall locked and SEASON PASS IS PAY TO WIN. If you got money in your pocket you can just out right buy the whole season, get over 20k gold and unlock better items, potions, gypsum for gear, etc.. I would rather play BDO and thats a hard pill to even swallow. At least with that P2W I can get better benefits. The P2W is more like faster progression in this game nothing ground breaking.

I personally find the lore uninteresting and mash through all quest dialogue, simply following the objectives, and I enjoy it well enough that way. I also play Final Fantasy XIV so all my ""reading and caring about story"" effort goes there.

Sadly, this deficiency in evolving PvP content adds another layer to the overall disappointment.

It probably was one of the better game purchases I have done in a very long time. 
I bought games that were more expensive but played for less time. I still have not started the expansions quests by this time, plenty of stuff that keeps me busy for now. Take your time and enjoy the game from the beginning, don't rush through it.

The game is not perfect, but there probably aren't many perfect games out there these days.
The sound and graphics quality is amazing. The combat is great. The classless system is great. 
The story is ok, but do not buy this for this story is what I would say.

Will the game still be entertaining after 500 or 1000 hours? Maybe not, but by then the purchase price was well worth it.

Will you be able to keep playing this forever without purchasing more expansions? No, if they want to keep this game running for 10years they need some form of income to maintain it. But if you still like the game, why not buy the next expansion and keep playing it? If not, well then enjoy what you purchased now.

Let's see here:
1. Became unresponsive and crashed on FIRST LOADING, even before opening main menu of the game.

3. After beating tutorial, the first spawn place - my commands/keys just became unresponsive. All except enter, at which point I could chat with fellows around me at least since when in chat, my keys worked just fine. 
4. After restarting the game, waiting another queue, I started playing finally. What happened next will shock you - I was getting stuck behind stuff in game, just cause I wanted to explore the world, seems like jump wouldn't trigger at correct times and would be severely laggy, but not in the server way just as in command for jump wasn't being received even. 
5. Hitboxes were shit, if enemy is at even a slight height from me - no way I can hit that with any sword. 
6. Even on sale, ain't worth the price, because for final complaint - the graphics, which I don't really mind all that much if the trees looked even slightly better. But no. On very high settings I'd expect lights, shadows, particles - none of that.

You take some time apart from New World, but there's not much else out there that can compete. You have a whirlwind romance with ESO or some Warhammer Fantasy CoOp, and a couple years later New World looks good. They say they've grown. You give it another try. And while its clear they're a little better, they've grown in a direction you don't particularly enjoy. Its different from what you hoped for, not quite what you two originally talked about.

First of all I have encountered more bugs in the game than in my last trip to the forest. 
1. Unable to finish the main quest due to the fact that the NPC will not spawn (this is not a minor bug like walking through textures. It's a major issue Amazon, a major issue!)
- what is the devs reply on this? 
That they are working on it. 
How about working on it before asking 66,98€ for the full game?
2. Unable to see the traps in the expedition.
- basically I had to rely on my friends to tell me where to move in order to not be dead.
I guess your reply will be that I have to change my system. 
I bet you this is not the case.
However it would be again nice to offer us a game that is playable for those 66,98€ that you are asking.
3. Now to end the nightmare, today, I just logged into the game, to finish the ""Season Pass"" which basically is the way they are saying to buy that f***ing DLC because else you are not able to finish all the cards nor to get the mount which is an asset/perk/mechanic, not an item. 
As I was saying, I started to play, and then, I found out the nicest surprise, because this is Christmas time.
All my waypoints from the Wilds were gone. 
Sorry?
Gone! 
Meaning I have to spend more time to reach each waypoint?
Basically besides all the minor issues that this game has, it does not deserve the money.

So now the question is. If The Day Before was reported for fraud. How is this different Amazon/Relentless Studios.. And the funny part is that we as players have the proof that your game does not work.

Please do not try to point fingers at other players that do not have this bugged version. 
As we paid the same money/amount for the game.

I know you do not care, or that maybe nobody will read this. 
But I did my part as a consumer.

Thank you and goodbye.

My two top reasons: 
1) Every update seems to introduce new issues and that takes a number of patches to iron out.

The PvP part of this game is just... bad. If you want to only PvE, then this review is not for you. But if you want to only PvE, idk why would play this game either, when ESO and WoW have way more PvE content than NW. 

I'm here to say that I wouldn't recommend this game, because of the state of PvP. 

There 5 ways to PvP: OPR, Arenas, Wars, overworld while flagged for it, and Influence races.

Wars don't matter for what seems to be at least 90% of players. Only 50 people participate in a war on each side at a time, and a lot of good war players have multiple accounts, and do wars across regions, even. Just assume you won't get into a War. 

Influence races are technically PvP, but they are only at specific times. Not great for people who plan their game time around their lives in my opinion. 

Overworld while flagged is just what it sounds like, pretty meh. Most people won't flag, it's not worth the effort usually. Flagging gives PvE bonuses, so I'm guessing that most flagged people, aren't really interested in PvPing anyways. 

There are 2 Arena maps, and only one in circulation at a time. So you get 1 3v3 Arena map for weeks at a time. 

There is only 1 OPR map! 1! Who cares if you're good at PvP when the primary mode only has 1 map?

Just don't buy this game or the expansion imo. I got time into it, sure, but if you have $70 to spend, there are other titles out there worth the money more. 

The devs could fix all of this by balancing certain weapons/armors, and by adding PvP maps. This game should have a lot more maps for how big it is.",1699924525,1703184398,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

now i'm over a hundred hours in and feel like i can write at least a halfway informed one.

I like the gathering a lot even if it's quite hard to farm sometimes.

the action combat feels amazing and some perks for your weapons improve these skills aswell (like applying weakness on top of poison through the poison cloud arrow)

the story isn't the best i have ever seen or anything but the characters were likable and well voiced

the pvp has a level system and there are faction races for controll of an area and guild can take controll of citys and start town missions that improve crafting stations.

crafting is ok. you have the resources and you craft the objects. there are some objects with which you can apply buffs or define perks

overall i like the game and would recommend it.

The *real* content is the PvP, but it's numerically unplayable until you hit max level, and now that max level is behind a $30 paywall.

Most servers end up with everyone jumping on the bandwagon of whichever faction with the most land, because when you're not in your faction's territory, you pay more for basic utility services.

New World's creation is a case study in Sunk Cost fallacy. Amazon Game Studios went through a rotating door of massively overpaid creative directors and design leads and it shows.
It's original story line (the heart of any RPG) was ripped out and replaced with a forgettable grind of kill/collect quests.
If you want what the original vision/story, go play Greedfall. 
It's shameful that they want $30 for the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, when it's just $30 of polish on a turd.
Basic quality of life improvements like mounts and a new weapon class, should have been added in a update,but the base game map is too small for mounts.
How are they still charging $40 for the base game?

New World is what lowest common denominator design looks like.
Enemies are cut, paste, and recolor. That was normal back in 2004, but not 20 years later.
The most exciting moment I've had recently, was the other day I ran into a ""new"" enemy. It turned out to be a re-skinned wolf with the same 3 attacks.
The player animations are weird. I dare a reasonable person to watch any of the video's and tell me the running animation looks like it was created after 2005.   
It's a game about sailors, but they can't swim.
It's a game about colonists, but they have no one to colonize.
It has 3 warring factions, but every player has the same backstory and tutorial, so there's no reason for 3 factions.

Lots of gold/item duping bugs that have tanked the economy when it was already tanking with so many people posting items and undercutting that everything was basically worthless.. so much so it was much more effective to just buy new weapons/armor as you would have gained a few levels and anything your brought from the auction house would have cost you roughly the same as it would to repair an item.

Portals had major issues and have been disabled a few times since release already.
Outpost rush has been disabled since release until recently and several ways to abuse the map have been found already.
PvP in general has had issues & plagued with bugs to the point it was being abused to capture zones etc. 
Throw in lag during big skirmishes and pvp is a joke too.

I really wanted to start a game from its infancy and see it evolve into a popular game and be one of the ""OG"" players. At the start there were a LOT of bugs, and gold/item duping. This is the first MMO I have ever played that shut down the trading between players and auction house, and they have done so on multiple occasions. After about a year and a half, things started to improve a little at a time. Season 1 and 2 were mostly enjoyable. 

However, Seasons 3 and 4 are getting significantly worse. Season 3 wiped the gear from all the prior gameplay. They made it significantly easier to get BiS gear, but significantly more difficult to make any money in the game unless you own territory which generates cash. Regular players struggled to make ends meet, the about of farming needed for materials for end-game crafting was exceeding 10 hours a day, and there was a daily money sink to get the items needed to craft necessary gear for end-game activities. On top of that, the best method of making money previously was selling gear drops from mutated expeditions, but they nerfed this so that almost every drop is now bound to the player and there is nothing to sell. It became a money sink to also do mutations because of the consumables required to do them. 

They also introduced races and have nearly wiped out invasions as they used to be done. The day-to-day gameplay is forced into specific 2-4 hour sections of the evening and you are no longer able to play how you want, when you want. If you want to push a territory, you can only do so for 45 minutes every 3 days at a specific time. Are you in Europe, Asia, etc? Too bad, you never get to do this content now. Want to do invasions? We only do them in large bulk 3 days on 3 days off, and half the time they are being reset or cancelled. As a strong company you can easily hold 6 territories and milk money from the server with this system as AGS has set a schedule for everything so you are never threatened by over exerting yourself. 

With the introduction of Season 4, not only was this the buggiest patch I think they never introduced, it had the least content of any major releases. They released new artifacts, which are just gear items that have additional perks. They released a new dungeon that is 10 minutes long, has the most boring end-game boss which is a re-skin of a previous boss, and features 2 extra bosses that also are just re-skins of previous bosses. The dungeon mechanics are just to run through, pull mobs into a clump, and kill them. It is brain dead, and boring. 

The only savior for Season 4 was the winter event, that they then nerfed so that players will have to log in every day to be able to get enough credit to be able to afford the rewards. This is their version of creating content and making their numbers appear higher. Many of my friends have stopped playing as the meta for pvp is absolute dogwater - everyone is in heavy and has infinite healing and/or CC so it is just a slap fest with no killing. 

Then they post a video of their roadmap for the next 6 months that has almost nothing on it that would be considered new content. There is nothing to encourage you to continue to play. This is like attending a school field trip where AGS holds your hand through all content, everything is strictly scheduled and there is no freedom of play.",1702997737,1702997921,False,593,41,0.886177003383636475,0,True,False,False

  Over the years i've come to realize that it doesn't matter how ""good"" or ""bad"" a game is, if the the ""support"" sucks, you're going to run into that as a big issues at some point, inevitably, and it will affect your gaming experience with that game. 
  I enjoyed (past-tense for a reason) the game, for the most part, though there were quite a few things about it that I had issues with, but they aren't my main source of annoyance in this review, nor my main point. 
 Support. I had, on several occasions, items simply disappear form my inventory. I contacted support, and the responses I received in return first off showed that they didn't even read my message. As a matter of fact, having dealt with MANY companies whom always seem to send some sort of ""cookie-cutter"" and pre-formatted response to your first message, I learned to TRY to prevent the first waste of time of their response, which makes me have to then tell them to ""Go back, and RE-READ what I said, you obviously DID NOT,"" by adding in my email: ""Please read carefully, and don't suggest the things i've already preemptively told you I have ALREADY tried, to solve the issue, Thank you."" Does it help...?...Not really, and not often, but I try.  Back to the point. The first message was literally suggesting things like ""check again,"" and ""are you sure,"" and other such moronic suggestions, AND suggestions I LITERALLY added to my first message to tell them I ALREADY TRIED. 
  Then, I had to respond, point out that i've already attempted their suggestions, and that I explained that in my last message to them which is clearly documented, & then respectfully requesting that they go read it again. Then I get a response, essentially accusing me of lying. They didn't say I ""lied,"" but their every comment was essentially telling me I must have lied. I don't need to say ""You're a liar,"" to call you a ""liar."" So, I respond, by pointing out that i'm not fabricating, and actually have better things to do, and that it's not like i'm asking for money, I just want the items back that disappeared. 
  They respond confirming the items were in my possession, & that they are no longer there (well NO S%$T, Sherlock, that's why I contacted YOU, ffs. Wow.). I thought...""Good, so now we are getting somewhere."" Nope. They at that point told me it must have been my fault, in some way, and that was essentially their final comment to me. 
  I responded, again explaining, and asking them to look into it. 
  At that point, all communication ceased, and they essentially told me to ""Go F yourself."" Not only the above, but it was as if each email ignored a large majority of what I had ALREADY explained, and as such required re-explaining, and re-typing, and trying, in vain, to get them to understand basic statements made. They either don't speak English in any meaningful and efficient way, OR they just don't care to deal with the issues their player encounter. 
  At that point, I uninstalled the game, and decided i'd not waste more of my time, & especially not any more money, on such horrible, useless, and trash ""support."" 
  You experience may vary, but this WAS my experience. Trying to get them to even understands, or read and acknowledge, was tantamount to trying to get a mentally-retarded, blind, deaf chimpanzee who was also just hit on the head with a hammer...to understand Astrophysics. It just didn't happen, and the end result was predictable. It's not the items, nor the game, it's the lack of logical, reasonable comprehension, communication, and acknowledgment in any meaningful way, followed by being called a liar, ignoring what I actually had thoroughly documented as what I had done to seek a resolution, then just silence and no responses. I've dealt with ""burger-flippers"" at McDonalds who had more investment in good customer support, than the people I dealt with in this game's ""support"" department. 
   If you have other games to play, or you don't mind HORRIBLE alleged ""support,"" and possibly being called a liar repeatedly, then being ignored...buy this game. Otherwise, i'd suggest, strenuously, that you avoid the game, because at the end of the day, ""good game"" is pointless if when an inevitable issue arises, you have no chance to get to a successful ""fix,"" because those responsible for such couldn't care less about your issue, and will do everything in their power to ignore, deny, insult, and then cease any attempt to help fix the issue. The issue was NOT on my end. It was with their game. Even if it were, their communication, and approach, was worthless, and horrible.
Edited to Add: There are MANY bugs, in this game. That happens, but it's the ""Support"" that makes the difference when it comes to whether the game bugs are able to be dealt with. Their ""support"" is almost non-existent, and what ""support"" they offer is nothing short of annoying, frustrating, and useless. If you're thinking about buying this game, just go to the nearest bridge, throw the amount of money you would have spent over the side, then hit yourself in the pubic are at least twice, and save yourself the pain and aggravation.

I am enjoying it so far, the scenery is fantastic, graphics are beautiful. I love how you can chop most trees, mine most rocks, etc. in the game.

Combat is awesome, no classes, just equipped weapons. No restrictions on what kind of gear to use - light, medium, or heavy which changes combat style, but is viable with any weapon.

The game story is fantastic and almost fully voice-acted which is a huge plus as I hate reading quest logs.

There are a few negatives I've come across:
- while 90% of quests are voiced, some are missing. Some don't match with written text, some are missing a sentence...
- movement is quite scuffed at times
- no swimming
- snowing INSIDE buildings in the Great Cleave zone! (perhaps others too...)
- sometimes you get in-game cut-scenes or voiced dialogue without warning, with no option to replay or see subtitles. I've had this several times in the middle of combat, with no idea what the voice-over narrator said because they were drowned out by other noises.
- you can get attacked while speaking to NPCs. I like to listen for voiced narration, suddenly get interrupted because some NPC spawned...
- The Map can be very busy, with so many icons. Filters exist, but you need to toggle every type one by one... 
- Gear and their set bonuses are super unclear and confusing what said bonuses even do or what weapon peace of gear is for...

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The sound is fantastic.
Gameplay is what you would expect.
Progression feels satisfying.   You get gear often, you get crafting materials often.  You FEEL like you're progressing.   The market is saturated enough for decent levelling gear to be cheap, unlike another mmo where it is the exact opposite.

The game could be great.  Unfortunately, I still can't recommend this game.

The problems I am encountering: 
In-game bugs that stop you from progressing the main story quest line.  Do understand that the MSQ opens up things to the player they're going to need at later levels.  You can go screw around doing other things, hit max level, and not discovered dungeons or actual equipment you need.   And these are self-inflicted bugs.   I also see people saying the house (the game has instanced housing, people decorate their house, etc.) they have been working on for years is now Empty.   Everything is gone.    On my second or third day playing, the server crashed 4 times in an hour.    Nothing like being in the middle of a big fight and...  dumped to character select.

Finding/Discovering Dungeons (or encoutners as they're called) - could be related to above?  Ive heard there is six or seven (surprisingly low number there) and people are saying one is broken.. I wouldn't know.   I can't seem to find them, get instructions on finding them, or progress the MSQ to the point of finding them.   That's pretty game-breaking.

The help channel shouldn't even exist, no one uses it or answers questions (and you will have plenty)

As with any MMO, the population will have a certain amount of toxicity - that is the nature of the beast.   With some the toxicity is low (BDO) and with some the toxicity is high (Rust).   This one lands in the middle, but leans more towards the high end..  I'd say 6.5 on a Ten Scale.   That is not to say there aren't helpful people.   You can find help outside of the game...  but you really shouldn't have to.  It should be explained better inside the game, and I shouldn't have to go to a Discord Channel for someone to explain the game to me.   That is the game's job, and it is pretty poor at it.

At the end of the day, the game is ""okay"" - It could be a LOT better, and with the big bank behind it (Amazon) you would think it would be supported better and not have as many bugs created by the developers and missed by QA (if QA Exists, I'm not sure it does).

My original review was a ""no"" because of stability and lack of any instruction on progression.  The stability (for me anyway) has been fixed.   The servers crashing has slowed quite a bit, but still happens once in awhile.  

But, I cannot being myself to say ""yes"" to this game, even now..  and it is a damn shame..  because this game could be so, so much better.",1646597396,1702910690,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back after two years and still long ques to log into game. No one wants to buy a game and battle pass they can't play. Still a dumpster fire they haven't fix ques or crappy hit boxes. Player animation is so scuff and clunky. 

I'm going to give you most honest review. ( 1000 hours played) If you are looking for smooth weapon swapping combat. Buy GW2. New World on other hand is a unfinished project rushed to make money. They should have never released game at this state ever. By far clunkiest combat I have ever seen in all the 8 MMO's i have sunk hours into. The servers this game runs on is complete garbage. Game is build around war system but the system can't support it. With awful game lag and rubber banding. High  Ping/ Latency is all over the place. NO central US servers.. WTF? Remember this is just the base of the game core mechanics. That's not even all the other atrocious issues that this game has. I will give you better list of MMOs to choose from.

GW2 For clean pvp with smooth weapon swapping. Level playing field in PVP gear. Story of game not so great.

World of War Craft - Yes it has had a downfall. But has lots of classes and great pvp system. Game story is best there is.

DCUO- PvP has huge learning curve nut can be fun after getting it down. Love the DC Universe story for comic lovers. Down side is pain to catch up with other people in gear and skill points. 

Final Fantasy- Great for furry lovers if you into that",1642365275,1702866307,False,3,0,0.50777202844619751,0,True,False,False

- Movement is goofy

- Offroad mounting speed is frustratingly slow, why is that even a thing?
- Sooo much material gathering that is very irritating and gets in the way of the core gameplay
- Changing your attributes (for when you want to play different roles) costs in-game currency
- In general, the game is extremely repetitive
- For those who care about immersion breaking; the game heavily leans towards a ""progressive"" political tune. Examples like: 90% of the quest givers/important NPCs are all women, armor is not gender locked, you can literally wear a dress as a male character, and there's also a personal pronoun option that isn't visible to other players, not sure why that's even there.

Character Customization – it is better than some, but not by much. If you are looking for deep customization look elsewhere.

World - It is gorgeous with great attention to detail. The variety of plants and animals is extensive at first and then you will notice a theme. I do not know if they got lazy, rushed, or ran out of funding. But there is SO MUCH copy and pasting of structures with new paint slapped on throughout the world. Same houses in different cities, same structures and layouts in Elite Areas and Dungeons. Then NEW city they released in the paid expansion did not even bother to have different houses in the same city they are just the exact same house painted differently. Just pathetic.

Town Management - The idea of having to work to upgrade and maintain stations has the possibility of being cool and worthwhile. But they made it too easy and there are basically no penalties for losing control of the town and there is no point to even really fighting for it. Even most things you craft do not even need to crafted in high level benches. Great thought but poor implementation.

Housing - Coolish on the personal level, except the variety sucks from most cities to cities. With 10 cities only 6 different styles the other 4 are just recycles. Plus, they really need company housing or at minimum a company chest.

Questing/Dungeons/Soul Trials - The game started out rather good to be honest. The story was eh, but you had to team up to go through dungeons like a regular MMO. Later they added to the story and added Brimstone and when they did that, they gave an option to either go through a solo quest line or team up and go through the dungeons. This was an awesome idea, and it was implemented well. Then for some stupid reason when they released the newest expansion, they thought it was a good idea to completely make dungeons irrelevant to the main story line. The story side and main story only brings you through the first two dungeons and then one to complete the base games msq. It completely ignores 4+ dungeons the main story used to bring you through, now they are completely disjointed from the game. The main story and side story don't even bring you into half of the world’s zones. Then to top it off there are mini dungeons that they call soul trials that you must do solo. It is as if they tried to change all of the story into a solo player game. Bring back the options keep the solo soul trials for the people who want to play alone, but also give the option for a group dungeon.
Gathering - Some things are easy to get others, at times, feel impossible because of bots and lack of nodes.
Crafting - Too many worthless things to craft that nobody wants or buys. Some things take forever to level, and it seems like the developers want to force every crafter to max every type of crafting skill to be an effective crafter, for no reason. You can literally farm almost everything you could ever want in the entire with the exception of specific furniture, foods, and potions. Everything else you can get better, or good enough from farming mobs, mini bosses, or dungeons, everything drops. IMO crafting for the most part is worthless. 

Music – It is fun, the different songs are great, but the buffs don’t scale with difficulty. Great Idea – poor implementation

Mounts – Fun, well built. Races are fun till you complete them once, and then you are done. Races should be repeatable with tracked completion times. And speaking of races, they had difficult long races to complete at first, but nerfed them and made them for the newbs. No challenges left. 

The Expansion - Great, in concept, horrible execution. You can tell and see them make changes that show they intended the area to be a much higher difficulty than what it is now, and they constantly nerf the difficulty across the board. It could be a fun, challenging, group required mmo, that they turned into a novice difficulty solo player game in a mmo setting.

So, in summary – I can tell, this game is built on and has a bunch of great, poorly implemented ideas, often broken things that shouldn’t be broken, chests with no rewards, the random un-completable quest lines, randomly broken mechanics, disappearing furnishings and pointless foundational MMO game functions, i.e. crafting. It has the possibility of being great, but they keep breaking things that shouldn’t be broken and nerfing things that shouldn’t be nerfed. 

Can I recommend it, in its current, constantly degrading stage - Unfortunately no

New World is the only MMO with a modern combat system in the world
u can play PVE like a modern Souls Games
or u can play PVP like a Modern Game CO-OP Game that requires a lot of skills and has the potential to be an ESPORT Competitive game
and New World is the Only MMO that offers this, New World is the best even with its many flaws as an MMO.

- if you hate Tab / auto aim, with 20 active abilities, and you love Action combat, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU 
- if you have only 2 - 4 hours to play in each day, this game for you, don't require Hard core or rushing

Amazon Game Studios have had every opportunity in the last 2 years to get their $#!@ together, but nothing has changed. 

The game is still a buggy mess, there is nothing the developers touch that isn't worse off than before, the design decisions are absurd and there is frequent and recurring immoral practices in place, as to what is communicated and when (if at all), to take advantage of players. 

Based on my experiences and time in game, I can say with absolute certainty:
     * No one from Amazon Game Studios are gamers, nor do they play their own game;
     * No one from Amazon Game Studios has any real MMO experience, either as a developer or player;
     * Amazon Game Studios is completely divorced from reality, it seems they exist in their own hyper-insular bubble that is totally disconnected from the real world;
     * Your time, as a player, will not be respected - if anything, it will be abused. 

If Amazon Game Studios weren't being propped up by the broader Amazon group, it would have gone under shortly after release. I am disgusted companies like this continue to exist and push such appalling quality products & services.

Set in the mysterious and supernatural land of Aeternum, this game offers a fresh take on the MMO genre, providing a dynamic and immersive experience for both solo and group adventurers.

One of the standout features of ""New World"" is its meticulously crafted game world. Aeternum is a diverse and breathtaking landscape, ranging from lush forests and towering mountains to eerie swamps and mystical ruins. The attention to detail in the environmental design creates a sense of wonder and discovery, encouraging players to explore every nook and cranny.

The game's emphasis on player agency is evident in its robust crafting and gathering systems. ""New World"" allows players to harvest resources, craft gear, and even build settlements. The economy is driven by player-driven markets, adding a layer of depth to the virtual society. The crafting system is intuitive, and the variety of available professions provides ample opportunities for specialization.

Combat in ""New World"" is action-oriented and engaging. Players can choose from a variety of weapons, each with its unique playstyle, and the real-time combat requires strategic thinking and skillful execution. The inclusion of a dynamic territory control system introduces large-scale PvP battles, where factions compete for dominance over key regions, adding a political layer to the game.

The game's character progression system offers flexibility, allowing players to mix and match skills from different weapon trees and specializations. This flexibility caters to various playstyles and encourages experimentation, ensuring that players can tailor their characters to suit their preferences.

""New World"" also succeeds in fostering a sense of community. Joining a faction, participating in wars, and engaging in large-scale expeditions with fellow players contribute to a vibrant and social gaming experience. The inclusion of PvE content, such as corrupted breaches and powerful world bosses, adds variety to the gameplay and provides challenges for both solo and group play.

However, it's important to note that ""New World"" had a few issues at launch, including server queues and balancing concerns. Amazon Games has demonstrated a commitment to addressing these issues through regular updates and communication with the player base.

In conclusion, ""New World"" is a captivating and ambitious entry into the MMO genre. Its combination of stunning visuals, dynamic gameplay systems, and a player-driven world creates an immersive and engaging experience. While it faced some challenges at launch, the ongoing commitment to improvement and the potential for future content updates make ""New World"" a promising and exciting frontier for MMO enthusiasts looking to embark on a grand adventure.

The game has gotten much better.  A number of my gripes from before have been addressed.  Its still a grind fest, but at least it feels nicer to play.  I had enough fun faffing around that I got the xpac so i could do a little more.  Not sure about the grouping though, I've been solo while lvling and crafting except for a few very short groups to do some main quest choke points that i was kind of over level'd for.


OG:
Grindy, but not fun grind.

- Movement is brutal slow
- Animations are slow and clunky
- The jump is pointless
- Mantling is hit and miss and annoying
- Trade skill is a grind hidden inside a grind, sprinkled with grind with a side of grind
- PvP is annoying at best... If PvE is clunky, imagine PvP.
- Group combat is as previously stated by other reviewers a left click fest seasoned with occasional abilities...
- Want to grind a group dungeon for phat lewts or crafting mats?!... Well that means you'll need to grind harvesting, trade skills, faction quests and then corruptions for uncommon drops.  If you don't want to do all of that, you'll be like half the server population and stand by the dungeon entrance spamming ""LF someone with key to [insert dungeon] then GTG!""
- Rare drop crafting mats from dungeons create worse gear than the random drop gear from the dungeon.  So you grind harvesting, grind trade skill, faction grind, and corruption grind... in order to grind dungeons for rare drops for crappier loot?  What in the actual f...

Healing, cause that's what i like to play...
- Aggro management for tanks is a mess and sketchy at best.  Abilities to reliably control mob aggro are severely lacking.
- DPS generally have no idea how to control aggro as everyone just spams max deeps all the time
- Healing aggro is too high for the healing rates even with aggro reduction gems
- Single target heals is a nightmare.  You have to use the scr.oll wheel to target party members.  Sure you can try to use the visual cue out on the battlefield, but its not easy to distinguish if you have the right person targeted in the melee ball at the mob's feet.  Its easier to use the party window for single heal targeting... However, The party member window is a tiny little list off to the far left of your screen so you're forced to take your eyes off of combat which means your not re-positioning mobs that have aggroed on you back into the tank's range, watching for boss big move tells, etc...

Character creation: Agree with the others who say it's too basic and doesn't have enough options.  It feels like character creation from the 90's.  There definitely needs to be more options in order to make your character feel more unique rather than just another cookie cutter avatar among all the rest that practically all look the same.

Tutorial: Wish there was an option to skip the tutorial after the first time through.  It's feels more like a delay to letting you play the game than an actual tutorial.

Leveling: Doing the main story quest and other quests to level 40 feels a little grindy but overall it keeps your attention and is fun.  I did find that after lvl 40, it becomes ridiculously more difficult to survive.  I'll admit to not being a very good player when it comes to combat, which is why I avoid PvP, but having to play on maps that are 10 levels lower than your character level just to not die every fight gets annoying.  Just an assumption, but it seems the difficulty intentionally jumps drastically at lvl 40 in an effort to force players to group?  I have found myself discarding my beloved musket, hatchet and medium armor for heavy armor, sword and shield just in order to feel like I have a chance at completing quests at my level.

Resource Gathering and Crafting: I've enjoyed the gathering side of the game, lots of nodes available.  Unfortunately the game economy is a bit unusual.  Most materials are currently only selling for what amounts to pennies (fraction of a coin) each, while armor, weapons, etc. sell for hundreds or thousands of coins.  Gathering doesn't really seem to be a viable source of income at the moment.  I am still learning the crafting, but so far it seems pretty straight forward and not too difficult.  Though most of the beginner level crafting items aren't worth trying to sell on the market, pennies again.  They really should do away with the pennies, even selling something for 1 coin would feel better than .01 coin.

Housing:  There is a free house available in the early area, but after that it'll cost you 5k, 10k, or 20k coins to buy a house on each map.  So far I haven't really found a reason to waste my coin on buying one.  Especially when you move to different maps as you level up, essentially making the house you bought in a lower level map no longer useful.

Chat: Don't kid yourself into thinking you'll get a non-toxic response to a question in World Chat, but isn't that how most games are these days?  There are helpful players who will DM you to help if they see you need it in World Chat.  But the good news is, you can mute any chat channel you chose to.  World Chat was the first one I muted.  Lol.

Overall:  I have and still am enjoying the game and recommend it to others.  Like all games it has it's issues and downsides.  I have been lucky enough not to experience any bugs yet, other than an occasional having to kill something twice to get quest credit.",1702476033,1702476033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was unfinished and felt more like a beta than a complete game. However, I played on launch and loved it. I put about 200 hours into the game in the first four weeks. I ended up quitting the game for about a year due to the repetitiveness. A lot of the mobs were the same back then and the game lacked depth. 

I am writing this review at the end of 2023 going into 2024. The game is very different and much improved since its launch. The developers clearly listened to the criticism it got from its community and has churned out a well polished, wonderful MMORPG. I highly encourage any person who enjoyed New World on launch to come back to the game now. 

Some of my favorite things about New World are the combat mechanics, difficulty level of open world solo leveling, gathering & crafting materials, liveliness of the environment, soundtrack, visuals, and the overall ambiance of the world. If you're someone who enjoys getting lost in a beautiful game and challenging yourself with fighting monsters/demons, you will enjoy New World.

Things New World could improve on: Raids, Dungeons/Expeditions, Towns/Cities/Settlements, and the addition of aerial foes such as dragons, wyverns, hawks, eagles, vultures, wraiths, etc. 

New World is a unique game that has the potential to be one of the best MMORPGs on the market. A lot will hinge on their next major expansion. I hope we see another large zone added with diverse terrain and mobs as well as a unique settlement and endgame character to fight.

Turns out there have been many changes to the game, most notably quality of life improvements, that have made the game much more fun to play.  I'm only 47 hours in to playing, but what I have played so far has been quite enjoyable.  The game can be quite difficult at times, especially if you play solo, but it's not impossibly hard. I have discovered in my experience when I have run into a difficult spot that I just couldn't beat as a solo player, I asked for help people were happy to comply.  

There is one thing in particular I feel I need to mention to those players that are not a fan of game focused on PVP.  While yes there is much end game content focused on PVP, you can play this game PVE and never have to touch PVP once, and still have a ton to do!

All in all I am glad I finally gave this game a try now, especially after the horrible launch it had.  I would recommend buying it when it's on sale and since it is a buy to play game with no monthly fee, you have nothing to lose except your initial purchase price.  I have seen the base game as low as $15, although I did choose to purchase the expansion as well which was not on sale at additional $40.

The only thing that is keeping me playing this game is my boyfriend and the friends I made through it. We came back for the expansion and while it was great to begin with, content has staled again. Wars are still fun to a degree. Influence races are enjoyable. Arenas and OPR feel stale again. Rewards for end game content are not rewarding, and the gold economy is so bad that if you're not consistently grinding gold it is unlikely you will be able to purchase gear that is end game as quickly as you should be able too. 

I will never be free. Freedom was a 2 year old illusion.

They don't play this game anymore due to lack of content / bugs / bordem / politics etc

Positive: Something fresh for me, you actually need to block and take care about minion mechanics and so on.

Negative: 
Holy... this game is 3 Years old and still buggy as hell. But thats not all, if you need help (For example i got a char which got stuck between crates), you are just lost because amazon refuses you to chat within the first 3 days of playing. Slow servers, bugs and bad game design decisions. 

Edit: After playing ~35 more hours of this game... its P2W (Mounts) and full of Bots.

Edit2: I thought about giving it another chance. WTF is going on? A message, that they fucked up the Patch over half the screen which DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO SEE ANYTHING!!!!! Never ever saw something that stupid.

Environment is pretty. There's a lot going on, and a lot to do. You can follow the story or explore. Multitudes of possibilities. 

The shine is lost quickly. The map is huge, like Fallout 76 huge, and you get XP for 95% of anything done. That's weird, because the level cap is 60 or 65 with DLC, and you can easily hit level 20-30 just messing around in the start zone. You pick up a lot of gear, but it's all junk. This becomes evident when you learn the route, head to the nearest town, and craft your own stuff with scant materials and no experience-you get weapons and armor that you won't receive as a reward for 15 or 20 levels. It's OP as hell but why not? There are ranged weapons! Muskets are cool looking AF, but they all suck. Except for some limited utility (game hunting) you will find that using them in combat is a frustrating slog. Every single melee weapon works-faster, more effectively, at much lower gear levels.

There are no passive skills I'm aware of. Weapons require skills to use effectively. You'll see ""something cool"" in every category, but it's surrounded by useless fluff. There are augments to skills-almost all of them are tied to the skill itself and do nothing, otherwise.

The respawn rate is bananas. The cool wildlife you see at the beginning becomes annoying AF quickly. God damn, spazzy wolves...you'll soon wish you could invest in animal repellent. There are at least 3 missions early on with crappy objective markers, tons of visual distractions, and constant respawning enemies. You are required to complete these missions, and you will not enjoy them.

I want to preface that this isn't coming off the backs of some salty sessions or a rage-out review, this is just honest thoughts after 1400 hours and talking to other players who've come to the same conclusion. 

I don't know what it is exactly about new world, but a huge swathe of the community are just complete lobotomites. They don't understand basic systems like threat or how to even build their character. 
Its genuinely jarring and weird how players can spend 20 hours playing the game to reach lvl 65, and have 0 grasp of the systems they've been interfacing with. 

The end game public PVE experience half the time, will consist of tanks wont run tank setups, healers who pull aggro before a fights even started, and DPS players blaming the other two roles for xyz, when in reality they die in 1 hit because they don't have the appropriate prerequisite gear.  

half the time an M3 dungeon will be easier than an M2 or M1 because these aforementioned swamp creatures actually need to clear M2 and M1 to apply for it

- Repetitive and boring quests
- No meaningful endgame loop 
- New content takes way too long to come out
- Lack of transparency around how perks *actually* work (no stats page, no damage meters, no awareness around perk caps etc)
- Unnecessarily over-complicated crafting system.

I really like that there's no classes and you can basically just do whatever you want. And the fact that you can harvest basically everything you can see (chop trees hit rocks ect.) is really cool and makes the world feel really interactive. I haven't done much PVP but that's been a blast the few times I've done it. Crafting is also neat and easy to understand. Also I really like the instruments in game cuz when you play them you play this little rhythm game minigame that I find a lot of fun. You can also add people to your performance and have a little band.

However I do have a small gripe about how sometimes if you're in a populated lobby and there's a lot of people in town your FPS can tank pretty hard. Also PVP has a very high level of entry. in order to be competitive in PVP you've basically got to buy the expansion and be max level (65 as of time of writing review).

But season 4 is coming soon and I'm really looking forward to that. If you're thinking about buying New World I'd definitely go ahead.

The combat is actually somewhat enjoyable, I describe it as what ESO combat should have been (except for the fire and life staff, staff weapon animations+VFX look and feel just as bad to use in this game as they do in ESO). The gathering system is very RuneScape which I enjoy, minus having proper mining locations which just make it a bigger pain than it has to be if you want ore or rocks. The faction/openworld PvP system was not well thought out at all, it's like they didn't consider the long-term effects one faction dominating an entire server would have on the games population. The questing is terrible, there is backtracking left and right since one NPC cannot give you more than a single quest at a time. The fishing and music skills are fun, probably the only things I have nothing bad to say about. And now my rant about what I find most baffling about this game....

People go on and on about how good the game looks, and while I agree it can have some nice visuals if you have a really great PC rig.... character models look like they stepped out of Fable 2 (saying this is me being generous), the majority of armor looks goofy beyond belief, and character creation is worse than games that came out 10+ years ago and it's options are simply terrible. Amazon really seemed to make the odd choice to dump all their funding/resources into making the plants abundant and the trees sway in the wind.
Then the art direction. The one thing that did pull my interest to this game was the more realistic, colonial aesthetic.... only for Amazon to release weird, Disney looking pastel armors left and right. Then with the Rise of the Angry Earth update it's gone even farther away from the original concept.

(1) There is no endgame. It's a long climb to nothing. Level the farming/trade skills? That'll cost a ton of time/gold yet top-level crafting is barely even profitable. Level your char and play PvE? You'll get sick of the same 6 dungeons in about 3 days, no matter how many mutations they create (which are no value added). Want to PvP? Unless you're a full sweat tryhard you can't do Wars; OPR and Arena are niche build sweaties; and open world PvP is majorly under-represented.

(2) The game is too PvE heavy. It started as an open sandbox. Not anymore. All I hear from positive reviews is ""it looks good."" Well, for those of us who don't live for pixel sunsets, it's about gameplay, and the PvP elements are severely lackluster. The arena and outpost matches are dog water. AGS shows zero interest in improving them (even in simple ways). The open world PvP is pretty great but literally the last priority of the developers.

(3) It's Amazon. So if you're into mega-corporation woke nonsense, this is your developer. I just got my first significant ban in any game ever during decades of gaming. Why? Because, very much in context, I quoted a guy as saying ""ching chong"" in global chat. Apparently that hit a ban filter because I didn't get a warning, didn't get a 24-hour ban, I caught a 7-day ban. It doesn't bother me much because of #1 and #2 above, and I'm already bored with the expansion, but this is typical Amazon corporate trash server moderation.

I literally said one ""no-no"" word as a quote, one time, and I got a 7-day. Despite the supremely toxic stuff that happens in-game with no consequences. Despite the incredible bug problems in-game that AGS can't fix. They can find one guy saying one word they don't like and immediately over-punish.

So, yeah, don't waste your time/money. Good luck. Eat it, AGS.",1702044290,1702047139,False,2,1,0.518650293350219727,0,True,False,False

Video Review: https://youtu.be/bWGvzs-DIPA

As of 2023, New World has undergone significant transformations with the latest expansion, 'Rise of the Angry Earth,' and various updates in between. The graphics and visuals are a standout masterpiece, offering a captivating blend of modern realism and enchanting vibrancy, accompanied by a superb sound quality that enhances the immersive experience.

The beginner experience has improved with a revamped levelling system and more engaging narratives. Character progression has seen a comprehensive overhaul, with the removal of gear expertise and an expanded level cap to 65. Crafting and gathering, a pivotal aspect of progression, has extended to max levels 250, with notable improvements and added depth.

The combat system is high-speed and action-packed, requiring strategic planning and skilful execution. The PvE content has seen significant updates and expansions, including seasonal content, but in-game events have become somewhat repetitive. The recent expansion brought refinements to the expedition system, although difficulties in group formation persist.

On the PvP front, the introduction of influence races adds a refreshing addition, and endgame content now includes 10-player and 20-player raids, with leaderboards for healthy competition. However, there's still a noticeable gap in supplementary activities and content.

The community dynamics show a solid core player base but carry a seasonal undertone, with occasional spikes in activity and subsequent declines. The developers have maintained effective communication, and the monetization strategy has evolved with the introduction of a seasonal battle pass and expansion purchases.

In conclusion, New World offers an enjoyable initial experience with captivating visuals, engaging combat, and immersive crafting. However, its long-term engagement falls short compared to established MMOs, lacking substantial content for sustained play. The endgame experience leaves room for improvement, with the emphasis on joining a company and engaging in PvP for continued engagement. Despite its shortcomings, the initial purchase is justified for ample hours of content, but the game feels more like a seasonal MMO, drawing players back only for updates or expansions. The potential for a more extensive, lore-rich experience could be realized in future iterations from Amazon Games.",1702041265,1702041426,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

While i enjoy the game a ton there are a few cons to know about before picking it up.

-(Movement) The games base movement feels very basic and with the lack of a sprint mechanic you will find yourself running around at what feels like a snails pace quite a bit. They recently added mounts to help speed up travel around the map but it does require you to purchase the expansion they are locked behind.

-(Navigation) Navigating around the map is fairly easy and its fun discovering new locations to search for secrets. There are a ton of fast travel locations scattered around the map to make travel easier, But in the early game it can be quite difficult to accumulate enough of the fast travel currency to afford multiple travels. The world also feels alive with the countless  players you will come across to either engage in spontaneous battles, Group up to fight enemies together, Or just to chat or trade with.

-(Combat) The combat is engaging and all the abilities with the different weapon classes feel impact full and unique, Unfortunately there are a few weapons the feel designed for pvp and don't feel good to use in pve activities and there are some weapon abilities that are bugged and just don't work.

-(Enemies) While it may feel like there are a ton of enemy types in the game once you play enough you will start to notice that a lot of the ""different"" enemy types are actually just re-skins of previous enemy types you faced, But the developers have been adding more unique enemies to the game to prevent the pve from feeling repetitive.

-(Mechanics) There's quite a few mechanics in New world such as  a carry weight system that changes your move speed and effectiveness of your dodging, Each piece of gear you obtain will have multiple perks that makes build crafting fun, And a perk system that makes spending your level up points feel impact full to your play style. The map also includes territory control for each faction that gives the controlling faction of a territory bonuses while in the territory such as free fast traveling, Reduced taxes for crafting and selling items, And exclusive chests that can only be opened by members of the faction that currently controls the territory.

-(Economy) The economy in New World is completely player driven which makes you feel immersed in the world. the only complaint i would have with the economy is due to excessive amounts of bots and gold duplicating depending on the server you decide to join the prices will be inflated and certain items will cost insane amounts of gold to purchase. If you want to avoid playing on a server with a inflated market due to gold duplicating then the recently added fresh start servers are for you.

-(Crafting and Gathering) Gathering resources and crafting gear in New world can be fun when starting out but if you choose to try and max your crafting and gathering skills you will notice how long and grindy the process is. For gathering you will end up spending hours an hours just running around mining the same few ore nodes, Chopping the same few higher tier trees that are clustered near each other, Or running back and forth in the same field picking the same 10 Hemp bushes just to level your gathering skills to a decent level. When it comes to leveling the crafting skills its unfortunately worse, In order to max your crafting skills you will end up finding yourself gathering thousands of the same resource or spending tens of thousands of coin on the resources to craft hundreds of the same item just to get the most crafting experience per craft.

Overall i really enjoyed my time spent in New World, While the game does have some major flaws here and there the developers have been regularly updating the game with bug fixes and quality of life updates. It's a ton of fun to play and has a ton of engaging content but it also has a bunch of bugs and some content that is locked behind having to mindlessly grind the same activity over and over hundreds or even thousands of times, Or even inaccessible without a huge group to play with.

Overall i would rate the game a 7/10.",1701941188,1701941188,True,0,0,0.489690721035003662,0,True,False,False

On the MMORPG scale I'd give it about a 6.5/10, it's not revolutionary, it's not even trying anything new, but it's a decent game especially for it's large casual audience. Economically it has some massive issues, there's not really a lot of traditional Raid and Dungeon content to get invested in, and I'm at the point where I wholeheartedly believe the developers spend 20 minutes fishing or decorating their house for every 1 minute they spend PvPing.

New World makes dramatic changes to PvP balance on a whim after people complain about something, your favorite build is never safe unless you're on Fire Staff it seems. More than likely you'll have entire seasons where what you play is nerfed by a percentage that completely negates any empowering or bonuses you can stack on your gear, i.e +7% damage on your jewelry, +5 stacks of +2% damage on your main gear, nearly negated by a 14% damage nerf specifically for your weapon that's applied before you even consider what kind of Damage Resistance the other player has on their armor. They added INT scaling to weapon Archetypes that have historically been pure STR and STR scaling to Archetypes that have historically been pure INT and then people run things like Abyss Great Axe / Fire Staff because Axe has the best AoE Crowd Control and one of the best gap closers in the game, and Fire Staff has the uncontested best gapcloser/escape in the game combined with the absolute best ranged damage in the game, let alone the fact that it's all magic damage with AoE splash or cleave attatched to it. It's like the old weapon balancing and development team left and the new team came in to try to spice the game up which is cool and dandy, but they opened the floodgates for perfect builds to exist. No downsides, no flaws, no quirks that make it difficult and no way any build that doesn't have AoE stapled to everything could possibly be considered as-valuable outside of 3v3s, specifically and in the hands of a really great player with a healer and a serious melee within their composition. They dunked on muskets and bows and then turned around to develop functional access to weapon compositions that never existed before, and completely counter setups that were already struggling, struggling not just with damage output in general but struggling with visibility in large fights, struggling to do damage to targets that, you did as a matter of fact hit, as you can see by the big blue ""Dodged"" notification that flies out of their character mid roll, but unfortunately immunity-frames are immunity-frames and it doesn't matter that you're actually aiming, predicting your shots and connecting a slow moving projectile with someone frantically sprinting towards you while bobbing and weaving back and forth. He pressed his dodge button and he's immune to your damage.

Straight up would not recommend this to anyone who wanted to play a Musket or a Bow at this point, I'm not sure they'll ever ease up on these weapon archetypes at this stage considering a majority of the best Archers gave up and if they didn't they're not even bringing their bows to Wars. It sucks when you really have a specific playstyle you enjoy and the developers at a company allow for changes so dramatic that you're not able to feel safe investing time into something you enjoy, even if it's not Bows or Muskets, because the reality is we're just a few too many complaints away from Great Axe or Greatsword being on the chopping block. What's worse is knowing they'll let you sit there for entire seasons being completely out of competition with the meta. You could hire a pocket healer and try to stay competitive or bully one of your friends into being your healer, but the fact is you'll probably still die to weapon pairings that seem like an oversight because of what they can be built to do (that they've never been able to do effectively until the recent addition of specific artifacts that break down the dichotomy that's always existed: Heavy Weapons = Strength, Magic Weapons = Intelligence, snappy fast Reflex Weapons = Dexterity.) Even with a healer hitting all their heals, you're probably going to be combo'd to death unless you sacrificed a very useful and very desirable extra source of damage or Crowd Control in the form of a Heartrune like Bile Bomb, Grasping Vines or Detonate, to run what basically amounts to World of Warcraft's Crowd Control Trinket with 10% fortify on it for 5 seconds, and consider, this requires the Heartrune to be available for use in the first place and realistically even the heal from Stalwart Heartrune of Stoneskin isn't going to save you by itself, it's going to give you enough space to run away, back into the backline where you get to chug potions and fire off pitiful amounts of damage once again. 

In my opinion if such a large percentage of the community was trying out Bows and Muskets in OPR/World Content that they had to completely annihilate musket, and tone Bow down to a pea shooter against everyone besides people that can't dodge and are simultaneously in a light-load, it seems like the nerfs cut out two skill weapons that people were having fun on. I understand the issue with allowing ranged weapons to become too strong in a game where melee exists but at this point I don't think you can kill a heavy that's aware that you're shooting him even if he only uses potions. I'm pretty sure a guy standing still in a heavy build would be able to loop potions on you forever, it's crazy that when you headshot these guys from ungodly distances, your reward for hitting such difficult to land shots is less than 10% of their total health, even when taking advantage of all the empowering bonuses of the entire Bow tree against full health targets, against targets you haven't hit recently and from heavy attack opening shots. It gets worse after the first shot as well, because more than half of your sources of empowering disappear after that first shot. It's tragic watching your damage not even be a factor in a team fight after spending time putting a character together, and honestly it's a big ""fuck you"" to everyone who mains these builds because what they want from you is to not only hit for you to hit 100% of your shots, but to hit 100% of your shots as headshots, through dodges, through rolls, through a slow projectile, through either a giant blob of nameplates that block out the sun when you have Visible Nameplates set high, or through nearly no nameplates unless you're looking directly at a target hiding in the bushes when you turn Visible Nameplates down. 

They have a really great idea, an MMORPG that has aim requirements if you seek them out, an MMORPG that blends shooters and RPGs together for a game that's beautiful in a lot of ways if I'm being honest, but in practice it leaves you feeling like you need to join the guys on Fire Staff or Great Axe/Warhammer/Spear/Rapier if you don't just become a healer so you're universally useful.

Had I done a bit more research beforehand, I would have quickly discovered its MMO nature, a genre I typically shy away from due to its notorious grindiness. However, much to my surprise, New World managed to captivate me in ways I hadn't anticipated.

Despite my initial reservations about MMOs and their tendency to be excessively grindy, New World presented a refreshing experience that kept me engaged for a surprising 80 hours—quite a feat considering my usual reservations about the genre. The multiplayer aspect of the game, in particular, stood out as a fascinating gameplay element. The way it was implemented added a layer of enjoyment that I hadn't encountered in other MMOs.

I find myself in a peculiar position of recommending this game wholeheartedly, especially to those who have an affinity for MMOs. If you're a fan of the genre, you're likely to have a rewarding and immersive experience with New World. Despite my initial misjudgment and lack of research, the game managed to win me over with its unique multiplayer dynamics and overall gameplay.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that my perspective is based on the 80 hours I invested in the game, and it's been a while since I last played. While my positive experiences linger in memory, the potential for changes and updates in the game could alter the experience for newcomers. It's always advisable to stay informed and updated before making a purchase decision.

In conclusion, if you're contemplating buying New World and have an appreciation for MMOs, I would recommend it. Just make sure you do the necessary research to avoid the initial misstep I made, diving headfirst into a new game without understanding its genre.

Still enjoying the game.  Reminds me very much of Fallout76 patches one step forward , several backwards.  The new grinds introduced in 1.1 aren't fun and just make activities even more grindy.  Great if you enjoy the game and wanted water mark and crafting to take even longer to complete.  

Overall game has some good foundations.  It's missing variety to keep playing it and balance.  There are only a handful of weapons, yet only 3 are really viable for pvp.  Having only 3 skills per weapon (out of 6) seems great but does get old.  It lacks the depth of FF14.  Not sure I'd recommend it to most people now.  Hoping they can make changes to bring more choices.

The Good:
-Nice environments, the art direction is good, locations can feel believable.

-Nice sound design, lots of small little sounds accompany your character, like the scraping of armour plates or the little clicking of metal and wood on your gun.

-The UI is nice and simple and pretty straight forward.

-The fighting is somewhat decent, with headshots, dodging and blocking mechanics.

-I have enjoyed the classless character build style, even if I would have preferred a class based style.

-I have encountered no bugs or performance issues.

The Bad:
-The gameplay feels so outdated. Talk to an NPC about a very generic problem that requires you to hear/read a wall of text, then kill x mobs or collect x pointless items. There are other poorer mmos like Elder Scroll that at least varies its quests design.

-There is nothing gripping about the story, it just feels like an excuse to cover up generic quest design.

-The voice acting is just awful, seriously, morning cartoon of the late 80's had similar or better voice overs.

-Poor to terrible character art style with almost no customization, and almost no haircut options  for African descendant people except for 2. Maybe you might not care, but some of us enjoy playing a non-white character.

-The writing is  terrible, every character sounds written by an old dude trying to guess what edgy teenagers sounds like in order to appeal to a younger audience. They even mention the accuracy of the real world people/faiths at the start of the game, but it is absolutely moronic to believe that all of these cultures from all over the world would somehow coexist in this time period, especially if your skin tone did not match another, but guess what? They are all great pals! Racism and religious hatred never existed don't you know?

-If you want to play a ranged build, forget it, even though the game has free aim, it uses the outdated kite mechanic in which if you manage to find a safe spot where to damage your enemy without them being able to damage you back, it will regenerate health and give you a big middle finger. This is just utterly ridiculous in a modern mmo. Do you understand the actually concept of ranged? The advantage being that you can hit your enemies and they cannot hit you if you outsmart them? Imagine if a bunch of barbarians during a fight with the Romans put themselves on the edges of a river, and the roman smartly put themselves at the top of the ravine, shooting them all down, but then the chief barbarian goes ""nope, not a fair fight, fuck you"" and regenerates. Even if you disagree with this, sometimes enemies regenerates just because a tiny pebble stands between them and you and fail to find the obvious path around it. The kiting mechanic is a lazy work-around to poor level design. Crap all you want on Fallout 76 but it doesn't have this dumb mechanic.

-The world feels ""dead"" as in everyone is an NPC for your convenience, there are no people walking around, living their lives. Taverns are empty, stalls for you to craft weapons or cook have no blacksmiths or chefs. It feels that only players and quest givers exists.

-Not a big deal for everyone but on a personal note, the lack of an RP support, like server tags or even communities which usually gives me purpose to stick around long after the game has lost its appeal are non-existent.",1701649952,1701701540,False,2,0,0.482491731643676758,0,True,False,False

Set in the visually stunning Aeternum, the game combines survival elements with a player-driven economy, offering an immersive experience. It breaks the traditional MMO mold with a classless, real-time action combat system that emphasizes skill and precision. Character development is deeply engaging, with a focus on leveling up personal attributes, weapon, and trade skills. The game's first major expansion, ""Rise of the Angry Earth,"" introduced in October 2023, added new content and story elements, reflecting the developers' commitment to evolving the game's world.

Despite its strengths, ""New World"" initially faced criticism for its grindy progression system, but significant improvements have made it more engaging. It's particularly commendable for solo players, offering opportunities to forge in-game friendships and collaborate to achieve goals.

3.) Company System (Guilds). I cannot edit rank privileges, rank names, or anything about the company except for the MotD, Icon, and the guild name. Its just a place to park your money and that's it. 
4.) Faction Wars. Unless you're in the top pvp companies with best in slot gear you will not be participating in this game mode.

P2w: Not officialy but the RMT in this game is crazy.

You need a good computer with Nvm.e SSD and a good processor, or you're gonna experience lag spikes, bad fps and freezing. This game is not very well optimized, ping can be high for no reason and you can get disconnected out of nothing. Game crashes a lot, even if you have a good computer.

- Character creation: awful, not many options for face and you cannot customize the body at all. Most of faces and hairs are ugly. Cannot change your character appearance neither the name after you create it, so keep that in mind.

- Leveling: fun! The open world has lots of areas to explore, tons of resources to gather (gathering system is the best!!). Quests won't give you good gear, better to buy something on the trading post if you need. Choose DPS weapons to lvl even if you pretend to be a healer or it's gonna be annoying to progress. The story is a bit silly imo, needs improvement still (it was way worse).

- Factions: 3 factions you can choose by lvl 20 ish, but factions won't affect much of your game in this early stage. But it's good to level up your faction rank by doing pve or pvp quests everyday. Later on, factions will be needed to buy faction exclusive items for crafting, lvl your pvp rank, join a guild and if you desire, try the wars.

- Crafting: useful and require lots of resources to max lvl. Can b a pain on end game as well and a way to make gold.

- Gear: now on season 3/4 it's pretty easy to get gear, so easy that became boring.

- Mounts: you need to be lvl 25 and need the DLC Rise of the Angry Earth to be able to ride mounts. Mounts does not fly or swim. This is a very simple feature. Only one type of mount with a few skins available. Most of the time it glitches and looks like it's riding a skate.

- Transmog: you can drop transmog token from Elite chests all over the open world or dungeons (1 per week), or even buy in the cash shop. You're gonna need 1 token per item you need to transmog, then you can use that item as much as you want after that, so for a whole set you're gonna need 7 tokens (included weapons). Not many skins are good tho, most characters looks like clowns.

- Dyes: you can craft dyes, but the pretty ones are in the cash shop with a long rotation that takes months to come back. So if you love white dye you need to stock up, which end up being very expensive.

- Community: very toxic in general, specially with new players. No one wants to teach you anything. This game does NOT have MMORPG community. Most of its players came from all other kind of game genre, so it's pretty hard to create that feeling of a long lasting community I've had on other MMOrpg. 

- PvP modes: Opr 20v20 (1 map), Arena 3v3 (2 maps), wars (50v50). Influence races (all factions 50v50v50). Wars looks more like a Guild v Guild thing it's schedule between guilds and the leaders pick up the members they want for the board. Ofc only the most skilled ones will be picked. 
Influence races happens in the evening and anyone can join, but if there's a lot of people you're gonna be teleported back to town. Opr and Arena you can join anytime once you're max lvl.

- PvE endgame: Elite chest runs (big crowds of players together to loot special chests in areas with elite mobs), organized by players in different times. Mutated dungeons (only 2 dungeons get a different mutation per week, so it might take a while for the dungeon you desire to come back in rotation). Mutations has 3 lvls, but m1 and m2 are very very very easy. So yes that means you need to keep repeating only 1 or 2 dungeons the whole week, and can only do it 35 times. Sometimes Amazon repeats the dungeons and makes a mess with it and the same dungeon stays mutated for 2 or 3 weeks, which means you can do only the same dungeon (that usually takes 20 minutes more or less for 2 whoel weeks or more).
There are no raids. There's 1 trial, a sandworm, with 20 people that only a few groups does it (usually guilds, extremely rare to find pugs).

- Bugs: YES! All kinds that can drive you nuts sometimes. They fix one bug and other 10 MAJOR bugs appears

- Storage: a pain to manage it.

- QoL features: missing a bunch of those. Not gonna lie, the game has improved a lot on this aspect but still missing many others.

- Housing: Fun, with many nice items, but the ones from cash shop takes forever to come back (a whole year), and some doesn't even come back. Many items can be dropped or crafted. It's not very customizable like ffxiv or ESO, but you can have some fun with it if you like this feature.

- Gear set (load outs): changes your gear easily, but does not change skill sets or attributes, which is bad, very bad. You can buy up to 9 in the cash shop.

- War System: as I've mentioned above, the war system is for a small group of people, mostly a GvG. A guild that wins a war can control a territory for some time (until some other guild takes it), and they receive all the tax money from the trading post, housing and crafting from that territory, so they can make tons of gold, they also control the lvl from the craft stations and the town buffs for better gathering and crafting quality for the whole server. However, many guilds only takes control of the territory and couldn't care less about craft stations or buffs, which affects ALL players in the server and it's a PAIN in the A S S.
New players won't be picked for wars, specially in legacy servers. Most servers has 2 guilds controlling everything which makes hard for new or not skilled players to join and play this part of the game.

- Game does not have API open, so no mods or good features are allowed. No dps meter, no way to measure if your weapon is bad or good or if you did well. No chat log either.

- RANGED WEAPONS: If you love to be mage or a bard just forget about it, unless you only pvp. Players won't allow you to use ranged weapons in end game dungeons (mutated m3). 

- Rare items: no. not much grinding nowadays for anything.

- PvP open world: you can find pvp usually near the forts from each territory.

- They add new content every new season (every 3 months). But when that season ends they remove the content. This is so bad imo, feels like the game never has enough for a good long lasting end game, which makes it feels empty and boring pretty fast.

- BOTS AND RMT: YES, TONS! Remember those guild that wins wars I've mentioned above? They make enough to sell the gold for dollars. It's way less gold nowadays, but still a lot compared to normal players.

- Healers: if you love to play as a healer in other MMORPG you need to know that in New World healers are very different, at least for me, a person that played Aion, Gw2 and FFXIV for many years. It's annoying to select a group member in the group list, you don't have many skills, and I trully dislike all healers skills. But that's me, you probably should check gameplay on youtube or twitch.

- If you say or do something to someone from a big guild they mass report you and you get banned. Amazon won't even check it.

- In the end: it's a game to spend a month playing. It's online so you can meet some people. The combat is action, not so good IMO, but people seems to love it. There are no swimming or boats even tho it's kind of a pirate ish game. 

 It has an official discord community moderated by Amazon/AGS but it's very strict and you're gonna get banned just by saying words like ""i'm noob in this game"" or ""not many people in my server now, feels empty"". All the bug reports and announcements are made on their discord, so if you get banned for those silly reasons you're dammed.

they have Mutated dungeons in 3 different increased difficulty levels for better loot and rewards. Problem is if you haven't been playing the game since the beginning nobody wants to do the Original difficulty which is required before you can progress to Mutated. so that is broken !!

the looting system is great , if you help kill it you get loot, but people in this game are GREEDY !!!! their are not enough resources to go around and it takes far too long and too many materials to level your trade skills. to the point i have almost completely lost interest in the game all together ! and unless your one of the people who buy gold from gold selling web sights you cant afford to buy the stuff on the Auction house.. 
so tell me again where is the fun in this game? if you like wandering around clicking on every node you see to gather it to try to bank enough stuff to eventually get your trade skills up then this is the game for you !

I haven't done any PvP so I can't speak to that but it looks engaging enough. I'm sure once I hit max level and start to do endgame stuff that more irritating things will come to light but right now it's pretty good.

Visuals/Aesthetic - 9/10

World Exploration - 8/10

Crafting - not too tedious so far, will likely also change with endgame, 7/10

Skills Training - Definitely grindy, getting to 50 of anything isn't that hard and that unlocks new ores, plants, etc. But getting to 100 is already grindy enough so I'd imagine that getting to 250 is going to be a nightmare.  For the leveling experience so far I'd say 8/10, but I can see that dropping to a 3 or 4 by endgame.

Combat - kinda clunky but you get used to cancelling and combos pretty quickly, and once you do everything kinda flows into place and feels a lot better, 8/10

Questing/Story - Story is okay nothing to ride home about, typical of what you would find in any MMORPG, questing is about as generic as you can get, 6/10

Dungeons - I've only done 1 dungeon so far and got carried by high level players so I can't speak to the difficulty/matchmaking/overall legitimacy of how dungeons work

1. The matchmaking of the Arena 3v3 is broken. You constantly get premades with healer on the oposit team, when you don't even have a healer in your group. 
Also 3 range vs 3 melee is usually easy win for range players. Just because range is so OP.

2. Outpost Rush is just a gambling. You don't have any impact there alone. Premades with tanks and healers win. 
Outpost Rush is usually boring onesided game with no balance in it. 

3. War is boring long fights on one spot with no tactics and skill required.

4. Melee DPS is not viable in PVP at all. You can try it and even do damage. But any range DPS will just do it better from safe distance. So in large scale, while you trying to get closer to enemies, you will be just deleted. 
Even in smallscale range will just run away with lots of mobility. No balance and trade offs for range. 
So, you can tryhard as light melee DPS or just chill and win everything as a fire staff/ Abyss Axe for example.

5. There are only few viable (meta) builds in the game for PVP. The rest is just useless.

6. The game is constantly has somethig broken in it (bugs, exploits, etc)

7. Seems like developers just don't care about broken balance. They simply make OP things more OP, because they can. 
For example, they are adding Boltcaster artifact bow to the game, when bow is already OP. 
And PTR tests show that you can delete people with 2 shots keeping enemy under CC while doing it,

8. PVP community is toxic 

9. Your gear is very impactfull in PVP. So, if you don't have correct one - you will be just useless. And it is super hard to get good gear as a new player. 

10. The combat system is clunky and has a lot of bugs and glitches. 

11. The game has very bad optimization and consumes alot of resources. So it can be laggy in large scale PVP, which is not playable. 

12. Some artifacts (type of gear) that are really important in your PVP build are far away in PVP track which force you burn your nerves getting them playing PVP with a poor build and gear against people with top gear and meta builds. 

13. Range builds have to much mobility. Combined with huge burst they outperform any melee light DPS. 

If you like competitive PVP - New World is definitely not for you.

My MMO history includes early experiences with Wizard101 and Pirate101, followed by a recent exploration of well-known titles like World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, and Final Fantasy XIV, all of which failed to captivate me in the long run.

World of Warcraft, with its vast universe and ties to Hearthstone, initially drew me in. However, the repetitive nature of combat and gathering resources quickly dampened my enthusiasm. Elder Scrolls Online offered a more engaging combat system but felt sluggish, especially in terms of movement. Final Fantasy XIV, while distinctive in its fantasy setting, couldn't sustain my interest, leaving me questioning if the MMO genre was simply not my cup of tea.

Enter Guild Wars 2, praised for its beginner-friendly approach and flexibility in playtime. Despite its positive reception, the slow pace and lack of challenge at lower levels left me disinterested. Seeking a change, I delved into New World, and it has turned out to be the MMO I've been searching for.

New World's combat system is a standout feature, striking a balance between traditional MMO abilities and more skill-based interactions. Every encounter, even with basic foes, demands attention, providing a dynamic and engaging experience. The open-world design is another highlight, where traversing the vast landscapes remains interesting due to the high level of interactivity. Gathering resources along the way feels like a natural part of the journey, keeping the exploration engaging.

While other MMOs employ various methods to speed up travel, New World relies on the interactive environment to make the journey enjoyable. Although the game has introduced mounts with the expansion, I haven't experienced this feature yet. The potential downside could be the monotony of travel once all professions are maxed out, diminishing the need for resource gathering.

Though I acknowledge the possibility of the honeymoon phase influencing my positive impressions, my increased MMO experience allows me to appreciate New World's unique qualities. While it may not be a flawless game, it has found a place in my library and gaming rotation, offering a refreshing experience in the MMO landscape. Time will tell if it can maintain its allure, but for now, New World stands out as a game that suits my taste in this expansive genre.",1701387729,1701387729,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

I waited because I saw so many mixed reviews on the game, despite being somewhat excited about the release. With the new DLC, my wife spotted the mounts and was ready to give it a try.

Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the game. There are a few things that feel oddly clunky and not very intuitive for a game released in 2021. 

The graphics are pretty good, nothing feels over the top or bland, though I did have to adjust my settings up because all of the NPCs in town looked like playdough with the defaults.

The audio is very immersive and enjoyable, we even noticed how the sound effects carry in the world (ex chopping a tree can be heard 20-30 meters away, though faint).

I love how nice it feels to no be class locked, which I REALLY enjoyed when playing Elden Ring. I started with basic gear, tried different weapons to see if I liked the play... Had a BLAST with the hammer (STR) and Ice Gauntlet (INT), but now am using the flail (STR/FOC) and life staff (FOCUS). 
The reason that's cool? I didn't have to make a new character to do it.

I love how the cosmetics work, though I dislike that the cash shop is the main source for the tokens and most the cosmetics are sold in bundles or bundles of bundles... I would easily spend $2-$5 on a helmet, chest, or weapon cosmetic. While I simply won't spend $100 to get the bundles that has 3 bundles in it for a chest that I like.

The crafting systems... are... Amazing. It's so fun to be able to harvest pretty much anything and then turn around and use it to make, cook, and build (like a survival game, without the risk of losing it all)!

My only gripes so far is my screen can get REALLY cluttered in towns and sometimes I lose track of party member or objectives when there's an elevation involved. Some of the crafting was confusing - as I had steel bars, but couldn't use them to make STEEL armor or weapons (only voidsteel, for example), which didn't make sense. I later discovered I needed to further level that skill.
Lastly, I don't have a potato system but for some reason the game simply crashed (multiple times) while my wife didn't experience this - it's EXTRA strange since I have a slightly better rig than her. 🤷",1701367820,1701367820,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the combat is boring, having to go back and forth for quests is annoying along with how the terrain is designed with so many mountains so that getting to quest markers is as difficult as possible, i think there should at least be a better system of navigation, and the final thing that i think makes this game fall apart: the quests themselves are so horribly insanely boring. They are actually nothing brainrot tasks to get XP to level up.

The only good things I have to say about the game is that it looks really nice and also its something to turn your brain off to and play while paying attention to youtube.

with a very bitter taste ive wasted 15euros on this ""game"" everyone bashed since release, even the DLC was a fiasco since u get mounts behind a 30euro paywall.

once i was done skipping and ignoring a few quest dialogues and cutscenes, i realised that even on ""very high"", the graphics looked shit. the tree's, the water, everything was not feeling 2023.

i speedrunned my way to Korinth to check out the crafting, since the combat was ""okayish"" and didnt really do anything for me.

whatever long story short: im still lvl 20, but im music level 204, that stupid korinth statue killed me several times since i forget that its bugged and there is water drowning people out of nowhere??? but yea, i bought the DLC to level up my musicskill to 250 and i also bought a super cute Outfit which i colord ""starblue"" + bought a diadem aswell since it matches really well with my nickname ""Queen Aqua"". i look amazing and the music-minigame is awesome. the weapon that comes with the DLC feels great and now im going to be a main Tank.

i am finally back to gaming, my MMO-void is gone and im really mad i didnt try this game earlier.

Alright, so Amidst the other reviews here i felt it would be remiss if I did not give a comprehensive one since most seem to be simply complaining about the game. 

Yes I play the game. Yes I like it for various reasons. Mainly that unfortunately this piece of garbage is one of the better MMORPGs out there currently. So the game play and mechanics are good. So why the bad review? Read on my friends Read on.


Let's start with the obvious:

1. ~ The Que Times have been resolved, however the server connection/performance is completely subpar for a company with the largest cloud server system in the world.

Let me Clarify: When you are selecting a Server/Region, you will notice all servers from all regions have 1 red bar and an error next to them which says ""All Regions have poor connections, You may experience issues"". 

This has been widely reported for months, and Amazon refuses to fix it. You would think this would be a priority since bad server issues causes all kinds of in game problems. But apparently maintaining their servers is not as important as Updating and Maintaining the cash shop (Which receives regular updates and fixes).

This is 100% unacceptable for obvious reasons.

Personally I have long held that the people at Amazon are lazy incompetent twits, but that was an opinion, however they have proven it correct repeatedly. 


2. ~ The next issue is the abysmally lazy no effort craptastical piece of garbage they call the character creator.

I mean I've seen E slot Mobile games with better Character creators for Christs sakes... Your a 1.8 Trillion dollar company, you couldn't pay your devs an extra 100k to create something worth a damn?.

Let me explain:

You want a male character? too bad you get an androgynous or ugly character with NO way to edit it beyond prefabed hideous looking faces and traits.

You want a female character? Too bad, hope you like Ugly women or Masculin Trannies because that's what your gonna get, again with 0 way to edit the prefabed presets garbage.

You get to pick skin color, Hair do, and facial hair, and some facial tattoos and scars.

You CAN NOT edit the characters body, at all in fact the Char creator doesn't even show it.


3. Clothing/Armor:  Clips like a MFer. And Hoods are hideous. Also most of the armor in the game looks like garbage. I understand the style they were going for was renaissance/conquestidorial style. But really.... Maybe you should have consulted with an actual expert before designing stuff.... And then realized that most people hate that time period and the way the clothing/armor looked during it. Some might like it it's true and it's definitely Unique. But Unique is not always better. And more traditional fantasy type stuff should have been added. Specifically fixes for the Hoods so they actually fit the body and armor of your characters instead of looking like hovering pieces of crap.


4. As far as the game play and mechanics..... It's actually not that bad, It's a good ""Game"", but the server issues and Character creation ruin the entire package.


Pros:

- Good game itself. (Once your actually playing if you can get in)


Cons:

- Servers are Borked.

- The simplest of character creators with almost no options for customization. Take your cookie cutter character and go play. Clothing and armor options suck.

- Nameing conventions Every name is locked across the board as they lock the names by the actual entirety of the world (as in Earth), rather then by server or region. In other words if someone in china names their character Bangjingadong. If your playing on US west you can't name your character anything even similar to it. (Yea thats right it blocks ""Similar"" names also.)

Anyway, My advice is to play the game at your own risk, its free to play once you buy it so there is that. If you just bought it and then read this, don't worry if you can get past the above you'll like the game.

All of that being said,

If there's a testament to the immersive and addictive nature of a game, it's my extensive playtime of 5000 hours in New World. From the moment I stepped foot into Aeternum, Amazon Game Studios' creation has captivated me with its sheer brilliance and enthralling game play. New World isn't just a game; it's an experience that unfolds as you traverse its beautifully crafted landscapes, battle mythical creatures, forge alliances, and compete in a persistent, evolving world. The immersive environment, rich lore, and engaging combat mechanics are unparalleled. One of the game's most compelling aspects is its attention to detail in crafting a breathtaking world. The diverse biomes, ranging from lush forests to desolate wastelands, showcase the developers' commitment to creating an expansive and visually stunning universe. Combat in New World is dynamic and skill-based. Whether engaging in PvP battles, tackling challenging PvE content, or participating in massive wars between factions, the combat mechanics offer depth and satisfaction. The weapon variety and skill trees allow for diverse playstyles, ensuring every encounter feels fresh and exciting. The social aspect of New World is equally enticing. The game encourages cooperation and camaraderie through its company system, fostering teamwork and strategic planning for territory control and conquest. Despite its numerous strengths, New World isn't without flaws. Early on, there were concerns about server stability and balancing issues. However, the developers have shown dedication in addressing these concerns, consistently rolling out updates and improvements to refine the gaming experience. What truly sets New World apart is its ability to keep me invested, even after thousands of hours. The constant updates, events, and new content additions ensure there's always something to discover or achieve, making each session as thrilling as the first. In conclusion, New World isn't just a game; it's a world I've immersed myself in for an astounding 5000 hours. Its captivating world-building, engaging combat, and evolving game play make it an absolute gem in the realm of MMOs. For anyone seeking an immersive and enduring gaming experience, New World is an absolute must-play.",1632978254,1701221128,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Players here (played in AP Southeast) are generally very friendly and helpful. (I have not reached to raiding yet as I'm only lv30 now so no comment on that.) There's crafting and gathering skills which are pretty similar to FFXIV.

Graphics (especially on scenery) are similar to Horizon Zero Dawn. (Which I think it's extremely beautiful to take a break some times and just enjoy the scenery) I got the game at the right timing as they'd launched mount feature in their latest DLC and was very amazed by how pretty & fluid the mounts animation are. For characters, it's just average, I've seen better in other MMOs.

Gameplay (attack animation) feels a bit clunky for me (maybe I'm just new to this style of combat) but can definitely get used to it over time. The style reminds me of Dragon Nest (includes the FOV & crosshair). 

No classes tied so you can build whichever weapons fancies you, which I think it's very cool too :)

After 130+ hours in game over the last week or so, I've only found one ""bug"" so far (the map marker not showing on my compass, which took a hard reset of my computer to fix) and can honestly say I'm impressed with the work and progress that Amazon has made with New World, because I have heard some nightmare stories!

Lesser game developers have given up and abandoned games, that had struggles like this one did at launch, so it's refreshing to see a developer stick it out to fix and deliver what was promised to their customers [here's looking at you Starbreeze / Pay Day 3 ] -_- 

The graphics are stunning & beautifully rendered. The quests are well done, with the perfect level of ""option to skip"" and ""cut scene"" (where you aren't constantly inundated with nonstop movies, but you can still skip NPC dialogue if you want to). The journals and maps make it super easy to track, abandon, restart and follow all of your quests (Amazon did a good job making FextraLife less useful here XD ). The crafting system is pretty complex, but simple to figure out and most of the items have 'hover-able' descriptions, that tell you where to go to use them.

I've never been a fan of PVP- to me, it's just a small peen measuring competition that gets in the way of my grind to end game. Too many games have let the joy of PVP for a few, ruin the rest of the game for everyone else- so I LOVE that Amazon made PVP fully optional. Those who want to PVP can PVP with themselves and those who don't, can play the entire game without enabling PVP once, if they so chose. I wish more games would take note on this.

I love that I can group with friends, even if they're in other factions and we can quest together and explore the world. New World is truly one of the better coded MMO's out there atm. Which I guess shows in my game time, having only had the game for over a week, and already played over 130+ hours ^.^'

If I were pressed for a complaint, I would say I wish the dungeon ""group"" requirements were reduced to 2, or it would be nice if they'd add a ""2-player Challenge"" option to dungeons, for higher level players who want more arduous game play. My bf and I play at odd hours, so most of our friends are asleep. We don't always have a third or fourth member, so waiting for randoms to saunter by and hoping they'll join us for the dungeon can get a bit tedious, but we're ""souls"" players, so we're always up for the difficulty of running the dungeons without the full group - give us the option to run it without 3!

Yes, there are queuing issues, mostly due to the buy once nature of the game, and hype that the game got. This happens and will resolve over time. But once in the game the graphics, sound and design are wonderful. Combat takes a bit to get use to since it is not tab targeting but I like that. Quests are repetitive, go here and kill x mobs but that ever MMO out there. Over all it’s a great game with a rocky start that will get better, just like every start of a new, hyped MMO.

New World is a game where you can explore a vast open world, fight monsters, craft items, join factions, and make friends. Sounds fun, right? Well, it is, until you encounter some of the hilarious bugs and glitches that plague the game.
Of course, these bugs and glitches can also be a source of amusement and entertainment, as long as you don’t take the game too seriously. You can laugh at the absurdity of the situations, share your stories and screenshots with other players, and hope that the developers will fix them soon. New World is a game that has a lot of potential, but also a lot of problems. It is a game that can be frustrating and fun at the same time. It is a game that will make you say: “Wow, this is amazing!” and “What the hell is going on?” in the same breath.

I have recently returned to New World, to see what has changed with the expansion they added.
Mounts, new weapon, new area.
They have actually improved on many areas of the game.
I still think some fundamental aspects are flawed, particularly around their server technology limiting just how ""massively"" an MMO can be (which is ironic given this is Amazon we are talking about). 
But that said, the combat itself is fun and engaging.
There are negatives and positives, but I am just generally updating my review again from Negative to Positive, in recognition of improvements they have made.

[Edit with patch 1.1 today]
Well, I look back at my earlier review, and note the promise I saw there.
In that time, I've come to see just how buggy and flawed this development team is.
So many many bugs.   All I overlooked, or worked around.  Just trying to enjoy the core gameplay, and not dwell on those aspects.

Then, 1.1 patch came along.  Lots of new fixes. 
But, with it, just wide ranging unbalancing changes that have thrown the entire game into chaos.   Whole gameplay loops broken, weapons and healing nerfed, end game areas insanely buffed to make it impossible to play through successfully with your mates.  

Created a have and have not divide.  Those who no-lifed the grind to begin with now far advanced, and able to possibly handle the new 'norm'.
Everyone else, good luck.  You'll need it. 

Just disappointing...

Oh well.. I got my moneys worth I guess.  Was fun while it lasted.

5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt

Directions:

2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Played every test I could, trying all the weapons, travelling to the farthest corners of the map, gathering/crafting as much as I could, and even participated in a war and a few skirmishes.

Including higher gear tiers/scores and mounts.
Suddenly nothing you've done in the game matters unless you buy the DLC and grind like your life depended on it.
I've also heard stories, my friend included, who suffer login/logout bugs where the game is continually trying to disconnect you so that even if you get into the game you can't move or interact with anything.

Movement is janky and navigation&UI are horrible, graphics and gameplay feels like a low budget MMO.
The worst part is the DLC activates right as you make a new character, rendering you unable to refund the DLC.

The story is okay, but nothing to rave about. The premise of the game is interesting, though. Where this game really shines for me is in its combat(more enjoyable as a solo player, imo) and its crafting and gathering mechanisms. It's actually fun to try finding resources and crafting your own gear as you level up, and the combat feels similar to playing a single player title. When a bunch of people group up, the combat gets a bit more bland I think, just because it's hard to determine who is being attacked and the animations of everyone on top of each other become a bit overwhelming.

The community seems to be pretty active, and it is nice to actually see players coming and going, as well as hanging out in town. The ability to actually play instruments via mini games in a sort of ""Guitar Hero"" type way is also pretty fun, and a unique addition to an MMO. 

Lastly, the game is probably the prettiest MMO I have played in recent years, but I don't play a whole lot of them these days so take that with a grain of salt. I genuinely enjoy walking around the world in this game, though. Speaking of the world, it's persistent, and I am seldom met with a loading screen outside of fast traveling. 

As someone who used to play Elder Scrolls Online quite a bit, this game is actually a bit more fun to play for me. The story in ESO is much better than New World, but in terms of game play, New World has so far won me over. 

If you can get this on sale for $15 as I did, then I encourage it. It would even be worth $30 I think, given then there is no sub and the game is genuinely fun to play.",1701058557,1701058557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playerbase is partly toxic and Developers look blindly at this. The imaginary luck system is a failure - They control how much an item should drop, regardless of how much time you invest in it. If you want to run 150 miles, and they have a lock on 100, they will make sure you stay at 100. They verified this with this video: https://youtu.be/JtrEdKqGmbo 

Its an MMO which inflates its own economy, that PVP'ers control. Millions of gold for the players themselves to either be sold or used. This is also largely ignored.

They have more focus on removing the amount of fun you can have, than to fix bugs that have been annoying almost since launch. Everything is time-gated... Everything. 

They will also after certain updates and changes, REMOVE items you have previously farmed from your inventory/storage, for the sake of making certain items more rare after they change its rarity.

There is no minimap in the game, the compass is a sad f*cking joke, possible one of the worst in game chat UI and the HUD is not doing any better

You can't use global chat for 72 hours, so exactly the most important time frame for you as a new player to gather information and ask question, you will not be able to do so. You will also won't be able to form a dungeon lobby for 72 hours. This makes no sense at all, I would understand if it was a f2p game so you can limit spam from bots and fake accounts but why implement such mechanics in a game that costs 40$ ?!

On top of that the games feels incredibly boring, running from one point to another all the time, the monsters are super basic, every now and then you will find a monster with some extra abilities that are basically just a variant of the same abilities from a lower lvl monster. Same goes for the animals in the game, you have 1 billion variants of wolfs and pigs and bears with a slightly different skin, there is no novelty what so ever. The quests rewards you with a lot of items that are basically junk tier or you won't use them ever as you aim to play with certain weapons and armor sets.

It’s an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game that has been described as having a colonial aesthetic and a theme of old-world pioneers exploring a magical island. However, the themes of colonialism aren’t really explored in depth, and it’s mostly cosmetic.

The game has been praised for its impressive ability to make tasks like chopping down 100 trees at 2 am seem like a reasonable, even entertaining, prospect. 

It also has a player-driven economy and a beefy crafting system. The combat system is action-oriented and requires you to aim each of your attacks, which can make the battles feel slick and engaging.

However, the game has been criticized for its lack of variety and novelty. Players often find themselves running through the same forests and facing the same enemies over and over again. The quests are described as dire, with the same handful of mindless objectives repeated ad nauseum. 

The game’s character customization and combat are held back by its limited attributes system.

In conclusion, “New World” is a game that tries to do a lot of things but stumbles frequently. 

It has some interesting features and ideas, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The game feels like it’s been algorithmically designed to ensnare anyone craving a big MMO, but the reality is a lot less scintillating.",1662492312,1701003155,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

When this game began it was in shambles with server issues, bugs, exploits and the infamous GPU breaks (not entirely due to the game  tho).

My verdict is give it a go have fun there is tons to do even without buying the new expansion enjoy the ride and the game they have created.

From the freeform character and weapon progression to the resource gathering and faction dynamics, there’s a lot to explore and experience. That said, New World very much feels like an MMO in a very early state. There’s not a ton of Expeditions, there’s no mounts, and there’s an obvious need for balancing with features like Siege. Luckily, MMOs often get better as they age, and if Amazon Games can build upon this great foundation, they’ll have a surefire hit on their hands.

Problem is they never let you pick reward weapons to keep the same types. Factions are lame, pvp only and gear looks differ. The faction quests are repetitive kill and fetch.  The resource gathering is ok, but people can steal your animal kills.

As a 17-year WoW player, New World is a breath of fresh air and ticks a lot of boxes for me. Graphics are more than acceptable for an MMO, combat feels good, plenty of gear with an easy to understand system, so far it feels very well-rounded and feature rich, although not without it's short comings. 

The main reason I'd recommend this game to any MMO fan, is the absence of a monthly subscription. It's insane to me that at fully fledged MMO is available for a single fee, you're welcome to play as much or as little as you'd like, and come back whenever without any additional commitment. Sure they charge for expansions, but so do the competitors-along with a monthly subscription fee.

I'd highly recommend the game so far, especially for casuals, or people who don't have 100 hours a week to devote to an MMO without the commitment of a monthly sub fee. Hopefully it continues to be a great experience, I'll sink a few hundred hours into this easy.",1700868580,1700868580,True,3,0,0.54476475715637207,0,True,False,False

The game would focus on crafting and PvP, with three major factions fighting for territory influence. The game wouldn't require subscription, which could encourage new players to move from subscription based games like World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Final Fantasy Online. As players generaly hate the ""Pay-to-win"" games, all in the game should be available for free, and the microtransactions should be mostly around cosmetic elements. 

The game was released, there was a quick influx of players, and a very quick decline few months after. Unfortunately the game had a lot of bugs, common errors in translations, PvP balance issues and poor PvE layer, so after initial interest people started dropping (you can check the historical stats for example on mmo-population website).

However, Amazon didn't abandon the game and reallyfocused on improving it. After two years of their work I can confidently say that New World is finaly great! (It's a pretty similar case like the story of ""No Man's Sky""). The game is finally a lot of fun! The PvE is exciting, there is a lot of interesing quests. The crafting is definitely the best comparing to all the other MMOs (I think Final Fantasy Online is pretty close though). The graphics are really pleasant, all characters are nicely voiced (also in different language versions), and the PvP seems to be finally balanced! 

The first expansion was recently released, which added new territories, increased the level cap and introduced mounts (with interesting leveling approach to the riding skill), There is a lot of fun with houses, cool instrument playing minigames providing buffs, and again the whole crafting layer which is simply amazing. The community is generally friendly 
(but please expect that there will be always someone who will race you to that sweet  harvesting node and ""steal it"" just from under your nose ;-) ). 

It's pretty obvious the game is for the international audience, as you can see people in chat speaking in different languages, but actually it is very nicely fitting the game story - people from different countries in our ""Old World"" are trying to colonize the ""New World"". And generally the story there seems pretty reasonable! 

The PvP is now fully optional and you can completely skip it, same as group content (major quest plot even gives you an option to select a ""solo"" or ""group"" path whenever it matters).
 
One thing that could be made better is definitely the complexity of quests, or maybe richer descriptions for the quest stages - but I suppose there is a lot of folks, who hate reading, so maybe developers tried to make stuff more casual and inteded for diverse audience. There are also supposedly still some bugs in quests (I encountered a single one after ~160 hours of play time), but fortunately the bugfixing is quite frequent. There are also still some random missing translations, but of course it matters only if you switch to other language version than the original English one. There are also sometimes login queues (that last for few minutes), but so far I encountered them maybe three times (while I logged to the game hundreds of times and actually mostly during the peak periods: evenings and weekends).

What surprises me the most is that there are still ""haters""  complaining about the game both in the chat and on Internet forums (while still playing it of course). Especially focusing on expansion ""price to content"" ratio. I really don't get it - there is no subscription here, and all the microtransactions are fully optional. The game is constantly actively maintained. The price of the main game plus expansion is approximately around 6 monthly subscriptions for other MMORPGs. And you have to still pay in them for the game and expansions as well, don't you? But I suppose there would always be trolls.

Summarizing - great game, lot of fun, definitely worth the price (even non-discounted one). I definitely recommend it!",1699216709,1700864208,True,148,6,0.8230857253074646,0,True,False,False

Weapons feel good, lots of options for many types of players, community options are vast.

Critique might be that the game could do with more in-world cinematics, the paper/drawing cinematics are cool but would love to see something closer to WoW cinematics. The developers seem to struggle managing the servers, during peak times its extremely hard to play but during downtimes servers appear dead.

Doesn't feel much better. I like that there's no weaving or slotting skills for passives but with 3 active skills and 2 bars it feels rather limited. Maybe it gets better at end game.

Other than that, the game is an absolute mess in terms of graphics and performance. FPS drop below 60 in towns, on highest settings there is a lot of aliasing (at 1080p) and the graphics are quite cartoony ... expected a lot more from it.

So all in all it's inferior to ESO in pretty much every aspect - haven't tried PVP yet, heard that's good tho.

UPDATE 24/11: I know this game had its up & downs, however I still play to this date and I love it! With the addition of artifacts you can create lots of crazy builds, eg. I have a tank and a mage (with firestaff and greataxe) builds and they both work ^^

With the expansion many things became simpler (dungeon mutations, travel times etc) and the new area is amazing! However, they did lock down an area that was on the original version of New world and in order to access it you'll need the expansion. Minor thing to be honest, especially since the Burning Sands was a free expansion.

On the next update they will add a global-ish dungeon finder too, which is great!

The only major issue I have is that the developers haven't updated their Steam achievements with the launch of the expansion. Come on devs!

Other reasons why i decided to refund after an hour include.

So far the game is good from 0-40, after 40 the game starts to feel like a grind. And once you get 60 it's just a grind to get max gear that almost feel impossible unless you play for 12 hours a day.

Do not buy this game if you:

4. Would like to spend time with your loved ones.
5. Have any desire to see the sun again.

This game will suck you in and refuse to spit you out. It feels so simple at first, like playing a childhood game for the first time. But it pulls you in with its many weapon options, compelling storyline, wide array of skills and trades to learn, and its focus on making YOU THE PLAYER feel like THE player instead of A player. This isn't your run of the mill, ad infested MMO with a pay to win structure. The work you put in here will have results, and you won't feel like it's a chore to do so either. Exploration feels rewarding. Taking the time to hunt down a rare beast or even a lowly turkey has its rewards, and you'll find yourself doing it of your own volition with how rewarding it feels.

devs keep their game updated and hear players feed backs

The mounts are now available and completely add a new feel for moving around the map. Raid Groups of up to 20 people has been a fantastic change. I recently did the entire 0 - 65 journey on a 3rd character and the main story line feels great with the additional cut scenes, voiced characters and quest givers who follow you around the map. The running simulator has mainly gone. The new areas, towns and enemy types have been fun. Artifact weapons have been a good edition as well. Season 4 is shaping up to be interesting.

Update: 26/06/23 - I standby everything in my original review. I now have over 1,800+ hours into this game and every update, the devs are taking more and more positive steps. Very soon we will have crossworld OPR, 10 man trials, 20 man raids, raid groups, new 3v3 map, refreshed OPR map, searchable inventories in settlements (by name and perks), UI refreshes, and more. In season 3 we know now the wards/bane gear is being removed, the gearscore will increase, armour will get an overhaul, mounts will be a thing, a new expansion, new expiditions, new heartrune gems, fishing is getting overhauled. etc. There is a lot coming this year and a lot already delivered. If you're thinking about coming back to the game, perhaps wait until the big expansion release or dive in early now to see what you've missed. Season 2 launches in about 10 days.


Original Review: 
1,000+ hours in the game so far. Played since launch. Seen massive improvements with each new patch. Devs listen to community feedback. Since launch there are several new dungeons, a large new zone, 3v3 arenas, plenty QoL improvements, several new weapons, early levelling and story revamped, new mobs and creatures, fresh servers, new crafting materials and lots of twitch drops. All the while this game has remained with zero pay to win mechanics. Still to come but confirmed by devs: Raids and Mounts. 

There is still room for improvements here and there throughout the game, including some more QoL improvements but as it is right now, I'd happily recommend this game for someone looking for a new MMO to experience.",1667420106,1700717070,True,2,0,0.508850514888763428,0,True,False,False

Game feels much better, the combat is a lot smoother and the gameplay loop while grindy is fun. They have implemented lots of QoL changes to the game for the better, reduction of travel costs, ability to transfer storage between cities easily. The game has the potential to be amazing if AGS keeps with the QoL, Bug Fixes and Dungeons similar to the most recent patch. I would like to see raiding added at some point.



Game could have been decent, they released it way too soon and due to that it's been bug city. The questing is boring, cities and quests are all copy/paste.

At first glance when they announced that Amazon is developing an mmorpg, I was skeptical. But the other games that I was looking forward to didn't release yet and my friends decided to play it. Since New World wasn't such an expensive game for me, I warned my friends that this game doesn't seem to offer anything unique. Everything is so duplicated and reused that even without playing the game you can spot them through streams or videos.

For example:

From lv 1 to 40 zones (there are like 6-7 of them, afaik), all the critters and animals (boar, wolves, turkey etc.) are the same with a new name.

Other than that, all the monsters are the same with different names. Skeletons, Dead Pirates, Ghosts. Only at 45+ level zones, you get just a LITTLE bit diversity which is the Angry Earth enemies and corruption monsters. (Which are made for dungeons initially and released in open world with same abilities but different name)

Lootboxes are just duplicated all over the place and there are floating mines/collectibles across the map for days now.

Storage and market system is designed to make the game unique as you have to compete with other LOCAL sellers but it doesn't work that way. Storages are inaccessible after an enemy faction takes over (Worst part is yet to come about this, keep reading please)

 and Storages fill up really easily if you want to play different weapons/stats. Not to mention a feather weighing 0.1 so basically 5 iron ingots are as heavy as 12 feathers. (https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/qszonv/a_single_feather_is_01_kg/)

Game has no player base, and open world pvp is so boring. Here is my perspective: Unless people have more numbers, people just kept running away from me majority of the game. Even when i pmed them or tried to aggrevate them, they gave me excuses like ""My pvp set is in my bank"" or ""I have my gathering set on"" or ""I'm a tank player doing this for the quest rewards, cant pvp now"". I had to chase tanks with axes and greataxes across the map...

Playing together with your friends is another big problem in my eyes. You can't do quests together if you have a level gap between you and your friends because it's not effective. Also traveling back to zones you already cleared and wasting your azoth to help your friends is also inefficient. There is not much co-op in this game. Even if you want to give your friends your crafting mats, it poses a problem. The storage system makes it so hard to do so.

I've hit lv 60, did EVERY single map quest while waiting for my friends to catch up except a few: Shattered Mountain quests and Fishing quests. I also couldn't progress with my main story because some of them cant be done without a group of players and entrance is limited only to people who ALSO HAVE that same main quest ( which is utterly stupid because I literally cant do anything about it except spam global chat and hope someone else has proper class, gear etc to do the boss quest with me where you kill the Well Guardian after doing Dynasty Shipyard dungeon main quest, i believe someone can confirm this as well)

Also reekwater quests were bugged, Multiple instances of enemies spawned in same place, oneshotting anyone who walks by because of a bug so my reekwater questline is halfway done.

Now this part is where game becomes unplayable for me:

Skill trees not working as intended, my personal builds that I create can not be used.. (2 basic examples: Gravity passive in Great Axe skill tree stops Reap ability from dealing any damage there for Reap's passives also don't work which are supposed to heal you for %30 of the damage done. Also Sword and Shield's heavy attacks remove debuff on hit doesn't work, I've tried countless times. Might be patched now but Honestly, I dont care after i played the game for 280 hours with these bugs that I swapped to Dexterity and played bow/rapier)

After all the exploits about the game (food glitch, axe/greataxe/staff exploits where they deal so much extra damage for no reason) was shared on social media like reddit etc, suddenly game turned upside down. Some dude hits me 2k per hit with axe in Outpost rush I thought damn he really got really great gear. Then i realized after hitting lv 60 and Gear score level 580, my axes only hit up to 1k with 300 str/dex per hit? That was eye opening for me. Then we suddenly started losing territory that we didn't lose before and had highest upgrades across the server. 

This is where game makes me utmost angry and intolerant because every time we lost a territory or Outpost rush I cant help but think ""Did i lose fair and square or did they abuse another glitch, hack, whatever"". Then I started doing some more research and here are a few of the things I found out:

https://prnt.sc/207gu06 - Duplicated azoth... (Traveling and crafting material)
https://prnt.sc/207gwmo - Duplicated expensive crafting materials...
People duplicated so much gold during server transfers, I sadly dont have Screenshots to prove this.
High respawn rate zones that people just agro from distance and kill as groups to level up faster instead of playing the game.

Then my clan leaders also trying to ""lecture"" members on how they have to abuse the weapon bugs because we are losing to much territory... I believe other factions thought the same. Trust is destroyed between players. I don't blame company leaders for this but that's off topic. People opposed to abusing bugs anyway. But losing territory and having to move our storages with low amount of azoth wasn't so fun.

So I decided to quit the game and I advice anyone to quit it as well. This game was at best a failed attempt to make an mmorpg and rushed to get it out to players. All these major glitches, exploits, bugs whatever should've been dealt with during beta period. If the game is not ready to be played, you don't launch it and expect people to be okay with it. MMOs are fun because the environment is interactive and competitive. And it also is a fair battleground. 

This is all I can share, I hope you've seen my point of view. Take care!",1637414628,1700695201,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They will eventually be resolved since this is a new, highly anticipated, game and long queues are not unexpected.  So I will not comment further on that.

New World is a beautifully crafted game that should satisfy many gamers itch for something new.  The game's many delays have paid off.   Optimization is good, with an RTX 2060 Super I am 60+ fps even with dozens of players in an area. 

The cash shop (as of now) is cosmetics only, so no P2W here.   There is no subscription required either.

Crafting here is, by far, the best of any MMO I've played.   You are not limited to what you can do, the only thing you need is the time to do it.  Need lumber?  Well leave, go find a tree nearby and start chopping.  Kill an animal?  Feel free to skin it for leather and meat.  Crafting system is intuitive, easy to learn and anything you don't need can be either sold on the Trading Post or salvaged for materials.

There are no classes in the game.  Want to tank?  Equip heavy armor and a 1h+shield.  Prefer casting?  Go for light armor and a fire or life staff.   Kills earn you XP towards your level and the weapon used.  Even if you change weapons, progress on the other is not lost.   Your stats do affect how good you are with weapons, so plan that accordingly.  A good thing is that respeccing the weapon skills and your attributes is free until level 20.  Play around with builds til then to see what you enjoy the most.

Combat is action based, in that there is no tab targeting.  Tap left mouse to light attack, hold for a heavy.  The latter can break a block FYI.  As your weapons skill up you can have 3 active skills equipped with a lot of passives.  As you level you can hold more than 1 weapon, and switching is easy (primary weapon is default numeral key 1, secondary is 2).   

PvP is by consent.  You must manually flag in a town, then you will gain more XP but can be attacked by others of the other 2 opposing factions while out in the world.  Territory battles for what faction controls what part of the island can be quite large.   Often around 100 players or so will be fighting for control.

EDIT:

The devs still doing good work updating and improving the game.  More weapons have been added since launch.   The new DLC reworked First Light zone and added mounts, plus an increase in the level cap.

AGS needs to hit the drawing board hard. The MMO is still in its infancy so it's not too late but as it is this game is a try at best for most and if you don't have the coin for more than one game pass try something else. I care about this game; this is not a bash, but it needs to be addressed and adjusted for it to succeed. 

The game needs some serious foundational attention, if this is your first MMO you'll have a great time for a couple hundred hours. A few of the bones are great but what the devs lean into is out of touch and seemingly done on a whim with little consideration for longevity. Mind you the game has come a long way, but they are still in the same vein they started in, and the player base shows it. The game's skill ceiling is the lowest you could possibly find in an MMO which is great for new players but leaves a lot to be desired if you're a fan of min/maxing.  

Of all the issues New World is currently facing and the backlash it is receiving the following immediate changes would correct the trajectory of the game.  

- Faction Vendor: Only charge faction tokens, do not adjust prices with gold removal.  

- Remove PvP Track and uncap Salt: In place of the track add a Vendor that players can use their Salt and only Salt to purchase the crafting components, attribute food & potions (give them a name like Salt Infused Health potion or Salt Infused Biscuit something to differentiate them from crafted or dropped items) and put the PvP armor transmogs in there.  

- Add a weekend PvP Vendor (that arrives at the same place and same time frame every weekend): this vendor will sell all of the Artifacts on rotation up the Azoth Salt prices to 100k - 150k. 

These changes allow PvPers to do what they like PvP. Use their resources to fund their builds and makes that part of the game special. This also allows players to take the rng out of the game a bit and replace it with content and effort in regard to the components and artifacts. 



- Add Merchants and a stall to the towns and wilds: a place where players can sell anything they want for a price. No tax, no fees, just a raw number range 20 - 100 depending on items. This will allow those with limited time to be able to accumulate funds to potentially use in the TP.  

- Allow Companies to bid on Merchants weekly: this will enable PvE or mercurial focus groups to claim ownership in Aeternum. They collect a tax based on the income the merchant receives. Players using this merchant do not pay this tax, but a percentage of the item sold value is sent to the company owning the merchant. One merchant per town and merchants in the wild allowing even a small company a chance to own and earn. 

- New town ownership opportunity: allow companies to engage the incumbent in a bidding war for town ownership. This adds a new layer to the ownership in New World and allows PvE companies a chance to own an entire town if they can outbid the current owners. They then are at a potentially greater risk for war and invasion failure due to the nature of the company. A company cannot own a merchant while owning a town. Have the merchants building start the night before reset and winners placed at reset.  

- Allow the deconstruction of gear: Different from salvaging, players can take any items to a corresponding bench and decon/salvage the item for a few of the main components in the item. No gold again just materials, set the base to 2 or 3 with a chance for 1 or 2 more. Crafting tax still applies.  

- Greatly reduce resource node cooldowns: this allows all players to harvest and have access to crafting materials. The market price will drop but there are players (like the PvPers) or those without time to fight others for real-estate or even stay up until the server's population drops, who are not inclined to farm but need the materials to craft.  

- Change teleport costs from azoth to gold (75 -100) and allow teleports from anywhere: this will help with the increased of gold in players pockets. Also allow players to teleport from anywhere as long as they are not in combat or flagged. Make the teleport from a shrine free.  

These economic changes will have a resounding impact on players' enjoyment and progress.  



- Uncap the number of dungeons per week: Allow PvEers to do the content they like without punishment. 

- Increase gold gained from mobs and guarantee drop chance of crafting components: this will allow those who just want to just play overland to be able to sell and make gold via PvE combat and selling of components in the TP ensuring a healthy economy.  

- Remove mount speed reduction off road: allow players to move as they desire, to maintain interest and ability to arrive at events timelier.  



These changes will allow players to play how they when they want regardless of the time available to them. This will also foster a community able to make and try more builds with the increased availability of materials and not be punished for making a mistake in crafting or being stuck to playing one style due to drops. While simultaneously making PvP and PvE feel special and appreciated. This I feel will greatly restore player happiness and increase population. Allowing AGS to continue to make changes and content with less blow back",1700099510,1700672709,False,4,1,0.501312315464019775,0,True,False,False

I played it, and sure it had issues, it had problems, but with friends it was fine. Had it's own way of doing things, and remained interactive enough to where I enjoyed myself, until level 35. The grind was ungodly real. So I stopped, and then they updated the game a bunch. I came back, I played more, enjoyed myself, until level 35. The grind was still just so much, it had gotten better in some areas and worse in others. I stopped, they updated the game, released some DLC, so I came back. Now the game feels pretty good, other than the now awful stuttering and continual crashing that I and my entire group of game buddies feel.

New World meets ALL these requirements I had for a relaxing casual time killer. The game is mid at best but it is so easy to understand and immediately start playing it is ideal for a casual like me who really isn't that invested or expecting to be playing this game in a years time. 

I watch content on YouTube while playing this, I ignore every bit of dialogue and only do what I feel like doing and it all works perfectly well and I do appreciate that. As I said, the game is actually pretty mid and dare I say a bit soulless but it also doesn't ask a lot of the player and is ideal for a casual who just wants to MMO without constantly having to go online to figure out how to do basic things. I actually wanted to try ESO again but when I started it up a few months ago I had totally forgotten just about everything and I could not muster up the energy to bother doing it all over again but I feel I could stop playing this game for a year and pick it up again with no real issue. 

The game runs fine for me, it looks pretty nice at times but not amazing which is expected as they obviously want to have it playable on even the lowest end PC. I encountered a few minor bugs here and there but nothing that re-loading into the server didn't fix. 

I am no MMO expert so I wont even pretend to be an authority on these games but for what I wanted out of this game it is perfectly adequate and mediocre and so far I have enjoyed it, even if I cant say I love it.",1700653092,1700653092,True,92,7,0.841870784759521484,0,True,False,False

Sound design is beautiful and immersive.

I really enjoy the game, but every week some new issue arises that takes from that enjoyment, halts character progress or as in today takes it offline with no update on when it will be available again.

Hoping for things to stabilise soon while there is still a decent player base left.

UPDATE Nov 23.
The ""optional"" DLC costing €29 turns out to be more a relaunch of the game than additional content. If you don't purchase the DLC you are locked out of core game items such as character level progression and skill level progression. So if you don't buy it, you can sit and stagnant while being rejected from group content because you are not lvl 65. 
For a new player I still think the base game is worth it. You will get many hours of fun following the MSQ and completing Brimstone Sands. After that it's just the same old grind, except you have to pay extra for the privilege to take part.",1637794562,1700652979,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The game is kinda dead and developers do not mind it and they just merge servers to get the servers full which did not work
2. There is no reach out from developers and trust me they do not know anything about making video games
3. The main focus of the game is on pvp aspect which is annoying because they are balancing the game with respect to pvp and kinda mess your pve experience 
4. Lack of content in the game is so obvious, i mean the only reason you can continue playing the game is only meaningless grinds which are not necessary 
5. Farming is a pain in new world because the materials spawn at the same exact locations and it is just about who get there first, which cause high values for simple resources in the game trading post
6. simple mechanics in combat, i mean you just have and need three hot keys and your left click
7. meaningless perk points and attributes to spend
8. Lack of a general database to explain enemies, their attacks or some perks in the game 
9. Ridiculous RNG factor.... i mean grinding in this game is not easy because of 5, and after you get to the certain point now RNG factor wastes your grind, there is no reward for grinders :)
10. Really bad and same events 
11. All enemies and the majority of enemies and locations are copied and reskinned 
12. BAD COMMUNITY 
I wish the developer team had some thoughts to improve the game and its mechanics but they do not! the road map of the game is so disappointing and the devs doing nothing, they just care about selling new (ugly) skins.
and also to all magic lovers ""the mage class in new world is useless and if you use it nobody will play with you :)""

They were haggling some poor person in chat for cabbages, their mother blames me for teaching them these habits as they have also started to try negotiations on vegetables they eat and the percentages of dessert they should get based on their consumption.


EDIT: There is no more queue simulator on the servers I play on, I would now like to make it known that the minigames have become the main game and queue is non-existent for me and my fellow ex-queue-rs...Great game for the whole family teaches them that paying taxes is a part of life and to make money you have to spend money.

Really loving queue simulator, however i keep getting put into these minigames after a certain period (quests,leveling, woodcutting fishing) which really distract from the real reason im playing this game and that is to queue...

1-game play will make you like :its fucking awesome!
2-you will get drown in a deep RPG that needs a lot of attention and spending time to level up and... 
3-fights are really good and feelings are real unless you have no feeling :) (go see a doctor amigo!).
4-graphic and performance are satisfying but make sure you have at lest a mid range PC.
5-the only thing that i'm not comfortable with, is the Azoth and fast traveling system, which is ok imo :\ but could be better 
(like having a fast travel shrine at every dungeon ...).
5-market needs a better User interface with more transparency!
6-grinding is very cool and i love it (cutting trees all day long), but hey! make sure you wont cut your own tree :D
7-price is decent with all those content.
8-regardless of that i'm not a PVP focused guy, but pvp in this one is good and you will enjoy.
9-it definitely needs more content in future but at this point you can call it a good game. will see what happens! in 90000000000 years maybe?
10-gear system is not perfect but at least it has a decent balance between gears atm.
11-some people are abusing the gold system and doing a lot of glitches,you have to make sure that you are not one of them.
12-community in this game is unique,priceless,wonderful... i cant find a better word to define it:) believe me people are so respectful to each other and the most reason that i stuck with it is the power of the community! and when it comes to a game like this with a huge population, you can't deny the communication!

I downloaded this game with high hopes and expectations. I though to myself ""this game could be a WoW smasher, a game changer""......but boy was I ever let down. I'll list the pro's and con's and you guys can decide on whether or not to purchase it. 

Pro's
-Amazing sound!! Best effects I've ever heard in my life
-Amazing Graphics
-Lots of stuff to do if your a completionist
-13 Weapons to date to master and get good with
-Lots of armor and look cool cosmetics
-Super forgivable!!! If you're new to the MMO genre this game is a nice starter.....till you hit the new content 

Con's
-Every time AGS does an update, they break 3 mechanics in the game.....minimum
-AGS loves to eliminate simple exploits that just allow you to either cheese a boss or at least make it easier
-Painfully frustrating when the mechanics are ruined by a past update
-Every new release to the game requires you to be at max GS in order to play it and enjoy your time doing it
-Toxic community! The level of fanboys in this game is unreal! You can never have an open discussion with anyone in this game, it will always result in at least 5 people either just calling you names like an adolescent boy or they will just say ""if you don't like it, don't play"". That argument alone screams ""I'm going to accept the game for broken, and you can't change my mind""
-The pvp system is janky to be nice. OPR is quite terrible truth be told. The latency in most OPR's is insane. The new ""perks"" they added to the game like ""freedom"" make it so CC is almost null and void. Playing anything other then the ""META"" is almost pointless
-Referbished enemies throughout the entire game. 0 changes, same enemies, same moves, they just hit harder as you go through the levels
-3 Factions in game with the most lack luster story ever....if at all. Factions hold 0 to the game what so ever unless you're looking to get into the open world pvp. Faction races are about as much fun as watching paint dry. You get quests from the faction vendor, run out in pvp status and do the quests, you return to the faction vendor and rinse and repeat. This will get your ""influence"" up and thus allow you to war with said town. Yay!!!
-Most lack luster story I've ever played. Convoluded quests mixed with alliances that make 0 sense, mixed with antagonists with 0 backround. It felt like dry wall puddy, just filling in the holes so that no one questions what was behind the actual motives
-Agro table makes 0 sense. Tanks can lose agro in the middle of the fight to a dps or a healer thats stood still the entire match
-Dungeon's are super lame. Everything feels like a figure 8, feels like a lazy designer
-Bots, bots gallore!!! Good luck getting resources as the bots in this game are in full spread.

All of these are my opinion's on the game. Take them for what it is. I've invested 700 hours into the game with my fingers crossed that it was going to get progressively better and I've been let down by the presentation of whats come thus far. I still have high hopes but its going to take alot of work to get there.

Thank you for reading

Edit:

I have put alot more man hours into the game recently and I modestly must say that it is getting better.....slowly, but surely.

The new upcoming roadmap shows a bit of actual end game content and this is exactly what we needed. I am afraid to say though that it may or may not be enough to save the game. 

The community has become super toxic and the new ""meta"" has the new player base suffering incredibly. The skill set you need to have to run the late game content in this new ""meta"" form is something only hours of playtime will give you. The community has become elitist and unforgiving. 1 mistake and you're either booted from the group or flamed. Its become pretty toxic.

The average player may enjoy this if they don't have their hearts set on doing the mutations every week or completing the season's pass but the die hards of this game, the completionists, struggle more now than ever. 

I don't revoke my original statement where the game is bad, but I will say that it is getting slowly better.....very slowly. I respect that now they test out every patch in the PTR and most if not all the content that finally goes to live is patched and ready for play. 

I for the most part enjoy my time in New World but it definitely has its ""I'm ready to uninstall"" moments. If it isn't the community, then its the server lag. If you're patient and want to see this game flourish like the rest of us do then by all means buy it and try it out. If you find you don't like it or its not your niche then you can close the doors to it and try something else.

The pvp in this game is incredibad! The servers can't keep up with what you're doing. You'll be fighting a player who's taking 0 damage and then half a second later he's across the map. 

3v3 arena matchmaking is like league of legends bronze hell. The team comps make 0 sense, the average team is just terrible, and then allowing players to potion and run is super defeating. This whole experience needs a rework something fierce

2nd Edit - Expansion:

So I purchased the expansion and it started out really good......for an entire day! The ""expansion"" content can be completed in an afternoon leaving you wanting more for your money. That being said, they have released alot of content for free so I can't judge too harshly.

Mounts - integral part of the game. I honestly didn't know what I was missing out on till I tried them out. Moving between areas feels soooooo much better. That being said, they are still not glitch free and pretty janky. I know that they'll get better over time but atm its painful.

Flail - Flail feels really good, the animations are crisp and the skill tree is fantastic, all in all....however, it does have its own glitches as well. The agro table when using a flail is so mangled that tanking with it is a chore and not very fun....and this is coming from someone who genuinely tanks with it.

New Zone - Elyssian Wilds is crisp and clean. It looks pretty good for a rewrite of an area. They made sure to keep the old look but just ""spice"" it up a bit. The old nostalgic areas are still around, they're just wrapped in Angry Earth. 

Story - The story for the expansion is kinda lack luster truth be told. It feels almost rushed. It started out really strong and really gets you into the lore of the area quick but by the end you just feel like it was rinse and repeat from a Brimstone quest chain. I enjoyed the story when I was running with a pack of allies and we were all storming objectives but as I roam around the new area more and more its barren, desolate, and still unfriendly. The only thing that truly intrigued players were the 2 new chest runs

Chest Runs - They added 2 new areas for the Epic Chests to spawn in. 1 of the 2 areas is a genuine chest run with a boss farm and even artifacts that drop. The 2nd chest run is a jumping puzzle of lag and frustration. Half the puzzles don't work, the enemies knock you off and there's less epic chests there than Mines in shattered mountains.

Artifacts - The artifacts either make or break the game. Some of them are so incredible that using them almost feels like a cheat code. Some of them are so lack luster that when you do finally acquire them you want to dismantle. Artifacts drop few and far between, and I mean every syllable!! You get 35 mutations a week and you'll easily burn through those and still leave empty handed. The ""drop rate"" is abysmal! It feels more like a farming simulator than an MMO. Now, I do agree that acquiring them should take a level of skill or time but jesus christ 35 mutations in and still no sight of it.....horrible decision AGS!!!",1654062663,1700627416,False,286,11,0.842927396297454834,19,True,False,False

The player base is large enough to find people to do stuff with and the economy seems to be doing alright. At first things may seem expensive as gold gain starts slow but you easily catch up enough to realize it feels okay. The new expansion (although it was small considering the game has been out for so long and this is the first expansion) added some really great content. What really draws me to this game as my new main MMORPG is the classless system. I absolutely love the idea of freely switching your class because the skills are tied to the weapons themselves. Each weapon boasts 2 specs, each with 3 unique skills, and you can wield 2 weapons at a time. This game feels so unrestricted that it seems like you can do whatever you want. Player housing, costumes, factions, and a huge PVP focus (although you can play the game entirely without touching PVP) are all bonuses. I definitely recommend this game.

Combat is weapon base instead of class base. You're not locked in any class. The same can be said for professions. Feel free to  cook, smelt, and/or craft potions, the only thing that will limit you is your resources. 

Pretty entertaining game. I hope Amazon continues to support New World.

But this is only true if you can get past the queue. 

In game, you will have people who are using macros to move their characters so they don't get kicked off. 

What a train wreck of a launch. You think a company that hosts between 50k - 80k of the world servers would be able to know how servers work... 

At the time of writing of this review, only 6% of people passed level 10. The rest are in queues. 

Shame...shame...

right now , after 2 years , this game cant be even called "" IN BETA ""
but still devs will release a new skin to just get more money
be sure in 30 days from now ( this comment date ) , they will add new campfire skin , u guys need this right ?
they will add new skin that looks like a Angry Earth , u guys need it for sure , right ?
they will improve , the way u can purchase skins in store , so important , right ? 
but
still u have to play with lowest graphic and get 23 fps if there is more than 10 player around u
still u have to get lag detected over and over cuz u tp somewhere or randomly for fun
still u have to unlock 1 coin seller to block 1 player who spam his company req (200 limit , its so hard to type the limit 900 or unlimited , it need way too much skill on programming )

I've given it 3 legitimate tries. Release, return to aeternum, and now elysian wilds. It seems like they just don't learn from any of their previous failures. Leveled each time fresh.

Perks and pvp traits are just TERRIBLY balanced. You can really tell they don't have any sort of team dedicated to balancing and implementing pvp and perks. Perks that are so overpowered that if you don't have them and you are fighting someone that does, you just lose. When you have to balance pvp by nerfing and buffing ANYTHING by 50-75% that just reeks of having absolutely no idea how your own game plays and the numbers work. Its awful and just terrible to deal with if you are anywhere near a casual player just trying to gear up. The meta shifts, you finally put together a PVP set with the OP perks and then BAM! It's nerfed into oblivion.

The economy is in shambles. There's too much money going out for upgrades which are being rendered obsolete through nerfs and not enough being generated. There's not enough materials in the world to sustain more than a handful of crafters at any given time. Of course- if you already have the trophies, 250 skill, a full crafter set then yes, you can still pull some profit. You just need a small loan of 300k from someone to get you there.

The mounts are great. The races are a bit ...much. They get extremely tedious after the 2nd tour set.

They still havent solved the issues revolving around mutations requiring specific gems/resists just to get into a group. They make it very difficult to have a use for any of the high level runeglass gems. They still cycle and if you miss the one that has one of your artifacts, youre SOL for another month.

Quests are still buggy and janky as hell. They seemed to have fixed a majority of the story quests but it should not take 3 weeks to fix a MAIN STORY QUEST that unlocks your Heartgem slot.

End game doesnt seem to have changed at all. Bunch of people just war log. You can do Mutations and ECR 

Influence races were pretty fun when the numbers were close but quickly get expensive and unfun when outnumbered. Grinding pvp levels hoping for an artifact got old pretty quick.

Dark matter doesnt drop enough and you need a shitload.

Unfortunate, really. I really hoped the balance and tweaks would improve with time but it is just as bad as ever.",1700616862,1700616862,False,3,0,0.510460257530212402,0,True,False,False

The game obviously had many issues at launch, and some still have not been fixed. As of writing this review, only 17% of people have gotten the Steam achievement of reaching level 60. But at the start of The Heart of Madness update the developers thought it’s a good idea to quadruple the amount of experience and double the amount of weapon mastery people receive. Some quests had been broken for months at the time, but instead of fixing them right away after receiving hundreds of reports about it on the forum, they had always waited to release a big patch fixing multiple issues at once. I don’t blame people for quitting, but for some reason the developers decided to punish people who actually stuck with the game and took the time to level up and grind weapon mastery, instead of making the levelling experience more enjoyable and bug-free so that people can go at it at the initially intended pacing. Speeding up the pacing makes more sense in MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, where after a new expansion comes out, the previous one becomes irrelevant and it is impossible to find parties for content from the previous expansions (on top of that, in World of Warcraft you oftentimes have to make new characters if you want to try out different classes/professions, which is not the case in New World). FOCUS ON MAKING CONTENT BETTER AND MORE ENJOYABLE, NOT ON APPEALING TO LAZY PEOPLE THAT WILL COMPLAIN ABOUT THE GAME ANYWAY.

As of April 2023, there are pay to win elements in the game. If you have Amazon Prime, you can get Vials of Suspended Azoth and Umbral Shards on Twitch after linking your accounts. On top of that, there is a premium Battle Pass which rewards you Gypsum Orbs, coins and other things affecting the gameplay like the territory standing boosts which translate into having faster gathering time, lower taxes as well as more storageroom.

In October 2023 they released the first ""expansion"", which in reality was a $30 patch that was more comparable to the free Brimstone Sands update size-wise, than to any proper expansion in proper MMOs like FFXIV or WoW. On top of that, it seems that they will keep releasing four Battle Passes a year, with multiple pay 2 win elements mentioned before. It is also the first time that achieving all Steam achievements is not possible anymore; you cannot earn territory standing in First Light anymore as it has been transformed in the new expansion's map, but the achievement still remains. It has been clear that the developers do not play the game from the very start, there are bugs I have been encountering daily since the game was released more than two years ago that nobody seems to care about (like the visual bug of displaying gaining territory standing for the zone you are currently in when paying upkeep from the map UI, or the bug of not being able to use hotkeys/click on items to separate them), and now they are asking the community to nominate the game for the ""Labour of Love"" for Steam Awards 2023. If anything, they could have had the award for the greediest developer, but it seems that Blizzard put Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 on Steam.",1648878584,1700612905,False,3,3,0.535723090171813965,2,True,False,False

New world has an amazing core. I love it. Its why I have over 500 hours in game, but sadly the devs of this game ignore huge issues have no clear direction. Feedback takes months or even years for the devs to act on, all while the game bleeds players. Balance patches are done with an iron fist rather than small tweaks, and ignore core issues.

The devs seem to keep following the same loop. Players ask for x change, they ignore the feedback or tell us they not going to do it. Players leave. Devs see this then finally listen to the feedback. Then this loops over, and over, and over again for every key bit of feedback. It happened with mounts, fast travel, levelling, quest, group finder, the main end game loop, etc. Now its happening again with the economy, game balance in pvp, the pvp track, cost of changing skills. I'm sure they'll fix all these issue, like they have with the past ones, but they'll keep their head in the sand and only finally do it when players really leave.

I would love the say the game is good now, to tell people to come back, but I can't. I only wish that this game was in the hands of another team.

The big summer update which they released did not only contain a summer event based literally only on the least liked tradeskill (fishing) and the new instruments tradeskill. So to summarize the event: Its an RP Event no one should take serious. A shitty event wouldnt be the only problem though. After introducing Gear Downscaling for new lv60 players earlier this year (or at the end of the last year, cant remember), AGS though it would be great to make their game more casual friendly and remove ""gatekeeping"".

How did they do it? Not by removing the downscaling, but by overtuning the drops so absurdly that literally anyone collecting 5-10 lootboxes of the PvP gamemode ""OPR"" (which takes maybe 4-5 hours to do) will very likely get a Best in slot item for PvP, even a neutral ""universal"" BiS if theyre somewhat lucky, therefore invalidating the time and effort of PvP players who spent a lot of time getting their hands on decent equipment.

Lets talk about the ""PvP"" mode OPR... you will see people chopping down trees in this mode since they can use the wood to put up gates in the forts (controlpoints) their team owns. Whats so bad about this? They can repair those gates. And you can literally outrepair those gates at max level against 10 players trying to tear it down. How is that supposed to be PvP?
There is the option to construct a respawn point for your own team in those forts as well. Those were towers people could see and shoot while being outside of the fort, therefore forcing the enemies to do something about you, if you didnt want to lose your respawn for free. The update changed those so that there is no way for you to damage them without either opening the doors or already being inside. 
The game has become a shitshow which keeps catering towards casuals and PvE players while constantly fucking around with the stuff that makes PvP interesting. fun, or at least good enough to keep playing the game.

If you want to casually play a game for PvE or RP? Sure, go ahead. But I recommend not even thinking about it ever again if you want your game to be more than an unrewarding, dull and stupid farming sim.",1644162203,1700593994,False,4,1,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

Will you get time out of it worth the price of purchase? Yep.

Will you be frustrated every login after finishing the main story quest and moving on to end-game? Likely, bugs have never not been regularly occurring.

Bugs present since launch, more added every patch- each patch is likely to corrupt your files.

Economy was immediately wrecked, originally blatantly encouraged gold farmers and buyer relationship- now less directly and pretty much leveling out.

Balance is not worth the laugh and will continue to worsen as AGS caters to folk wholly unaware of already-present mechanics asking for things that already exist or are completely ridiculous.

New world isn't as bad as people say.... 

The game has issues like lack of end game content, poor leveling system that seems repetitive, and lag issues. But as long as the developers don't give up on the game and 'cut their loses' the game will be successful. This game has some of the best roots for an MMO I've ever played. The foundation is there. Sadly it does feel it needed another year of development. Though in the meantime it's worth the price of $40 without a subscription. 

The game currently is fun and I will continue to play because in a year it will be one of the better MMOs on the market. The developers have been listening to the fans and have been putting out videos to show they are listening and staying transparent with the players. It may not make a final fantasy turn around but the game will rebound.

One year update --2023--

Im going to keep this short. If you tried New World at launch it was a bad game. But every gripe you had at that point has most likely been fixed.

A buddy raved about this game (he uses Windows) and I have seen reports on the web that NW does work in Linux, so I gave it a try.  Spent a couple of hours trying a lot of different things to make this work, finally gave up.  Either the game would freeze with a white screen on startup, then (sometimes) crash to desktop, or the game would play for a few minutes, then CtD.

If I deleted the New World folders from the AGS folders in Roaming and Local folders, I could play for about five minutes, then another crash to desktop.

After all my testing, I ended up with one lvl 3 char on NA East and one lvl 2 char on NA West.

List of what I tried includes:
Started with files installed on HDD, then used Steam to move files to SSD, repeatedly verified files;
Four different versions of Proton, including GE Proton;
Three different NVIDIA graphics drivers, beginning with the 525 that I use constantly for Path of Exile, then tried 545 (sorta beta) and finally 535;
Started on NA East server, saw 100ms+ pings, switched to NA West (sub-20ms);
Full screen and windowed;
Numerous reboots and cleaning of AGS folders;
Setting Steam launch options to: -high -useallavailablecores;
Also tried Steam launch options to force DirectX10, 11, and 12.

I'm done.  If my experience is typical for Linux players, this game is NOT ready for release to Linux.  Requested a refund from Steam.

---------------------
Update: Steam refused my refund request, claiming my account showed I had played the game for four hours.  No, I did not play the game for four hours.  I spent four hours trying to get this POS to run more than five minutes without crashing, then finally gave up.  Linux users, you've been warned.

I'm nearly 20 hours in and have yet to fall victim to the world.

It still needs work.

This games current story so far really does its best to engulf the player into the world. 
Crafting and hunting is simplified enough that both casual gamers and hardcore gamers won't complain about it.
The cities and towns are big and plentiful and each really feel like their own But a few have a copy a paste thing going on.

Enemies aren't that impressive. It seems every region you go to you're facing the same enemy types over and over. The few bosses and event bosses I've encountered were very unique. Though I had little to no trouble soloing them. 

My only negatives so far is getting gold is kind of like real life. You get paid 40.12 gold for a completing a quest but, items or even houses you want to buy are very expensive. 
Swimming is none existing in this title. If you go into deep waters you have 20 seconds to walk out or you die. This game has been out for two years and a simple swimming mechanic hasn't been added.
So far, trading seems to be done between players only. So if you have junk you want to sell, You gotta hope a player wants it. I hope this gets updated later on. I've collected alot of trash items since I started that I'd like to get rid of without having to scrap or drop.

I'd like to see companions and new races added to the game in the future. I'm mostly a solo player due to my work schedule and others schedules never lining up. 

Overall this is game is a very decent MMO.

After a couple years, these things are all very true still - I mean, they still have the same bugs from original launch (like trading post, haste bug, etc.). Endgame is literally grinding whatever a player thinks is BIS just to do all the redundant, unchallenging content they had to grind to get there.

It has the skeleton of something that could be quite good, but there's still no meat on the bones after all this time. 

[1500 hour review] Ok. I have some hours clocked, right? I was incredibly enthusiastic about this game because it was promoted as a PvP heavy game. Now, it's a poor quality PvX. The dungeons aren't challenging - Gear Score (grinding to level up your gear) is the only real inhibitor to doing dungeons easily (gems for elemental resistances and race specific armor resistances recommended). Not skill. Not mechanics. Not synergies. PvP has been reduced to: 1) a 20v20 that incorporates no balanced/ranked matchmaking, 2) 3v3 arena that is not rewarding so no one is queued, and 3) open world...if you flag (few do)...for next to no rewards. Merging servers has broken apart my communities and made it difficult to find new, active groups; this has happened several times. Finally, things just break or don't work after every patch, and at this point it's just disheartening.

Overall, I'd give New World the rating of ""meh."" I'm about tapped out, but once I quit, I won't return unless glowing reviews from peers start coming at me - something the last shred of hopium looks forward to.",1638417101,1700417003,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The devs seem to be hitting their stride lately with new updates making the game better than it was at release. The Artifact weapons are a cool touch for collectors and the combat has a solid, satisfying feel to it.

Dungeons like the Tempest Heart are immersive and some of the best times I've had in-game. The atmosphere they've created is top-notch.

As for negatives... the tooltips can be misleading—they don't always match what's actually happening in-game, which can be a bummer. But overall, ""New World"" is worth sinking your teeth into if you're into MMORPGs with substantial content.

The problems

The quests are uninspired fetch quests and generic kill quests – nothing to keep you engaged or excited about the next objective.

The touted player-driven economy is a joke. The market system is poorly designed, and it's impossible to make a decent profit without sinking an exorbitant amount of time into mindless resource gathering and crafting. The whole concept of player-driven economy ends up being more of a chore than a rewarding aspect of the game.

Graphically, the game is mediocre at best. While some environments are visually appealing, the character models and animations are outdated. It's like stepping back in time to the early 2000s, and not in a nostalgic way.

The gear progression system is flawed. Certain armor sets and accessories clearly outshine others, creating a clear hierarchy that renders many items obsolete. This lack of diversity in viable gear options makes the grind for better equipment feel less rewarding, as the endgame essentially becomes a quest for a specific set of overpowered gear rather than a meaningful exploration of different playstyles.

Crafting also suffers from poor item balancing. Some crafted items are so powerful that they completely overshadow the rewards from challenging PvE content. This undermines the sense of accomplishment from defeating tough bosses or completing challenging dungeons when the loot they drop is less valuable than what can be crafted with relatively common materials.

* Economy.
* Gathering.
* Loot acquisition.
* Technical Debt.

The economy of this expansion has capped the cost of items.  But the drops you can earn randomly by playing can be BIS (outside of certain perks being unavailable).  So it becomes a ""how quickly do I earn gold"" vs ""how quickly do I win the loot lottery"" vs ""players are constantly devaluing items due to competition with players with less and less gold"".  There will be a point where the best path to equipping a new character will be 'start over, do the quests for gold, and buy from the auction house'.  Even supersizing your houses (and their weekly taxes).

Gathering.  The game has a tiered pyramid system where A is ued to make B which is used to make C.  However the tools the developers have have very limited abilities to add new resouces to the map.  They can change what drops per spawn, but apparently in a resource gathering game, adding resources is ""hard"". It has been this way for years when the devs said adding Trees to OPR (to add more musket/bow/firestaff defense) was difficult.  Players optimize their time, afk farm resources, and players running around for resouces spend a lot of time finding already exhausted resources.  Then you have the ""Can I craft for myself, as a solo self bound?""  The answer is: Yes, maybe, do you have a life... do you hate yourself?  You will likely give up, because the 10s of 1000s of resources required aren't worth solo farming.  And this is the problem: One persons investment in their gear is NOT the same as anothers.

Loot Acquisition. If you gold buy you can have bis in hours.  If you solo farm resources and craft, years.  The devs can decide your items are useless almost on a whim.  Demoting your playstyle with perk changes.  Basically this game is a ""Farm the patch"" game (earn artifacts/seasonal events the first days/week they are released) and check the auction house for your specific needs at other times.  Gradually earn dark matter given your playstyle and realize you will have far more items that need dark matter than you can acquire so you stop caring.  Your bank will be filled with tons of 'maybe someday' items.  Items that used to be 600 and useful and you pushed to 625 for specific needs became 632 and required 15k gold and weeks (or hours of dungeons) in Dark Matter to ""see"" if the item is useful.

Technical Debt.  The tools/software the developers have do not allow them to maintain quality and it is left to a revolving door of team members who lack deep understanding.  Ex: You can find Flails with Bane as Named Drops.  The expansion removed Bane.  The existence of these items to veteran players is proof the developers don't care or the tool used to create the items is inept. The devs appear to have meetings and argue over usage reports. The reports will nevershow apathy,

Can you enjoy this game? Yes. Unless you have a guild, or have specific self formed goals, just play the patch.",1670934186,1700116787,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

----------------------------
Servers unstable, amazon needs better game servers. would still play again..... im a sucker for badly executed games.

Game has alot of potential, I'd recommend giving it a try. 

There is alot of bugs, I've yet to run into a bug that has caused game breaking/progress denying issues...

(asfaik gamers I've met from WoW tend to struggle adapting to the ui ... somehow imo the ui is super simple but it might be confusing due to lack of information outside the boundaries of translations)

Sometimes the waypoints become finicky and changes based of your location

 (when moving between territories it will try to prioritize the missions in that territory it gets confusing as you'll have to manually pin quests if you accept too many to avoid running back and forth wondering why the waypoint keeps looping you around )

The crafting is interesting however collecting resources can become the most competitive thing in this game since all the resource points are shared. If someone else takes it you have to wait 5-15mins and race to the next one. im not a fan of due to. 
Some ""bots"" or extremely efficient players make it difficult. imo 250 player servers feel just right in resources, but near impossible to find expeditions.

(this will change with upcoming updates according to a roadmap as of 2023~ giving expeditions ques to ""all servers/worlds?"" )

The Populated servers have alot more players, and not enough resources so the 1000+ population worlds are... not entirely enjoyable in comparison to lower population servers

(wish you could freely choose your server on log in but I understand why this is still common in older <- mmos being in a seeded que on login to place you in the best possible server location, but able to join friends would be nice too... but it might change the economy/enjoyment of community/guilds given the way the territories in the game work)

The community is quite.... unique... overly political and easily angered.... individuals i've encountered scream a inferiority complex so some of those individuals try to shit on others instead of trying to help newer players from what I noticed in both EU/US servers... relatively speaking its unfriendly to newer players.... unfortunate...

If you're expecting to do dungeons or have ""competent"" teams with PuG matches its not going to go well most of the time.... gear does matter in this game compared to some other MMOs and 2 random dungeons have mutations which furthur increases the difficulty of the enemies and your Gear Score matter at an noticeable degree even though they dont really increase the damage from 10 to 100 but it feels like that (the enemies tend to be ""weaker?"" to higher gear score weapons and do less dmg to higher gear score armor) I really like the Gear score Mechanic as it adds more depth to your builds, 

This game isn't bad at all I'd still recommend giving it a try, however don't depend on most guides as the game changes become drastic over time asfaik which is honestly pretty well done imo as it makes tinkering with builds and trying new things less ""meta"" however there will be constant ""opinions"" on what should be done~",1688991596,1700098426,False,0,0,0.538705170154571533,0,True,False,False

Will hang out for a bit longer until the next game, after which I'll slowly drift away, this game had so much potential but has been a giant flop of an MMO, even with recent updates. 

Overall I feel the developers don't really know what they're doing.

-patches are huge, even minor ones - 27gb avg for the last few patches
-lots of bugs
-servers are isolated, so your server population is your bubble
-sever population numbers are pretty low
-when there are ingame events, that entire day, rest of the games group activities are completely dead, participating in the event requires a raid as you won't get kill credit going solo, there is constant spam, event boss health unbalanced, not high enough at the start so things die when you get there and too much at the end when no one is doing it making it pointless. 
-manual grouping, no dungeon finder. 
-excessive grind for crafting
-economy is bad with massive gold sinks for all the main systems.
-no split balancing between pve/pvp",1697296858,1700042490,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game's actually quite good like 7/10

obviously the game needs quite a lot of work cause it has a lot of frame drops durring events/chest runs
i think it lacks a bit in end game with how the dungeons currently operate but i would say its bad.
The only thing that is kind of a let down for me is how the artifacts that they added are lock behind the pvp track they've got since im not a pvper myself but again but it is what it is at this point. also mount system looks really good on road even if it gets a bit clunky off road. obviously the game has huge potential but also needs a lot of work.

Also here a recipe that i copied from somewhere else xD 

how to make delicious Butter Chicken.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Ingredients for 4 servings,
2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast (910 g), cubed
salt, to taste
pepper, to taste
2 teaspoons chili powder, divided
½ teaspoon turmeric
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1 ½ cups yellow onion (225 g), diced
3 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ginger, grated
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cinnamon, 3 inch (8 cm) stick
14 oz tomato sauce (395 g)
1 cup water (240 mL)
1 cup heavy cream (240 mL)
rice, for serving
fresh cilantro, chopped for garnish.

Preparation
In a large bowl, season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, and the teaspoon of turmeric. Let
sit for 15 minutes to marinate.
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Brown the chicken, then remove from the pot.
Melt another 2 tablespoons of butter in the pot, then add the onion, garam masala, remaining teaspoon of chili powder,
the cumin, ginger, garlic, cayenne, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Cook until fragrant.
Add the tomato sauce and bring to a simmer.
Add the water and cream and return to a simmer.
Return the chicken to the pot, cover, and simmer for another 10-15 minutes.
Stir in the last 2 tablespoons of butter and season with more salt and pepper to taste.
Serve the chicken over rice and garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!",1700025148,1700025148,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The major frustration being that their code suffers major break chain issues. 
This has become so par for the course that with every exciting update, you can also expect the change/implementations to code will break things up and down the chain. 

Because of this, New World could be expected to have as rocky a future as it has had launch. Being in a constant state of broken repair, as it expands it's already limited content.

other than the much needed town and msq updates, everything else releases with poor thought and poor execution. even the PvP systems (PvP was the main focus of this game up until beta) are poorly designed and executed.

the combat system and gathering of open world resources (the world is beautifully created and can provide you some very nice scenery screenshots with your character) are the only thing that is good in the core game and what keeps me coming back after every 6 month or so break from the game out of frustration from the countless issues in other areas.

i do not recommend this game unless you want to see the combat system and the resource gathering in action. the msq and side quests will provide enough game time to get your money worth out of it while you do that.

Decent story, rather easy navigation of quests, actually challenging enemies through out and really fun PVP!

There are a lot of bugs but none that'll ruin your experience. I mostly laughed when falling through a rock and not being able to get out. 

It does a really good job at making you feel like you're apart of this amazing world. 

Mounts feel necessary once you reach a certain level. Locking them behind the new DLC is a little scummy. Kinda feels like I paid $40aud for a mount but it is what it is.

Early levels are fun until the late 50's. Endgame consists of 6~ dungeon runs to get maxed gear then there is nothing to grind for crafting is not needed when you can get BIS drops from random mobs. ( But there is a bunch to do making it worth the price if you buy it on sale)

Unlike most Mmos, New world has some weapons that allow a way more interactive combat system that requires you to actually aim to hit your targets, even having head shot bonuses instead of a click and charge ability that can't miss unless rng decides. 

The progressions starts of kind of clunky but gets real fun once you learn the basics and picked what weapons and playstyle you want to use. Unlocking abilities and gear to better suit your playstyle is also really cool. 

However, the game gets extremely repetitive fast and you find yourself doing essentially the exact same quests and activities over and over and over until you finally reach lvl 60 and can try out PvP for the first time only to find it all has devolved into any other MMo PvP with absolute spam shitfiesta fights consisting of nothing but dodge spam, Aoe spam, aim assist melee spam and some more spam. It's incredibly annoying and unrewarding trying to use any sort of accurate aiming abilities especially in many fights where the servers are performing so bad that many shots never even register. 

This wouldn't be as bad if it weren't for one small detail. You can't use any sort of mounts or level up past 60 in the game unless you buy a 30 dollars season pass in the game that already has an item shop and battle pass. 

In any sort of PvP scenario which there are a few of, this makes the game plain and simple Pay 2 Win. 

There is no point arguing this to the currently insanely delusional, obnoxious and toxic playerbase because 1. They don't posses basic math skills and logical understanding or 2. They suffer from excessive amounts of sunk-cost fallacy and are high on copium trying to make up excuses for the game and do mental gymnastics on why It's not Pay 2 Win to pay real money to get an advantage over someone in a PvP game scenario who hasn't paid real money. 

Overall decent start to an MMo but quickly devolves into garbage. There's not a bright future for this game with how boring it gets long term and the fact that it allows blatant Pay 2 Win in a fully paid 40 dollar PC game in 2023 is fucking madness. 

Also, it certainly doesn't help that the game has lost over 95% of its playerbase. Hmm I wonder why.",1699835676,1699835676,False,3,0,0.506234407424926758,0,True,False,False

I played New World at release, it was already full of life, beautiful in terms of graphics, with an excellent sound design and
the crafting and professions very satisfying.
The journey until level 25 was refreshing and give me back the ""first mmo vibe"".
But it had some problems that quite ruined the second part of the leveling and the endgame : repetitiveness, endgame grinding...

All the updates and the extension fixed practically all the faults that I found in it, with a complete rework of the leveling, mounts, and new systems for endgame dungeons, way to gear up and much much more..

It deserves to be looked at again ;)

The content is wafer thin, it has all the feel of a paid beta at this stage that's been released onto us, they had a duping bug problem for about three weeks which gamers have gotten away with now to the resentment of a lot of the player base as their running around in gear they shouldn't have and ferreted away on alts as I understand it, though no proper explanation from the dev team if they dealt with this stuff, 

It has too numerous bugs top mention at this stage and a dev team which does very little interaction with the player base outside of the token minimum on their forums when people scream enough, there's no road-map for the game and no development plan we can see at all yet.  The devs also failed to secure their bug reporting forum properly so it basically became a library of exploits instead of just hiding posts between the dev and the person reporting it, then they wonder why you suddenly get mass exploits taking place when they effectively hold a library of them on their forums fully accessible to all of the player base.

The amount of content as you progress through the game becomes wafer thin the more you level, as you hit 60 the max level then,  you get to then have to level up a ""watermark"" system that you cannot see in game and it gives you no clue as to what you should do to level your gear, the dev team made changes then to all of the elites pretty much locking the people out of this gearing up who were slower levelling as it wasnt worth the effort anymore and anyone who didn't have all this gear farmed now have much less of a chance of getting gear like other players now, they did this in an ""undocumented change"" in a patch too which was particularly galling as it was done hush hush and then hastily apologised for with a weak explanation for fundamentally changing the game.

It has got systems in place which do things like auto-ban people on mass report abuse which player companies do in game a fair amount and I have seen repeatedly now and if you get banned  then Amazon have zero decent customer support behind it to be able to deal with that smoothly and swiftly for the person their system has been abused to ban, there's no point raising an appeal as the people you raise it with don't seem to have any easy ability to deal with it either to add to the frustration, the offenders then get away with it too while my friends get banned out of wars, this whole auto-ban setup makes you not want to talk in global chat at all or interact with anyone in the world for fear of being banned from the game for nothing now other than being in an area where other people who outnumber you have decided to farm also, it needs turning off and they need to employ actual GMs or Admins in game that are contactable live to deal with issues in game.

The numerous bugs I could put up with as they were dealing with them quickly and timely, but the most recent one has broken me really, - Despite me having uncovered all of the towns and all the fast travel points in the game, it decided then in a bug after the latest patch, that it was going to completely remove my inn recall and all fast travel points and teleport ability to towns that I had accessed previously, to sort that out I would have to walk the entirety of the map again picking up these points for the second time which would take me about 4/5 hours because of the map sizes and pathing I would have to take.

I cannot recommend the game to anyone as it stands, I will say that I do like the game a lot, its very enjoyable and different to other MMOs in the genre coming from a WoW point of view it was refreshing to begin with, but at the moment, its so volatile from patch to patch with the dev team seemingly overwhelmed that I just cannot recommend it to others, maybe a year down the line this can be revisted to see if its improved, but as of now my opinion stands.

Update: 
I returned to the game after leaving it as I said above, its fresh start realms free of the cash rich dedupers and the game is in an infinitely better position than the first review that I made, its now an enjoyable experience free of annoyances like Expertise grinds and features an infinitely better story driven levelling experience than it did at launch and I would recommend it based on the multitude of improvements the developers have made.",1637615829,1699815957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest beef with New World is the resource nodes are far and few and they are shared between everyone on the server. You run into never being able to collect higher tier resources because they are camped by people farming them almost 24/7.

My other huge complaint about New World is the inventory and storage system. The storage is based off of town and weight of items. Most cities you cant even store the resources you need to level up your crafting to max. The town storage is not shared, so you have to either go to each specific town where your specific resources are to craft (which is limited because you have to spend Azoth salt to teleport) OR you can pull out the crafting materials from storage into your inventory which don't fit because you cant carry that much weight. It is very inconvenient to have to pull 1-2 resources run to the crafting station craft a thing or 2 then go back to the storage for more resources. This game is HEAVY on crafting and if that is the case at least implement a storage and inventory system that can support your games main mechanic.

Furthermore the PVP in this game is not very good. It consists of alot of people running around drinking potions or all together just running away from you. 99% of players don't even flag for PVP and most players try to play only PVE. New World should force players to flag for pvp 100% of the time unless they are in cities or at teleport shrines.

Why would you have a mostly pvp based game and give players the option to never partake in the action.....

The dungeon system is quite boring. There are very few dungeons and the way you get better gear is doing the same exact boring dungeon on a hard difficulty which M1 and M2 aren't even a big challenge. M3 is quite easy also.
Most items you get are BOP so you just salvage a ton of gear and you can only salvage so much before you max out salvage parts to 2000 then you are forced to go craft repair kits and repair kits are useless in the game because you can repair at any time in your inventory (not using repair kits)

Gathering the artifact gear is very simple but just a waste of time really. You sit at a boss or monster which dies in 2-3 hits and kill it 5-10 times and you have an artifact. OR you can just pay real money for the season pass and get a full set of artifact gear from paying real money.

The transmog system is absolutely TRASH. EVERYTIME you want to add an item to your transmog set you have to pay REAL LIFE MONEY. You only get 1 transmog token for free while leveling to max level.

There are 3 pvp factions in New world that fight for control over zones and its sad because at any point in time you can change factions. This creates a huge imbalance and 1 factions controls the entire map with no hope of anything.  With the majority of players not participating in PVP it makes the game seem worthless.",1699801971,1699802862,False,2,0,0.490945667028427124,2,True,False,False

Until they do, I'm changing my review to NOT RECOMMENDED. Some rewards are very stupidly locked to a ""PVP-gate,"" like Serenity greatsword ... which by the way ... DOESN'T HAVE ANY PVP-ONLY PERKS ON IT. Until you fix that and give alternate ways to earn it, you will not be getting a thumbs-up from me.

Update 07/23: The game has gotten better in terms of things to do with PVE players. I can usually complete MOST of a card in the season pass, but I skip PVP-related activities since I'm not a PVPer (I will do duels with friends, but not PVP openworld or even 3v3). I prefer the more calm pace of a PVE experience myself.

The current Season pass is a little bit better than the first season pass. Though transmogs aren't useful right now, next season they should be. At least they're letting us get some before the feature is fully out so we can decide what we want to equip.

This review reflects my views and not the views of others, Amazon Games Studio, their employees, blah blah disclaimer here. I am stating this because of certain nasty elements who like to call people that disagree with them ""AGS brown-nosers"" (this will come up later, I assure you).

There are a LOT of misconceptions by a LOT of people about this game, made worse by people who only want something to trash-talk about (like those people that call others AGS brown-nosers. See? Told you it would come up later). So read up, people. I am going to tell you how it really is. I know, I know. Many say that and then proceed with a lot of whining, crying, and excuses. Ignore that garbage and read closely. I am going to tell it to you straight, whether you want to read it or not (though I imagine if you did not want to read it, you would not still be reading this...)

[b]How Well Does Amazon Games Studio Listen?[/b]
Pretty freaking spectacularly, actually. I mean, they are not going to take every suggestion you throw at them, of course. No company would. Also, sometimes bugs take time to fix, and people need to realize that. But when we told AGS, ""HEY! You got botters and gold sellers!"" They listened. Hard-core, too. These days you are hard-pressed to find these jerks in-game. If you do, make certain to report them, please. There is even a special category on the report screen for these low-life assholes. Also, please stop giving credence to people that rant about ""AGS brown-nosers"" and that garbage (they make claims such as that AGS hires people to go in-game and talk about how great it is, etc.) I assure you, ""AGS brown-noser"" is nothing more than a made-up phrase by people trying to humiliate and degrade others that disagree with them.

[b]What About Mounts?[/b]
Do they have mounts? Yes, but only if you purchase the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC. For those of you that do not have the DLC, Auto-Run is still your best friend. Even having mounts, Auto-Run is your best friend. The good news is that you do not see 99.9% of the population using their mounts to out-run others to nodes and fights in low level areas. Surprisingly, even those with mounts are running on foot to these things, to make it fair to those without the mounts. Kudos to the community for this! You also do not see people running amok in the cities with mounts, blocking NPCs and other things. Part of this is no doubt due to the inability to use the Dash (speed boost) in cities. Another part of this is that you cannot stand in the same space as another person while on a mount; one of you has to move. The rest? Call it being polite? Whatever it is, it is nice to see.

[b]Is Player Housing Available?[/b]
Yes. Yes it is. So the up-side is that you can use your house in this game to add to your storage capacity and as a free teleport to the city it is in pretty frequently. You can even decorate them and craft furniture in-game for the house, or purchase furnishing packs from the in-game Store with Marks of Fortune. The down side to this is that you have to pay in-game taxes each week to the Company that runs the city. If the company is charging high taxes, you might be screwed. You can opt to not pay the taxes for a week if you wish. Not paying them simply means that you do not have access to that house nor its upgrades for the week. The choice is yours.

[b]Are You Lagging, Stuttering, Rubber-Banding, etc.?[/b]
If you are lagging, stuttering, rubber-banding in this game... This is a YOU problem by this point, not a GAME problem. Do I experience any of this whatsoever? Nope! Do I have a top-of-the-line computer? Nah. Close, but not fully. Anyway, any issues that New World had on their servers with such things have been long since fixed, I assure you. Anyone that is still having these problems either has an issue with their computer not being good enough to run it, OR their internet connection is having issues, OR their ISP sucks, OR they need to alter their settings. No, really. I am not joking. So THUMBS UP to AGS for fixing the issues they did have (which, honestly, were not that many in this field).

[b]Systems: How Well or Badly They Work[/b]
AGS is constantly making improvements and changes to their systems based on feedback by the community (and probably other things like research, but who knows? Only them...). With the majority of the big initial bug issues now resolved, they are focusing a lot more on these things, and it is showing in both their patch notes and in how things are working in-game. My personal experience is that for a long while the leveling was tedious, the crafting was tedious... and, honestly, as a result I did not play New World as much (that, and I have too many games to play!) That experience is quickly changing as these systems are now being tweaked to better play to a fun experience in-game. The XP events are freaking awesome, though, and I do hope they continue in the future, as they help those lower than level 60 to catch up on a lot. I do plan to try to find more time to play New World if I can tear myself away from Guild Wars 2, Lost Ark, and Elder Scrolls Online.......

[b]PvP vs PvE:[/b]
Great news!!! You are never required to PvP. Ever. At all. BEST NEWS EVER, right? At least, coming from a PvE-only player, I find that fantastic news. Now, there are some perks to enabling PvP, such as you get to level some trade skills and such faster while it is on (watch out for those other PvPers though. They will not hesitate to interrupt you from chopping that tree to murder you). Second... It used to be that PvE players would suffer greatly from the actions of PvPers due to the fact that the Azoth cost to travel depended on whether or not your faction owned certain territories. Thankfully, no more suffering is required. This is another example of AGS listening to those who write thoughtful and meaningful forum posts (you know, not the ones that just whine and scream at the game or AGS employees?) explaining why it was not working out, and fixed it! One last thing. You cannot PvP in cities. Not going to happen. The game does not allow it.

For now, stop listening to the people that hate on things because it is the cool thing to do and just try it for yourself if you really want to. That decision should be yours only, based on your desire to see what it is like or not.

Do I like New World? Sure! Is it my favorite? No. I like it enough to keep playing, though, and as it grows older it continues to improve (in my opinion, of course). I want to see where this one goes. Climb on board or do not. The choice is YOURS alone.",1656828515,1699736943,True,0,1,0.492523163557052612,0,True,False,False

The graphics are lovely

I am really happy to see the work AGS has been doing on this game since its messy launch and slumps; I initially gave up on this game out of frustration but it is honestly coming alive again.

[h3] Bugs are fixed en masse. [/h3] One of my biggest gripes with NW was how insanely unpolished and messy it was. Main story progress was softlocked for so many players, quests did not function properly, performance declined across all PC specs...I could go on. AGS has done a great job of addressing these bugs and smoothing out HUNDREDS of bugs in one patch. 

 [h3] Combat in PVP and PVE alike is fluid, simple, and satisfying, yet challenging all the while. [/h3] Do you want to be a standard Sword/Shield player? A Lifestaff Healer? Too plain? How about a Blunderbuss and an Ice Gauntlet? Oh you changed your mind? Nice and easy switch. You can choose to build your own unique playstyle, perks, weapons, gear, etc, however you want; there is no set rules for 'classes'. Spend time learning intricate combos you can perform for insane damage/debuffs/cc. 

[h3] DO WHATEVER U WANT! [/h3] Do you just wanna chill and farm/harvest/explore the beautifully crafted Aeternum, undisturbed by other players, after a hard day at work? Are you bloodthirsty and seeking PVP in Arenas or Outpost Rush or Wars? Maybe making 500 pieces of jewelry to sell to other players is your thing. Or you could farm whatever event is going on. You are genuinely free to experience this game in any way you like, and I have yet to run out of things to do or progress in. 

[h3] WHAT ABOUT THE DLC? [/h3] I'm somewhat disappointed that mounts, a zone, and flail are behind a paywall. I much rather would have expansions be part of the base game, especially since AGS has normally done a good job of sticking to Buy Once, then Free to Play, since the beginning of NW's life cycle. However, if you do end up loving this game, I think it is well worth it. If you cannot justify the price, that's ok! Mounts have not made a marginal difference in my travelling since Azoth (material used for fast travelling) is plentiful and easy to get  without focusing it, plus fast travel spots are littered throughout the land. The Flail is a niche utility weapon that only specific builds will use, and most players will find themselves getting more value out of literally any other base game weapon. Elysian Wilds (the zone that comes with the dlc) on the other hand, is quite nice to have access to. 

Overall, I think New World once again has a good future ahead of it as one of the greatest MMOs of the decade. Is it flawless, or even close to it? Not at all. But to see a game being taken care of well like this is rare, and I plan on sticking with this game for a long time.

***Even after 2 plus years this game still lacks end game content and becomes incredibly boring once you reach 65 and have good gear.***

Wars suck... they are nothing but a farming session for all the war logger company's that control all the territories across multiple servers they play on..

There's still only one Outpost rush map - and due to poor map design and no sort of class que you will either be farmed at your fort door within minutes or be lucky enough to be on the team farming people. rarely ever will you get a competitive match.

Arena's are ok... as long as you don't solo que.. que up with a healer or other people that also have strong arena specs if you wish to grind this mode successfully...

The new influence races might be the only end game activity that is somewhat fun, although... new mode or not to successfully push influence you must still do the same old boring mechanic of (running pvp missions) if you wish to declare on someone... what a blown opportunity!!! nevertheless if you find a company that participates in them nightly and go to the fort or towers for some engaging large scale pvp they are still fun.

If your not into pvp and your strictly a pve player I hope you like doing mutated dungeons or chest runs over and over again even if you have nothing left to farm for, cause there isn't much else for you.

Lots of work/additions to end game content is needed if AGS wishes to keep some sort of player base moving forward.",1673566011,1699648998,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, this game needs:
-Significantly better storage options. Centralize all storages into 1 and allow us to create named stash tabs...
-Loot filters or auto-salvage function that does it based on a number of rules.
-Game Optimization (fps).
-Remove the 200 gold cost for changing attributes (make it azoth), and allow Gear sets to set specific attributes.

Other minor things:
-Significantly less bugs every update. For every 1 patch expect 10 bugs.
-Fix issues with linking items in chat if using other languages other than english.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

I embarked on my journey in ""New World"" with high hopes, ready to carve out my legacy in its sprawling wilderness. Unfortunately, what I discovered was less of a brave new world and more of a beautiful facade with hollow promises.

Let's talk aesthetics first. Visually, ""New World"" is a feast for the eyes—the lush environments, the attention to detail in the lighting, and the texture work are top-notch. However, even the most beautiful scenery can't mask the emptiness of the world. Compared to the richness of environments in games like ""The Witcher 3,"" where every nook and cranny tells a story, ""New World"" feels like a gorgeous stage set waiting for a play that never starts.

The gameplay mechanics showed promise but quickly became monotonous. The combat lacks the refinement and satisfaction you get from titles like ""Dark Souls,"" where every encounter is a dance with death. Here, battles often feel like a clumsy brawl rather than a skillful showdown. Moreover, the quests are as generic as they come—a far cry from the narrative depth and variety seen in ""Final Fantasy XIV.""

As for the MMO elements, ""New World"" seems to stumble over its own ambitions. The promise of player-driven economies and territory wars sounded groundbreaking, but in practice, it's plagued by imbalance and exploits, leaving it leagues behind the community engagement found in classics like ""World of Warcraft.""

In conclusion, while ""New World"" shines in graphical splendor, it fails to deliver on gameplay innovation and MMO dynamics. It's like being served a gourmet meal with no flavor—it looks good on the plate, but leaves you unsatisfied. Perhaps with time, it could evolve into the game it aspires to be, but for now, it feels like an unfinished symphony.",1632986959,1699548094,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some people might think that to buy an expansion only for mount is totally wrong and here is what you get when you buy it.

1. Mount of course (which you also have to do quests as well.
2. New map unlock with new story quest 
3. You can access the new weapon as well
4. Your level cap will be unlock to 65 instead of 60 without buying expansion 
5. from number 4 if you unlock to 65 you can access more challenge level of dungeon for a better loots. 

The only things I don't like is the mount quest is a little bit boring, it's easy to do it but you have to spend time (at most 20 mins) just to ride your mount. I feel like dev might want us to see the scenery of the game but it's too much.

However, below you will read my honest opinion of this game, Amazon, and the Developer team.

[u][H1]The game:[/H1][/u] 
Firstly, let me just say this. The game of New World itself is in one of the best states that it has ever been. The game is thoroughly enjoyable and quite honestly, it's easy to get lost in all of its systems. Me, being someone with ADHD really struggles (but enjoys) the activities of this game. I find myself getting distracted with profession, uncharted landmarks, and  exploring non-stop while trying to finish my Main Story Quest(MSQ). Recently, I've been cutting down all the tree's where the MSQ takes me, otherwise, I'd never make it very far from settlements. This is my new strategy to stay focused, but also distracted at the same time. :D

The world is absolutely beautiful and some places are breath taking. The amount of time the art team put into this game is astonishing. With that being said, this game has quite a few performance issues. I don't have the weakest system (Game is installed on an internal SSD, 64gb of ram, intel core i7-7700k 4.20GHz, and a nvidia RTX 2080 Super 8gb) and I very much so experience FPS drops quite randomly and frequently. Changing the settings to the lowest of low, doesn't fix anything for me. However, I can look past this seeing how it doesn't ruin the experience for me as I mostly do PvE in these style of games.

I also enjoy the fact that we are pretty much just adventurers in this game. We aren't gods, or world saviors and I hope that it stays this way. The MSQ is nothing special either. So far it hasn't caught my attention, but I am hoping this changes as time goes on.

[u][h1]Now let's talk about Amazon[/h1][/u]
When Amazon first announced that they were going to create a studio that focused on creating the next big MMO with an AAA budget I was extremely excited. (As were many others) I thought, ""Sweet, a company that can afford to not be greedy when it comes today's style gaming market with in-game cash grabs. They'll be able to revolutionize the gaming industry back to the good ol' days."" Boy, was I ever wrong. Amazon, is actually one of the worst offenders in this field. 

Here is why: 
Players have asked for mounts since the launch of New World. This was the #1 most requested thing. Well, the finally delivered, but locked them behind a $30 paywall. The #1 missing thing that drove players AWAY from this game and they lock it behind a paywall? Talk about being disconnected with your own community. I get it, they have to make money. But, that's why they have an in-game store. 

Speaking of the in-game store, this is one of the only games that I have played where you pay money up-front for the game, and so many features are locked behind the in-game store, that is considered a base-game thing is so many other AAA MMO's. Want to transmog? You have to pay. 

With that being said, they could go about this whole in-game store thing completely different. I feel like ESO does everything right. You B2P the game and expansion, and you can choose to pay a sub that gives you minor perks and monthly in- game store currency. The big part being, THE MONTHLY IN-GAME STORE CURRENCY.

In all honesty, Amazon should sell their gaming studios to a company that can afford not having so many pathetic cash grabs. Amazon is their own worst enemy in this aspect.

[u][h1]Now let's speak about the Developer team[/h1][/u]
I honestly feel bad for this development team. I don't feel like many of the choices are up to them when it comes to the cash grabs. I feel like they're told what to do in this aspect and they just deliver what Amazon wants. The dev team is honestly trying their best, and they've seriously created quite an amazing game with the cards they're dealt. 

So that is my review.",1637942658,1699497773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all I would like to clarify I'm not a fanatic MMO player, I rarely play MMOs and my experience on this genre is limited. New World has offered me a very pleasurable gaming experience in my journey so far. I'm a PvE player and I enjoy doing such activities as expeditions, events, farming loot, mining, fishing, etc. For a casual player like me this game feels a lot relaxing and fun. There are some bugs here and there but I have not encountered any game breaking. If you're looking for a casual chill game, this is a very nice choice.

As for the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion released, well... People seems to forget what an expasion of a game is. It expands the game content! That means if you want to progress further than the base game, get items with more gear score, get mounts, compete with other players that have the expansion as well, get MORE content and overall keep up with the development you need to buy it. It's not like Amazon made an inovation in 2023 by adding an expansion to their game. Games have expansions for at least 10 to 15 years already. If you don't wish to buy it (yet) you can still enjoy all the content prior to Rise of Angry Earth but you will play among other users that may have it.

That's all, have fun.",1699446662,1699446662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So here we are again. I came back to New World recently to see what has changed.
What can I say? AGS did a complete 180 with this game.
So many updates, so many new things, things were reworked, things were fixed, and now it's just better than ever.

It just works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I played this game at launch, it was a bloody blast. Everything was fresh and brand new, people everywhere, a new world (pun intended) to explore. And I'm not gonna lie, the 40 something levels I played back then were pretty damn fun, even tho the game practically turned my then laptop into an electrical stove, so I had to get a desktop PC.

However, by the time I got it, the server I was on felt like a bloody ghost town, and most of my company was already just half gone to god knows where. And from there, things only started to get worse. That magical feeling of a brand new game was lost, everyone was abusing the living shit out of every possible exploit, finding groups for expeditions was near impossible since everything felt deserted, and the Lag Wars... Good God the bloody Lag Wars. People jumping around the entire map, tons and tons of AoE spells on a single spot, being unable to capture points in wars thanks to said lag... It was a right mess..

So I was gone for 7 months, and I come back right in time for the nearest update, and what do I find?

The same fucking game I left 7 months ago, only somehow much worse for wear and practically on life support.
Going ""strong"" with ~20k players at peak times. Sure, the servers still get populated up to near capacity of 2k players. Those that remain, that is... Can you imagine that the game had so many servers at launch? 1 Million people, all queuing up to play this one game, and damn near every server being full to the brim with people.

Now it has been reduced to a measly 35 servers out of which ~25 have a population of at least 100 players, and out of those 35 servers, only 13 currently have a population of over 500 players. Only 4 out of those 35 servers have a population of at least 1000. Currently, at time of writing, only 2 servers are near capacity, being: Barri and Dry Tree.

Can you imagine? The game is not even a year old, and from 1 million players, it's down to 20k. This is a massive fall.

Some games have absolutely god awful launches, and recover over time.
Some games start strong, but lose players over the course of a couple of years.
Some games don't even launch at all, for whatever reason.

But New World has managed to lose damn near it's entire playerbase within the span of like 7 months-ish.

Not much has changed since I left it 7 months ago.

This apple looks so bright and juicy, but on the inside, it's rotten to the core.
I say, this game censors criticism even! I cannot even say ""This game was made by a dev team with no mmo experience"", the message simply never gets sent! You cannot even say the dev team has no prior MMO development experience because it just gets filtered! Can you believe it?

Game experiences lag spikes, quests still lack any character, characters lack any soul, mobs are the same all across the game.. Open world is still, in a sense, a running simulator cuz there's not much else to do other than run at a painfully slow speed..

It sucks, you know? I really wanted this game to succeed. Still do. It's got some nice visuals, and the combat's quite simplistic and cool. But overall it's getting killed by being a grindfest with no endgame, repetitive and unimaginative in it's world building. Not every game needs to bring something new and innovative. You don't have to reinvent the wheel to make a good mmo. Simply improving on already existing features can feel quite fun and refreshing. But New World doesn't do that. If anything, it does the same thing other mmos do, but worse somehow.

Game was really made in a vacuum, crafted by a team that didn't even know what an MMO is like it's some brand new concept that only recently got invented.

I expect the game to shutdown sometime after their Autumn update, if not sooner.

Prove me wrong. Please.

EDIT: To clarify, I say ""prove me wrong"" as in please just prove me wrong. This is one of those times where being wrong is just objectively better than being right. This is me pleading you to prove me wrong. Dear God, please just prove me wrong.

New World, the highly anticipated MMORPG developed by Amazon Game Studios, arrived with great expectations. However, after spending significant time exploring its vast world and engaging in its gameplay, I find myself deeply disappointed with the overall experience. While the game showcases some promising ideas, it falls short in several crucial areas, hindering its potential to be a standout title in the genre.

Lackluster Gameplay:
One of the most significant shortcomings of New World lies in its gameplay mechanics. The combat system, touted as one of the game's main selling points, feels clunky and unresponsive. It lacks the fluidity and precision that players expect from modern MMOs. The limited variety of abilities and lack of depth in character progression further contribute to the monotonous grind that plagues the game.

Uninspiring Quest Design:
Questing in New World quickly becomes a tedious and repetitive endeavor. The quests often lack creativity and fail to provide meaningful or engaging objectives. Players are left with a series of fetch quests and generic kill missions, which do little to immerse them in the game world or offer a sense of purpose. The lack of compelling storytelling and memorable NPCs further detracts from the overall experience.

Unbalanced PvP and Endgame Content:
New World heavily promotes its PvP-focused gameplay and large-scale battles, but the implementation leaves much to be desired. The PvP system is imbalanced, favoring high-level players and groups, which leads to frustrating and unfair encounters for newcomers. Additionally, the endgame content feels lacking and fails to offer compelling activities to keep players engaged once they reach the level cap. The lack of meaningful rewards and progression beyond the initial stages of the game further diminishes the motivation to continue playing.

Technical Issues and Optimization:
New World's launch was marred by numerous technical issues and performance problems. From long server queues and frequent crashes to optimization struggles, the game fails to provide a stable and smooth experience. These issues significantly hamper the enjoyment of the game, causing frustration and a sense of wasted potential.

Conclusion:
While New World had the potential to be a groundbreaking MMORPG, it ultimately falls short of expectations. The lackluster gameplay, repetitive quest design, imbalanced PvP, and underwhelming endgame content hinder the overall experience. The technical issues and optimization problems further compound these shortcomings, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the game world. It's a disappointing outcome for a title that promised so much.

1. PVP -  PvP is so unbalanced it's not even fun.  You either steamroll or get steamrolled in OPR.  Very rarely is it a competitive game.  3v3 Arena is a little better.  The reward track for doing PVP just contains so much junk, you rarely get a good item.  You also feel like you need to do PvP because the reward track MIGHT contain a crafting perk called Adamant which is a highly sought after item and is only obtained by doing PvP or from Armoring Aptitude crates.  

2. Storage - Storage is still a major qualify of life disappointment.  It is a major pain to try and manage it and you can forget about organizing.  It needs to be one full storage system with the combined weight.  AND you should be able to craft from storage instead of RP walking to crafting stations because you are encumbered

3. Ultimate Trophy's - The made a nice step forward with the Ultimate Trophy HOWEVER they cost 45,000 gold and 900,000 faction tokens each.  And in reality you need to have 9 of the ultimate trophy's.  I don't mind a grind on the tokens but 45,000 gold x 9 = 405,000 gold and in all of my hours playing I have maybe hit that gold threshold.  

4. Gathering and Crafting system is like none I have ever encountered in an MMO.  It is almost perfect IMO.  I love getting the different armor sets for each gathering profession or crafting profession.  The only downside to gathering is that I wish there was a node sharing component to the game.  Sometimes you will come across people that will try to aggro mobs on you while you are mining, or skinning or people will outright steal some of the skinning you are doing from killing beasts.  For crafting I don't like the fact that to craft a BiS you need to have so many different ""buffs"", I will say, for the lack of a better term.  You need the crafting armor set, you need to have a food buff, you need to have a town buff (which isnt controlled by you the player) ... it's just a little too much

5. Combat - The combat is alright.  I enjoy the classless aspect to the game.  You can choose any weapon you want and that almost takes on the class itself.  I just wish there was more to it, better Vfx or a few more abilities.  It seems monotonous at times and lackluster.

The devs have clearly been hard at work making the game better. My initial review was negative, but hopeful. My current review is less negative, but also less hopeful.

Let's talk about the good, because there is a lot. 

The world itself is beautiful. It's large & expansive, and littered with plenty of points of interest. It was clearly crafted carefully and I'm always impressed with how real it feels. The open world is fantastic.

Combat is fascinating. The game utilizes a two-weapon system that allows you to swap between each somewhat seamlessly in battle. This allows for plenty of unique builds and play styles. 

They've removed the disgusting azoth price on transferring items to and from town storage and a lot of the annoying gear/expedition key systems from the base game with the new expansion. Slowly but surely they're making a lot of these elements from the game more appealing. 

Now onto the bad: 

It's Amazon. Can we all just agree that Amazon is evil as hell? Don't believe me? Here are some of the more egregious elements from the publisher:

Elements that *should* be in the base game that are paywalled:
Transmog
Gear Sets
Mounts

Cash shops are an unfortunate reality and for a purchase to own game like this I understand the necessity for it. But they've taken a page out of the Everquest playbook and added seasonal emotes. Not too bad, right? Except these emotes you pay REAL MONEY for are only available for 24 hours. Now you RENT emotes. I've never been more disgusted by a cash grab in all honesty. 

OH and these emotes are non-refundable. As is the expansion.

The economy is in a pretty rough state as well. It's a completely player-driven economy with no options to sell items to NPCs. Some of the items you want for crafting/upgrading gear are time-gated and purchasable through vendors, but are insanely expensive. New/Returning players simply cannot earn enough gold to keep up. 

It seems like for every 2 things they fix they break 5 things. It's really sad because like I said there's a ton of great elements to this game.",1637664562,1699407855,False,5,0,0.507684946060180664,0,True,False,False

I'm going to say it up front, I haven't hit max level yet and there is a lot I have not done. This game is MUCH BETTER than it was at launch from pve content to pvp, the economy, azoth collection, traveling and mounts. I've just come back to it recently and I'm willing to see it through for quite a while longer. If you are one of the people who heard bad things about it from launch, just forget it. It's still not fantastic, but not for THOSE reasons anymore. I do think the average MMO player who hasn't yet played it would actually like it today.

My favorite thing to do is equip a musket and shoot turkeys. I'm not a sweaty min maxer in any game. I just wanna have fun. Am I having fun here? I guess. 

My feeling on this game is that AGS said ""Look, we put all the things in an MMO that are supposed to be in an MMO: Progression, crafting, gathering, housing, auction house, gear scores, meta builds, seasonal content, fishing, dyes, mounts, group content, pvp, pve, story based quests. Now please love me.""

If you expect to find it in an MMO, It's here. So. There's that. No denying it. If you want a game that gives you a lot of opportunities for progression and min maxing, this game can do that. If you want to just chill and do some mindless pve or gathering, you can do soooo much of that. Wanna decorate your house or play music? do it. 

The thing is, that despite it all being there, the only time I feel connected to the world is when I'm just kinda riding through it. It's gorgeous. It's immersive in small moments. The sounds and visuals are top notch. I literally don't even have a sense of smell at all, and I feel like I can smell the zones and some of the stinkier looking NPCs. 

The story makes no sense to me overall and it does not hook me, and I really can't stand the ""every player is the chosen one"" lazy writing for an MMO, but it's nothing unusual for the genre. There is some more solo-cooperative stuff with Town Boards where you just dump materials and quest objects into a literal bulletin board, not even an NPC. I find it disenchanting and lazy, but hey its like an XP dispenser that helps build up the town so...why not. It works. I'm not in love with it.

The game feels like it always actually just wants money. I have never bought anything from the shop but the feeling this game is not rewarding me for my time and REALLY just wants my money is very strong. Idk why I'm playing it. Its not the worst thing I can do with my time I guess. 

Gathering is top tier. You won't find a better dopamine hit imo. They nailed every aspect of that. Make number go higher. Yes. 

I'd think there'd be more RP going on, given how nice the taverns and environs are in the game. None to be found at all. Wish there was more of that to be seen around.

Bugs are introduced every patch and maybe or maybe not fixed promptly. Whatever. Content updates are regular and only the sweats are getting bored. 

If you have a nice pc, it runs great.

PvP is fun. The Influence races really help with the open world action.

With the GPU issues happening at launch with EVGA cards (I have a 3080 EVGA) I stayed far away. But i enjoyed watching people stream it. Fast forward to nearly 2 months ago,this game went on sale for $15 and i decided.....why not give it a try? 

I jumped in and I was actually impressed and had a pretty fun time playing the game. I managed to play up until about level 30. There is a fun and relaxing feeling when gathering and running around in the world. Its a very appealing setting(most of the time). Unfortunately I was hoping to get some close friends involved in the game and can have a memorable group experience. Sadly nobody was interested in joining the game.

The community from what i saw reminded me of shades of WoW's good old Trade chat. Someone is upset about something and someone else argues with that that person that is upset. It seemed constantly there was a back and forth happening in the global chat.
I currently am off and on FFXIV WoL and a former WoW player for 15-16 years and am considering going back. I hardly have time for one MMO. With New World I think there is value with playing this game and it seems to be in a much better place than launch or the first year. So I would strongly recommend this MMO for anyone who craves a newer and more modern(visually) MMO experience .

I played from Open Beta until New years Day 2022. 
Wars were won by bugs, server-side glitches, back-room win-trading deals and on occasion they were won through hard work and good tactics.
The good tactics made the rush of the game feel great. Those moment kept me playing it all the way to my 600th hour. 
I stopped when the chase was brought down to such a crawl it was a job to play the game. Server Mergers, player griefings, ,and just lack of a rewarding loop was really what brought this game down.

2. absolute braindead balancing.

4. Season 4 announcement was bascially a joke since we get nothing new except artifacts, which are either absolute garbage and wont be played or absolutly broken with a 100% guarantee to screw up pvp even more. (BOW)
5. PvP feels like the unloved child while they implement new solo content which literally nobody asked for. Its an MMO and not a single player rpg ffs. 

Maybe the devs should start playing the game by themselfs to see what mess they've created. If they play the game and still think its in a good state i'd strongly advice them to not sniff paint fumes before business meetings. Maybe that will safe the game....

Lots of mmo alternatives are on the horizon. Fix this mess or buy a coffin cause that game gonna be dead in 2024.

The story isn't bad either, and in it's iteration does a good job immersing you onto this island.

Most of my grievences with New World is because of the devs... 
They started this development as a pure survival game, then added a storymode and optional pvp flag.
You can clearly tell, this game would excel, if only they stuck to the core development.
Ever since release, the game has struggled with mechanics ad-hoced into the game, although most of these has since been resolved.

As the game was released and patched/expanded devs allowed bugs and poor balance creep into the live release, increasingly giving the hardcore players more and more advantage over the casual player.
This has continued to this day with the release of the first expansion. Massive advantages was rewarded to the hard core players, only to be removed before most casual players could partake.

Finall, the game lacks any incentive to socialize beyond companies, there is no single raid as it is known to most players, and the limited development being done to the game, shows most of AGS has moved on to future releases like LOTR.

I want to love it, and I do to some extent, but the game is developed in a way there the DEVs try their hardest to prevent you from having fun. I normally don't do reviews but my experience in the last two-three weeks has really pushed me to do this.

I have been grinding for the Scorpion Sting spear artifact, as it seems really strong and fun in 3v3 arenas. So I go grinding for it. I don't have the rune for the door, the game doesn't teach me where to find it, and google won't give me answers, so I just jump into the hole at the top. Eventually the server restarts and I lose my Inn and have no home. So I am stranded in this hole, with no teleporting out. I log in and wait. I get bored after 10 or so minutes and get kicked for being AFK for trying to escape this hole. Log back in, and nobody is there to let me out. Eventually I get to escape, set my inn, and continue grinding for the spear. Never got it, but that's its own monumental problem.

I get tired of grinding for this spear for a week with nothing else to show for it, so leave the hole today and try to grind my PvP track which moves at a snails pace and locks named items that are required for good builds behind it. However I only queue up with no healer into a healer comp and get steamrolled every time with nothing we could do about it. Mad at that, I decided to go to The Great Cleave and engage in the most boring gameplay known to man because AGS doesn't want their players to be able to level their character in a fun way. Now, me being a bruiser with tank gear in medium armor, running these PVP missions gets camped by some Bow/VG build with light armor. This constantly slows me, hits me with dots, and heals him to full everytime. Me winning this fights don't rely on my playing well, but him making stupid mistakes. Otherwise I cannot win. Right before I rage quit the game, I wanted to post some recruitment posts for my Company in the recruitment chat... All my messages all day work, but posting a recruitment message for my company would not post. Every attempt of me having fun or progressing my character has been stonewalled.

Overall, for the past week, I have been engaging in New World to try to have fun, but am being cornered into not having fun or being able to make meaningful progression in any which way. This has enraged me more than anything else has in terms of gaming. I hope AGS can figure out that the important part of the game isn't restricting the gameplay from the players, but allowing them to have fun in the first place. Recently it feels like their goal is simply placing a framework for fun, and then spending all of their time putting needless barriers around the important parts.",1699324120,1699324120,False,2,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

New World is a fantastic MMO for a casual audience to pick up and play. Over the years, it has grown into a massive, content rich game with a variety of things to do. PvE is fun, engaging at the higher levels, and pretty rewarding. PvP is good, but has it's ups and downs from time to time (currently in a down). 
If you like crafting, this game does it a great justice. With refining and crafting life skills to level up and spec into, putting commitment into a profession can have a pretty large payoff.
Combat is very fluid and feels great! No lock on means combat never feels like it's too mmo-ish, and allows for a good cinematic and engaging feeling combat system, letting you mix in good movement and decision making on the fly.

Nothing changes, aside from the fact that they have still not added some of the most basic features of the average rpg.

Only way to get some help is if you already know something but if you ignore the group dunegons, the game can be enjoyed solo. 

If your going to play, be sure to play on the most popular servers, even if it doesn't let you make a character just wait, i was forced to a smaller server and its so shady, as people with money buy out a lot of the most comment items and resell for anywhere from 10-200x the price from the market shop as there is no cap or regulation on prices, which i respect black desert online for doing, its alright to make money but its down right shady to exploit it to make it harder on others when there is no need.

Plus side, there is a wide range of weapons to use which you can respec and go full beast mode on those weapons which is good, however there is only 6 skills to choose from so it also gets repeative, but its best to try finding what weapons you like and still have fun with it. For me i wanted to be greatsword like gutts from berserk, but its style was boring damage wise, its good for taunting and fighting outnumbered but the skills dont have the power or awe factor. But magic was fun and i really enjoyed the spear and bow.

You will have really fast progression, levelling is super quick, but make sure you focus on the story mode as that will save you a lot of effort to get gear, join one of the three factions asap for faction low level gear, its best from 15-35 but once you hit 45, dont get the gear just buy from market place, but still do quests for making inventory bags that they call satchels. 

I was disappointed with mounts, they slow off roads which makes no sense, id expect them to be fast in the forests and off road especially with a lion and wolf. Be good if there was mounted battle or can fight on your mount for a new dynamic, but its just a road of transport, best mount system hands down goes to guild wars 2. Mounts serve purposes and are just fun.

I never read the story, i skipped all the dialog so i cant comment on it, but it wasn't really interesting, midway i got interested in the ancients immortals but even that was easily seen through and can be summed up in a line. 

So the game can be fun, but its repetitive, like bat **** crazy repetitive and reused, in dunegons your likely to be with people end game levels that wont explain and you just gotta follow along but its great looting with little work. Its a once of purchased but there is a cash shop for skins and appearances, once of the things that upset me with it is some stuff is too overpriced like bundles with have 16 skins in it, 4 will be beautiful done rest dont like, but you gotta spend 64,000 cash shop coins to buy only the items you want. Not only that, there where a lot of cool looking monsters towards max level like the angry earth mobs, and even some of the human bandits that look so much better then anything you can get to wear.

more buggy beta shit at the beginning: like Amazon dont have enough money or servers to actually get it right after 4 betas.

There are also a few bugs that prevent you from progressing at times, they mostly get fixed after every patch, but is replaced by a several tons of new bugs appearing somewhere in the game.

The Transmog, and general collection system of WoW isnt present here too so if you're thinking of buying this to play for the long haul, you'd have to like the PVP content cuz its where it shines the best, IMO.

Lol. Haven't played since last review, but just had to add a laugh. What a dumpster fire this whole thing turned out to be, eh?

2022 Edit: 
My friend convinced me to try again with the Fresh Start servers. There have been constant and consistent updates since I'd played it last, and it seemed like maybe there would be something different.

I have to admit to myself and others that the beginning of the game, the leveling up of gathering skills, is fun. I enjoy harvesting, organizing, and storing materials. I enjoy the sound design most especially. Those things alone are, in some way, worth the initial cost of the game.

But when we got to the end game (even sooner than the first time despite less effort), I found it to be largely the same. There's daily tasks and improvements with the Gypsum system which is interesting, and much better than the invisible watermarking of days past. But while there are things to do, there's very little that I want to do. The same frustrations I had in the beginning are just features of the game. Being stunlocked by enemy hits while never being able to affect the same type of stagger on them. So many little things that I just don't really like. There's still amateur-ish graphical errors and glitches. Things that really shouldn't be in a game with this much constant support a full year after release. (Can't access stash, have to fast travel or restart the game to make it work for one example.)

I don't know man. I want to give the game a thumbs up, for the fun I have gathering. Cause I do, and did. I really enjoyed that aspect of the game. But it would be a misdirection because this isn't what the game is for. (Unless you join with the sole purpose of gathering for a company and never doing anything else. But that's a specific decision you'd have to make while playing.)

Is the game worth the price tag? Yeah, it is. I got 421 hours out of it. I fell for a couple of their stupid store offers, but it's still worth the price tag in total. But I just.. after all the time I spent I've uninstalled it again cause it just seems so empty. Like a movie I paid for and laughed at a couple of times, but I'll forget it soon.

Original:
I really enjoyed the game for all the time I spent... but it needs a lot of work still. So much so, that I'm changing my recommendation to No right now.

There are too many small oversights and quite a few game-breaking issues that slipped under the radar, that makes it feel like they really did push this game out too soon. Playing it has felt like a polished beta.

In retrospect, we all should have waited before jumping on the bandwagon here. For all the joy I had with the game, knowing the bitter taste of what awaited us a few months later - I wouldn't have bought this game in the first place.",1632792920,1699142065,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Having a ""no class"" system is awesome because I don't feel the need to grind 3 separate characters just to have different specs. You technically could have any spec or class on one character. At that point it's more about organizing your gear.

Here's my main gripes:
1.  It's full of bugs, gamebreaking bugs that will stop you from progressing through the story quest kind, where you need to complete them to unlock key abilities to progress in the game.
2.  It started as a survival game and it shows.  As a solo game it's okay, but PvE is meh and PvP is moreso something you do when you're fully geared at level cap and there's nothing else to do.  Worst implementation of a healer I've ever seen in an MMO hands down.
3.  I don't see much of a future for the game, I'm sure there will be people who try it out after some marketing for each expansion with promises of 'improvements', but the issues it has are systemic and I doubt they'll ever change (unless they rewrite the client/server architecture and redo all combat systems, so it won't happen).",1699108574,1699108574,False,5,0,0.513431966304779053,0,True,False,False

Always loved the rpgs where you can go hybrid class and mold it how you want.

I am a returning player and mounts do help traversing the map a lot more. However I cannot reap rewards from activities nor progress a main story quest Accursed Ahpopsis due to not having azoth staff tier 5. I cannot equip heart runes because the quest secrets of the heartgem requires azoth staff tier 5 to complete it. Locked out of abilities everyone gets to have and locked out of story progression. The update that came out today gave me.... azoth staff tier 4. With no way to obtain tier 5. So with 200+ hours in the game this really sucks. Apparently the Azoth staff bugs have been in the game since 2021. finding a solution to this does not seem to be a priority for New World Devs. its sad because I have been enjoying this game for a while now. But i feel cheated out of my money and my time invested.

EDIT: The staff bug has been finally fixed. I can finally progress with main scenario quests in the game. If there ever is a next expansion I will not buy it. Angry Earth feels like it was not ready at all for release from MSQ bugs to players not receiving what they paid for on the season 3 reward track. The solution for those people is that they will supposedly receive extra track progress...next season lol. Folks at the endgame says angry earths content is dry in comparison to brimstone sand which was a free update.

EDIT: I have finally ran into ""My game no longer launches"" problem... I do not know why but the game no longer starts...players do yourself a favor and your money and time else where. Do not buy this game. heading to final fantasy 14 sooner than originally planed.

After many patches they did and are continuing to do, I'd say this game has come a long way. There are still many things they need to fix and/or make better, but at least they are making an effort to make it better! So far, I am happy with the progress that has been made and will enjoy this game for the long haul.
EDIT to now not recommended as of 11/3/2023:

OK... so now that the devs ripped off the arms and legs and sense of humor, off the base game, such as the 5 level brackets above 60, to a new total of 65... that in so doing is denying you the following: 
the improved player stats, the top gear score of items. 
the only area that has the ingredient drops you'd need to make the better food that not only gives better stat boosts, but for a longer duration.
A new weapon that is so OP that it kills you with a few slaps.
The DLC region? it used to be a place called, ""First Light"" they just recycled it into this ""new"" region and then locked it away.
You know all the hype for the mounts? they locked it away as well, but whoop de doo! there is literally a fast travel point not far to travel to, all over the map! You kinda don't need a mount at this point so meh?
Anyhow, all of this is locked out of base game.


All of this restricts you from ever again playing any amount of PVP taken seriously! which is most if not the main reason why you'd suffer through the leveling up from 1 to 65, with the poorly done story missions. and building up so much, to you know. not get mopped by too many people? oh and not to mention the and outpost rush and 3v3 pvp arena as well, now you only get to feasibly do PVE! 

And even then? a bad, watered down PVE because the top levels of dungeons demand top gear score to survive in them for longer than two steps. Oh, and you can forget about being recruited for participation of the invasions, that absolutely have to win the invasion, otherwise the entire town's workshops and armaments get downgraded! Which is an awesome mechanic on paper and practice for an ongoing challenge and leveling the playing field for town ownership, and in the past it really was cool to play in invasions... but now this quickly becomes a problem when you have a significantly smaller pool of battle ready players willing to defend the town!

And the devs? They placed these newly ripped off arms and legs and sense of humor, into a box, wrapped it up and locked it away into a now deemed overly essential DLC ($29.99) that is almost as expensive as the base game (39.99)!

I'd be mad already if it was a $1 or as high as $15 for this shameless, and now made into an overly essential DLC, I might even get the itch to play the game and fork out the $15 to get back to it... but $29.99? when base game is $39.99? 

Oh my God, how does that even register as fair to you devs, or give you any reason to attempt to explain it away? 

I mean c'mon! Take me to dinner first! Make me feel special! Talk to me dirty! SOMETHING! ANYTHING! before you try to shame me twice, and sell me such a dynamic duo, of another bucket of crap! 

The first shaming being the initial base game purchase of, ""Bucket of crap""... now downgraded to, ""bucket of crap: classic"" and the new DLC's, ""bucket of crap: extra!""

So yeah! that's my line in the sand, crossed a few miles back I will admit. 

New world devs, I genuinely loved the world you made, I spent a lot of time in your world, and loved it even with the toxic, clannish, and elitist keyboard warrior warts and all, even after it became a shameless corporate greed cash-in, I stuck by it, hoping it wouldn't get any worse. Well you proved it can get worse.

New World offers a satisfying healing experience, though it could use more attention in terms of balance and end-game content for healers. 

Healing Gameplay (8/10):
New World offers a unique and enjoyable healing experience. The combat system, while not exclusively healer-oriented, adds an exciting dimension to healing. Managing cooldowns, aiming heals, and providing support during intense battles is rewarding. However, I'd love to see more healing-specific abilities and mechanics to further enrich the healing role.

Healer Balance (6/10):
The game has seen its share of balancing issues for healers. Some weapons and abilities have felt overpowered, making it challenging to maintain a balanced PvP experience. Amazon Games has been actively working on these issues, but there's still room for improvement.

PvP Healing (8/10):
Participating in PvP battles as a healer is a thrilling experience. Your role as a support class can be crucial in determining the outcome of fights. Coordinating with your team to keep them alive and secure victories is immensely satisfying. I've had some of the most intense and memorable moments in the heat of battle.

End-Game Healing (7/10):
The end-game content for healers is somewhat limited. While healing is essential in high-level dungeons and expeditions, there could be more end-game activities designed to specifically challenge and engage healers. Expanding on this aspect would be a welcome addition.

Community (9/10):
The New World community has been generally positive and supportive. Players recognize the importance of healers, and I've found camaraderie in my company and faction. The community's welcoming attitude has made my healing journey in Aeternum all the more enjoyable.

Optimization and Bugs (8/10):
The game had its share of issues, including server problems and bugs, which occasionally impacted healing gameplay. While many of these problems have been resolved, ongoing optimization and bug fixes are necessary for a smoother healing experience.",1648070314,1699043700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Expansion really made changes for the best.  Game is moving in the right direction. Great job by the team. Obviously room for improvement, but little by little they are doing things right.

-----------------------------------------

So much high hopes for this game. Developers ruined it. Didn't listen to playerbase.  Patch after patch new bugs are created, old ones still exist etc. I shouldn't get a run bug 3 minutes into a war, where I literally can't move my character.. after 3 months same thing. Really?

Very minimal endgame content. When you login, you don't have a goal. Maybe run a pvp map(only 1 map), maybe gather some materials and craft(repetitive), or run a dungeon. Only 2 dungeons, basically zero mechanics even with Mutations, it is easy as fuck. Stand in one spot, and use left mouse button, win.

None of the systems are flushed out, everything is time gated.

Run a dungeon? I hope you are ready to spend your hard earned gold to join a group, because these ""orbs"" are time gated and cost materials to create.

The list goes on and on.

NW encourages a love/hate relationship. If you're a mage or a light player, the game loves you, otherwise fuck you. 

+ Classless progression (""class"" abilities are tied to equipment: change gear, change abilities)
+ Beautiful world (lovely graphics, exceptional sound design)
+ Interesting world that isn't a cookie-cutter RPG (no elves, etc.)
+ Significant PVP elements
+ Players meaningfully affect the world
+ Fairly dedicated community (servers get curb-stomped by super-companies that shit all over an otherwise healthy server, then leave). If you think that's hyperbole, play the game for more than a month.

- Gear costs can be prohibitively expensive at endgame. All content is now endgame content
- You'll have to turn your settings down or the lag will be game-breaking (e.g., in war)
- Because is telling a new story, most people don't bother with the narrative
- PVP design encourages worst aspects of online play. System issues will be a recurring frustration (rubberbanding, death by desync, etc.)

I logged in choose a server world and i still to this date haven't successfully login to be able to even play and check out whats happening! SOO thumbs down now. Bummer wanted to be able to see all the hype.

You reviewed this game on October 16, 2021
I come from a long line of MMO's I'm VERY pleased here, one of my most favorite MMO's of all time would be ""SWG""! I couldn't be happier especially with the skill trees in crafting which I cannot believe the level of crafting in this game. Anyone that loves to be a Crafter you better haul booty into this game because its your ultimate dream game for that alone! SWG's gaming experience for years has haunted every MMO I have tried afterward which FORCED  me to compare against runner up MMO's. None of which have lived up to it! New World is providing all the similar gaming mechanics of not just SWG, and taken many good lessons from other MMO's along the way and integrated there own style of mechanics. it has it all how's it in game packs trinkets grouping elite epic triple gold crocodiles which would be like a group x4 just to kill a Kimogilah etc. 

Ill be updating this as more time passes!

Cansei de outros MMO RPGs mais precisamente ESO e tava em busca de outros games pra jogar, claro mantendo o mesmo gênero que é um dos meus preferidos. E acompanhei o lançamento desse game deis de um tempo atrás e percebi que talvez ele poderia não me agradar por algumas razões de gosto pessoal mesmo.. tipo estilo, época, cenário, essas coisas. 
Um tempo se passou e eu decidi comprar pra realmente poder gostar ou não. Fiz a compra e assim não mudou praticamente nada deis do lançamento do game. Eu até gostei de como as coisas funcionam lá, como por exemplo a dificuldade não é tão casual ela pode ser um pouco punitiva se você não tiver pratica nos comandos de ataque e defesa. Os territórios lá são marcados por Lvls então você precisa evoluir pra poder avançar.. até ai tudo pq a dificuldade foi uma das coisas que mais me agradou.
Falando um pouco da comunidade é claro que sempre irão existir pessoas ruins porém eu apenas encontrei pessoas que me ajudaram e até me deram um suporte financeiro no game ^^, itens lendários e tal. Então assim, eu não reclamo da comunidade tal qual o servidor q joguei foi Server BR.. Incrível. 
Eu realmente não gostei do game em outras perpectivas e poderia ter visto mais vídeos e gameplays de como o game se comporta e talvez eu não teria me decepcionado. Esse game tem o seu próprio estilo.. me refiro a: Eles não copiaram.. É bem original com artes da própria humanidade. O que não me agradou foi o fato de não ter montaria pq o mapa é grande só que ele só é grande pq não tem nenhum tipo de meio pra você se locomover de forma rápida. Mais ai você me diz porra Faw tem pontos de viagem rápida no game e o personagem anda meio que correndo. e então eu respondo: É ai que não me agrada pq talvez a ideia deles foi boa do tipo preservar mais horas de jogo pro jogador e fazer com que ele explore mais o cenário.. certo porém o lvl endgame não é tão alto assim e uma hora ficar andando e coletando recurso que inclusive é umas das coisas mais legais de se fazer nesse game pq o mapa é extenso e tem matéria em tudo quanto é lugar.
Mas voltando pra questão da montaria.. Porra, poderia ter iria ser mais divertido e evitaria eu ficar andando pelo mesmo caminho sempre que eu voltasse pro ponto de viagem rápida no caso da morte.
Outra coisa que não me chamou a atenção foi que o game não tem Raça cara.. E isso me chama a atenção pq tipo cada raça tem um tipo de habilidade pra somar com a sua classe e build e tal pra ser uma coisa mais completa. Mas não tem e isso faz com que perca a graça. Só tem humano mano, wtf...

Opinião atualizada !! XD

Adquiri o game novamente e vou recomendar pq é o melhor MMORPG.. claro ainda vou ficar sentindo falta de muita coisa que vi nos outros, contudo, esse é uma obra original e tem sus próprias caracteristicas. 
Estou bem animado pra ver como estão as coisas por lá e vou deixar como recomendando pois não serei tão punitivo a um game que evolui e mostrou originalidade deis do seu principio. Me parece que eles viram o que a comunidade anseia e colocaram a prova nessa nova expansão.

- The battle pass, for those juicy premium track boosters, is 25$
- You can only track 5 quests. Tracked quests appear bigger on your map. The game eventually floods you with quests and the map is riddled with points and things and pins and stuff that realistically make it really annoying to look for the smaller, untracked quests. Typical AAA UI Design. Btw most of the really distracting stuff on the map isn't relevant to you until high levels.

So they kicked me from the Discord Server for asking the bug to be fixed.

Game Rating: Snowflake moderators and admins out of ten.

Update:

I will keep updating this review with every bug I get.
So since the release of their DLC and they already got my money, this game has been crashing every 15 minutes.

In Season 2, which was before the DLC. They broke the game so bad that it was stuttering.
They finally fixed it but with only 20 Days before the Season ends.

Now, DLC and Season 3, Game crashes every 15 FUCKING minutes. What MMO is there that you can get 15 minute of enjoyment out of and say ""that's it I'm done.""

ABSOLUTELY ZERO.

There has been 2 to 3 Patches since and still no fix for why the game is crashing.

AGAIN DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

At this point, the only reason why I'm still here is Sunk-Cost fallacy. Plus there are no new half decent MMOs that doesn't throw in NFTs in their game.

STILL DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME

Play any of these if you will throw your money into an MMO: RS3, TES, FF XIV, WOW, Albion. JUST DON'T PLAY THIS GAME

Update:

This game is still trash don't play it.
Automated banning system but BOTS still running around.
You all should play RS3, TES, FF XIV, WOW, Albion, heck even Path of Exile.

There's no actual human managing everything. Just devs slaved into making a game by businessmen.

Update:.
So my GPU just bricked, I'm keeping my old review down below.
But just a heads up. I'm not changing my review anymore.
It literally destroyed my Graphics Card.

I still wouldn't take back how decent of a game this is. They just need to fucking fix all of this shit. But until then, this is a thumbs down. Especially with the GPU shortage right now. Fucking unbelievable.

Beautiful environments, great music/sound, engaging combat and progression, and fun lifestyle skills make for a genuinely enjoyable game that holds up to many single-player titles that I typically enjoy. 

I really like the idea of MMOs, but in the past year or so it's been hard to find one that really clicks with me. Even if I really like a game's world or community, such as what I've experienced in Guild Wars 2 or LotRO, the traditional tab-targeting combat and skill rotations of most MMOs has never become fun to me. In my life I've primarily played single-player, action-based RPGs with high levels of gameplay and immersion; if the moment-by-moment gameplay of an MMO wouldn't hold up as a single-player game, then it doesn't hold my attention long. (And let's face it, more and more MMOs are being geared toward solo play.)

New World has been a pleasant surprise. The beginner leveling and learning experience has been a joy; I do not feel rushed to get to the endgame content. In fact, this game regularly puts a smile on my face. The environments are diverse and drop-dead gorgeous. The music and sound design are fantastic, and I don't feel the need to put something on in the background like in other games. The combat is engaging; each weapon feels totally unique. Timing and dodges matter. The classless system and cheap respecs allow for deep experimentation and calibration. Gear isn't a linear, ""bigger number = better"" decision: I have to actually engage my brain and weigh the pros/cons of what synergizes with the weapon/stat combination I'm trying to specialize in. The gathering, refining, and crafting systems are fun and don't feel tacked-on as an afterthought. As I'm out in the wild questing or fighting mobs, organically finding and gathering resources feels like a special treat. The life skills are fun and add enrichment to the game. (I love rhythm games, and New World's music skill is as fun as it is functional.) I haven't done much multiplayer PvE or PvP yet, but the game is populated and feels lively, which is the reason I'm drawn to MMOs in lieu of single-player games.

There are aspects of New World that leave something to be desired. The main story questline leads me to engaging content, but the story itself hasn't gripped me. I unfortunately find myself skipping through well voice-acted dialogue because the text itself doesn't interest me. The game is jam-packed with lore and journal entries lying around, but most of these only seem worth cursory glances. I'd say my attention span is the issue, but I don't have the same problem in a game like Skyrim or Zelda.

New World lacks an East Asia server. This wasn't a problem for me until I recently moved to Japan, and I had to make a new character on the Pacific server. My ping is mid-tier at best and too high to play at worst. Most times, though, the game is playable from here. This may change if I tried to play competitive PvP. 

All in all, this game has become my go-to MMO and has made me forget about the others I've tried. This game just clicks with me.",1698839015,1698839015,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The good :

-The game has changed, its now less laggy, is more friendly to casual players, has less latency problems and is much more fun than it was on release. 

-The early main story questline update was amazing, leveling from 1-45 is much better now and it took me about 5 days ( 55 ish hours) to reach level 65, and it felt like time passed way too quickly. 

-The new dlc (Rise of the angry earth) is a great addition to the game, while it doesnt completely change the world like WOW does, it adds a new area, mounts, the flail weapon, new lvl cap and new trade skills cap. And i think its actually better than what WOW does, instead of changing the whole world they will slowly expand the original world making it bigger and better. Now, for casual players who play about 2-3 hours per day i would definitely give the dlc a try when its on sale, for players like me who play a lof of hours each day its absolutely worth it for the full price.

-The community is an absolute joy to be around, i can count on my fingers how many toxic people i've seen in the game, the players are nice and helpful, there are no stupid questions in my server.

-Insanely good graphics compared to other mmo's

-A ton of content for both pve and pvp players

-An insanely immersive world, you can be whoever you want, however you want. You want to be a crafting junkie and earn by crafting new gear for people? You absolutely can!

-While on the topic of crafting, great crafting! It makes sense and its easy to get into it

-Traveling has never been better after the introduction of mounts but the scenery of new world is amazing, especially brimstone sands where the structures are a sight to see!

-It's not p2w, what else is there to say the only thing you could bring to being p2w is the premium season pass but it doesnt provide anything that you cannot normally get exept for skins

 The bad : 

-Sometimes the movement and combat feels scuffed, your walking animation is faster than how fast you actually walk and its a weird experience

-If you pull too much enemies you can get stuck in a staggered state from all their attacks, this could be easly fixed with a cooldown on pve staggers

-The server cap needs to be made bigger, more players in a server would mean more competition if you want to farm for example but it would also make the world feel much more alive than it already is

-After 2 years there is still no swimming, the lore excuse is pretty poor (some curse of sorts that makes the players unable to swim) they need to add swimming into the game because it just ruins immersion immensly

-Transmog need to be changed, i think its absolutely bullshit for people to not be able to change how they look without transmog tokens

Overall new world has improved, its come a long way and from what i see the devs are trying their hardest to keep the game on its feet, and i respect it, the game is more complete, more immersive and much more fun to play than it was. Its slowly taking the right steps into becoming an amazing mmo.

With that said i will give new world a deserving 8.9/10 if you like mmo's you absolutely need to get this game on sale and i hope to see more good things from the developers. Cheers.",1635707630,1698821729,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

oof where to start.. well as a new player coming back to this game after being in early beta I will say they have made minor improvements at best. This game shows a complete lack of respect for players time and honestly kind of pay to win if you ask me. 

Pro:
-the game looks good
-the mounts were a good addition even though I absolutely hate the mount system in this game. its clunky and essentially forces you to stay on the road, but none the less it was a good addition.
-depending on what you are doing the combat feels good.

Cons:
Oh boy where to start....

-Whomever came up with the artifact acquiring system should straight up be fired. they clearly don't understand the balance between cool ways to obtain and the time to obtain. For example you to get the Pvp spear, you need to kill a PVE mob on a timer that only spawns during the night on a 1.5 hour cycle with the occasional second spawn. that means as a average player who only plays like 2-4 hours a night there is only a possibility for you to kill this boss 1 to 2 a day day if you are lucky... how in any game world does that make sense. You are punished for either not working from home to afk spawn camp or having a family and kids.. not to mention its a PVP WEAPON you get from PVE. Then you have the PVE greatsword that come from a PVP TRACK...... . the fastest Ive been able to do 1 rank in the pvp track is about 50 minutes.. you cannot from my understand unlock the ability to get the artifact items until level 20.. that means I have to do at minimum 20 hours just have the chance to start getting the artifact. I have heard of people doing 50+ more pvp tracks before even seeing the artifact great sword... Not sure who at AGS thought making it acceptable to put artifacts items behind a wall of at minimum of 20 hour to 70-100 hours but they should be fired. as they clearly 1) have no idea what they are doing and 2) clearly can give two craps about their customer and clearly do not respect their time. 

-the crafting system while I assume it gets easier to understand as you go is very very overwhelming for a new player especially at max level. I am not saying you cannot understand it eventually, but at first glance it is really overkill.

- questing has gotten better due to the mounts, but they really need to come up withe some better questing pattern then just literally running back and fourth for hours at time. 

-PVP - they should make outposts available at level 10 and make it a viable way to level. This would get people more acquainted with pvp before hitting level 65 and just not having a clue about any of it.

Overall I am going to give it a couple more years before I try again. it is clear to me the developers mindset is more so how many pointless tasks can we put into this game to keep players in it instead of really giving good content.",1698782425,1698782425,False,12,0,0.588094472885131836,7,True,False,False

- Good environment and areas
- A lot of copy paste mobs but with new regions there has been a lot of different variations of mobs added
- Very good game if you are NOT playing hardcore. If you are a hardcore gamer and play MMOs in hardcore with long hours this game is not for you. 
- Classless which means you don't have to make another character to play another class/weapon
- Fun PvE content. Dungeons, chest runs etc.
- Decent PvP, i don't like this games PvP much because the lack of movement in this game and healers just rule 3v3 arenas and no decent amount of action is taken against it. Basically if you don't have healer and opposite side has you will %95 lose the arena match
- Open world pvp is lacking
- A lot of optimization issues specially large cities and large scale PvP
- Too much time gating on gearing. If you are hardcore player you will most likely quit due to this. Almost every type of thing gear progression or crafting some items etc. is time gated. Even if you have all the money/resources game tells you that you have to wait a day or few days to craft single item. Devs choose this instead of making the actual content harder which playing longer doesn't bring much to the table. If you are P2Wing and buying coins you can buy other players cooldowns and buy crafted items directly from other players for a fee which game basically forces you to do so. 
- Too much bugs each patch. If you are going to play don't suprise to keep crashing, running into weird bugs. Simply this game is not being tested much before patches releases and this is something that is not new and always happening and they keep players wait too long to fix the bugs. If major patch releases wait at least a month before start playing. 
- Very bad world system for an MMO, the worst. Sometimes they lock servers for transfers so you can't really play with friends and have to wait maybe a month till bunch of players quit and you lose the motivation to play by then. They should simply merge every world and make channel system which we can swap with a small cooldown but its not the case. If you transfer world too much you will be banned from market and trading becareful when you do that. 
- Limited amount of dungeons there is about 9 dungeons that mutates (hard end game content) each week 2 mutations happen and you have to pay coins to swap gems each week or when you wanna play the other mutated dungeon. Because of this you can't use runeglasses which is very improved version of gems that helps a lot but can only be used in PvP not PvE basically costs too much money.
- Lack of creating raw coins. Basically the only way to make coins is trading. Make an item, craft, gather and sell. There is no raw coin gain that is stable. Dungeons give like maybe 300 400ish each run and its same with mutated ones and normal ones which doesnt make sense while you spend 400 coins each run for potions/elixirs so that money is gone. I think they should increase the rate of raw coins in PvP rewards and mutated dungeons which we all have steady income even if all items are not sellable etc. Its weird tbh
- Lack of testing before patches causing bugs/exploits/abuse in PvP/PvE etc. They simply don't test patches enough and no patch ever released is ready for release its just how it is and you need to accept that
- Lack of customer support, if you are in official discord community manager redirects you to amazon support which they either take too long to response or just redirect you to in game feedback or back to discord very poor support.
- Too much desync in PvP and even in PvE. Sometimes hits doesnt register you teleport and teleport back it just happens no fix yet.

Overall this game is good for casual players as you get hardcore you will enjoy this game less.",1637457442,1698693274,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New World is far better than people are saying. Most the things people bring up mostly haven't played the game in the last 5-8 months or just spamming reviews. I go through the reviews every now and again, as I see the hours these people put in. Some have 13 hours other have over 5k hours, the thing I find funny is they seem very vague. They talk about problems that are new and think they're the same because they're similar to older exploits. There's different ways to break a game and people try to find them. Most the bugs and problems people talk about I haven't noticed. But they talk about the old methods or ""things that haven't been fixed"" okay, so what hasn't been fixed? Again the reviews are very vague, then others saying they got banned for no reason, or their mother, friend or a friend of a friend that was introduced by a 7th cousin twice removed for the same reason. Even found an account with 9 hours that copied a comment with like 1.5k hours.  

My point being, these people with less than 50 hours are either spammed comments or expected everything to be handed to them like a lot of MMO do these days. While those who negatively comment with 300+ hours are hypocrites. How are you going to not recommend the game when you've played 300+ hours? I mean you must of had some fun if you have that many hours, so why would you lie? The game is $40, most games that cost $70 you'd be lucky to get half that time. Lets not forget it was also just on sale for like $20 or so this past weekend. Not sure people know how to be honest with themselves anymore and just simply hate to fit in. False promises, what false promises? Seems like New World kept up with everything they said while giving even more, plus AGS gave us Brimstone for free. You know what FF14 tried to do with A Realm Reborn? Charge you $30 for the game they spent 2 years fixing and didn't talk about it at all for that 2 years. And it still released with just as many bugs and problems taking another 18 months (1.5 years) to fix and be playable. Final Fantasy XIV isn't new, the game is roughly 13 years old. And people are expecting New World to compete against that in 2 years? Final Fantasy XIV didn't start getting good until it was about 8 years old. So stop saying this game is bad when Final Fantasy XIV nearly made Square Enix go bankrupted 

 There are problems with this game, some are very noticeable and some aren't. I've found a few and reported and seen some change or a step. I'm not expecting AGS to do much, they are trying to make money after all while keeping the game running. Can't really do that if you spend time fixing the game and give no new content at all. But, in compassion to some games, New World has came a long way. It's so easy to list vague problems such as bugs and ""false"" bans, but playing this game since launch, it's a completely different game. Keeping up in PTS among other changes I can tell you the game is still very fair to play. No pay to win or anything, so people crying about the whole season pass, get over it, it's a cosmetic progression. Kid you not, if you get to level 60 Player exp is worthless, with the season pass player exp from quests is worth doing. People crying about bots, the bots, at least on my server, are few I've ran into maybe 2 while farming for my own mats. So anyone who's saying the game is filled with bots are either lying or searching for them. I have company mates who only farm for the company and they rarely run into bots if at all. So Bots are not a problem anymore. Dupe glitches get dealt with nearly instantly once reported, they even shut down the shop until it's taken care of. And some of the glitches are dealt with. This is by no means a perfect game, again there are problems with the game I wish AGS will fix. But most of it isn't game breaking. You can casually play or you can hardcore play. Some of the problems the game has is the design, I believe they need to remove all the wards and the game will be much better. But aside from personal wants the game is decent. It's fun to play, very fun community and different combat from other MMOs. New World isn't outstanding but it's not a copy and paste, you'll find something you like in the game. Some of my company enjoys the randomness of crafting, spending most their time getting mats just to role BIS gear. You're free to do as you wish, you don't even have to force yourself to burn out. You can just get everything up on your own time, no one expects you to have it all, so you just do you. For an MMO, there's nothing better than that. I recommend this game because unlike most devs. they haven't just tossed it to the fire, Anthem, after promising to make changes. They have and are making many changes. Expecting this game to be as good as others without trial and error is foolish. AGS has learned from their mistakes, even delaying Season 1 because they don't want to release it in a poor state like New World when it first launch. Developing isn't as simple as adding this and changing that, if it was every game would be a masterpiece. I'm not expecting New World to be the greatest MMO, New World is it's own game. And like every game you have to try it to see if you like it. There's plenty to do, ignore the whole ""getting to level 60 is annoying"" comments, the game has changed a lot and the first 40 levels are kind of a joke to be honest. They've made progressing professions easier, and going to do so once Season 1 is launched. So I recommend to try the game, if it's on sale then buy it if you're not sure. You waste what $20? The game is fun, find a company, make friends, dance like a fool to music, use the proximity chat, ask about things you're not sure about. Don't force yourself to live by people's standards of what's fun. Because I doubt the people who can clear the 'hardest dungeon in 15 minutes' most like has BIS gear for that expiation and try to speed run it. M10 on average is like 25-30 minutes so they're most likely lying. Try it for yourself, don't play it for 30 minutes and complain about walking for one minute. 

For my conclusion, the game has changed a lot. Expecting a honest review is hard. New World is different, it's doing a concept most MMO games only think about doing. Again the game isn't perfect, there is a wall you will hit, but it's not as bad as people say and it will take you a little while to hit that wall. Just look at the 5k+ hours people played and are crying about. 5k hours, 208 days at least of people playing this game, and they finally said their sick of AGS' shit? And most are complaining about nothing or jealous others are successful off this game. The game is fine, it's fun if you allow it to be. My advice, don't force yourself to play just play. If you feel like farming mats farm mats, if you want to try to get your Mutations up then do so. You're free to do as you please, nothing more nothing less. Just be you and have fun. On that note, take care, stay safe and keep hydrated.

(Edit) This comment was before the announcement of the expansion, after the announcement my views of this game has changed. I didn't buy the expansion seeing I would rather spend my money on a full game on sale than an expansion that will give me another 30-40 hours at most. The fact there is content that was in the game, now locked behind the expansion is already a red flag. Sooner than I expected, the game's numbers have dropped, and I expect by the middle of November to be below what it was before the expansion. Sadly this game is now dead, due to the greed of the developers. For 2 years they released subpar events, nothing really fun and even their ""raid"" content was just a single boss. This is what happens when you have 3/4's of a game and add the last 1/4 in a paid expansion. I had hope for this game, now I must say it's dead. Buy what you want, just know there's better out there.",1679984995,1698648528,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some stuff in the game make no sense whatsoever, for example there's an encumbrance potion to let you carry more, but strength doesn't increase your capacity. Why not just tie it to strength and if you encumbered you can use a strength potion?  The crafting system is a bit overly complex, but the storage system of having mats spread all over what, 15 different storage sheds is just flat out annoying.  When you craft only the mats in the shed in that particular town are automatically available.  Does this serve any purpose other than to annoy players?

It's kinda fun to run around and hack and slash, and some of the group activities are good fun.  If you're more into PvE than PvP like me it's still a fun game.

Average styled MMO however, the ""any class and weapon"" system is a game changer. The combat is the BEST, no auto lock or spam clicking like other MMOs, with that being said, pvp isnt for casuals.
The game is very similar overall to Destiny if Destiny wasn't an fps MMO, Artifacts being exotics, upragding underleveld gear, clans, pvp, open world bosses, raids, crafting. The audio in the game is the best in any game ive heard

What can be worked on is:
- PVP queing for those under lvl 60-65. anything below those levels youll be waiting at least an hour
- Cleaning up the map and highlights over NPCs for side quests, etc,  looks like a cluster F like most MMOs filled with older folks 
- Cleaning up the complicated (at first sight) crafting, the biggest thing I hear from my friends & others that avoid MMOs is always ""that looks way too confusing to enjoy"" which is why I stayed away from MMOs myself until ESO. Making things look more friendly and understandable for new players would be a game changer while still keeping all the content in, so to those who say ""go play COD or something if it looks to confusing"" stfu, thats why your favorite MMO is dead.
- Make required side quests like the heartstone or mount more noticeable or easier to find. At least once a day I see someone in chat ""How do I get my mount now that i'm lvl 25""
- Enough of the typical ""go pick 5 berries for me then come back"" quests, ESPECIALLY at the start of the game, this is another reason new players get bored. You don't have fun really, until a few hours into the game.
- Let new players chat rather than waiting 2 days, the game isn't free, bots who spam should get banned faster if thats the cause for this

Other fun things after being max lvl is participating in company's, company wars, pvp, highest lvl expeditions, houses, trading post for rarer items, maxing out skills like mining or fishing

Overall, this MMO is tons better than others. It's not ""easy"" talking about combat, like most MMOs are. Beautiful design, voice actors, gameplay overall 9/10.
 
Do what No Mans Sky did, devs. Keep working on it consistently with few bugs and few transactions. Don't let this great game fall off in 4 years like the thousands of other MMOs out there. Even bringing this to console with cross play could boost it even more. Worked for ESO, but no cross play also kills it.

Good game with a lot of potential for improvement. Definitely not bad for an MMORPG in its its first week(as of review time). PVE or PVE content are plenty here. Given that it's just started and already feels solid, I will recommend this game now, even more if the game is optimized further later on. (92 hours @ 1st review time)

Second Review:

Spoke too soon. Should not have reviewed a game in its seemingly extended paid beta release. Bugs are just too much at the moment to ignore. NW will be a good game once they fix all the bugs. At this time, I would not recommend it as I hate to encourage game studios from profiting from buggy games. (350+ hours playtime)

Third Review:

Long overdue third review. NW is now a good game for me. Bugs are less frequent maybe because they improved the Lumberyard/Azoth engine or less people playing, IDK. Bottomline is, there are now less bugs.

Several quality of life changes and regular new content, through seasons release, also made the gameplay much more playable in the long term.",1633500494,1698629439,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is still improving and getting better. They did away with the Expertise System and replaced it with just having loot drop at higher and higher Gear Score. It's a much more natural progression now. The new Expansion is fun and comes with the much anticipated addition of mounts which is an excellent QoL feature. The Dungeons/Expeditions are fun. 

Combat is still only okay and I still wish it were better. 

*Update* 

The game is better than it was at launch. The dungeons are fun and the Expertise Gear Score system is better than the old Watermark system. They've made some positive quality of life changes. 

Combat is still only okay. I wish it were better. 



*Original Review Below*

Starts off fun enough. Falls off pretty hard. 

I really wanted to like this one. 

The questing just isn't good. It's the same handful of quests in different regions over and over again. 

The combat is clunky and a lot of stuff plainly doesn't work, either all the time or some of the time. 

The large of amount of duplication bugs among other bugs and glitches that will ruin your experience. 

The most recent issue is AGS stealth nerfing the end game, creating a gigantic gap in between the players that reached max crafting/GS watermark and those who haven't started the grind yet. They conveniently left all of the negative changes out of the patch notes also. They're clearly making terrible decisions and attempting to sneak them into the game without the player base knowing.

I've been on and off with this game since launch and just immediately got bored leaving auto-run on until I get to the next settlement. Now, I still toggle auto-run but I'm much more engaged with the game than before.

CON: I didn't like was the marketing decisions made by AGS on pay-walling mounts. They should have at least left the accessibility of mounts to all other players for free. Pay-walling mounts sort of makes the game pay-2-win at this point on both PVE & PVP gameplay in terms of player evasion and artifact farming. Allow me to explain.

   -PVE: To expand more on artifact farming without having access to a mount, lets say I wanted the artifact [Scorpion's Sting] that's dropped by Scorpio Supernal located in Brimstone Sands. I get invited to a raid group and I tele to the Cradle's Rest spirit shrine. I load in. Bear in mind that I'm also mountless so I run on the road. When I get there, Scorpio Supernal is already dead.

   -PVP (Influence Race): 
To put it simply...you can get on your mount to evade attacks from oncoming enemy players. For players that don't have mounts, when it's time to fall back in an influence race, your entire team but you get on their mounts, you are pretty much dead as the enemy team overwhelm you with their accessibility to mounts.

I just started playing new world this past week and i'm already in love. I've spent the past few moths been searching for a great MMO to play as they are my favorite genre. For a bit of context, I have played Runescape mainly over the years as well as BDO and ESO, and a bit of WOW. This will be important because it is where I am coming from and will be using for comparisons later down the line.

-=-=-=-=- RANT -=-=-=-=-
I will throw this out there real quick If you are looking through other reviews, I think this next point is absolutely critical and can be deemed as a bit of a rant but I'm going to get this off my chest. This is a game for more casual - mid level players who don't plan on sinking their life savings, potential real world relationships with others, and literal years in-game. You will see that the overwhelming majority of negative reviews are, funnily enough, left by people with THOUSANDS of hours in game. There are people with well over 6000 hours in the game saying that it is garbage and to not play. WHAT!? That is over 250 DAYS IN-GAME, and you say it sucks? you paid 30 dollars for that much game-play and you would not recommend it? Illogical and honestly sad. I am really sorry that these people feel so cheated somehow, but I feel like these reviews are absolutely not critical, and are purely emotion-based. Rant over.

-=-=-=-=- PROS -=-=-=-=-
-Visuals/sound (9/10)
The first thing that will strike you in this game are the visuals, they are absolutely breathtaking and the atmosphere is serene and beautiful. The lighting is colorful and the detail in the textures are amazing and FAR greater than any other MMO i have played to date. The world is charming and the sound design is incredible, and that is not something I ever even think about in games but the sound of mining and hearing reverb from the nearby mountains is actually an amazing level of detail I've never seen before. The music in the game is peaceful when walking through the woods, and epic when in fights.

-Grind/leveling (8/10)
Unlike almost every other MMO that I have played/watched other play, the grind is immense which personally I have never particularly cared about. I have gotten skills in Runescape to level 99 which on average depending on the skill, could take on average 200-400 hours to get fully maxed which in retrospective is aggredious. Not only is that an insane amount of time to not see your loved ones, or do anything productive in your life, more importantly IT IS NOT FUN. you sit there, clicking, filling your inventory with crap you don't want, getting rid of it, and doing that again at nausium for months. In New world however, I find leveling in all types fun and engaging. You have to walk around and collect resources as you find them, and in most scenarios you can level so many things at once, for example - If you go mining and you have a path of ore veins you want to hit, you will more than likely walk past trees you can cut, mobs you can farm, plants to harvest, and all of this will increase levels in other areas while waiting for those veins of ore to re-spawn. Fishing is sort of a fun mini-game to me and is actually somewhat challenging and isn't all brain-dead.

-Questing/story (6.5-10)
The questing in this game is not the most fleshed out, and if you are very story driven and like to indulge yourself with the lore of the world when playing games, you won't have much to grab onto with new world. It is leagues better than it was when the game first launched as far as questing goes, but still falls short. The story line is very confusing for me and not all that interesting. On the other hand, I don't care for the story in any other MMO that I have ever played and I'd say the majority of those who play MMO's fall under that same umbrella. Its just unfortunate that you don'y have much of an option to dive into this aspect of the game for those who would like to.

-Movement/combat (9/10)
The movement in this game is very fluid and feels fantastic, and so does the combat. All of the weapon choices are fun and unique and you aren't locked into any sort of ""class"" system with your character which allows you to try out different play-st. This game is amazing for those who love to craft the best builds by min/maxing. The enemies are varied with a wide range of different attack styles that you need to learn especially if you plan on doing ""expeditions"" which is New World's version or raids or dungeons. Speaking of which, those are super fun to go through! Unlike almost any other MMO I have played, the game DOES NOT start at endgame. I've always felt that style of game forces people to rush through the game as soon as possible and to not enjoy the time it takes to get there. With New World, you can take your time to get to end game WHILE still getting to try out lower level versions of these expeditions at just level 25 which I loved since end game PVE is usually my favorite in an MMO. What would make this category a 10/10 for me would be to change the running animation, it moves quicker than the character does and just seems off. I would also say that I wish there were more expeditions, I believe currently there are 10, which considering the age of the game, there wouldn't be 20-30 like other MMO's that have been around for decades, but I would like to see more come into the game soon.

-Money/value/pay-to-win? (8/10)
Almost every MMO nowadays is completely ridden with pay-to-play/ pay-to-win mechanics, so were does New World fall on this list? I would say its actually very surprisingly fair. You the whole game which is hundreds of hours of play easily, for 40$ and if you get it on sale you pay even less than that. The DLC is 30$ and I will get into the good and bad with this soon. There are NO pay-to-win mechanics. You can absolutely play the game as-is since the only in game purchases besides the DLC is a season pass which is 90% cosmetics, and 10% boxes with items/xp boosts. There is also a free season pass that I have been enjoying personally because again, it adds in cosmetics and xp boosts and you don't have to pay anything for it so you really can't complain (yet some choose to).

-Bugs/glitches (7.5/10)
If you heard anything about New World previously, its that it was a complete buggy mess at launch and I can reassure you that two years later, the team seems to have cleaned up a large majority of those bugs. I have actually only encountered a few visual glitches in my time with New World, and one that stopped me from progressing a quest I was in until I went to the game lobby/rejoined the game and it was fixed. As for visual glitches, I personally would consider them very minor offences, considering they won't end your life in game and only last a moment or two. New World has really come a long way since launch in so many ways but there are some bugs you will encounter so just keep that in mind.

-=-=-=- Cons -=-=-=-

The newest expansion is a lot of fun and I had no issue paying the 30$ shortly after picking up the game because at that rate I knew I was invested. , it is almost a re-skin of a small chunk of the map that previously was available to everyone, and that is honestly really stupid to me that they would take something from everyone and put it behind a paywall. This is also the only way to get mounts in-game which again, is kind of a staple throughout the MMO genre and is a bad choice to keep behind a payment. I feel like there are so many better ways to keep what they had previously, and add an extension of the map and tie it in with the story very easily since the theme is ""nature taking over"". It felt like a huge oversight to me. 

I would give this game an overall (8/10) and would highly recommend to anyone looking for an awesome new MMO.",1698602127,1698602127,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Some bugs and glitches early on while not game breaking were funny and eventually got fixed, one example of this was when a friend of mine got banned for milking the cow in the starter city/town right after launch it was funny we all laughed about it and moved on with our lives after Amazon patched the issue and unbanned the people that were wrongfully banned. But there are even more game breaking bugs and glitches  that Amazon struggled to fix after launch that persisted for months because it seemed that every new patch released made them worse. There were even some updates like the one to the crafting system Amazon decide to release after everyone had already maxed their harvesting/ crafting skills that essentially made all of our collective efforts worthless, the bot problem that seems to persist no matter how many time Amazon has claimed to have fixed it. Then there was the toxicity issue where some players went out of their way to bully and harass other players solely because they thought it was funny and the server my friends and I played on saw some of the worst of it because we had big streamers on our server ,Asmongold and TimTheTatman, to name a few. Now  I never had any issues with the two streamers mentioned nor did anyone I know (both helped a few friends of mine with an expedition and were fairly nice) but other streamers leaked the server name to their fans and encouraged them to join the server leading to queues 12+ hours long just to play on the server. The biggest issue we faced due to this was the fact we had some players join the server solely to troll their favorite streamer by spamming things like racial slurs or kekw in chat because they thought it was funny and before you ask me why we stayed, I'll go a head and say it was because some of us had already gotten fairly well set up on the server and didn't want to have to start all over on another server. Now we get to the big issue and the reason why I personally stopped playing the game, Character/ progress lost due to Amazon merging servers and inadvertently deleting peoples' character data, and before you say that , ""Amazon fixed that and was able to recover those peoples' character data"", Well let me tell you this Amazon in most cases was only able to recover some peoples characters and lost data and the rest of us well all we got was swept under the rug and ignored because it was easier for Amazon to claim they had fixed the issue and recovered all the lost character data. When in actuality they still had hundreds if not thousands of players worldwide who had lost hundreds of hours of progress due to Amazon's incompetence. As it stands I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone, because in my opinion the game was rushed and incomplete upon initial release, had Amazon taken another year to work most of the issues seen early on out of the game before release they would have seen far more success with the game and the game would be more fun to play.",1632862228,1698590425,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR- 8.0/10 nice.

First off, (I'm Mainly a PvE guy). 

New World has a ton of annoying ass QoL and Gameplay issues... BUT, at the end of the day the game is well worth every dollar you spend on it and here's why. I'm only kinda buzzed i think.

Between the Standard Game price and the Expansion, it's been a great ride lately and I'm not mad about the price tag that followed. This is easily the game that should've been released back in 2021 and Everyone still playing will agree.

Normal full length AAA games are 60-70$ and we all hate that. But if the game is good, it doesn't matter at all. New World is the type of game that'll suck you in and you'll forget all about your Steam Transaction and why you only eat sodium ramen water now. But still, you only spending like 40-60$ for the game and like 20$ a month on ramen, it's kinda legit, buy a house IRL in 2025 or whatever idk whatever.

You'll easily get at least 500 hours out of it if you do all Main Story Quests, side quests, crafting, PvE and PvP.(at least! Some will get 3000 hours because (""Ayee yo, anyone in this world tryna buy a full set of perfectly crafted PvP gear I just crafted with BiS to the moon!!!""). Or something equally as neck beard nerdy as this in game chat.

If you like PvP you'll love it, the fight system is insanely addictive and the abilities/builds can make for fun combat and playability. I have like 0.4k/d in wars and OPR, but it's still so fun and exciting! (But it could use more PvP maps and modes. I bet they are coming sooner than later in updates.)

Finally... At the end of the day, if you like an MMO with a community that seems to always be down to help newer players. Constant large group(20-40) loot/chest runs, expeditions with tier difficulties, PvP with actual aim to damage rewards and terrotiry control gameplay, and a young MMO only getting better with time... Then this is an easy 40$ recommend. 

**IF YOU""RE ON NA EAST JOIN VALHALLA SERVER AND ADD ME AND I""LL HELP IF I CAN! (suhgirl - username)!**

Ah, New World, the game that promised to be the Amazon Prime of MMORPGs. I was there at the release, and let me tell you, it was quite the rollercoaster. After playing it for a while, I'm about as excited for their expansion as I am for yet another cardboard box on my doorstep. Buckle up, folks, because it's time for a hilarious, trash-talk-filled review.

Amazon's Promises:

Amazon, you had one job, and it wasn't delivering packages. It was delivering a solid, complete game. But no, they decided to release New World, which was about as complete as a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing. It was like buying a sandwich and getting two slices of bread with a slice of lettuce.

Developers' Shenanigans:

The developers played a fantastic game of ""We Promise Fixes Tomorrow."" The economy was a mess, the bugs were as numerous as Amazon fulfillment centers, and the PvP was wonkier than a one-legged race. But hey, we got ""Coming Soon"" patch notes! Who doesn't love empty promises?

Economic Blunder:

Speaking of the economy, it was like a wild stock market crash, but instead of losing money, you lost hours of your life. Crafting materials were rarer than a unicorn, and selling items in the market was like trying to auction off beachfront property in the Sahara Desert. Bravo, Amazon, for turning in-game trading into a bureaucratic nightmare.

PvP Master, Right Here:

Now, don't get me wrong. I was a PvP master in New World. I specialized in the ""Run away as fast as I can"" strategy. It was like playing hide-and-seek with 60 other kids on a sugar rush, and I was the champ. So, when they announce the expansion, I can't wait to be obliterated by folks who actually understand the combat system.

The Future:

But here's the kicker – despite all the trash talk, I can't help but feel a bit excited about the expansion. It's like waiting for a new season of your favorite reality TV show, hoping they'll fix the mess from the last one. I'm coming back to New World because I believe in second chances, just like Amazon believes in delivering your package two days late but with a smile.

In conclusion, New World had its fair share of hiccups, but it's like that friend who's always late but somehow manages to make you laugh anyway. I'm ready for the expansion, Amazon, so let's see if you can deliver this time, and I don't mean packages.",1698525496,1698525496,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

The bots are still here but they log out when you're in the area, they are tracking everyone in game. Many farming spots are still heavly used and farming feels stressful like you can't stop or someone might squeeze in and tax your route. Gathering is basically ptw now, each set of gathering cloths you aquire you then need to buy a equipment slot and keybind it(sure you can say it's pay for convince). 

What really bothers me the most is they give you all the tools to prevent toxic people(whatever that means) but if you choose to turn that off and you get offended by something and report them Amazon will side with you. Like the streamer that got permanent banned for saying ""deez-nuts"" in global chat and he linked nuts he gathered. Still bothers me I'm playing a game that takes away my freedom of speech faster then my government does. 

Let's be honest nothing is much better then wow classic, they just don't make games that are fun anymore, they make games faster and faster and they loose all immersion. I went from 60-65 level in hours of doing quests in the starting zone. Everything feels like I'm on 4x speed. Soon as you're 65 you start buying 700 gear off the market, doing face roll large raids gives you so much free gear, you can level up weapon skill as well without even casting or swinging your weapon, lol. They just don't have a clue how to make a triple a game. Crucible was a better game and I'm sure new world will follow suit.. I mean they will scrap it.

New World is just a rip off of BDO but with out any complexity. I'd still be playing BDO if I didn't get suckered in to PTW. 

This has to be the hardest game to convince your friends to come back too and for good reason.

That all being said, It's in a pretty good state and I'm having fun or is there just nothing else to play.. idk.

Let's not change how I felt 2 years ago, the game really passed me off.. 
(Trolls abuse the mass reporting. 

Destiny gearing up system. This one is the main deal breaker for me. Nothing is rewarding, it's just minor random upgrades.

Dungeons are the same thing, you only do them for crafting mats.

Crafting is a long painful grind, it's the best RNG chance at end game gear.

New World is a long painful grind that doesn't feel rewarding.

PvP is all about the perks on your equipment not about the skill of smashing 3 abilities on 2 different weapons. 

Everything above is from 400hours played, nothing changed. 

I played for another 1k hours and only thing I have to add is the game heavy pay to win by gold sellers. It's easy to find tons of bots, but if you have trouble either you don't farm enough or you can't distingue the difference, just wait for a war or invasion then walk around the boarder. 

Some guilds get over 1 million a week in taxes so the economy is really messed up. 

I really like Amazon's engine though, Mourningdale looks amazing. I do look forward to seeing other games use this engine.)",1634788112,1698486134,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I generally first enjoyed the game for a few weeks - it's relaxing with awesome graphics, audio is superb - it is quite frustrating how Amazon Game Studios succeeds in breaking various aspects of this game with just about every other update. Crafting stations stop working, Season Pass breaks, quests don't update or need to be reset AGAIN, etc.
The update files are HUGE and take forever to install. Yet, a few times a week it seems to be a necessity now to repeatedly install patches. Extremely poor QA. May be auspicious NOT to buy the upcoming DLC upon release but instead let it mature for a few months. 

It's equally bewildering how the server issues simply persist. Really sad how the home of AWS can't host New World reliably. Servers constantly crash; players stay away, New World goes dead, servers merge and can subsequently not accommodate a sudden rise in players when seasonal events increase the player base. This happens time after time, AGS has apparently no clue how to adjust for this.

10/03/2023 UPDATE: As predicted, paid $29.99 for the DLC and can't play. Servers overloaded and hour long queues. A total rip-off.

10/09/2023 UPDATE: Still can't play unless sitting in queue for 2 hrs. Finally managed to get 5 mins of play time - disconnected from server when fast traveling. Season pass is broken, does not let you claim rewards. What a total disaster this game turned into.

+ It's an interesting world, unique story and the mix of gunpowder, swashbuckling and sorcery is great.

o Efficient graphics engine but very underwhelming effects.

- only one map to queue for in pvp and if you don't buy the expansion you're just fodder in open-world, as it provides a 5 level bonus, mount and access to legendary items.

It could have been a spectacular game but it's just .. not lol. Given the amount of time since release there should be more content.

Forget all the bugs which after waiting since launch are introduced regularly and are seemingly never solved.

Pay for a mount and Flail lol, all empty garbage, they make you think that you need what they are offering, how about uninstall. I bought this game for a family member, and most of the hours I put on are around release, everyone stopped playing because the game devs don't respect your time, the forums are full of people who don't understand what that is, avoid this game unless you want to play a demo without DLC.

Pay to continue? ROFL, I had First Light at around 100 and they got rid of it just like that, came back to see what's what with DLC and all. Why would someone want to invest anymore precious time on this?

I decided I wanted to try a MMO because I could pay once for access to the game and then enjoy my own adventure with other players in a world being constantly updated with new things, for way more than 50 hours.

Now with about 100 hours into new world I am happy to keep playing and I am still nowhere near the endgame. The combat system is versatile (you can use sword, wooden sword, greatsword, staffs, flail, gauntlets, melee, longbow, axes, and probably more that im forgetting, each with their own abilities) and graphically this game is very strong compared to something like Elder Scrolls Online. There is something really charming about New World. The writing and voicing of NPCs is surprisingly campy and friendly. The game definitely feels alive right now with players and activity.

That doesn't take away from the game at all. 
- You no longer need to do mutated dungeons as most gear drops at 625 now
- 625 gear is now upscaled in structured PvP to 675, perfectly viable 
- Artifacts, while strong are still in the balancing phase and will be adjusted.
- You do NOT need artifacts to be good or win at PvP, you can be competitive with 625 (675) gear.
- Flail is the first weapon we got that's paid, we got two others and arguably its worse than the Great sword and blunderbuss (despite the use in wars)
- Brimstone was more or less the same size as Elysian and it was free.
- 𝐌𝐎𝐒𝐓 if not 𝐀𝐋𝐋 MMO expansions raise the cap in some fashion. 
- ESO (one of my most played MMOs) always introduce some game altering sets, skills, artifacts with their expansion. They also lock classes behind expansions, which would be like the flail.
- GW2 (probably my favorite MMO at the moment) has elite specializations, locked behind expansions, and those are objectively better than the base game classes.
You could argue you get more bang for your buck and that's a valid criticism. 

The game still has glaring issues, and it still needs a lot of work, despite that, this game is a night and day difference from the launch experience. Its slowly shaping up to be one of the best MMOs on the market. I spent the 30$ on the DLC and have not been disappointed (even though I was reluctant to at first)

Personally the expansion has been a 8/10 for me. I wish the narrative side was a bit stronger, cinematics, lively world etc.. New expedition is great, new mobs, are nice, mount feels really good (Absolutely 𝐂𝐑𝐈𝐌𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 that it isn't in the base game, my biggest complaint)

The said 'bugged issues' consist of me having lost progress on my account that I invested many hours (between 50-60) in to obtaining. I of course wish for this to be restored however do not believe it is going to happen at this point. 

Personally don't enjoy the fact that expeditions (Dungeons) are capped when you run the mutated variants, as I had a single build in mind I wanted to obtain and play with, so waited till the mutation that dropped the item I wanted to make the build work came around. By the time I expended all of my runs, the item did not drop... If it wasn't capped, I would happily keep running mutations till it dropped. I have to wait a month at a chance of obtaining the item again now... Nah. 

Entirely lacking the intensives to farm the rest of the build in the meantime as I have no guarantee that it will even drop next month, so what is the point. Consequently, this has entirely disheartened me from continuing to play the game, as hopes of playing it in the style I desire is no longer seeming achievable in a realistic time frame. - I refuse to slog it out another month un-enjoying the game at a glimmer of a hope that I may eventually enjoy a little more. 

A game completely inconsiderate of an individuals time investment to reward ratio - Wish I could refund the DLC.

Wouldn't recommend for long term/hardcore play. Would recommend for short term/casual play. New world needs time and more effort.

(I've had to shorten this from 20k to 8k so it is missing ALOT)

I really loved this game, addicted even, but now I'm writing this review after more than several times of seeing ""You've played for X Hours, Would you recommend"" So here it goes.

[Positives]

-Combat-

Absolutely incredible, I love the action combat, I've played all weapons but main a bow / spear (Don't hate me) The feel of it is fantastic, the hit marker noise, the clink/clunk when it lands, satisfying. I main healers or tanks usually on other games, but always loved the archer types, but never stick them out in current MMO's, New world hit that mark for me in a big way. I also tank Mutations, I love the weapon swapping, and general feel of handling your skills.

-Gathering-

Truly immersive, I could blink and hours go by farming, the open world is gorgeous. if you genuinely enjoy gathering in games you'll love this, I even pop PvP on sometimes for abit more risk/fun, its not for everyone and it does have it's downsides.

-The World-

A truly beautiful game, lots to discover, it can be abit samey to some, but it never really felt that way to me. There is a couple hidden things in the world that really make it feel alive and full of history and sentiment. If you haven't yet, check out the shrine in mourningdale dedicated to a dev's wife. Its beautiful and horrible at the same time. It really feels like they care about what they've made.

[Negatives]

-Customer Service-

Awful customer service based on a recent ticket I created with alot of hope in being resolved. I  went to upgrade a named item in the gypsum forge to 700 with 3 perks, I spent 10k on Weapon matrix, 15k on Chromatic Seals + the faction tokens, plus 250 dark matter (11 M1 Gold dungeons excluding the odd scrapped legendary), I wanted to pop on a craft mod for hearty and OFC the forge is bugged, it goes to craft, does nothing, there is a delay, then nothing happens, I was scared it would consume my mats and spit me out nothing, but it didn't luckily, but instead I've had to take the mats to a different forge and somehow, be it my brain or the game, Its instantly gone through the craft and spat out a hot piece of garbage without my desired perk.

I immediately contacted amazon, praying they could do something (In other MMO's GM's would have) They proceeded to take my details, the time of craft, time it was now, exact dates, screenshots/videos, character names, server, it felt like I was being heard and like a resolution was coming, they certainly were looking into it with haste and detail, I get asked to wait 2-3 days, I get a very short email basically saying sorry but no because ""it doesn't fall under the Courtesy Service Policy"" I've asked what actually falls under, the bottom line is ""You are not allowed to know what is in the Courtesy Service Policy"". I even get ""I'm a gamer too, I've asked if they could just change my perk to the desired one, no. Could I be compensated for the mats? no. I have to wait 3 more days, farm 250 more matter, spend 20-25k more. It might not be alot of gold to others but I'm constantly spending gold so I don't have alot to chuck around that I can just let go and be happy with. I really think there is other crafters that have faced this issue, I don't think it should just be ignored, I think it should be done case by case, if you've crafted an item and left it 1-2 weeks, then maybe that is too bad right? But if your forge is bugged, and I've contacted you immediately, maybe you can just be nice? 

-Character Services-

There is a massive lack of character services at present, and it has been 2 years now. No in-game or outer game customisation changes, i.e hair, face, gender. Just have to re-level and go again.

Transmog is too expensive/gated.

No item restoration

Unclear Courtesy Service Policy - What does it cover? Certainly no miscrafted items.

-Toxicity-

Whilst farming ore or trees, people will message you with threats of their company reporting you for botting if you don't move, claiming its their node and they were there first, insulting you in English and other languages. Simple google translate works, they will also get company members or friends to come help them camp you out.

PvE players will straight up refuse you if you don't run meta, not even a chance, Hense why I tank my own mutations now, given up on playing bow in dungeons (Despite getting my ennead 10 leaderboard with a bow/spear) its not worth the hassle at all. Play spear, greatsword, rapier or you aren't coming - but only 1 rapier is allowed too (understandable due to bleeds).

-""Link gear""-

I hated this at first, link gear, link gems, link trophy's, link consumes, and even if you had the correct trophy's, gems, gear score, even playing meta weapons, they would see a 2 perker piece and decline, it really is minimal. People act like the content is ridiculously hard, I found it quite easy. BUT on the flip side, I've had awful groups that leave you thinking, really? or how on earth? so I do get it, to a degree. This is probably made worse due to the dungeon cap each week. Most wont reach it, but I easily find myself capping the dungeons out every week and it doesn't feel good to lose runs to stupidity or toxicity.

-Dungeon/Mutation rotation/caps-

Having 2 dungeons a week to choose from is mind boggling. I don't understand the limitations to this game, why do I get to choose from 2 dungeons and not them all? The main bother being, if you missed your favourite week, you wont see it again for a month or so. Bad design in my opinion, but AGS have said they are looking at 3 dungeon rotations, so well see. Its very limiting with the old 25 cap now 35 cap too. More players might hit those caps if they didn't have to spam the easiest dungeon that week 35 times for dark matter/gear/gold, whatever the reasons. The PvE dungeon scene in new world feels very gated, by players and by dev's.

-PvP-

 If you run ranged be prepared to be insulted constantly (directly and indirectly) because melee have to chase you and press W, but on the flip side if you run melee you'll get ranged insulting you if you manage to catch them because you'll likely 2-3 shot them. Standard rage I guess, just feels like there is more here. Specially on newer players.

-User interface/Options-

Due to the crafting annoyance earlier written, I don't see why there isn't more alerts in-game when crafting, ""NO CRAFT MOD DETECTED"" or ""ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CRAFT THIS?"". Some more prompts to engage you and make sure these mistakes don't happen, because based on experience now, if you fuck up or bug out, tough shit go again.

When spamming mutations you understandably get flooded with items. I skim over them sometimes to read the stats and make my mind up, whether to lock or scrap. But sometimes I just want to scrap it all fast. When you do this is floods your screen with mats/messages being attained and it gets in the way of the UI/scrapping Yes/no UI, its very very messy, and is a clear oversight and needs a design team / UI team to look into.

-Banking-

The banking system has improved alot since launch but it still fails to hit the mark for me, The weight limits, the unique item restriction, its too much. Personally I'd love to be able to just farm some days, and then dump it all in storage for another day, be it to sell later or craft/level crafting another time, but you can't, 

-Re spec Costs-

I swap specs/attributes out several times a day. If I tank a mutation, 200g. Opr 200g, arena 200g, Open world, 200g, Mistake on my stats, 200g, Magnify/Gear set change, 200g. I must be spending 2k gold a day on respecs at least. I don't believe this should be in the game anymore, it doesn't have a place. Once again punishing players for swapping around isn't good.

Ultimately after my 1,600 hours, I wouldn't recommend it today.",1698332488,1698332488,False,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I am highly in favour of season pass. And paywall content. Like it is done. This is a life action game. That means.. it pays rent and feeds its employees.

The changes that happened with expansion? The mounts behind supposed pay wall? Well.. i not only bought it but paid for currency. Because i trust the road map. 

And yes. The different concerns people bring forth. They try to deliver. They can't satisfy everyone. This is a very mixed community. The perception it was supposed to be this ego shooter pvp wasnt realistic in the end. In the end.. more fantasy friends joined this then anticipated. And they wanted to play in this world. 

Next to the fact.. pvpler were always the most ungrateful bunch considering the changes happening?
Meta changes? Pvplers like ""why?"" ""cry emoji""
Why not server caps at 10000 people? Why not crossplay right now? .... Why are there hard mutations.. why is there PVE content.. pvplers are like "" this isnt the game i wanted"" but it never was.
They never understood they joined an RPG.

Up to this date New World is working on integrating content so it fits their world. To enable people to enjoy traveling the wilds. To enjoy experimenting with weapons and the crafting system.

And pvplers ... were always like ""this is too hard make it easier""

They made changes. They made reasonable changes. But still to this day.. there are people crying over something not dropping today this hour.. because they farmed it for 8 hours and dont own a single luck trophy. Or they did.. and this is the only thing that for RNG reasons just didnt drop as fast.

People are only satisfied when they dont have to play.

<.< On the other hand. As an enjoyer of this world, its concept its possibilities and how they keep wanting to make this the best game for us so that we feel comfortable to pay for their livelyhood.. as well as enjoy the game with us.. I only have love to give to the devs.

This is not like every other game. And people seems to forget what it means to have their own engine. it has its own potential. 

>.> For whats on the market.. For the fact.. they reduced the base game price with new expansion instead of making the same mistake as WOW or ESO.. 

I tap my head.

The amount of bugs? Fuck... any game i enjoy has bugs. I dont know why those are the only games i enjoy though. Maybe i enjoy the potential more then a flawless gameplay. BEcause otherwise i wouldnt have a lot to complain about.

To be precise. They improofed server stability. They improofed pvp Stability. And still people think negatively about q's 

<.< Because this game struggles with player count they have to work with adding and merging servers. And everyone just keeps clinging to servers that dont provide the capacity.

This community was always quite unwilling to change servers. And honestly.. i expected more of people that enjoy a game. 
Although i understand that they cant worry for weeks. But those that worry for weeks to join that one server? I cant understand. 

Numbers back to normal. But there are so many possibilities now.. I am happy. I keep to the roadmap. And i keep believing.",1666530864,1698331047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The battlepass this season is way less FOMO, I could actually complete it and planning to buy the premium. The game is now less hostile to casuals. Thanks for that.

You're in a huge disadvantage against other players that paid for the """"expansion"""", they'll have thing like: 
- mounts, which straight up turns open world PVP inviable if you don't have one;
- higher level cap that translates to higher attributes (more damage, health, etc.);
- higher gear score items with better stats;
- and an exclusive weapon (new weapons used to be avaible to all players).

1. Storage can be freely moved through the user interface, no more running around moving things between different storage locker locations.
2. They removed the 'Expertise System' for gearing! Max level gearing is much easier now!
3. Mounts make the experience better in that you can skip areas easier and move faster, game feels more fun and exciting with mounts running around.
4. There are a lot more quick travel points across the world and the currency to use them is overflowing, even more so with in game perks, the walking simulator is long gone, never have to travel far or for long.
5. I was able to get really good endgame gear through completing the Seasons track, very cool!
6. The game still has bugs, optimization is poor in some areas and have to reset some areas to get npc spawns, some bosses bug and you have to reload or boss is cheesed due to bug.
7. For those that complain about the $30 to play the game in its better state I'd say go play another mmo without a sub monthly and then comeback and complain

Come back and give it a go, I will be playing it awhile in its current form, the graphics are good, my hours played show I've given it a go, I've changed my mind about it. The servers are populated.

In its current state 2 years later I would say it's a lot better compared to my thumbs down review below two years ago, game still has bugs but the devs respond to things, what game doesn't have 'features' you don't like? ;-)

Old  Review 2 years ago 2021:
Primarily a solo player game with group elements that are poorly done and poorly optimized. The world is beautiful and the solo combat is pretty fun, but it's the most buggy game I've ever played at launch. Buggy to the point it has ruined the community and taken the fun out of the game due to the bug exploitation that has heavily ruined the faction balance and supported gold farmers. The game optimization is poor as I have to run my GPU at 90% power and at 90% GPU clock MHz otherwise the game overcook's my GPU. At 90% I'm hitting the 100% mark during spikes from the game. If I run at 100% it will spike at 110% and the game starts to lag out...The game is just very much in a beta state still. Most likely the change up from the original colonial pvp concept to the attempted underworld theme park of what it is now prevented it from being more polished upon release.  I love the world design and the solo combat. I do wish the story-line was a bit more compelling and that the NPC voice-over dialogue worked properly.",1638599616,1698287857,True,0,0,0.502127647399902344,0,True,False,False

Hiding all core mechanics, such as mounts, high level gathering and a new weapon behind a paywall within already pay to play game is just dumb. Game used to be such an amazing piece of gaming, even with repetitive engame. I was really hoping that with time i will keep comming back to this game, but not this time. AGS wake up - you're killing the game, the community and last bits of passion left for the project. I decided to change the ""Recommended"" into ""Not Recommended"" - not anymore.

NEW REVIEW:
First things first - there are no more queues and thank people and the dev team for that.
Theres so many different ways you can play the game. If you want to become a master craftsman, you can level and earn your gold by doing that. If you seek battle and blood, kill your foes and get some extra exp this way. Game is vast and theres a lot of things to do. 
Althou its clear the devs are doing their best, they kinda act like an Indie Company with downtimes at noon taking 5-7 hours to fix minor bugs, but well at least they are getting fixed.
Playing New World is a wonderfull experience and i would recomment it to everyone.

OLD REVIEW:
Gameplay is nice, but getting to it isnt...
Queues are frustating AF, posting review at 23h game time, from which about 6h is from actual gameplay, rest is sitting in queue.
2k players per server is just not enough for such hyped game. If they increased it by 1-2k queues would be either non existent or would pass waaaay faster than right now. Bet 500 players are just on AFK bots to not get kicked untill they are back from work.

Game has a lot of potential and is fun to play, but not untill they fix queue times. Get your shit together amazon, please.",1633000419,1698276840,False,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

This is a sandbox styled MMO
Far more progress can be made with a group
and even more with a strong guild

Some of my favorite parts of the game are:

exploring to build your spell book out (killing mobs will allow you to learn the spells they use), 
Lots of gathering
An intricate gear imbueing system
A few tiers of gear
Elective PvP events - City raids and Seiges

The price tag might be high, but remember that there's no pay2win at this point. The only things you can buy in the cashshop is cosmetics. Maybe the DLC is p2w but that's for you to debate.

This is what I said over 1 Year ago during the terrible release of the game.

Now though, the game is actually in a good state. The devs did work hard to deliver changes and improve the game. And although alot of people are hating on the new expansion people need to understand that this is not a subscription based game, adding all those other updates for free is great but in terms of production revenue it doesn't do much. The DLC may not be as good as other updates, but it still adds alot of content and I think being considering all the work they put in the game after the fuck ups it justifies it. The price tag itself is questionable, perhaps 15£ or something would be reasonable.

In terms of issues still with the game, I hope eventually they add a swimming function or something like that. And in general, bugs occur that will probably be refined.

However, the game does have its flaws. One major issue is its server structure, with a limit of 3,000 players per server. This falls short when compared to older competing MMOs that have much better solutions. Additionally, the combat and movement mechanics, such as jumping around, can feel clunky at times.

Like: The game is good, the mount system and artifacts have brought a lot to the game, but beyond all that the reason I'm staying for a longer term this time is because they made open world PVP a reality. People in open world pvp drop items (not their own items, it's like a killing a mob). Depending on how long they've been flagged, the item they drop will be better. This is what I'm excited for, and the reason I'm playing hard to get max geared to open world pvp. 

Dislike: Imagine a game about adventurers (greedy pirates) on a island in the ocean, but there is no water content, and the people can't even swim... It's a bit immersion killing, to be walking underwater as if you won't float. I wanna uninstall every time i fall in water. Also, the combat by using abilities has gotten OK with artifacts that can reduce the CDs, but damn these devs are STUBBORN about using basic attacks. Nearly everyone in the entire community wants *enough* skills so they don't have to basic attack, but the devs are... learning slowly on this one. 

Side note: Gliding Mounts, when? I wanna jump off the top of a mountain gliding on a Wyvern or a Griffon. the graphic in New World are one of the best in the MMO genre, this would add SO MUCH love for the game, just being able to do this.

   Improvements needed are to stabilize the servers and provide more servers. Wanted to do the Halloween event unfortunately you need to be Lvl 60. They need to make it so all players can enjoy events at lower levels. Don't like the PVP factions. seems more about just having more side quests to complete.

   My favorites are being able to ride a horse at level 25 and it has a decent quest to make it more fun and enjoyable. All the combo of weapons  you can use and respeccing is free till lvl 20. Love the fact it's open world with no limits whatsoever except maybe the zone being higher level than you.

A friend of mine on a particular server had to wait 400+ spots to get back into the game after the game randomly crashed.
The game is very badly optimized and will crash randomly. I have an RTX 4070 and my settings are set to High instead of Ultra and have the Framerate cap to 30 and the game STILL crashes randomly.
Not to mention everyone who has a budget GPU can barely play the game, even after lowering all settings to Low.

Another thing I would like to see is Classes. Actual classes. As the system is, you just dump points into whatever is needed for the ""build"" and it's ok but it could be MUCH better by implementing classes.

Furthermore, we could definitely use ""builds"" even further by having sets in our inventory. As is, the game allows you to have 2 custom builds/sets of armor but if you go from Ranger to Fighter now you have to respec your character to prioritize Str over Dex. 
It's true that it is very cheap to respec but why not have those stats IMPLEMENTED already as you had them WITH the set/build? Which is why having ""classes"" can help with that without having to rebuild the game from scratch. I find it crazy that in 2023 this hasn't been thought of in many MMO like games when Neverwinter MMO actually got it right and it's a game from 2009!
Lastly, why is there NO controller support for the game? Using the Steam layout (which I am using), I had to make a working controller for the game and it runs smooth UNLESS you're doing PvP! The problem is that sometimes when you open the map, fast travel, or swap weapons too fast certain functions on the controller stop working. 
It's 2023! These things should be implemented in ANY game nowadays. I find it incredible how so many ""gaming companies"" don't know this which is why Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3 is such a HUGE success story! Stop worrying about how you can get more money from players and worry about how to make the game better and you'll see how the players will more than willing pay EXTRA!
Larian said that they will NOT do any DLC's and I wholeheartedly would pay $100 just for 5 minutes of content from them!",1698103893,1698103893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

Edit after Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion (10/23/2023)

The community is mixed between Veterans and New Players on the newer opened servers. The New expansion brings a new meta but in the end the game has not changed, lots of fixed bugs.

Still needs a few improvements but overall a great experience.
