Truly terrifying whenever you're walking through RPD and Mr. X walks around the corner of the hallway you're about to enter. Amazing enemies throughout the entire game and a good ending. A perfect game for those new to survival horror.

Game story can be can played with either Leon or Claire, the two main characters of the story, but you don't get a full different story for each character, what you get is more like a variation of single story with some different elements. 

The somewhat clunky or intentionally restricted gameplay may put some players off. You can pretty much only walk, run, shoot and perform scripted actions, meanwhile most enemies are really mobile and some are really fast and deadly. Aiming is another thing game relies heavily on, this makes some boss battles really annoying.

I played the game blind, without any guides, and the design choice of using scarcity as game mechanic became obvious a bit too late, this mechanic was something that didn't really work that well, late game became very tedious. Inventory management and navigation/planning with a map are the core parts of the game, and these are actually pretty enjoyable. 

The game offers you the option to complete tasks in any order at first, but as it progresses, it becomes increasingly linear. The middle portion of the game — the sewers, was not my favorite since I felt like I didn't know where to go or what to do on my first run. 

Graphics look good, a lot of attention to detail was put on the characters, the environments, and even for the damage and environment effects. Even though this is a few years old game, it has beautiful modern looking shaders and lighting. Cinematic cutscenes get really old after the first run (skippable), but there is still a lot to see and find, if you are a completionist type of player.",1708796372,1708796372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They essentially rely on Birkin and Mr. X to make the game tense, but that doesn't work in the remake because none of the tension is built up and all of the scariness just kinda falters into frustration and annoyance. Top that with characters that aren't very interesting or memorable. Gameplay that's a slog to get through at times due to some weird delay in movement (why would anyone care about realism in a game with zombies?). This remake feels kinda half baked and sort of like they just wanted to push it out as fast as they could.

I have no nostalgia for it, and I went into this experience completely blind. That being said, this is one of the best games I have ever played. 

[i]Resident Evil 2[/i] is stunning, and extremely fun. When I randomly decided to pick this game up I never would've expected that I would end up beating it two or three times, or that it would become one of my favorite games. However, it is, and that's because everything here is so smooth and well done. The graphics are beautiful, the combat is exciting and extremely tactical, and the puzzles are just enough to provide a short break from the action. Different items are perfectly placed around the environments to keep you moving back and fourth while having to avoid the infected and Mr. X. 

For others who are going into the game blind, [i]Resident Evil 2[/i] is a survival horror game. So, although you'll see zombies walking around the police station, it's important that you pick and choose which you eliminate and which you tactically slide by. Additionally, this isn't an on-rails linear experience; there are multiple puzzles for you to solve around the police station, and you'll need to wander around clearing rooms, finding new key items, and figuring out how they can help you clean up any messes that are halting your progress. 

On the first playthough the scares were thrilling, but never anything crazy. In fact, [i]Resident Evil 2[/i]'s fear factor comes more from the constant tension of Mr. X won't leave you alone and chasing you around than from jump scares. [i]Resident Evil 2[/i] is so fantastic that it doesn't need to be scary to be good. Additionally, there is so much replayability here; you can play through the game as Leon or Claire first; the two have slightly different stories and the difference is certain enough to warrant beating the game as each of them once. Furthermore, once you beat the game for the first time you unlock a second scenario that you can play as either Claire or Leon, so there are really four different playthroughs you can have here as well as different difficulties you can play on. 

Four playthroughs seems like it could become repetitive, however, I will say that my second playthrough only took me four hours, that's nearly four hours faster than my first, and I'm sure it only gets easier the more you play. 

Outside of the main story there is still more content in the form of multiple different short-stories you can play through. These are a fun little addition, and you can challenge yourself to complete them in fast times. Collectible wise, throughout the main story there are little bobble-heads hidden for you to find and destroy- you can't go back to find them, but secondary playthroughs keep your collectible progress from previous runs. Completing harder difficulties and challenges rewards you with new weapons that break the game, allowing you to take your victory lap on this nightmare sittuation.

Honestly this is one of the best games I've ever played. I've never been a horror fan, and I had never played a [i]Resident Evil[/i] game before, but I had an absolute blast with the game. I'd highly recommend it to anyone; it's well worth the price for the amount of content packed in, and it's thrilling from start to finish with amazing incentive to replay countless times. I hope Capcom continues to remake [i]Resident Evil[/i] games in this style, or learns from the successes of this remake and implements them into the newest [i]Resident Evil[/i] titles.

Review:
If Resident Evil 2 Remake were a movie, it would be the blockbuster hit of the summer – the kind of film you watch with one eye closed and the other peeking through your fingers. Capcom's reimagining of this survival horror classic is like a love letter to fans of the original, with all the thrills, chills, and zombie kills you could ask for.

Let's start with the dynamic duo at the heart of the game: Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield. These two are like the Batman and Robin of zombie-infested Raccoon City, armed with nothing but their wits and a trusty arsenal of weapons. Watching them navigate the city's twisted streets is like watching a masterclass in zombie survival – if that masterclass also involved a lot of screaming and running for your life.

But the real star of the show is the game's setting: the iconic Raccoon City Police Department. From its dimly lit corridors to its blood-spattered walls, every inch of this haunted house of horrors is dripping with atmosphere. It's like stepping into a nightmare version of your childhood police station – assuming your childhood police station was overrun by the undead and filled with puzzles straight out of a cryptographer's worst nightmare.

And let's not forget about the zombies themselves. These guys are like the Energizer bunnies of the undead world, with an endless supply of energy and a serious case of the munchies. Whether you're blowing their heads off with a shotgun or dodging their outstretched arms like a seasoned matador, there's never a dull moment when you're up against these brain-hungry baddies.

Of course, no Resident Evil game would be complete without its fair share of puzzles, and RE2 Remake doesn't disappoint. From deciphering cryptic codes to hunting down elusive keys, there's always something to keep your brain scratching while your trigger finger gets a workout.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a spine-tingling thrill ride from start to finish. With its heart-stopping action, hair-raising scares, and enough zombie guts to fill a swimming pool, it's a must-play for any survival horror fan. Just don't forget to pack your courage – you're gonna need it.

Killed an enemy with the knife and took the knife out, which according to the game means that the enemy is definitely dead, somehow miraculously woke up to add some dramatic effects after you first meet the MISTER.

Bon, je n'ai pas encore fait la campagne de Claire et, bien que je compte la faire à l'avenir, je pense avoir suffisamment à dire juste avec celle de Leon. Je n'ai également jamais joué à l'original donc je ne pourrais pas faire de comparatif entre les deux versions pour ce qui est du gameplay.

[h3]Points positifs :[/h3]
- Comme pour le remake de Resident Evil 4, les graphismes sont magnifiques, même en qualité lowest.
- Le jeu est bien optimisé malgré quelques lags à certains endroits.
- J'aime beaucoup les designs des personnages même si, pour une raison qui m'échappe, je préfère quand même le visage de Leon dans sa version original.
- Le jeu est ultra généreux avec les munitions de pistolet. En tous cas j'ai réussi à finir la campagne de Leon avec +200 balles restantes dans mon inventaire alors que je me suis amusée à éclater la cervelle de tous les zombies.
- De tous les remakes des Resident Evil jusqu'à présent, c'est probablement le seul qui a choisi de se concentrer sur l'horreur et la survie plutôt que sur l'action (avec les boss pour seules exceptions) et ça fait du bien de voir qu'il est resté fidèle à sa vibe originale.
- Le jeu est relativement assez long pour son prix. La campagne de Leon m'a pris environs 14h à compléter en avançant aussi rapidement qu'une tortue-limace et j'imagine que ça sera à peu près la même chose pour Claire, donc j'estime la durée de vie à une trentaine d'heures au total si vous êtes du genre à prendre votre temps comme je l'ai fait.
- Possibilité de choisir entre l'audio du remake ou l'audio du jeu original.
- Le jeu propose des défis, mais je les trouve ultra chauds à faire.
- Les traductions et le voice acting français sont réussis, même si j'ai quand même eu l'impression que ça ruinait un peu le jeu d'acteur à certains moments.
- On peut jouer à la manette, mais il faudra passer par le gestionnaire de contrôleur Steam pour les adeptes de manette PS4.

[h3]Points négatifs :[/h3]
- J'ai eu quelques chutes de FPS à certains endroits (je suis passée de 60 à 40-45 sans raison), mais ça reste une perte minime et ça ne m'a pas empêchée de finir le jeu pour autant.
- C'est peut-être juste un problème qui me concerne mais les plantes bleues ne m'ont servi à rien du tout. Je n'ai jamais été empoisonnée et, pourtant, je suis une quiche pour esquiver les attaques ennemies.
- Autant le jeu est généreux avec les munitions de pistolet, autant j'ai l'impression que les munition de fusil à pompe et les munitions de magnum étaient quasiment inexistantes, à tel point qu'on se sert pratiquement jamais de ces armes en-dehors des combats de boss. Du coup, ça rend aussi les améliorations du fusil à pompe complètement inutiles, puisqu'on ne peut même pas en profiter pleinement.
- Pareil pour les grenades (et je ne parle pas des grenades assourdissantes), à part pour tuer le groupe de zombies qui sort des cellules, je n'ai eu besoin de m'en servir à aucun autre moment.
- Il y a un système de sauvegarde automatique, mais je le trouve encore plus inutile que les sauvegardes manuelles.
- J'ai eu l'impression que la fin était un peu rushée, mais c'est un avis subjectif.

Le jeu est génial et je me suis quand même bien éclatée à finir la campagne de Leon, c'est juste dommage de voir que certaines mécaniques finissent par devenir si anecdotiques qu'on pourrait limite s'en passer (voir les points négatifs). J'ai également l'impression qu'il y a un gros déséquilibre au niveau des munitions qu'on ramasse et vous pouvez facilement finir le jeu avec plus de 200 balles de pistolet dans votre inventaire alors que le fusil à pompe et le magnum sont... beaucoup trop délaissés à mon goût. Ça reste, malgré tout, un très bon jeu avec une bonne durée de vie et un prix plutôt abordable pour sa qualité.

[h1]English:[/h1]
So, I haven't done Claire's campaign yet and although I plan to do it in the future, I think I have enough to say just with Leon's. I also never played the original game so I can't make a comparison between the two versions in terms of gameplay.

[h3]Positive points:[/h3]
- Just like with the Resident Evil 4 remake, the graphics are magnificent, even in lowest quality.
- The game is well optimized despite some lags in certain places.
- I really like the designs of the characters, even though I still prefer Leon's face in his original version, for some reason.
- The game is very generous with pistol ammo. I managed to finish Leon's campaign with +200 ammo remaining in my inventory, even though I had fun killing every single zombie in the game.
- Out of all the Resident Evil remakes so far, this is probably the only one that has chosen to focus on horror and survival rather than action (bosses being the only exceptions) and it feels good to see it sticked its original vibe.
- The game is relatively long enough for its price. Leon's campaign took me around 14 hours to complete while moving as quickly as a slug-turtle and I imagine that it will be roughly the same for Claire, so I estimate the lifespan at around thirty hours in total if you're the type to take your time like I did.
- Possibility to choose between audio from the remake or audio from the original game.
- The game offers challenges, but I find them really hard to complete.
- You can play with a controller, but you will have to go through the Steam controller manager for if you're using a PS4 controller.

[h3]Negative points:[/h3]
- I had my FPS dropping in certain places (I went from 60 to 40-45 for no reason), but it's a minimal loss and it didn't stop me from finishing the game anyways.
- Maybe it's an issue that only concerns me but the blue plants have been of no use to me. I haven't poisoned once and I'm not even the best at dodging enemy attacks.
- As much as the game is generous with pistol ammo, I have the impression that shotgun ammo and magnum ammo were almost non-existent, to the point that I didn't even use these weapons outside of boss fights. As a result, this also makes the upgrades for the shotgun completely useless, since you don't even have time to take full advantage of them.
- Same goes for grenades (and I'm not talking about flash grenades), apart from killing the group of zombies that come out of the cells, I didn't need to use them at any other time.
- There is an automatic save system, but I find it even more useless than manual saves.
- I felt like the ending was a bit rushed, but that's a subjective opinion.

The game is great and I had a blast finishing Leon's campaign, it's just a shame that to see that some mechanics end up becoming so anecdotal that we could almost do without them (see the negative points for more info). I also have the impression that there is a big imbalance with ammo and you can easily end the game with more than 200 pistol bullets in your inventory while the shotgun and the magnum are... a bit too neglected for my taste. Despite its flaws, it remains a very good game with a good lifespan and a rather affordable price for its quality.",1707651252,1708102372,True,5,0,0.595238089561462402,0,True,False,False

I can't do horror. I love this game.

RE2 is a tense, meticulously crafted experience that should probably be experienced by every gamer interested in games. Perhaps its best to understand the game as a ""thriller puzzle-lite"". Exploration is rewarding and engaging, but not tedious. The combat is punchy but not too difficult. The story is intriguing but not complicated. 

RE2 probably has the best level design for a game of its size, and it is a small game. Most of the game takes place in a police station plus the surrounding area, and the game makes use of every last drop of its setting. The station becomes a character to learn and at the same time its inhabitants aren't going to let you figure it out that easily. 

I appreciate the pacing of the game the most. It's tight and concise, a quality that seems to be lost in the numerous (great) games that have come out in recent years. RE2 is short, but it doesn't waste a single second of your time. 

No cheap jumpscares, just great thrills. Even if you're scared of being scared, the game isn't long enough for it to be a slog. If you find it too much within two hours of playtime you know what you can do.

Plus Points :
1. The story isn't far from the original RE2 on PSX, but it is improved and more impressive.
2. The story still focuses on RPD, Sewer, Vacant Factory, and Laboratory (renamed NEST in the remake).
3. The horror element is retained, the atmosphere in RPD, and the realistic zombies, lickers can evoke nostalgia.
4. The BGM sound can be changed to the original PSX version, enhancing the horror experience, and nostalgia.

Minus Points :
1. The storyline for supporting characters (Ada Wong and Sharry Birkin) is longer, but different from the PSX version.
2. There are many achievements that require certain actions to be done before acquiring them. For example, in Ada Wong's story, there is an achievement that requires not using a handgun, or in Sharry Birkin's part, the achievement is to escape from the room within 5 minutes after being kidnapped. These achievements are not easy to anticipate without reading the guide first.

You have to put like 3 head shots in a zombie on normal difficulty to kill them, and even then they might not die, they might get back up, which i thought was dumb, especially when they've made ammo scarce. You really can't waste all your ammo into putting zombies down in this game, you gotta conserve it and save it for when you really need it...it's pretty lame. like this is NOT a zombie-slaying game lol sorry to burst your bubble if you thought it was. if you run out of ammo, you don't always have a knife to rely on cuz like I said, everything is made scarce, they will break. You can't do melee attacks either and even if you used your knife the game is made in a way that you can't just keep slashing zombies with the knife, they will eventually grab you and take a bite out of you (UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY GOOD, I GUESS).

I did like how the game keeps you on your toes as when The Tyrant (Mr. X) comes in, you have to keep playing the game running from him, you can't kill him you have to continue playing the game, solving puzzles all that all the while being chased by him. that was pretty cool and it had me pretty nervous haha

What I didn't like: I hate how the game doesn't give you enough inventory room to hold items, I mean several times I found myself having a full inventory and not being able to hold any more items, so I had to discard some items I was already holding to make room for new items. That's pretty lame man. cmon Capcom. You have to play through the game and unlock more inventory pouches, but that happens as you progress through the game. It's an annoying feature. Should've just given us the extra inventory space from the start instead of making you unlock it. Also, this game is supposed to be played the way the devs intended it to be played leaving little room for any freedom to the player. Like the dev decides for us when to drop used items making room for new items.

They really nailed the ""survival"" aspect of the game. I mean this is a survival game if you couldn't tell. Everything is made scarce. It's really lame how if you don't have a knife in your inventory, you can't defend against zombies in close quarters. Just f**ng push them away dawg. But naw, you gotta wait and watch the zombie take a bite of meat off my boy Leon.

Unlocking infinite ammo weapons (like rocket launcher and minigun) by beating the game on S ranks was the icing on the cake. Actually makes you want to play the game on a 2nd playthrough for those up to the challenge so you can unlock those things and pwn zombies.

Can the game be improved? if they just added a stealth element that would be cool. guns just draw attention and herds of zombies. So to conserve ammo, let us 1 hit stealth kill zombies with a knife.

I still give a thumbs up because I enjoyed the story.",1667116441,1707744096,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

My biggest beef in the original REs was that you could never move while shooting.  You'd have to stand still while multiple zombies fly up your rear-end.  Not to mention you had to shoot them in the head about seventeen times before they'd die.  I'm glad the remake actually enables its players to more effectively succeed.

Gameplay is what you would expect.  Lots of zombie killing, things to find, puzzles to solve, etc.  You have 
a pretty useful map that helps you know where you may have missed something.  The dialogue and voice acting is pretty cheap, which is to be expected from Japanese developers, but they usually make up for it in gameplay.  I don't think the plot and storyline are much different from the original, but I can't be 100% sure on that.

So, you can play the story as one of two characters where some parts are different and others remain the same.  Then, there's a whole separate run that can be played with varying differences.  So, there's quite a bit of replay value.

In addition to the story, there are some other game modes that can be played, some of which need to be unlocked first by completing ""records"", or ""challenges"" as I would call them.  Completing these ""records"" can also unlock different items for use in the story.

The 4th Survivor is a survival run-through challenge with limited resources and a crapload of enemies, which is very challenging.  That's not the end of it.  Apparently, beating this unlocks ""tofu"" characters.  I'm not kidding, you're literally a piece of tofu throughout the whole challenge.  It's incredibly silly.  And there are five different tofu types, each with varying weapons, equipment and silly Japanese one-liners that I didn't understand.  Oh yeah, and the tofu runs have heavy metal music playing in the background, which I really liked.  Finally, the ""tofu"" runs are egregiously difficult to beat.

Then, there are the Ghost Survivors stories.  You start off with three of them and unlock the fourth.  They are difficult.  You have limited weapons, ammo and consumables, but lots of enemies to work through.  They will test your judgment greatly.

My greatest beef with this game was character slowness.  ""Oh, no!  I'm being chased by an invincible tank of a zombie dude and he's quickly gaining on me!  Better keep jogging as casually as I can!""  Seriously, developers can do better than this.

In the end, I'm sure Resident Evil fans would really like this.  Still, people who aren't too much into the franchise, like me, would also like it.",1707527075,1707527075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere, graphics, the vibes, its own essence, enemies, map design, story, sound design is a one in a million. The lickers and Mr. X scared the shit out of me a few times at the point that it made me scream lmao. The feeling of oppression and hopeless in the air of a decaying police station and Raccoon City is something that I barely experienced in a videogame. Puzzles are really well made and makes you think just a little bit but are very nice to do. 

Nevertheless, I gotta say that the 2nd run, in my case was with Claire and some aspects didn't make any kind of sense. For example, how Claire (in my case) needs to do the same puzzles that Leon does in the 1st run. I understand that is obviously a game design thing but cmon. How do you fight the same William Birkin? 

Zombies... bullet sponges, that's it. Even if you shoot them 7 times in the face, there they are, still livin'. No more to say.

Despite all of its flaws, I clearly understand why people call this ""The best remake of all time"". I thought: ""Is this game THAT good?"". After I tried it, yes it is. If you want probably the best zombies experience in a game, go and buy this game, even if you don't want a zombie experience but a good game, go, what are you waiting for.

Ok, wow, I am probably gonna be one of the few people, that actually just couldnt enjoy this game:
Ill start with the good things:
- The graphics, sounds and asthetics in general are really, really good. Nothing more to say there.
- The story is still pretty cool.
- The progression and enhancing of your weaponry is quite satisfying.

But now, for the bad things:
. Pretty much the entire gameplay
- The bosses

Yup, you read it right. The gameplay in this game has got to be one of the worst things I have ever seen.
 Where do I even start?
1. Leon can do nothing besides shooting, throwing grenades and slashing with knifes. The game offers you no alternate way to get out of sticky situations. No knife parrying like in RE4 Remake, no kicking or punching or dodging, nothing.
Of course you could say: ""Just dont get cornered then."" Unfortunately, its not that easy. The game has quite linear paths, which makes it prone to getting cornered. I often had to resort to things that the gameplay didnt intend you to do.
2. Lickers dont work. Not only are the lickers just not well designed enemies (in this game, I mean, generally hear-only-enemies are quite cool), the game also gives you absolutely no way of distracting them. The only effective way to deal with them for a short time are flash grenades, which you have limited of. Slowly sneaking past them only works in limited scenarios, mainly because you cant, well, sneak in this game, you just have to walk past them by only tapping your walk button, which doesnt only look and feel stupid, it also barely works as the lickers can still hear it quite often and keep following you.
3. Bosses have way to much health and take way to long. On veteran, I ran out of ammo trying to fight birkin for the first time. And no, I didnt aim bad, I landed my shots pretty good on his weakpoint.
4. Probably the most glaring flaw. Common enemies are bullet sponges. Enemies soak up way to much ammo sometimes without reacting to them in any way. You can put 7-8 handgun bullets into a normal zombie's head and it might not even flinch. Oh yeah, and they might get up again multiple times before they finally die.
5. Quest items take up inventory space. Such a stupid idea. There is no fun in a feature like this, you sometimes have to run to a spot thats far away multiple times, just to grab items you had to leave because your inventory was full.
6. Limited saving is not a good idea in any difficulty mode, it doesnt make the game harder in any way, just more annoying, so I dont get why they put it in

And no, this critiscm is not because I am bad or something. You can argue with me, I ll gladly show you my gameplay, so you understand my point.
I have played Resident Evil 4 Remake before, played through professional multiple times and feel pretty good there. So I know what I am supposed to do.
I still cant unserstand how people can even compare this game to Resident Evil 4 Remake.
RE4 Remake is an absolute masterpiece, the second best game I have ever played, and this game doesnt even come anywhere to being close to it.",1706641928,1707428560,False,2,2,0.407962918281555176,3,True,False,False

I like the game so much because it's almost perfect - The graphics are so realistic, fight with bosses or other enemies is difficult and every boss fight is different, the music is good and it fits with the situations. Also there are more than 1 story in the game which make it longer to play and that's amazing for me and if you love mini games with zombies there are also some extra modes which are fun and telling you more about the game story. And about the story - it is very interesting, there is almost everything - there is love, action and more, but there is some sad moments which were so realistic. I don't think the game has many or big drawbacks - maybe only that when there are enemies behind the doors you can't just get in you need to open the door again and again and try to defeat all the zombies (which is rare situation). So if you love realistic action horror story mode games and like making achivements or try challenging yourself by playing the game on hardcore - I recommend this game to you.

Game is actually tense,""scary"", challenging, looks incredible and some caveats I'll get onto later aside otherwise supports the advertised 21:9 out of the box and runs incredibly well. The acting and writing are actually a bit better than usual low RE standards as a shock with a tone closer to the Resident Evil Remake and RE7. The controls are tight and make it feel like every bad thing to happen to you is your fault and with how they've implemented a third person perspective here I am starting to think the game might not have been as scary with the original camera (even if I would like it as an option). Doors really do invoke tension and without ANY load times it truly immerses you into the world and makes it feel like a real place. Especially because enemies still move and exist even when you are not there. Zombies can even follow you into other rooms and move around when you aren't there. Just when you think you are safe wait until you meet Mr X who will follow you across the entire RPD bar certain puzzle or save rooms who is alerted to you either by seeing you or hearing you or your gunshots.
This was a must play for 2019 and a reminder of what makes Resident Evil good and what makes good games in general.

And again while the story is decent for once I've also found having looked at the original that some of the content the remake emits (not much of the original is better) negatively impacts it like it lacking the ""Zapping System"" and the fact that Leon's A and Claire's B aren't that different compared to the original. The Ghost Survivors is a nice edition probably inspired by Extreme Battle mode but it's otherwise quite mediocre edition so thank god it's free.

Outside of Mr.X and Hunks new themes I am not impressed by the new music or lack of music. I use the Retro/OG music pack (which costs an additional fee :/ ) which helps but it's a shame there was no middle ground between old and new tune wise.

Worth while and a great way to get newbs into the genre and or series.

This game nails survival horror. It brings back everything that made the first game great and nothing that made the first game bad. The remake looks incredible. The combat is very good. My only complaint about the combat is that it can be awkward to dodge boss attacks. I'm not a big horror fan, although I am slowly getting more into it, and this game has made believe that video games are the best medium for horror. I'm very excited to continue playing through this series.

The rest of this review only concerns the second run (after you beat the game, you can play through it again as the other character).
I'm not usually interested in playing a game a second time immediately after beating it. I only played through RE1 once. After looking online, it seemed like many people believed doing both runs in RE2 is necessary to consider the game ""beaten"". There are many differences between the runs, and you have to do both to unlock the true ending so I decided to do both for this game. For the most part, I enjoyed the second run. It's mostly the same places but the enemies therein and the path you take are different. The story is also different, but it can feel awkward. At times I can see where Leon's story and Claire's story match up and it feels like they are happening together. At others it's impossible for both stories to be happening together. The true ending is fine, but nothing to write home about. All in all, I would prefer they either committed more to the second run, making it clear that it's a core part of the game and making the plot actually line up with the first run, or just not have the second run and put more content into the first. Luckily the game is good enough that playing it again is still a lot of fun.",1707195786,1707195786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a longtime fan of the franchise, I was eager to revisit Raccoon City, and the 2019 remake by Capcom left me thoroughly impressed. Kinda wish they remake on RE1 not remastered. Third person camera would be appreciated and ALSO PLEASE RE CODE VERONICA. I AM NEW TO RE FRANCHISE, MY MATES BEEN SAYING RE CV IS RELEVANT TO RE 5.

Pros:

Faithful Recreation: The remake successfully retains the core atmosphere and narrative of the original while enhancing it with modern visuals and gameplay mechanics. It's a nostalgic trip for veterans and a fresh experience for newcomers.

Stunning Visuals: The graphics are nothing short of spectacular. From the detailed character models to the intricately designed environments, every aspect of Raccoon City feels immersive and terrifying. The RE Engine truly shines here.

Terrifying Atmosphere: The game expertly builds tension and fear. The dark corridors, ominous sounds, and unpredictable encounters keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Capcom nails the survival horror aspect.

Well-Designed Puzzles: The puzzles are challenging without being overly frustrating. They add a layer of complexity to the game, encouraging exploration and critical thinking.

Cons:

Limited Exploration in Certain Areas: While the game generally encourages exploration, there are a few areas that feel slightly restricted. A bit more freedom in these segments would have enhanced the overall experience.

Story Structure Choices: The decision to split the narrative between Leon and Claire's perspectives, while interesting, might leave some players wanting more connection between the two storylines.

Conclusion:

""Resident Evil 2"" sets a new standard for video game remakes. Capcom's maybe meticulous attention to detail according to my mates, combined with modern technology, results in an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a veteran of the original or a newcomer to the series, this remake is a must-play. It's a shining example of how to respectfully reimagine a classic while maintaining the core elements that made it a genre-defining title.

        [td]With terrifying hallways of the Racoon City police department, to the laboratory of Umbrella; the lighting and atmosphere is absolutely haunting. Many areas tell a haunting story of struggle and panic. I love the design of every area in this game. It’s so claustrophobic and terrifying. The enemy designs are flawless, actually just perfection! Also the zombies are the scariest I've ever seen in a video game. The UI is also clean and really easy to navigate. The in-game map is so useful. Any item you don’t pick up is marked on the map, so you will never forget where items are. That’s such a welcome addition to any survival game. Also the UI for the map just looks amazing, and user friendly.[/td]

        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]It’s simple survival horror, really easy to get used to. You have to solve puzzles (which are extremely easy), conserve ammo, and fight scary bosses. The zombies (and other enemies) can be bullet spongy and can pull a few surprises on you. You will encounter many item puzzles, for example keys, a handle for a valve, and more. Also many items to help you on your journey. Healing items and finding pouches to increase your space will be a lifesaver! Exploration is everything in this game. So do not rush and take your time. Safe rooms are also a blessing and a returning feature from the original game. The safe room is, well, a safe room. No monsters can come in and hurt you. You will also have an item box to store all your goodies to use for later. Also don’t worry because every item you put into the item box, and connected to every safe room. There are many types of horrible creatures to fight through. Ranging from your normal zombies, dogs, G virus creatures, and much more! There is some content that has been cut from this game that was in the original sadly. I understand that this is a remake, but some content felt unnecessary to cut. Here are some of the content that is not in the game: 
[code][list]
[*]Zapping System
[*]Some puzzles are removed
[*]Removal of the Factory & Marshaling yard
[*]Many enemies that are cut (spiders, moths, crows, roaches, etc)
[/list][/code]
Regardless of the cut content, the game feels incredible and absolutely terrifying. The mechanics and overall gameplay feels incredible and so smooth. It’s the best form of survival horror, so prepare for a great challenge.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is short, but sweet (well as sweet as it gets in a zombie apocalypse). You play as Leon, or Claire. Each protagonist has different paths and stories for you to experience. The challenges each character goes through is believable and has incredible writing. The voice acting is top tier and really puts you into the experience. This is one of my favorite game stories. It’s horrifying, action packed, and has amazing characters.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Leon’s playthrough took me around 6 hours to complete. Claire’s playthrough was around 4 hours. You have a total of four different playthroughs in this game so the replayability is there. The good news is that you have challenges and unlockables you can get in this game that adds to the replayability. Also you have different game modes with there own short stories that add a good amount of playtime.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 2 has amazing music and sound design. The music score is so incredible and the developers were generous to add the classic 1998 music and UI sound effects. The zombies sound absolutely scary and hearing Mr.X roam around the halls is so haunting. They perfected the sound design and soundtrack for this game![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really encountered any bugs in this game. Actually I can’t think of one bug I had so far on my playthroughs.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Flawless. I can play Ultra settings no problem on this game. I had no stutters or frame drops. I have a mid range computer and it runs so well. The RE engine is so well designed so you should have zero issues on this game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]✅Pro’s[/td]

        [td][list]
[*]Cut Content including enemies, puzzles & locations
[*]Interactions between Leon and Claire are lacking in the Remake
[*]Second playthrough (or Side B) of Leon and Claire feel the same as Side A, but with very minor changes (basically feels rushed and lazy on the Side B Scenario)
[/list]

    [tr]
        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]9/10
This game is worth full price, especially for this amazing game! You can get this game on sale usually for around 50% off if you are patient.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 2 is a near masterpiece for me. I wish they didn’t cut as much content from the original. It’s a shame they did this, but besides that gripe I have; It's still one of the best modern horror games (especially for survival Horror). If you love survival horror, you will absolutely love this game.[/td]

I hadn't played the original RE2 going into this, so my review doesn't have any nostalgic boost attached to it! For a game this highly rated I was disappointed at soundtrack and writing. It's filled with cringy dialogues. I think some of it is straight from the original game, which I'd question if you're improving everything about the game why not improve the script too. I also found the soundtrack rather bland with nothing standout that I'd play in my car on my way to work.

However the gameplay is quite tense and fun, and the graphics are amazing as all the other modern Resident Evil games. That slow paced survival gameplay was the main reason that I still did a couple of playthroughs even after 100% completion, just because how much fun it was and because of all the amazing unlockable weapons and costumes. Not to mention the very cool changes in each playthrough between the two main characters. Also level design is sublime and the interconnected map reminds me a lot of Dark Souls level design philosophy. 

It was quite a fun achievement list as well, most of them including collectibles can be done without a guide. Although the Extra modes was where the fun ended for me. That's where the game forget all about slow paced survival game design, and throws seemingly unending enemies at you. With ""No way out"" extra mode being the worst offender, where the game puts you in a tight space and throws 100 zombies at you to kill with somewhat limited resources! ""Extra modes"" aside, overall a very fun achievements which take 50 - 60 hours to complete.",1706812039,1706812039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     The difficulty is just hard enough to create tension with you and your environment, but just easy enough to where the mechanics are easily accessible and allow for a gentle skill curve. There are multiple game modes and story lines the player can follow up on that keeps the stories and their respective progression relatively fresh.
     I find it really impressive how the action, survival, and horror mechanics all click with one another, allowing for a truly unforgettable experience. Each of the two stories between Leon and Claire feel unique to each other, making it worth playing them each thoroughly.
     The controls are very intuitive and responsive, feel both smooth and snappy, which allows for a very satisfying gameplay loop that rarely gets tiring.
     My only con with the game though is that if a new resident evil player comes to play completely blind and finds themselves in a really difficult spot, and has used up a large amount of the finite resources given to them, the difficulty gradually spikes, making it quite frustrating at times. But as long as you think in terms of ""what can i afford to use"" rather that ""whats everything i can use"", you'll be perfectly good to go.

This is a great Resident Evil and a superior remake in some many ways, but also it is a terrible RE2 Remake in many other ways. It should have been homerun, but it really isn't for many that will have fond memories of the original. For a thumbs up this is about to be extremely negative. 

One of the biggest grips is there really is no real ""Zapping System"" form the original present here, and I feel like the game just isn't a proper remake without. Run A and B are pretty much the same with no interlocking story. Your second run fights the same bosses and many of the same story beats with Leon and Clarie never interacting past one interaction and a couple of letters. While you really had to excuse some concessions in the original, I would have hoped this would have been improved for the remake not negated. The replay value is seriously hurt by this. 

""The Story"" is more fleshed out in the original and a continuation of the RE1 but too many details left out in the remake especially that RE1 happened and RE2 is the indirect outcome of RE1. 

""Controls"" are infinitely better than the original but also purposely made worst for sake of survival horror. This may or may not bug you. This makes sense in some ways but in others doesn't. Other than RE4 all of the newer Resident Evils whether 1st person or 3rd person the player is somewhat purposely gimped in the controls for the sake of the survival horror. RE2 leaned far heavier in the Action than Horror, and I really would have rather have seen it control more like that. More like RE4 and less purposely made worse. 

""HDR"" is a train wreak on PC in the REngine. It seems to have been this way since the Ray tracing update, which broke it in different ways in every Resident Evil game. The best way I could find to make it work more reliably is the turn it off in game and turn on Auto-HDR in Win 11 because the info is already there and just works so much better. Special K can also be used to fix HDR as well if you prefer that. Ray Tracing and HDR effects in REngine are very subtle, but it doesn't change they are a mess on PC. 
HDR is either washed out or busted and in game controls don't offer enough control over brightness to fix it. Many PC monitors don't have enough controls on the monitor itself to fix it so the only way to fix it is by using desktop controls, which usually the in game HDR has a fit if you alt tab.  

One thing I will say is that ""Ultrawide"" even to the extreme ends of the spectrum with ""Super Ultrawide"" are fantastic. This game looks glorious @ 7680x2160 (32x9 aspect & dual 4k) with a little DLSS, some settings adjustments, and a beefy enough system you can easily hit 120fps.

Overall I do like the game but some of the most important aspects of RE2 are missing in the Remake unfortunately. This along with busted settings on PC  really make it harder to recommend if you enjoyed or remember the original.",1706377669,1706469050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To Capcom: I will keep posting negative review for ALL your games, whether or not they now include your invasive DRM, [b]until you remove it[/b] from all of them.

 I want to make it clear, I'm not doing this out of spite, nor does it come easy for me, and that's saying something.
I'm not against use of DRM. I'm against being screwed over, having a company I respect dropping malware into some of my favorite games effectively denying me access to them.

Your crusade to stop others from using weird mods (especially since they won't stop, either way) in your products shouldn't involve people who practically never use them, like me, from playing your games as they are.

I genuinely don't think Capcom has lived up to what they pulled off with this game since, the RE3 remake was plain bad, RE8 was an action horror like RE4, and RE4R is back to linear action horror, and is considerably more janky than this game.

But this game? This game feels like an extension of everything good about 2002's RE1 remake. Resources are scarce and enemies are tough, so getting through the game requires a combination of planning and careful consideration of when and where to use your ammo. The game is fairly challenging, without being too over the top or cheap like RE8's VoS mode or the other bullshit meme difficulties RE games have been adding in recent years (not including RE7 Madhouse, that's actually well made.) Beating the game isn't too hard, but beating it quickly, or achieving challenge runs, will test your map and enemy knowledge, as well as your ability to stay calm and plan a route. Getting that S+ takes raw skill and practice, it feels fair and getting the S+ rewards feels earned, it's just excellent.

The enemy roster is a bit smaller than the original, but every enemy type poses a unique threat relative to the others, and the way they're used in the extra modes really forces you to understand their mechanics. Additionally, as mentioned, the A/B scenarios have been gutted in favor of what is essentially just an arrange mode that's the same for both characters. It's sad to see the system gone, but overall this remake holds up as a solid survival horror game, something other games should be held to as a standard of quality. 

Highly, highly recommend any RE or Survival Horror fan play this at least once.",1684981880,1705980492,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

●The origins of the Umbrella Corporation lie with the eugenics movements that dominated Europe and North American debate in the early 20th century. Its three most prominent founding members were Dr. Oswell E. Spencer, The Earl Spencer; Dr. Edward Ashford, 5th Earl Ashford, and Dr. James Marcus, who were university classmates, with further early work from Marcus' protégé, Brandon Bailey; the 16th Earl Beardsley and his daughter, Mylène and France's House of Henry, of which Christine and her father belonged. All were virologists with some associations with the eugenics movement either themselves or by association to another prominent figure.Umbrella's immediate pre-history truly begins in 1966, when Dr. Marcus developed a hypothesis that a mythical West African flower known as Stairway of the Sun bestowed powers to its consumers by a mutagenic viral infection. In a trip to the Ndipaya tribal lands, the fabled flower was discovered in an underground garden and a virus discovered within it. However, flowers cultivated in the United States failed to replicate the virus. Requiring significant funding beyond their aristocratic links to bring about their eugenics dream, Spencer formed Umbrella Pharmaceuticals on behalf of Ashford and an indifferent Marcus and established a base in the Ndipaya garden so Progenitor samples could be transported over the Atlantic instead. Requiring more money, the three agreed to a plan later known as the ""t-Virus Project"", where they would independently develop strains of Progenitor to sell to the US military as a weapon.The umbrella symbol represents protection and safety, but in reality it becomes a symbol of danger and death. The red and white colors represent danger and warning, while the black background represents the darkness.

It was founded by former Soviet Colonel Sergei Vladimir. The U.B.C.S. primarily recruited former soldiers and militiamen who had been incarcerated and, thus, could be offered a new life. At its largest in 1998, this force consisted of at least four platoons, designed Alpha through Delta, making for a compliment of as many as 120 mercenaries. It suffered near total destruction during the operation in Raccoon City.

It was one of several paramilitary organisations used by the company, including the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service, the Undertaker Unit and the Intelligence Division. The U.S.S was an expansive organisation, with branches specially trained and equipped for different situations, ranging from guarding Umbrella facilities to covert operations. It was dissolved in 2003, after Umbrella declared bankruptcy.The first known use of U.S.S. for this method was in 1988 when Dr. James Marcus was assassinated by two guards on the orders of Umbrella CEO Dr. Lord Spencer.[ In 1993, the U.S.S. college was moved to Rockfort Island, under the command of Lord Ashford. Along with a new military training centre, a concentration camp was built for the guarding of Umbrella's enemies.

========================================================

While this remake of Resident Evil 2 might not be the greatest survival horror game of all time (there are some other great contenders for this title that I believe surpass RE2make), it is THE definitive survival horror game for people who are unfamiliar with the genre.

- incredibly beautiful graphics that still hold up a few years later (with ray-tracing and DLSS/FSR support!)
- smooth and precise over-the-shoulder gameplay with resource management that's very easy to grasp but requires the player to keep paying attention at their ammo and such at all times
- simple puzzle solving embedded in some of the most clever level design I've seen in a game of this type
- a completely seamless experience in which you can go from the very starting point all the way to the end without a single loading time
- a lot of replayability thanks to the various playable scenarios
- good scares here and there but nothing that would cause a panic attack either meaning the player can keep focusing on playing the game without fearing for cheap jumpscares and such
- and overall a very faithful yet at the same time modern recreation of every iconic location of the original game.

Add to all this the fact that you absolutely don't need prior knowledge of the Resident Evil franchise to understand the story (though some minor lore bits may fly over non-fans' heads), and you get what I personally consider to be THE absolute perfect game to introduce someone who doesn't play survival horror games to this genre. If you have a friend who's never played that kind of games before, have them play this one and then the RE4 remake as well.

This is by far the best horror game I have ever played and is a must buy for anyone, the atmosphere of this game is unlike anything else I have experienced and the replay-ability it offers through achieving higher ranks and playing through the other stories cannot be understated.
The game also offers extra modes that test your abilities post story and offer great challenges for anyone looking to push themselves.
My one recommendation for anyone picking this game up is still install the Direct x11 iteration, the lack of ray tracing in the Direct x11 creates a far more stable framerate especially when in the main hall of the Raccon City Police Department.

Warning: Capcom is adding unfamiliar DRM to their back catalogue of games. This corp has repeatedly shown their stance towards mods in their games as well and seem to be taking action. I would caution you against purchasing any capcom product that contains this DRM as it’s unfamiliar, and untrustworthy. For now, if you really want this game, or any capcom game, I would stress that you watch and observe to see what happens in the near-ish future. 

Please note that there is a lot of misinfo circulating about with regards to this situation. Please do your due diligence and research everything and even fact check myself before making a final judgement. I am doing the best I can to sift through the false info and properly inform myself and will update this review accordingly.

DRM is not always a bad thing, if used correctly, it protects initial sales. Then good publishers will remove it later on allowing for better experiences. I am upset when DRM harms performance, which it often does (like Jedi Survivor). I find that inexcusable, poor performance that screws over the paying customer should always be frowned upon. Recently, denuvo was removed from RE8, which is good. But, when it was first added the game suffered many problems which modders had to remedy until its removal. Enigma seems to be capcom’s replacement for denuvo.

Earlier this month, RE Rev was updated and performance was harmed. Shortly after, capcom reversed the update. This is concerning because REV was released almost 11 years ago and the game’s already been cracked (both the pc and 3ds version), as with most older games. This update to add DRM to an old game is incredibly fishy, especially with how it came with no announcement from the publishers themselves. Almost as if somebody was trying to hide it.
Denuvo a very good DRM, since there’s few who know how to crack it, even then it’s tough. Denuvo itself costs ~$5,000 per month for the license, ~$60,000 a year. A game’s sales can’t keep up with the fee forever, and the DRM has to be removed/replaced to salvage income. 

Enigma is $59,920 cheaper. It costs about $400 for initial purchase, and $80 annually for upkeep. Enigma was checked with a virus scanner, and got 34 positive flags, ~%50 of what Virus Total checks for. Scanners can have false positives. The REV .exe will show 1 positive flag (at least for me). This one is easily written off as a false positive. Generally low single digits are fine. When you are getting into double digits, there’s problem. The dev for Enigma has been purported to have a fake address in the US, and the domain name’s been alleged to be bought through a Moscow front (fact check me). This DRM is incredibly sneaky, and according to others, is capable of quietly worming its way through your PC. These factors, even if partially false, are concerning, keep this away from your pc.

On October 25 of 2023, there was a capcom R&D presentation.
“RE:2023 Anti-cheat and Anti-Piracy Measures in PC Games Recommendations for In-House Production”
14:00 – 16:00 ish. The pres states that all mods, unless officially supported, are no different than cheating. Yes, with regards to DRM, all foreign code is considered tampering. But, they go further, and say that mods tarnish the product’s (and corp’s) image as they may be mistaken for legitimate parts of said product. Earlier last July, a tournament competitor in a SF6 match forgot to disable his Chun-Li n*de mod. This is likely what capcom is referencing. But, they’ve taken things further.

Capcom is no newb to “nuking” youtube creators’ channels. They’ve removed content and channels for discussing info that the corp themselves leaked. Capcom has taken action against MH creators, most notably speedrunners. This was because their videos featured mods, some as harmless as to simply aid with running or slightly modify the experience (skins/costumes/fov). Capcom has tried to take down modders’ work as well. Yes, these modders were making n*de mods, but never the less they came after a modder, who’s to stop them from taking things further and coming for everyone else?

Considering the corp’s past and recent actions and statements, it’s safe to say that they are/will be coming after modders. People like to add that Enigma was added to RE5 last year and that no one has had any problems. Even so, ghost updates are sketchy, since there’s no point in copy protecting a long-cracked game. For now, I advise customers to watch, listen, and wait to see what the corp does. We can choose to make it apparent to them that mods are an inevitable factor of PC gaming. I know where my stance is, if I can’t make Leon sound like Kermit then I’ll happily take my money elsewhere.

Thank you if you read this far, I’d be happy if you had any info (legit that is) or comments you’d like to share.

Warning: Pseudo-rant ahead
I have one more speculation (not an allegation or accusation, simply a theory coming straight outa my rear end). I think that modders are beginning to pose a business threat to companies like capcom. 

This corp is known to have a lot of stinker dlcs.
Example:
REV has dlc, 2 fun characters, and 4 more that suck. There’s 2 shoddy weapon reskins and 2 parts packs that boost damage. All of these things are already in the purchased game. This leads to my theory, capcom is scared of modders. We can simply repaint the base G18 and make it look like jessica’s, and have a better gun too. The same goes for parker’s gun dlc. Whip out CE and give yourself the gun parts. For one customer, the corp has lost out of possibly $4. Apply that to a large portion of the consumer base, even more money lost out.

Another, Street Fighter 6. Its dlc has one year character pass costs $30. You get 4 characters..and character colors. Not outfits, colors; and in game currency…which you can earn for free. The same goes for the $50 ultimate dlc, it just adds 2 backgrounds (stages) and some costume colors with a little extra in game currency. You can get so much more for this amount, just look at the steam reviews.

We also see modders making far better outfits for free. The recent Yor update was bad too, just a worthless reskin. So, modders will fix it and make it look better. Both of these scenarios DO harm the their image, it just shows that some dudes in blender can do so much better than a multi-billion dollar corp. 

Their claims about “public order”, I believe, are total bs. I believe this corp recognizes that it churns out dumpster fire (ignoring the rare cases like Separate Ways, which is only $10) and are too afraid to admit that they want money. At least EA is obvious abt it.

The same goes for so many other capcom dlcs.

I love these games, I am a big fan of RE, DD, MH and more. Yes, your writers often suck, but I still love the stories in these games. I love to play them, I have so many happy memories of these wonderful little gems from my childhood. I WANT to support the talented, skillful, and passionate people behind these pieces of digital-art. No not the suits, I mean the programmers, artists, musicians, voice actors, mocap dudes, sound guys etc. But, unfortunately, these people work for a corp who is rapidly growing greedier, and at a scary pace. Soon, they’ll be just another EA, a money vacuum that cares about microtransactions more than making a great experience that keeps people comin back to that game and for more in the future.

Whoever is currently in charge (in my opinion) is out of touch with what customers actually want and will support. I have blacklisted this corp from my steam page, and it will be sometime, if ever, I consider purchasing their products ever again given their recent statements, actions, practices, and routine behavior. 

End of Review.

Btw capcom employee who reads this, this is all one ginormous opinion, not an allegation or accusation, just a giant word vomit from my unintelligent ignoramus brain.

RE2 Remake is one of the best games i've ever played, it's beautiful, engaging, and the story is pretty good too, it sucked me in and i played it day after day but only in short bursts because this game is scary and i'm a wimp.

If you don't like horror or jumpscares at ALL, play RE4 first because it'll slowly get you used to it (as its much more action than horror) then play this game.

For Steam Deck users; despite this game being verified, there are a couple of cutscenes where they just DON'T show. I didn't run into this issue until I was at the very end of the game on my Deck, and I could hear the audio but it showed one of those TV static images instead so I had to watch the cutscenes online. The game runs INCREDIBLY well, on default settings with their in game filtering for performance I was getting smooth 90fps like 97% of the time on the deck OLED, this is a perfect game for the deck (minus the cutscene issues)

O DRM é uma prática de instalação que não tem nenhum sentido e nenhuma razão, além de ser perigoso para os PC's e deveria ser considerado uma prática criminosa.
Mods nunca atrapalharam em nada (nenhum jogo), pelo contrario, eles sempre ajudaram os jogos a nunca serem esquecidos, por exemplo, Skyrim ta ai para mostrar; outro bom exemplo, olha o que CD Projekt RED faz com seus jogos (a comunidade de Moders de Cyberpunk 2077 e The Witcher 3 é incrivel).

To begin of course, the game that I'm reviewing is none other but a good game that Capcom always delivers. However, this changes things when they've announced about their new DRM that they will eventually add to all of their games, lets talk about that. The DRM (Enigma DRM) isn't at all known or popular throughout the world so far. Though knowing that the company is unknown, its already obvious on whats to be expected, bad things.

Capcom had picked this DRM out of the blue, maybe throughout the recommendations of their employee or something. The main reason they've done this is to suppress modding. Why are they doing this you might ask? if you're out of the loop, go look up the incident on SF6 back in 2023, its probably the reason why they're trying to suppress mods. I'll be real with everyone, I don't mod Capcom games at all because my experiences on Bethesda games have gotten me exhausted to even bother. But I do have respect for modders as they offer a longer lifespan for games. But going back to the DRM, this thing is a literal Malware. For one that has been confirmed by some customers on DRM Supported Capcom games, those customer's device have been infected with at least 34 virus that comes with the DRM. Capcom is putting us all at risk if we want to play their games. 

For now, I haven't heard much of Capcom since they revert the DRM on one of their games. They've been silent for sometime now. But going forward to anyone that reads this, I do not recommend you to get anything from Capcom at this time. I've lost devices to Malwares in the past, which is why this has gotten me worked up. I sincerely hope that you guys don't meet the same fate as i did while convincing you guys from buying a potential Malware as well.",1705286818,1705286818,False,7,1,0.549474954605102539,0,True,False,False

You should be aware that there is likely a huge negative PR storm coming your way and possibly offer Capcom advice on how to implement your product properly as you've angered a lot of people.

Attempting to kill modding communites and calling them ""cheaters/hackers"" by adding malware to the gamefiles to ""prevent people from modding"" is a very sad anti-consumer attempt. The funniest thing about this whole situation is that Enigma DOESN'T EVEN WORK! Mods still work meaning it's only purpose is literally to drain performance and run a trojan on your PC.

Also, comparing modding to cheating is the most pathetic corporate thing I've ever heard.
FYI: The same company calling modding a form of cheating are the same people who released an older build of RE2/3/7 on Steam so that mod creators didn't have to update their mods and transfer it to the latest version.

Crapcom were one of the best studios in current day, with their last 5 or more games being massive successes and super fun games to play.  But I guess there's a twist to everything.

The graphics, sound design, mechanics, all top notch. I will admit that the atmosphere is better in my opinion if you buy the OG soundtrack DLC and use that instead, the new soundtrack is basically unnoticeable and you'll hear no music at all most of the time. It's subjective, in many ways the game is scarier when there is nothing breaking the silence except the groans and limping footsteps of nearby zombies. In other ways, the retro OST establishes a more tense atmosphere.

The replayability is solid, the game requires multiple playthroughs to experience the ""true ending"" but each one is different. It really doesn't get old and this game is one of the most replayable in the series. I love the atmosphere, and the amazing graphics when maxed out makes this game so easy on the eyes, walking around the RPD is a visual treat.

*sigh* Capcom has done it again, folks.... They decided to simply upset their entire fanbase with something so shady, that this time it's borderline criminal. Some people out there, think that it's a good policy to simply ""cheat"" on their customers, by implementing shady DRMs and Spyware to existing games. 

I did NOT agree to this when I bought the game, and definitely you will NOT tell me, HOW I will ENJOY my owned game. There is no ""right way"" or ""wrong way"" to play a SINGLE PLAYER GAME. It's MY way, or the highway. And before you ask, no. I don't have mods installed.

All that Capcom did this time, is encouraging piracy. Especially on single player titles. Why would someone trust Capcom after what they did with this ""Enigma""? And this happens SO close with the release of Dragon's Dogma II... Now, i was waiting for this title, and was excited to actually get my hands on it.... Well, not anymore, Capcom. 

From here on, I'm boycotting Capcom. Even if they revert this. There's no trust between us anymore, as this is the second time you're messing up with your customers.

Game itself is phenomanal, one of the best REimaginings around, I recommend the actual game itself, however, I do not recommend Capcom as a Company, as they just added DRM to a long list of their games new and old that destroys performance, tries to stop anyone from being able to enjoy community made mods and custom content (Which they have some of the most popular modding communities ever), and straight up makes their games fully unplayable for a large number of people.

The Nintendo comparisons Capcom gets are stronger than ever, countless beloved series with very high quality games but some of the most egregious and disgusting anti consumer practices around.

Apparently they may be reversing this or something hastily, and claiming it was an accident ""oopsies"" style, and mixed reports are on what has DRM in it yet, but lets be serious, we all know they intended this, and would only be backtracking due to backlash and to try and pretend nothing happened, they will try this again later, on large scale, which is why we need to make a statement and let them know what their community thinks of this decision they made and that it could very well be a massive blow to themselves that could potentially damage their reception and popularity and future sales.

Also, some of my games had their saves/achievements/playtime/stats wiped when this happened, and a lot of UI errors are happening for me on their Steam Pages/Communities, I cannot even leave a review for some games because of that, thanks Capcom, this all shows what you really think of your community/customers, I guess you really would rather just interact with our wallets....",1705046736,1705098756,False,9,0,0.48717382550239563,0,True,False,False

However they claim that mods are no different from cheating and also that there are mods that ""are offensive to public order and morals."" As such not only are they seeking to block all modding but they are copyright striking youtube videos that contain mods.

Some of these users have now had their youtube channels deleted permanently. What I find ""offensive to public order and morals"" is interfering with, and taking away people's forms of income.  Well, two can play at that game, not only do I not recommend purchasing any Capcom game but I'm sure a lot more people will now move to pirating their single player games as once the DRM is cracked they'll be able to mod again.

It's even crazier that in the past Capcom have officially supported Speedrunning which is a big part of the community, and they often contain mods. 

The real reason they want to remove mods is probably because if you look at Street Fighter 6, they're trying to charge you £15-20 for a costume while modders do it for free. They also probably want to sell their ripoff game-skip purchases.

Sure at the end of the day if you start speedrunning RE2R you can Finish it(one story) in under 2H30M but thats only a part of the fun of this game. Because you get scored at the end and the game can be finished in 1 sitting your able to go at it again see if you can play it more perfectly go faster be as optimal as possible and also just mess around with the weapons you unlock by doing the achievements. The other reason because if you want to truly finish the game you need to play both characters stories which for about 50% of it is the same and only on the 2nd run do you see the true ending. Another unexpected strength of RE2R is the modding community once you download the custom launcher theres so many mods out there that do everything from fashion to op weapons and camera angles and even First person view mode.

Capcom allows itself to update decade years old games in order to add [b]D[/b][i]ancing[/i] [b]R[/b][i]atatouille[/i] [b]M[/b][i]esopotamia[/i] in its code, and Steam does nothing to prevent it.

A couple of downsides:
1. not being able to pause while being hit for some reason, I might want to load back a save because I'm in a losing fight, why do you stop me from pausing? Should I just watch myself get beat up?
2. the skip button for cut scenes isn't very clear; you need to pause and then press space key to actually skip a cut scene. Why not allow me to skip the cut scene while outside of the pause menu as well? I didn't realise I could actually skip cut scenes until the last final clips of the game because not many games do it like that.
3. the game changed the difficulty automatically for me when I wasn't doing very well, in the end this actually resulted in a better gameplay experience for me however, it was a bit of a blow to my ego to just change the difficulty without even asking, did I really suck that badly?

883710,155508828,76561198007208379,0,19,753,0,686,1704735785,"TL;DR: It's a 4/10 game. It's from the '90s so take it with a grain of salt. It's just kind of there. I don't have massive nostalgia for Resident Evil because I never played it in the '90s on PS1. The graphics are good but the story is meh and split up over multiple playthroughs. You have to play the game FOUR times to get the entire story. The boss fights are stupid. You're probably better off watching a walk-through video on Youtube and buying the newer games.

Longer version: The graphics are good. It's the first thing you'll notice about this game. However, the intro video of the trucker eating the burger is the most disgusting part of the game. I don't need to hear LOUD LIP SMACKS AND CHOMPING right in my ear in the first 30 seconds of a game.

Unfortunately, this is the kind of game that you MUST watch a walk-through in order to play it. Don't bother trying to play it without one because you will just get frustrated. You'll still get frustrated with the walk-through but slightly less so. There's very limited ammunition so you cannot kill every single zombie. You have to know who to fight and who not to. You'll also need to know exactly where everything is since you can't fight everything. Hence the walk-through.

The boss fights are a pain in the rear. There's really only two boss fights and they're back to back right at the end of the game which is weird. You'd think they'd have like a mid-point boss fight and then a finale. The boss fights are bad because there's only one specific way to accomplish them. There's no room for creativity. You have to have the timing perfect to be standing in the right spot at the right time so you don't get hit. It basically requires you to know exactly where the hit boxes are. If you get hit you might as well reload the game because your character will naturally enter a very long, drawn out animation during which you're locked out of control. However, the boss is free to move about and wind up for swing #2. This means that the boss has started swing #2 right about when you're going to gain control of your character again. Swing #2 is a freebie for the boss. You can take about 3 hits max before you're dead and when you die it's a pain in the rear. The death animations are very, very long and drawn out. So much so that you're better off ALT+F4ing to close the game quickly and then open it up again and try again.

You cannot dodge attacks; you can only slowly walk away and hope you don't get hit. Also the controls for secondary attacks are weird. Press and hold space bar, wait for animation, then left click and wait for another animation before you can attack. However, at that point the boss has moved away from where your grenade is going so it was all pointless.

And then to top it all off, if you defeat the boss, guess what you get to do it again because this game has FOUR playthroughs that you  MUST do to get the entire story. What a stupid idea. I'm fine with having it split up between two separate stories. That actually sounds kind of cool. But this is just the same story 95% the same as you already did. What a dumb idea.

With all that being said, get the game if you really want to relive that '90s video-game frustration. If you don't want that then just watch a Youtube video on the story and purchase one of the later games.",1704661472,1704736522,False,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

But this is Resident Evil 2, the remake. I watched probably 2-3 LPs already, I know the story and I agree with the general consensus that this is one of the greatest remakes ever made. I really wanted to buy it and play it and reward the developers for their work. So I started a normal game as Claire and managed about 2 1/2 hours (just before Mr. X turns up), only shitting my pants once thanks to a surprise licker attack. But then I just couldn't continue (until I cheated, see below).

I am 42, man, my heart cannot take this (""anymore?"", nah, I could never take this). I played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Metro and other games that can scare you with their atmosphere, but there I could always defend myself. I could never play Amnesia or those new fancy survival horror games that are all the rage with the cool kids. I am a bloody coward.

So I got myself a good ol' trainer. Those tools still exist, apparently, and they bloody work. Mr. X? One shot froze him forever (unless he was spawned in by the game at set pieces). I know what most of you are thinking? Mate, you basically destroyed the core concept of the game. And I know. And I am sorry. But that was the only cheat I did, I fought those f'n lickers and those stupid tree monsters and that cunt of a doctor that cared more about work than family (oh and her husband, too, I guess)... and I won those fights fair and square. It doesn't count in the eyes of the hardcore RE heroes, but I am happy that I got to live another day without a heart attack (*knocks on wood*).

RE 2 is a really good game. You don't need my opinion on this, it's already got a good reputation. I am just here to tell everyone who maybe is as scared as I am of being chased by an unbeatable monster, that it is okay if you, like me, resort to bloody cheating to still be able to play this game. It's fun even without a heart attack, I promise.

Now please commence the public flogging because I dared to not be as hardcore as you.",1704570280,1704656658,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Actually, there are many other similarities between the two that are cool to spot. I don't really love pure horror games, I find this mix really enjoyable, since you are given a chance to trade blows with the enemy. Both main characters are so likeable and well portrayed even for a short game like this one. Gorgeous to look at, outstanding levels with abundant use of backtracking. I love the setting and the movie-like presentation. Gameplay-wise, it is super interesting and demanding, always keeping you on your toes. Resource-management and strategy are key to make it out alive. Sometimes a fight is not worth the bullets, other times you won't be given a choice. Brutal initial cinematics, was immediately immersed and that is key for players to keep playing a game. Seems obvious, but so many (yes even AAAs) fail at this to this day.

Everything is faithful to the original, from the story to the maps to the environments and even the weapons, just updated for modern hardware and expanded on to better tell the story. I would definitely call this a worthy sequel to the remake of the first game.

My only complaints involve the VAs for Leon and Claire and the decision to make Claire a brunette. I get that having the originals voice these characters again was unlikely but Capcom didn't even try to find sound-alike ones. Also, Claire is very clearly a redhead with auburn hair in every prior game and CGI movie she appears in. I know there are mods to fix that but it still irritates me that Capcom would go the way of Hollywoke and try to cancel real redheads.",1704495271,1704495271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall i would recommend to play all resident evil games not only because they are interesting enough, but from psychological side - all of them has something different and it helps to understand yourself what your body prefer in games and same about your friends.

For example - Resident evil 3 may be not the best for many players, but for me and my wife personally it was more immersive and more intense because of Nemesis with than Resident evil 2 , but we like it too.

The visual overhaul is nothing short of spectacular, transforming the dark and eerie corridors of Raccoon City into a visually stunning and chilling environment. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and gruesome zombies is commendable, creating an immersive and terrifying experience.

The narrative remains as compelling as ever, with Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield’s stories beautifully reimagined.

The atmosphere is palpable, enhanced by a revamped sound design that keeps you on edge throughout your journey.

The controls are more responsive, and the updated camera system adds a modern touch without losing the classic survival horror feel. The balance between action and horror is expertly handled, providing intense and satisfying combat moments while preserving the spine-chilling suspense that Resident Evil is known for.

The pacing is spot-on, ensuring that players are consistently engaged and invested in the unfolding horror.

That is the only thing making this game hard and annoying to the point of frustration, I eventually lost all interest in everything close to end because of it and some puzzles started to feel like chores.
Tyrant was nothing more than an annoyance that slowed progress and nothing more, but I guess some people get exited for someone chasing them.
The game is not scary in my opinion but for some it might because zombies and dim lighting, in dark areas (which there are not many) you have flashlight that is fairly good compared to many other games

My only complaint would be that they really stretched their assets by reusing content over and over. I played Leon's Campaign and then Claire's Campaign, and Claire's was largely the same as Leon's with maybe 20% of it being different. When I beat Claire's and then realized I had to also beat one of the two's Ending B's- a weird re-adventure with slightly different progression and loot layouts- all for the sake of seeing the one-minute final boss and 2 minutes of cutscenes? I just looked that up on youtube and called the game done. I'm good on having to play the exact same maps for a third time in a row.

The recreation of Raccoon City's locales is nothing short of extraordinary, boasting breathtaking graphics that establish a compelling atmosphere, intensifying the game's inherent tension and horror. The character redesign for protagonists Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield is nothing short of stellar, endowing them with a heightened level of realism and intricate detail.

Furthermore, the game preserves the core essence of survival horror, featuring demanding combat mechanics, intricate puzzles, and a strategic approach to resource management encompassing ammunition and restorative items. The sound design plays a pivotal role, significantly enhancing the overall eerie and tense ambiance.

The narrative undergoes an expansive and profound transformation, providing a more enriched experience for both those acquainted with the original storyline and newcomers to the game. The dual perspectives of Leon and Claire's campaigns offer a distinctive outlook on the unfolding events within the zombie-infested city.

Capcom successfully resurrected the survival horror masterpiece, delivering a haunting and intense experience that pays homage to the original while introducing modern gaming elements.

Visually, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a triumph. The RE (Reach for the Moon) Engine showcases its capabilities, bringing the decaying Raccoon City to life with breathtaking detail. From the eerily dimly lit corridors of the police station to the grotesque designs of the undead, the game's atmosphere is nothing short of captivating. The photorealistic graphics contribute to the overall immersion, enhancing the sense of dread and tension.

The narrative remains faithful to the original, following Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield as they navigate the zombie-infested city. However, Capcom took the opportunity to deepen the story, providing more depth to characters and introducing new narrative elements. This narrative expansion not only serves as a treat for series veterans but also engages newcomers with its compelling and well-paced storytelling.

One of the standout features of Resident Evil 2 Remake is its innovative over-the-shoulder perspective, a departure from the fixed-camera angles of the original. This shift in perspective enhances the player's connection to the characters and intensifies the fear of the unknown. The tight controls and responsive aiming system make combat satisfyingly tense, emphasizing resource management and strategic decision-making.

The revamped gameplay mechanics extend beyond combat. Puzzles are cleverly designed, challenging players to think critically and rewarding them with a sense of accomplishment. The interconnected environment encourages exploration, and the ever-looming threat of the relentless Tyrant (Mr. X) adds an extra layer of tension, transforming the game into a nerve-wracking experience.

Resident Evil 2 Remake excels in the audio department, using haunting ambient sounds and a chilling soundtrack to create an atmosphere that constantly keeps players on edge. The groans of zombies, creaking floorboards, and distant echoes contribute to the overall sense of dread, making each encounter a heart-pounding experience.

The game's replay value is commendable, offering two distinct campaigns for Leon and Claire, each providing a unique perspective on the unfolding catastrophe. Additionally, the multiple difficulty settings and unlockable content provide incentives for players to return to Raccoon City and face its horrors in different ways.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a masterclass in survival horror, seamlessly blending nostalgic elements with modern design to create an unforgettable experience. It successfully captures the essence of the original while introducing innovative features that elevate it to new heights. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer to survival horror, Resident Evil 2 Remake is an absolute must-play that sets a high standard for the genre.",1704085239,1704085239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll explore the iconic locations such as the Raccoon City Police Department, solve puzzles and defeat bosses with the help of an Over The Shoulder Camera (like RE4) and brought alive by the RE Engine's visual prowess. 

Overall, you're getting a streamlined scenario with the classic gameplay loop of item management, resource management, exploration and puzzle solving that have all made a successful transition to the new camera angle and presentation. You can aim freely but, in exchange the enemies take a lot of hits to go down. The new RPD layout makes A LOT more sense than the original, the Sewers feel creepier with ample use of shadows and lighting, and the Lab has a totally different feel than before. It's also very replayable thanks to multiple difficulties, two characters with two scenarios each, and side content to go along with a runtime that doesn't overstay it's welcome. 

My only gripes are that there's no ""Zapping"" System (picking up an item as Claire during Scenario A would make it disappear for Leon in his B scenario and vice versa). And that the scenarios don't really fit together well. In this the A scenario of your choosing is what actually happens and you have to imagine what the other character is doing because the B scenario has things that literally can't happen to both. The B scenarios were an afterthought and it shows. 

Even with those flaws, this is an excellent game that's well worth playing whether you're a veteran or newcomer. The Over The Shoulder Camera and movement should feel right at home for newer players or are used to modern games making this an accessible point of entry.",1703987889,1703987889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remembered beating the game and unlocking Scenario B, I remembered seeing how fast I could beat the game and seeing if I could do it without saving.
I figured it was all going to come right back to me once I started playing.
  
When I started playing, I quickly realized this was not the same game I remembered. Similar yes, but different.  Aiming is not the same but better, movement is not the same but better, atmosphere is much darker, more terrifying than I remember.  Walking through these halls, and seeing the scratches on the walls… a feeling of dread creeps over me.  Anxiousness begins kicking in, the fear has returned.  
Running through a door to get away from the undead hoard, and the feeling of safety quickly leaves you as the doors come crashing down behind you.  You receive no comfort in the pause menu while you mentally prepare yourself for the next door, as you listen to the constant eerie ambient noise. 

The sound is amazing, eerie, realistic, good voice acting.
Visuals are greatly improved from the past, really added some good cutscenes.
Gameplay is better than I was expecting, same story from the past but slightly twisted.
The controls feel really good, very smooth transitions.  More jump scares than ever.

As a remake: homework done, but missed the spot.

1998 was a fine year to be alive. Hardly knew any English and used to be scared of much harmless things than zombies and only way to play the game through was on easiest difficulty with miniguns and rpgs and still having not a clue what was going on due a language barrier. When I got older I was able to find a guide from the internet in my language (Finnish) how to complete the game and few years after that I completed the whole thing without cheats and understanding the story without lose ends.

Thus I can say that I have wiped both Remake and the Original and their difference is not in their excellence for they both are greater than great. However, while graphically and room dimensionally Remake stands out for its benefit, the original wins in storytelling. Practically things are much the same and small changes work and are refreshing, but thing were Remake doesn't success is to create the immersion of parallel stories between the characters and this does not only affect negatively on the uniqueness of different scenarios, but also for replayability. In the original players were attracted to play the both sections A and B at least twice through by switching the order of the characters between sections, but in Remake this is not the case unfortunately and there is less reasons for replays and they even wiped few moments were player was able to impact some of the assets in Scenario B during Scenario A.

I have recently played few Remakes of old games and people use to complain a lot how their childhood is now ruined and bohoo this and that. Of course I could join the choir and talk about more straightforward puzzles, lighter atmosphere and go to pinpoint that Remake is nothing but a lazy, half arsed game which gots nothing on the classic, but I totally let that slide for Remake is a marvelous game all the way from the beginning til' the end. There is always a bright side of these Remakes and that is that we are once again able to enjoy these relics with a new vision, and just like zombies they won't die but raise up once in a while.",1703794734,1703794734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Keep in mind the intended way to play this game is Leon / Claire A and then 2nd run on the other character. Don't do both on A and then both on B, it's not worth it.

Two main problems I have with the game.

First is Mr. X. During the police station chase it's less scary and more tedious. Jack from RE7 was a better implementation of the same mechanic in my opinion.

Second is that this remake skipped on a lot of the really cool mechanics to do with the first and second runs that the original had. The original A and B were two sides of the same story. If you fought a boss as Leon you would not have the exact same fight as Claire. If you picked up an item as Claire then it wouldn't be there for Leon. At one point there's a puzzle that requires both characters to have interacted with a panel before it unlocks. The remake ignores these nuances, and although the end result is still very good I can't help but feel it could have been so much better.

Despite that, this is one of those games that you just have to play.",1703775246,1703775246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]Pros[/h3]

- [b]Beautiful graphics and sound design[/b], which really breathe life into the horror aspect despite being played a third-person perspective
- A [b]decent length of play time[/b]; playing a single run is fun, but would highly recommend rounding out the story by using the ""2nd run"" option for the other player character at least
- [b]Reasonable difficulty curve[/b]; limited ammo can seem daunting at first, but with frequent saving (in non-hardcore mode) and some skilful inventory management, this heightens the challenge instead of feeling like a chore. 
    - You're [b]incentivized to seek out hidden items and areas[/b] to fully experience the game to get more resources, and the map tracker feature marking unexplored rooms as red is very helpful.
    - Keep an eye out for [b]helpful loading screen tips[/b] every time you die!
- Some really fun player [b]customization and mods[/b] available if you're into that!

[h3]Cons[/h3]

- For newcomers to the franchise, the layout of the RPD police station can be [b]labyrinthine and frustrating[/b]. The map addresses a lot of these concerns, though.
    - Even for non-newcomers, the amount of [b]backtracking[/b] involved can be very tedious. The player character's movements can feel a tad slow at times due to the lack of sprint, especially when being actively pursued by monsters.

Step into the zombie-infested streets of Raccoon City as Leon and Claire once again - this time with gorgeous new graphics.

The familiar police station and sewers have been expanded and improved. Solve new environmental puzzles and watch out for zombified lickers crawling on the ceiling - yikes!

Combat is weighty and satisfying thanks to the over-the-shoulder camera and intuitive controls. Line up clean headshots or blow zombies away up close with the trusty shotgun - feels so good!

The Tyrant Mr. X stalking you adds thrilling tension. Nothing like hearing his ominous footsteps rapidly approaching when you're low on ammo! Escape requires thinking on your feet.

Perfect balance of the horror aspect, just enough to get the adrenaline going if its your first time playing, and not too much where you'd be constantly trying to brace for some scares.
In some other horror games, I personally think that those loud, abrupt jumpscares can be a total turnoff for the faint hearted players alike, but RE2 was definitely much easier to handle, to a point where i'd be itching to continue multiple runs of the game now. Currently progressing through Claire's storyline and im also looking forward to what changes on the 2nd runs of both Leon's and Claire's side.
Puzzles are quite easy to follow along, but can be tedious going around looking for clues and then going back to the puzzle spots.",1703431653,1703432082,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game still has the best blend of action and horror among the remakes, and even after being spoiled by RE4's sublime combat, I came back to this (having over 1000 hours in just Claire's scenario alone on PS4) and it has aged just fine since 2019.  A solid 4/5 experience. There's cut content and a pretty hard to ignore lazy 2nd scenario mode, and some of the narrative doesn't make sense depending on who you pick to play as, but in terms of raw gameplay, visuals and sound design, this is one of Capcom's best.

The most noticeable drawback is the lack of diversity in the character lineup. The game's protagonists conform to well-worn stereotypes, neglecting the opportunity to showcase a more varied and realistic representation of humanity in the face of the undead. In a modern gaming landscape that craves diverse narratives, Resident Evil 2 feels like a missed opportunity rather than a progressive step forward.

The narrative, while compelling in its own right, misses the chance to explore themes related to diversity and inclusion. The zombie apocalypse could have served as a backdrop to address the complexities of diverse relationships and perspectives, adding depth to the overall storytelling.

Fast-forward to this year, and I was determined to give the game another chance. I have since completed all the runs for Standard mode, finished all but the ""Tofu"" (if you know, you know) extra game modes, and will probably hop on and give hardcore a try. 

The game is a bit tedious in the way that you must backtrack a lot (and often you need to ""rehearse"" how to clear certain areas), but the original RE2 was like this as well. Once you learn a few standard operating procedures regarding how to approach the gameplay, the game is a lot easier and more enjoyable. 

It definitely is a scary experience, especially the first time around! I highly recommend a play-through, and even if you only want to do the basic stuff, it's still worth the purchase price.

This game is the biggest reason I love Resident Evil. It is the most-classic modern zombie shooter ever made and not only the gameplay, every part of this game is just so good...

The environment is extremely iconic. It is amazing to explore through the RPD and gets even more satisfying after you unlock new parts of it.

The gameplay is amazing. Truly a great way to play Resident Evil, and Although I can tell that the inventory system is different and modern but it also feels incredibly nostalgic to me somehow. I'd say that it is satisfying as well; combining herbs and gun parts, organizing, storing...

The story is deep, truly a goosebump material. It is just a little confusing that there are minor conflicts between two stories, even when you play through it as A > B and not A > A (like intended) but I'm willing to ignore that given how incredible this game overall is. 

What wouldn't I give to play this game for the first time again...

If not then what do they know about zombie games, since they haven't played the two best zombie games in known universe. So perhaps that is all that needs to be written to show you what I think about this game. This is how a remastered version of a legendary game should look like. You can feel the care and emotions of developers. It has been some time since I played it, so here is how I remember it even now. 

It starts with a classic selection of characters. Leon or Jill. Then a road A or B. Every option is unique, I can assure you. In option B characters switch places and go via the road the other character did, in option A. There are bigger and smaller differences. I loved it since way back in the 90's. The road B is like a bonus game. Legendary police station is here again and it’s so great. You will be going thru the burning Racoon City. Streets filled with zombies, cars fill the streets, again at one point you need to run thru city bus to get thru blockade. But as all locations in the game, it is modified compared to old. I think I haven’t seen anything that was the same as in old game. As you progress thru the story, you will learn what is happening, why, what caused it. All clicks together pretty well. It makes nice connections to RE 1. Basically they were able to deliver the same game but it looks new, locations, items, some enemies, scripts, few mechanics, all is the same but a bit modified in a way that old fan like me is happy. Even the controls are better. Camera changed, but it is not FPV, it is hybrid that allows for surprises. That does not grant you full awareness and creates a space of horror. But overall I like it more than the old camera. Music sound and voices are great. Visuals and graphics as well. Controls too. 

Some examples of what you will encounter: be assured to experience all joys and stress as advertised. You will be running from zombies trying to conserve ammo. Or you will come to that story item only to learn that you shouldn’t have picked that ammo way back. Because your inventory is limited and now full. Then run zombie slalom to the nearest storage and back again. Jumpscares here and there. Some memorization or puzzle here and there. And other joyful moments. Nemesis is coming. Run. It is good that you can outrun him. In some areas you can even lose him. You will try to kill zombies with a knife, only to learn you need to practice so much for it to work that you rather switch to other weapons. And store the knife for the rest of the game. 

As you obtain better weapons, new enemies will be introduced. New routes will be created. Like some walls destroyed. Keys obtained to open new doors. Locations are so well crafted. They are labyrinths at first and as you are progressing thru story and open new rooms, there will be shortcuts created for you to lift off the need to go long ways. So it won't bore you. There are so many fine tunes in the game. Puzzles are just exact, not too hard, not too easy.
The game is an equilibrium of all the things inside. It makes a symphony with all the instruments it was given. I always loved the modifications to your weapons. They are here again and are great. I think even now they reload your weapon. They removed a few enemies from old and given as few new ones. For me the worst were the sewer enemies. I miss that new Nemesis is not murmuring “STARS” any more. 
Oh man how I love that all side characters are here and it is again done in such a great way. You still get to control them at some points.

This is a must have game for someone who likes Zombie games. And everyone who wants to throw this genre into trash should try 1 and 2 beforehand.",1702921756,1702928849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1662631622,1702906731,True,4,1,0.48185381293296814,0,True,False,False

This game was pretty fun to play through with all the 'Runs' you can do! I like how you can choose different characters and it'll change how the game plays and your puzzles too. Also the introduction of Leon and Ada to the series, at least to me so that's sweet.

HOWEVER. I have a complaint with this game, and that being how ranks are done. Yes, it's stupid to say, but I really dislike when game give you ranks based on how quick you finish the game instead of other factors like how many zombies you killed or whatever. I'm only mentioning this cause of one thing, Hardcore S+. 

Imagine having to speedrun through the game in less than 2 hours, only allowed to use 3 saves or less AND the only unlock you can use is any pistol you bought with real money or a infinite knife. You don't get much time to get resources and have to REALLY space out your saves, risking being sent all the way back if you get killed. That is the hell of RE 2 S+.
As of writing, I was able to S+ Inferno in RE 3, but not get S+ in hardcore in RE 2....so that gives you a hint of the difficulty then.

Enough ranting however, the game is wonderful and you should pick it up, possibly with the Extra DLC if you feel like giving extra to the developers.",1702696747,1702696747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original looks like complete garbage with it's outdated and clunky gameplay and awful graphics compared to this masterpiece of a remake. Ada Wong, Claire Redfield, and the other characters look way way better and more realistic and more expressive. The game is much more atmospheric and scary than the original. A more modern over the shoulder perspective third person shooter instead of the dumb fixed camera placements at random locations! The controls are way better and thank God this game does not use the terrible laser dot aiming mechanic but uses cross hairs yes! Please everyone go buy this game you will never regret it! Too bad the remake for it's sequel wasn't nearly as good. Although some of the cutscenes in Leon's portion felt cheesy and somewhat cringe. Claire's story is way better and she's just a better protagonist anyway. The guns sound way too muffled and quiet and don't do nearly enough damage so you'll end up wasting almost multiple magazines shooting into zombies head which seems to be based on an RNG system where I've only used one bullet to blow a hole through a zombie's brain which pisses me off! This game fixes everything that was bad about the original and even vastly improves upon them! The best game in the entire franchise!

I think this is my second favourite Resident Evil game, being able to have the zombies follow you between rooms changes the whole feel of the original and hearing Mr X's stomp in the next room is terrifying. If I had to rank the RE games i've played i'd put them in this order:

1.   RE 1 Remake
2.   RE 2 Remake
3.   RE 1
4.   RE 7: Biohazard
5.   RE 4
6.   RE 8 Village
7.   RE 2
8.   RE Code: Veronica
9.   RE 3
10. RE Zero 0
11. RE 5
12. RE 6
13. RE: Survivor

So as you can see I rate this above nearly all other games in the series, I haven't played the remakes of 3 or 4 yet though or revelations games and I can't decide where i'd rank the directors cut of original as the music wasn't as good.

It’s the best of the RE remakes I've played thus far and wholly outshines my most optimistic expectations. For me, this does supersede the original experience. While retro-purists might say otherwise, this just plays and looks so great that why would I ever go back? It’s an excellent retelling, a wonderful update, and a stellar game to re-experience all over again. A phenomenal remake that does far more than just adding a fresh coat of paint.

That said, Resident Evil 2 retains the vintage video game tension, requiring players to juggle inventory and battle through undead hordes in often difficult to navigate maps. The limited save opportunities has not gone away. Combat still provides a satisfying crunch with every shot - maybe even more so now than ever. And let's not forget TWO FULL CAMPAIGNS are included - which is still a bonkers amount of content. I admittedly only completed with Leon. Eventually, I'll come back to run the second.

Capcom has been killing it these past ~7 years. Ever since RE7 Biohazard, it's been almost nothing but gold. If you enjoy horror games in general, this is a must-play. The only crowd who might be let down are those who really enjoyed the B-movie charm and quality of the original. The voice acting and cut scenes are well done in this remake and lack the campyness that some might have hoped for. Myself?

Players have the opportunity to experience the game from two distinct perspectives, depending on which character they choose to play through first. This dual-playthrough approach not only adds depth to the narrative but also significantly enhances replay value, offering new challenges and nuances in each run.

The visuals in Resident Evil 2 Remastered are nothing short of remarkable. The game strikes a perfect balance, boasting modern, high-quality graphics that enhance the experience without overshadowing the classic feel of the original Resident Evil 2. The attention to detail in the game's environment, from the shadowy, foreboding corridors of the police station to the rain-soaked streets of Raccoon City, is truly immersive.

Mr. X simply stalks you relentlessly which does not work in an inventory management, back and forth to unlock game, constantly trying to learn your path and figure out the next thing to do type of game. Is he scary? No. Can he be stunned? Not really. Can he be stopped? No. IF this were a linear game, I could see being stalked and having to keep moving ahead as fast as possible but this is a constantly going back to where you started game. You waste so much time trying to dodge him or hide from him until he goes away just to have him show up 2 minutes later because you opened a few doors.

From the gripping atmosphere to the heart-pounding encounters, this game is a must-play for both long-time fans and newcomers to the series.

Claire Redfield:
Claire's journey through Raccoon City is nothing short of exceptional. Her character is brought to life with incredible attention to detail, and her unique perspective adds layers to the storyline. From the hair-raising encounters with zombies to the emotionally charged moments, Claire's arc is a testament to the game's narrative excellence.

Graphics and Sound:

Visually Stunning: The graphics are top-notch, bringing Raccoon City to life in gruesome detail. Character models, animations, and environmental effects contribute to an incredibly immersive experience.

Eerie Sound Design: The sound design deserves special mention. From the unsettling groans of zombies to the haunting score, every audio element adds to the overall horror experience.

Claire and Leon's Interconnected Stories:

Rich Storytelling: The intertwining narratives of Claire and Leon create a rich tapestry of storytelling. Choices made in one campaign impact the other, encouraging multiple playthroughs to uncover the full narrative.
Conclusion:
Resident Evil 2 Remake is a triumph in the survival horror genre. With its compelling characters, spine-chilling atmosphere, and polished gameplay mechanics, it stands as a shining example of what a remake can achieve when done with passion and respect for the source material.

A few moments got me, but I had tried playing RE7 prior to this and this was WAAAY more approachable for a horror wuss like me. 

Gameplay feels great, story is great. I played on controller and the aiming and controls felt smooth. Some nice quality of life features in this game to help with inventory management such as showing where items are on your map if you don't have space to pick them up right away. 

No spoilers here, but set your expectations appropriately for the ""Second Run"" playthrough that is unlocked after you finish the game. The game encourages you to play a ""Second Run"" playthrough as the other character to see their side of the story.  I thought it was going to be more different than it was, but it was like 95% of the same game. Still worth doing as there were some differences and you get an extended ending, but I just found myself a bit disappointed that it wasn't more different.

However, I personally believe that Remake 3 did a much better job a year later than Remake 2 in many ways. Nemesis from Remake 3 as an ""immortal enemy type"" is far superior to Mr. X, who is very annoying and too mechanical here. The variety of locations in Remake 2 pales in comparison to the levels in Remake 3 too.
And I'm definitely not a fan of the way Remake 2 handled two campaigns from the original, leaving them both too similar and contradictory to each other. What was acceptable in 1998 doesn't look so good in 2019.
So, once again, while I can't argue with the overall quality of Remake 2, I unfortunately can't praise the game either. And I'm a little sad about the criticism that Remake 3 received because I really think it's a much better game than Remake 2.",1701288166,1701288166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't know why it took me so long to play Resident Evil, but I'm glad I did now! Well, I played Resident Evil 2! I don't know if I want to play Resident Evil 1, but that's okay for me, i already know the lore from the first game! :) 

The story in Resident Evil 2 is magnificent and so catchy! I couldn't stop playing when I first started it honestly. I love that it's not full-on horror and most of it is action. 
It's really cool how you play the story and make some puzzles, then randomly Mester X shows up and chases you around while you do the rest of the story. He wasn't even scary or anything, it was just the fact I was being chased and scared he would catch up to me that was the horror part of the game.

The zombies and other monsters were also well made and placed perfectly random around the map to kinda jumpscare you. 
I loved the cutscenes, gave me a lot of beautiful screenshots! The game looks great :).
I've seen many people say they thought the game was too short, but honestly, I don't think so at all. I wouldn't mind it being longer but I'm happy enough about the 17 hours it took me to finish it!

Released in 2019, Resident Evil 2 Remake takes players back to Raccoon City with stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, and a renewed sense of terror, delivering an unforgettable survival horror experience.

From the outset, the game impresses with its exceptional graphics and attention to detail. The atmospheric lighting, highly detailed character models, and gruesome environments contribute to a visually stunning and immersive reimagining of the iconic locations from the original game. The switch to the over-the-shoulder third-person perspective enhances both the horror and the action elements, creating a more dynamic and engaging experience.

Resident Evil 2 Remake successfully captures the tension and dread that defined the survival horror genre. The revamped audio design, including hauntingly atmospheric music and spine-chilling sound effects, intensifies the sense of unease as players navigate the labyrinthine halls of the Raccoon City Police Department. The pacing is masterfully executed, with moments of quiet exploration building up to heart-pounding encounters with the nightmarish creatures that inhabit the city.

The narrative, while faithful to the core of the original game, benefits from expanded storytelling and character development. Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield are brought to life with convincing performances, and the intertwining campaigns offer players a fresh perspective on the unfolding nightmare. The addition of new subplots and twists adds depth to the overall narrative without losing the essence of the original storyline.

Gameplay mechanics have been modernized to cater to contemporary gaming expectations. The inventory system, puzzle designs, and combat controls have all received thoughtful updates. The strategic use of limited resources, the clever level design, and the relentless pursuit of terrifying enemies contribute to an experience that perfectly balances survival horror with moments of intense action.

The replay value is high, with multiple campaigns, unlockable content, and additional difficulty levels providing incentives for multiple playthroughs. The implementation of the ""Raccoon City Incident Report"" system encourages players to explore and master the game, offering a rewarding sense of accomplishment.

While Resident Evil 2 Remake is a near-perfect experience, some might argue that certain segments could be more challenging, and the absence of the original's live-action FMV sequences could be missed by nostalgic fans. However, these are minor concerns in the grand scope of an otherwise exceptional game.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a triumphant reimagining of a survival horror classic. It successfully blends modern gaming technology with the essence of the original, delivering a gripping, atmospheric, and unforgettable experience. Capcom's commitment to honoring the legacy of Resident Evil while pushing the series forward has resulted in a game that stands tall as one of the finest examples of survival horror in the gaming industry.",1701239103,1701239103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story captivates with its intense, suspenseful narrative, earning a solid 8 out of 10.

The gameplay is commendable, meriting a 7 out of 10.

I wish it were slow paced similar to it's original version and not RUSH through all areas because of the fear that you'll be fisted. Implementation with Ada and her super cool gadgets is unnecessary only to show how deeply she cares about being rescued by rookie cop who fell in love with her. To be completely honest i absolutely despise Ada as a character since re4 she is an overrated stereotype, milla jovovich parody, action element cliche. Whole love story plot twist is cheap bs with the same ejaculation in the endgame cinematics. Leon is being a simple guy in this remake and has a degree of intelligence inadequate to cope with anything complex or involving mental effort, when Claire's initial intentions were to find out her brother but ended up with saving privat Ryan. Relationship between Leon and Claire is shallow, banal : ""Hi I'm Leon, Hi I'm Claire, where are you going, don't go there, good to see you alive"", moreover i was disappointed finding out that their scenarios are absolutely not complementary, differences are other side of police station and a person to rescue out of dumpster. Final battle with William is repetitive and doesn't give any memorable moments, pretty much as Nemesis in re3 remake, to be honest all this wild mutations are pathetic, tired of shooting at that exact G spot. First mrX on my аss, then William, i came to the point that i got so exhausted of this neverending persuasion, even outlast wasn't so energy consuming. Zombies are extremly irritating to deal with, slow annoying biting animations, rubber bullets, constant ammo absence, yeah that is what RE series about, to feel no secure. Extra modes are dull and straightforward - overflown with enemies runs from A to B, you can't kill anyone or kick their butts, there is no point in this, mainly because of low ammo supplies, all you need to do is avoid damage till you make it, which is idiotic and deeply anxious, a 100x multiplied ultimate re2 experience. The 4th survivor ruined because of this stingy gameplay, i should've studied economics in order to manage this crаp inventory and items placement. I do appreciate environment, mood, animations, models, sound, cinematics, some parts of physics, small details, many things that Capcom done right to make this game shine, it's great for new era generation, i do understand ratings, direction taken, but i'm feeling odd about the game at the same time. In my opinion the conceptual peak of resident evil was ""RE: Outbreak and it's file#2"" right before they took progressive ultra action re4 direction which is implemented in this game in a bit subdued way. 20 years old game has more complex approach rather than we have here, with mechanics way too far ahead of it's time perfectly suitable for RE series, but who needs that forsaken s*hit, we got suspence, we got mrX and suspence from him, we have W.Birkin with more persuasive suspence and UNDYING ZOMBIE PLANTS wow, can you imagine how cool is that ?! Also RE engine, and another ace in the sleeve - ADA WONG and her gadgets. What we get - half baked remake with a lot of missing content compare to original game. If play this game without considering it's legacy - i guess it's alright then, at least Capcom does things, and not being Konami with thousands great games being held in hostage.",1701123657,1701125848,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was aware it fell into the survival horror genre, which isn't my usual preference. Despite knowing this, I gave it a shot due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the best decision.

So, unless you're a fan of horror games, approach with caution. It might not align with your preferences, and looking back, I wish I had thought twice before diving in.

The far-fetched plot, about Leon Scott Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who together discover a city full of zombies, is kept down to earth by clever scripting and gritty storytelling. [spoiler]It starts with your character surrounded by zombies - and all you have to defend yourself with is a gun and a small amount of bullets.[/spoiler] Afterwards, the story twists and turns, the monsters get meaner and more gruesome, and the movie atmosphere digs in deeper.

You can play [i][b]Resident Evil 2[/b][/i] as either Leon or Claire, and then, when completed you can play through it again as the other character. They have their own agenda, weapons and path through the story, albeit in a completely different way, all of which is set up in the impressive introductory sequence.

Graphically, [i][b]Resident Evil 2[/b][/i] is light years ahead of its predecessor - especially the animated zombies, which seem to proliferate in every darkened corner of the game and as if your blood pressure wasn't high enough, a sprinkling of deliriously scary set - pieces have been dropped into strategically positioned portions of the game. The overall presentation looks exceptionally good, particularly the visual effects that give a tense atmosphere and feeling of isolation. Special note must also be made of the eerie music and subtle sound effects, both of which add much to the mise-en-scène.

[i][b]Capcom[/b][/i] has created the computer gaming equivalent of the [i][b]George A. Romero[/b][/i] horror movie classic, [i][b]Day Of The Dead[/b][/i] - a concoction of dead-end scares and flesh-chewing shocks.",1680654186,1700618319,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Unlocking a new area, key, or defeating a boss always feels fresh in this game. The designers of the game had an appreciation for beauty especially in the statues, art, and details that went into this. The aesthetics are a kind of heightened Americana type that I wish the US was more like (consistently). The characters are attractive, especially the women such as Ada, which is something that Western games are not doing as well with lately. The story telling left me with nothing else to be desired. The romance was hot. The boss fights are enjoyable. The game has a bit too many puzzles imo, but those can also be rewarding to solve. I have criticisms of many of the puzzles however, especially because some are so convoluted and tedious to figure out on your own that it will have you relying on online sources. Nevertheless, it is a charming survival horror game. I thought it kind of like Dead Space game but in a contemporary setting, but of course, RE inspired that. It was difficult for me given the limited health, ammo, and time-consuming inventory management, so I bought the DLC because it's more fun to have an MP5 with infinite ammo. Would still suggest that route. The dark environments, jump scares, and powerful enemies still frightened me. I considered it scary so that's good horror in my book. If you're a trophy hunter, most of the trophies are fair and not too obscure. You can finish the game in under 10 hours, so it is a short game, but it does have decent replayability as another character. All in all, I would certainly suggest it.",1700479293,1700543759,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed both scenarios this game brings to the table, I feel this is what Resident Evil should be and that is what makes this game very special. Arguably, the Tyrant is my favourite stalker to this franchise. When I think of Resident Evil I think of the Tyrant. The atmosphere this game proposes has got to be some of the best I have ever seen. Not as good as Resident Evil Village's atmosphere but still fantastic. The special effects used and how the game plays out is incredible. Also, this never got boring. What I mean by this is the game did not feel rushed in anyway and adding unique segments that you can only discover if playing with either Leon or Claire. All in all, it is a brilliant Resident Evil. My second favourite Resident Evil without any hesitation. Furthermore, this was the first Resident Evil I played that got me into the franchise. Therefore, I am a fairly new player considering the first ever Resident Evil came out in 1996. But, I am glad I played it because now I enjoy the Franchise.

This is a brilliant example of a game that creates uneasiness not through jump scares, but through giving you limited resources, having to be smart and adapting to the fact you can't just shoot every zombie (because you'll run out of ammo when you need it) really added to the tension. There were certainly moments where the game really gives you an adrenaline rush (many moments), this game masterfully sets the tone and continues it throughout the game. The sound design is also amazing, I couldn't play this game at full volume and fully immerse as I'm a whimp.

I absolutely loved the layout in this game, the way that exploration and a keen eye is rewarded is second to none. There are many things that you can unlock throughout the game that give you additional weapons, bag slots, ammo and medication for survival, but only if you add pieces of a puzzle together when you pick items up, and go into other rooms in the police station and work out what those items relate to. It is completely worth exploring everything you can and working out each puzzle as the rewards are worth it almost every time (and advance the story/narrative throughout). 

I really enjoyed the story and the characters, it is well fleshed out and the moral forces involved are interesting to think about. Not to mention some of the other tragic themes. The game length & pacing for me was just about perfect, it was enough to give a cohesive story, and not make you just wonder when the game will finally end, it ends exactly when it should and is a thrilling experience.

Last but not least, the graphics, oh the graphics. They're amazing. Almost every enemy in this game is terrifying, and the use of darkness and your limited area covering flashlight just adds the cherry on the top. This game is a magnificent accomplishment by CAPCOM.

As a fan of the original, this remake is... acceptable. The gameplay and graphics are obviously modernized, and puzzles are honestly better than they were, but pretty much everything plot, character, and music related is a huge drop down.

The game gets the gameplay right which is what makes it worth playing. Hardcore is pleasantly difficult and tense your first couple times through. Exploring the map is fun, backtracking is never a chore.

The one thing that was ripe for improvement were the differences between the scenarios and making you feel as if the other character is somewhere on the map having their own adventure that also affects you. Instead, the story (within the same ""timeline"") both contradicts itself and repeats endlessly with absolutely nothing one character does affecting the other. There's enough material here for one and a half scenarios, not four. 

The writing is straight up bad. That's all I'll say about that because I don't want to go on a novel long series of tangents.

MUST PLAY HORROR GAME, MUST PLAY RESIDENT EVIL GAME.

RE2, along with the original Resident Evil are two of the best games in the series.

One of the best games in the series and in the genre. Great for newcomers and veterans of Resident Evil and horror in general. Graphics are about as high quality as it gets. Gameplay is phenomenal and the story is just so much fun. Only two complaints are that the enemies are practically unkillable even on the easiest difficulty settings and the movement, which is kind of important for dodging these unkillable enemies, is extremely quirky. Your character walks about as slow as a grandma on a walker even when a massive monster is trying to kill you and that can be extremely frustrating when you're trying your hardest not to get hit but your character just doesn't seem to care or want to move. Other than that, this game is so full of interesting moments, cool puzzles, great characters, great set-pieces and damn near perfect pacing. It is so much fun to play and even when you finish the game you're going to want to play it again almost immediately. It's that good.",1686131419,1699980581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a Resident Evil 2 REmake which features a graphical rebuild and changing of certain story elements to streamline game play. There are basically two ""stories"" that you can choose from, though the basic premise of the story is roughly the same: You can play as Leon Kennedy through the first day on the job of the Raccoon Police Department, or as Claire Redfield as she searches for her brother.

[h3][b]My Thoughts[/b][/h3]
This game has a very different vibe to the original Resident Evil 2, that's not necessarily a bad thing since even though the original was extremely well made, the controls, pacing, and fixed camera are not for everyone. This REmake does an exceptional job of bringing the game into the more modern era of gaming. I personally would have loved a dodge in the game, but that's just me being a little picky. 

The game looks beautiful, has some fun puzzle elements (though nothing quite like the first Resident Evil game with the bizarrely constructed manor), and introduces game play elements and features that provide a lot of quality of life improvement (being able to expand your inventory blessedly being one of them).

If you are a fan of the Resident Evil series for it's story telling, and you do not mind a shift in game play style to something that would be considered more action oriented, then this is a game that you will likely have a lot of fun playing. If you prefer the puzzle elements, tension, controls, and pacing of the original games then the changes they have made to modernize the game may not necessarily sit well with you. In my personal opinion, I think they game is amazing and definitely worth playing through. If price is a consideration, wait for the Steam sales that occur pretty often to pick it up, but the value for the money spent is there.

If you'd like to check out the begging of the game and a sample of what the actual game play will look like, I have a play through on my YouTube Gaming Channel. I will put a link to it below if you'd like to watch, below that I will also provide a link to the full playlist.  If you would be so kind as to subscribe to the channel (only if you're interested, of course) please do so, it will greatly help my channel grow.

This was my introduction to survival horror, and with no prior experience, the necessary strategy to get through it felt very different from other shooter games - having to be very frugal with ammunition, having no base melee weapon, deciding which enemies to kill and which to just avoid, etc. Was not as terrifying as I expected, but it did provide me with some scares here and there, which made for a good balance of keeping me on my feet sometimes while allowing me some peace of mind to calmly and confidently proceed. I felt like this game doesn`t break its own rules - for example, zombies will never follow you into a different room, and if you blow their heads off, they`re gone for good (which might I add, was a relief, because it allows you to clear some safe paths). Combat feels good, especially when using the shotgun, but the main character does not provide you with tight handling, forcing you to either clear your way beforehand or risk getting hurt if you try to evade the enemies, which I feel plays into the survival horror aspect. Took me around 10 hours to finish my first run. Liked the characters and environments.

Here's an extensive review of why this game is a must-play.

Visual Overhaul and Atmosphere:
The most immediately noticeable improvement in the ""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" is the visual upgrade. Utilizing the RE Engine, the game presents a darkly beautiful and terrifyingly realistic Raccoon City, with detailed environments, atmospheric lighting, and grotesquely lifelike zombies. The police station, the game's primary locale, is a character in itself, with its intricate architecture now fully realized in stunning high-definition, making the exploration both awe-inspiring and horrifying.

Gameplay Enhancements:
The remake abandons the original's fixed camera angles for a modern over-the-shoulder perspective, significantly updating the game's playability without sacrificing the claustrophobic feel that fans loved. This change, coupled with refined shooting mechanics, makes combat more engaging, and the need to conserve ammunition adds a strategic layer to every encounter.

Sound Design:
Sound plays a crucial role in establishing the game's chilling atmosphere. The moans of zombies, the echo of distant gunfire, and the character's footsteps reverberating through the halls create an immersive and nerve-wracking audio experience. The game's soundtrack is carefully used to enhance key moments, adding to the tension and release during gameplay.

Narrative and Dual Campaigns:
""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" features two parallel campaigns with protagonists Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, each offering a distinct storyline and unique gameplay experiences. This dual approach not only provides different perspectives on the outbreak but also increases replayability, as players uncover the full story by playing through both characters' eyes.

Survival Horror Elements:
True to the series' roots, the game emphasizes survival horror elements. Resource management is critical, with limited inventory space and scarce supplies forcing players to make tough decisions about what to carry. The puzzles, a staple of the original, return with a fresh twist, requiring players to explore and interact with their environment thoughtfully.

Enemy Variety and AI:
The zombies in ""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" are not the only threat. The game introduces a variety of enemies, each with unique behaviors and weaknesses, including the iconic and relentless Tyrant, known as Mr. X. The AI is unpredictable, making each playthrough a unique challenge.

Character Development:
The characters in the ""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" are more developed, with expanded backstories and motivations. Leon and Claire are more fleshed out, making players more invested in their survival and journey. The supporting cast also benefits from this attention to detail, adding depth to the game's narrative.

Modernized Controls and Interface:
The controls have been modernized, making the game more accessible to newcomers while remaining challenging enough for veterans. The user interface is sleek and intuitive, ensuring that players spend less time wrestling with menus and more time enjoying the gameplay.

Replayability:
Beyond the dual campaigns, ""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" offers unlockable modes, secrets, and difficulty levels that encourage multiple playthroughs. The game rewards exploration and mastery, enticing players to return to Raccoon City again and again.

In conclusion, the ""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" is a triumphant revival of a classic game. It captures the essence of the original while improving upon it in every way, from graphics to gameplay to story. The game manages to be both nostalgic and fresh, providing an experience that is accessible to newcomers and deeply satisfying for long-time fans. Whether you're looking for a terrifying horror experience, a challenging survival game, or simply a well-crafted story, ""Resident Evil 2 Remake"" delivers on all fronts and stands as a benchmark for how to do a video game remake right.",1699460931,1699460931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I then went on about a year long hiatus before going back and playing through them again, i loved them all the same. however, I was definitely in need of a new story, bought RE:4 VR and played through that, loved the game, story was amazing, was where i was introduced to my favorite RE character, Leon. as good as RE:7-8's and RE:4 VR is, i was ready for something new to me. Then last month during the Halloween sale i decided to pick up RE:2-3-4-5-6. i wanted to play through the games that i knew had more modern graphics (2-3-4 Remasters) and then the mildly dated RE:5-6. I picked up this game with an open mind because of the perspective change, and HOLY SH#T. this was one of the best games I've ever played. The story, the characters... Leon my Beloved. 

This game is scary, it feels like parts of the early season of the walking dead... however, cram a bunch of scary mutanty demon creatures ON TOP of the hordes of zombies. This game follows the same formula as every resident evil game, and does it FLAWLESSLY.

The art museum turned RPD is one of, if not the best location in gaming history, and although the later locations like the parking lot, sewers and laboratory are weaker, they're still fun. But goddamn it, I just couldn't get myself to enjoy the B stories.

It's not even the fact that they're super similar to the A stories like most people have a problem with. It's a specific thing they have set up in the B story that messes it up.

I like that fact that you start in a different, more difficult location with more difficult enemy placements and how you slowly open rooms in the RPD in a different order compared to the A story, but what completely messes it up is the early introduction of Mr. X.

In the A story, Mr. X is introduced at the perfect time and enhances the gameplay. He's introduced at a point where you're familiar with all the rooms in the RPD and have most of the RPD opened up, so whenever Mr. X does chase you, you have a lot of different paths you can take so that you can loop or lose Mr. X, or find the nearest safe room. It's fun because it's satisfying to remember your surroundings and come up with a plan on the fly that'll get this monster off of your tail.

In the B story, sure, you still remember the layout because of the A playthrough, but because Mr. X is introduced so early in the B story, you're at a point where you don't have a lot of rooms open, and therefore don't have any places to go to lose him. On top of this, because there's barely anywhere to go, Mr. X has a smaller search area to patrol, so he's gonna be finding you a lot more often. This usually leads to you leaving a safe room, trying to get to the room with the key item you need, finding Mr. X in your way, and because most rooms are locked up, you can't lose him, so you're forced to take a straight line backwards to the safe room you just left. You sit in the safe room until you can't hear his foot steps, you leave the safe room and try to get to the key item room again, but he finds you again, and it's back to the same safe room. Over. And over. And over again.

I get what they were going for. Introducing Mr. X earlier makes the game harder, and it makes sense to make the game harder because this is the B run, but this feels like, to me, artificial difficultly. It's not challenging, it's just plain frustrating. Maybe this isn't a problem with the game. Maybe I've just been super unlucky with how Mr. X patrols, but it doesn't feel that way to me.

I'm still gonna recommend the game because the A story is so good. Just know that most of the B story will be very frustrating to get through.

From the deafening silence that permeates every area of the game to the sudden thrashing of a zombie as they bash a door open to pursue you, the sound design does a spectacular job of immersing you in the environment, especially if you're using headphones with the proper settings enabled (Headphones mode + Binaural Audio). I seriously doubt that the game would've been as tense as it was if the sound design wasn't this well-done.

There are some parts of the game that could be improved further in future installments, namely the 2nd Run portion of the game that I found to be somewhat disappointing in terms of potential. Another nitpick would be that the boss battles can feel bullet spongy and a little tedious at times, which I guess is to be expected by playing on Hardcore.

Other than that however, this game excels in pretty much every area you'd expect a survival horror game to excel in. Note that since I haven't played the original, I can't really speak for how this remake compares. Despite that, I can definitely say that on its own, it's probably up there with the best that the modern survival horror genre can offer.

I would recommend playing on the Hardcore difficulty for a blind first playthrough, especially if you know you are capable of handling the changes it introduces. It's an experience that just can't be matched by a second playthrough on Hardcore, because like with Soulsborne games which rely on player knowledge for some of its difficulty, the first playthrough will almost always be where the most fun is had.",1561787609,1699075272,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

1. While there are enough differences between Leon [1st run] & Claire [2nd run] that you should play both, there aren't enough differences to justify playing Claire [1st run] & Leon [2nd run] on top of that, or vise versa. So if you're not keen on replaying the game, just choose 1 set & ignore the other. That being said, I did all versions of the scenarios multiple times over as I enjoy the gameplay.

2. Only buy the deluxe edition if you're interested in the costumes it provides or the soundtrack swap, the additional weapon is not worth it. The soundtrack swap in particular is a setting that must be toggled manually, otherwise it won't be present during your playthrough. Music comparisons are all subjective in nature, but there are some tracks that the remake does better (countdown sequences for both characters, 4th survivor), while some that better in the original, or in some cases only present in the original (Main hall, save rooms, library).

- Graphics. Really great, and performance is amazing.
- Env. design - no need to tell anything, this is what Capcom always does great.
- Plot, dialogues (Capcom always does it great)
- Claire
- Ada
What I didn't like:
- Map design. Pretty complicated for non-hardcore players, you need to go back to old locations a lot of times, there are a lot of non-obvious quests to unlock something and in combination with lack of ammo and re-spawning enemies is makes player stress a lot
- No close combat opportunities (like knife parry in RE4 and melee finishers in RE4). In combination with very limited ammo it is painful.
- Gameplay idea is that you can't and shouldn't kill most of enemies and this might be a good thing for hardcore players but it is pretty painful for players like me that struggle to orient on the map and like to slowly go and explore everything.

Overall - of course I recommend this game, if you are casual player I might recommend you to get the infinite ammo DLC and with that you can equip Gatling gun and kind of relax :)",1698582243,1698582243,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

In classic ones, there are no shops to buy or upgrade weapons; there are no boxes to break them and get loot; enemies won't drop loot items either, so there is no benefit to killing them, and you better run away as long as you can. There are no melee attacks, and you need to focus on saving ammunition, etc.

[b]Resident Evil 2[/b] is a remake of the 1998 classic that was released on the PlayStation. Fans had long been clamoring for a remake because while the original game was still enjoyable, both its graphics and gameplay had become outdated. The remake aimed to offer a fresh experience to both new and old fans of the Resident Evil franchise. Utilizing the same engine as Resident Evil 7, [b]Resident Evil 2[/b] attempted to recapture the essence of the original while providing modern visuals and maintaining its roots in survival horror.

In this game, players take on the roles of either Leon S. Kennedy on his first day as a police officer or Claire Redfield in search of her brother, both set within the Raccoon Police Station. [b]Resident Evil 2[/b] features two scenarios, denoted as A and B scenarios, which can be played by two different characters, resulting in a total of four campaigns that can be completed. While the story doesn't differ significantly based on the character you choose, the narrative is closely tied to the scenarios. It's enjoyable to see the different perspectives and interactions of the characters with their environment, and the canon story can be interpreted by the player, as the final outcome doesn't hold much bearing on the overarching story.

With [b]Resident Evil 2[/b], after venturing into more action-oriented gameplay in Resident Evil 4 and returning to old-school horror in Resident Evil 7, Capcom successfully recaptured the essence of what made the Resident Evil franchise memorable. The remake intensifies the experience compared to the original, especially with the introduction of Mr. X (T-00), a towering and relentless pursuer who chases you for a significant portion of the game, whereas in the original, he only appears in B scenarios. The zombies were also redesigned to be more in line with the original Resident Evil 2. Since Resident Evil 4, shooting zombies in the head has been the most effective method to eliminate them, and that still holds true in modern Resident Evil games. However, the remake adopts the classic approach from the original Resident Evil games where zombies are not easily dispatched, and headshots may lead to critical hits and instant kills, but occurs very rarely. It's often preferred to conserve ammo and avoiding unnecessary combat, particularly because Resident Evil 2 doesn't provide generous supplies like more recent entries. The horror element is maintained by the constant threat of Mr. X, zombies that are difficult to kill, and a scarcity of resources that require careful management.

[b]Resident Evil 2[/b] also incorporates puzzles and hidden items that players can discover. Solving these puzzles and finding hidden items provides valuable rewards, such as weapon upgrades or entirely new weapons. It's worth the effort to solve these puzzles since it allows you to experiment with different weapons. Notably, Leon and Claire have different sets of weapons, which prevents the game from becoming repetitive. Resources found in the environment often come in raw materials, allowing you to craft your preferred type of ammo or healing items. The return of the item box, a staple in the Resident Evil series, plays a crucial role in resource management, as you must save and conserve your limited supplies.

A noteworthy addition to combat in [b]Resident Evil 2[/b] is the use of the knife. While the knife has been an important weapon in various Resident Evil games, it plays a critical role in [b]Resident Evil 2[/b], particularly when dealing with zombie bites. The knife can be used to avoid damage and push zombies away, but it has limited durability and is quite rare to find. Once used, it can only be recovered by defeating the zombie that has it, which may require using additional ammo. This creates a balance between protecting yourself from zombie bites and conserving precious ammunition.

To the best of my recollection, [b]Resident Evil 2[/b] does not have any significant downsides. While Mr. X's presence can become more of an annoyance than a true threat as you become familiar with the game, he can also be avoided. The game may start to feel repetitive if you play it multiple times to complete both scenarios with different characters without taking breaks. At times, [b]Resident Evil 2[/b] might feel too similar to the original, to the point where it could be seen as a cash grab with minimal changes, but it's a well-deserved remake.

In summary, [b]Resident Evil 2[/b] is a solid remake of the original Resident Evil 2 (1998) that remains faithful to its roots. Players who are more accustomed to modern Resident Evil titles might struggle to adapt to the gameplay mechanics of [b]Resident Evil 2[/b], but it serves as a great entry point for understanding what made the Resident Evil series great in its early days.

Everything about the atmosphere, the music, the gameplay loop of scrounging for and preserving ammo and healing items is so freakin' immersive and just...fun.  Starting the B scenarios of each character with some background knowledge of the map layouts, it's a ton of fun to plan out routes for where to go and maximize what you're getting out of each trip out into the station.

I think my biggest gripe with the game is its near complete absence of a soundtrack, especially when the OSTs for the classic games are so beloved. After that it'd be that the A and B campaigns are clearly tacked-on afterthoughts that should've been left out, but hey, whatever. It's a fun game.

Having just finished the incredible RE4 remake I picked this game up again after dropping it a while ago, as the backtracking got a tad too much. After powering through the police station, the game flow becomes a lot smoother and overall an enjoyable, scary ride. But if RE4 is a 9/10, this is at max a 7/10 not just in story and flow, but also gameplay mechanics and variety. Started the Claire story and it's so far 90% the same. Not happy with that. RE4 with its Separate Ways DLC works way better in that regard. Overall a good game and definitely quite scary, can (not) recommed together with high doses of caffeine, very anxiety inducing :).

Resident Evil 2, my dear friends, is not just a game. It's an adrenaline shot straight to the heart, akin to a heroin rush for the thrill-seekers among us. It's like riding a rollercoaster that's on fire while juggling chainsaws and reciting Shakespeare backwards. It's intense, it's terrifying, and it's absolutely bloody brilliant!

The game is so good, it makes you question the very fabric of reality. You'll find yourself sitting in your underwear at 3 am, eyes bloodshot, heart pounding like a drum solo at a rock concert, screaming at zombies on your screen. And you'll love every second of it.

The graphics? Top-notch. The storyline? Engrossing. The characters? Well-developed. The zombies? Absolutely terrifying. The adrenaline rush? Constant and unyielding. It's like the game developers found a way to bottle pure excitement and inject it directly into your veins.

Now, I don't usually beg, but in this case, I'll make an exception. Give me all the awards! All of them! I want trophies, medals, certificates, ribbons! I want my name engraved on plaques! I want a parade in my honor! Why? Because I survived Resident Evil 2 and lived to tell the tale!

In conclusion, Resident Evil 2 is not just a game. It's an experience. It's a wild ride that will leave you breathless and begging for more. So strap in, hold on tight, and prepare for the ride of your life!

P.S.: If you find any typos in this review, remember: I've been dead for a while. Cut me some slack.",1697794774,1697794774,True,76,15,0.759670138359069824,0,True,False,False

- Good atmosphere
- Decent voice work
- Zombies and other enemies are good
- Puzzles aren't too easy or too hard and require a bit of thought
- Survival horror elements work as they should
- Game can get genuinely scary 
- Bonus content is good
- Layout of the RPD and other areas are nice
- New perspective is implemented well

Cons:
- Mr. X is scary at first, but eventually becomes a gigantic annoyance and pain in the ass
- 2nd run is implemented in the most lazy way possible and is a huge downgrade from the original
- The soundtrack from the original game is locked behind a paywall
- Music isn't as memorable, but does have the occasional track I remember from time to time
- Some scenes remain the same regardless of the character you pick on the 2nd run

Overall: While it does have some issues it still is a good remake and worth checking out.

With utterly spectacular graphics powered by the best engine of the last decade (also see DMC5 and SF6), RE2 delivers a compact and replayable loop of terror, tension, action and exhilaration. You pick between the male and the female protagonists, and try to survive in the spooky police precinct of the infested Raccoon City of 1998.

Perfected after two decades of practice, the Resident Evil formula delivers to the max. The plot is mercifully simple, the protagonist good-looking, and the action tense. Most of all, the atmosphere is one of gorgeous pervasive oppression and brooding menace. Best played in the dark, RE2 can genuinely get to you.

From a technical perspective, the RE engine never ceases to amaze. It runs great, loads fast, and the models and the lighting look terrific.

In terms of gameplay, you are back to basics polished to the max. You explore a tight space room by room, solving simple puzzles and shuddering before turning every corner.

Each of the two characters has two slightly tweaked scenarios. And if you complete all four versions of the game, you can try to beat the hardcore difficulty, or to get the ""S"" rating by speed-running. RE2 has something for everyone, from the casuals to the pros.

10/10 - a genuine masterpiece, highlighting both the cinematic potential of gaming as an art, and the sheer fun of carefully calibrated gameplay. If you had to play only one Resident Evil, this is probably the one.

This is the most painful thing I've ever had to write.
A Resident Evil 2 for the modern generation. Besides catering to modern gamers, and including the characters from the original game, I in no way see how this is supposed to be tailored to  long time fans. 
For clarification, the original Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation 1 is one of my favourite games of all time. I originally rented it and kept walking into the fire, or immediately getting eaten. I was ready to return it and chalk it up as garbage. But, I persisted, and soon, I was in the gun shop. I don't remember how far I got in the time I rented it, but a few months later, my dad bought me the game as a reward for finishing grade 8. I was now a bit more experienced with the game, and could basically make it to the police station without even firing a shot. I was immersed in finding all the secrets, and played through the ""entire"" game in one sitting (Leon mode A + Claire mode B). I was hooked. I played it so much that I even managed to beat the bonus modes with Hunk and Tofu. I still have a copy on my PS3 and play it from time to time.
When I heard it was getting a remake that was supposed to be like a love letter to the fans of the original, I even shed a tear of joy watching the original announcement trailer. Now after playing it, I feel like an idiot for that. I realise now that I would simply be far happier with a remastered version of Resident Evil 2 with some updated graphics. Resident Evil 2 Remake isn't what I asked for, nor is it something that I ever wanted.
I hate it so much that I haven't even played the remake of one of my other favourite games, Final Fantasy 7, because I'm horrified of what they may have done to it (the amount of attention to detail about Cloud being in a dress already tells me enough).
This game is Resident Evil 2 in the characters and story only. Saying you've played Resident Evil 2 and have never played the original is like saying you've eaten a hamburger, so you know what steak tastes like.
I'm not just saying this is a bad remake. I'm saying this is a bad game.
- The moment that I really began to despise this game is in the police station when, after walking through a wide open shutter into the main hall area, several zombies refused to follow me, merely losing interest and turning around before wandering off in the other direction. This is the kind of asinine disregard for detail that completely breaks immersion, and would have never cut it in the original. Resident Evil 2 may have had chunky graphics and tank controls, but it made up with it in originality and  paying extreme attention to details, like never doing stupid shit such as this.
And those terrifying Lickers? Stand in a doorway. Open the door, shoot them, back up. Door closes, Licker leaves. Repeat. Ohhh, so fucking scary. Fucking horse shit is what it actually is. Of course you could retreat through a door in the original, but you knew when you immediately went through again, those enemies were generally there waiting for you. In this pos the Licker retreats to his default position every single time seconds after it breaks line of sight with you. I get that you're supposed to sneak past them, but this rarely works, and it's stupid.
 - No game mode B. The single greatest part of Resident Evil 2 for me was beating the game and then knowing it wasn't over. You now got to see the entire game from the perspective the other character would have seen it from - and then could repeat the entire process by playing the discs in the other order, meaning to REALLY beat the game, you had to complete it four times, and it was unique each time. This was an amazing idea and that attention to detail is what made the game great to me. It was unique, something RE2 Remake can't claim in any way, shape or form. Besides looking good, RE2 Remake borrows elements from every existing game imaginable, and refuses to do anything unique or groundbreaking. Hell, it refuses to even pay homage to the game play of the originals. It just wants to be it's own thing, which seems to be great for lots of people, but I hate it. I at least had hopes that they would add this mode as a dlc or something, but they clearly have no intention of doing that.
- I hate defensive items and you're constantly forced to micro-manage defensive items. I don't even bother with the knives or barricades, they just take up inventory space and are more annoying than useful. Because, you know, it makes perfect sense that a knife or a 9 v. battery should take up the same amount of space as, say, a SHOTGUN or a PILE OF FUCKING 2x4s!!
- Zombies magically re-spawn in sealed rooms with no explanation or possible way they could have gotten in there. This is compounded by the fact that, even though a ""normal"" zombie (in theory) should drop from one head shot, apparently everyone in Raccoon City has steel fucking plates in their heads, because they take upwards of 7+ shots to the face and still get back up. This bs, with the defensive objects, makes going through every area annoying as fucking hell, because if you use up all of your consumables, you've basically locked your game and need to restart. 
- I played through this originally until I got to Ada and her hacking tool, and I just couldn't do it any more after that. I decided to restart the game and give it another chance because people won't shut up about how good it is, plus I put aside all of my expectations for it to even hold a tribute candle to the original, but no, it still sucks.
From the goofy trash that was ""Welcome to Raccoon City"" to this, my fond childhood memories of Resident Evil are now heavily tarnished. I'm extremely happy that I at least own the Resident Evil 2 board game and all of the expansions because they are a far greater homage to Resident Evil 2 than Resident Evil 2 Remake is.
Like most things these days, all of the emphasis and importance is placed on aesthetic glitz and flash, and hardly any substance. More time was spent figuring out how to monetise outfits then was actually used making sure that hardcore fans would be happy.

You have two characters to choose from, both with two scenarios, multiple added scenarios with different characters to see other perspectives in Raccoon City during the outbreak, a couple of goofy things to try like playing as a piece of tofu, and a good amount of content to unlock like a model viewer and concept art. 

The assisted mode is also nice for total wimps like me who just want to kill everything to clear out the horror side of things and make it more of an exploration game, so outside of the threat of Mr. X, I got to experience RE2 in a way that I had a lot of fun with.

If you don’t know who Mr. X is – he’s an invincible stalker wearing a fedora and a trenchoat who follows you around menacingly, and somehow he’s a mixture of scary and amusing. I think it’s because big monsters wearing fedoras just look goofy more than anything else, but then he catches you and slams his fist straight into your dome… but then you run into a safe room and he just stares at you before shrugging and walking away.

Graphics in this game are gorgeous to look at, the RE engine does wonders and really makes the game feel so lived in and realistic with character models and the environments. 
Gameplay is pretty good, and I think they did a really good job modernising the feel of the game.

I am writing this review after completing Leon Kennedy's Story, and it is great.

This game is unusually short compared to the other 3 games I've played (RE7, VILLAGE, RE1) but it doesn't suffer from it. Resident Evil games aren't known to be crazy long, but always have lots of detail & polish in them, and RE2 is no different. The environments & the detail within them are all great! I have my own personal favorite & least favorite areas in the game, but I won't be naming them to not spoil any of them for you. All of them are good though, I didn't hate any of the areas!

I've never personally played the original Resident Evil 2. I'm actually a newcomer to the series, & this was my 4th game in my ""Resident Evil Journey""! So, I don't exactly have any comparisons between REmake & original. I've heard that the REmake is very faithful to the original though, but cannot confirm or deny.

Resident Evil 2's main 2 characters are very good. I played as Leon in my playthrough, & he is great! This game really makes you love him. Claire Redfield doesn't appear very much in Leon's story, so I can't speak much of her, but from the little she is in, she is cool as well!
No matter which character you choose to play in your first run, I highly recommend you either play a second run as the other character, or watch a playthrough of the other characters story. I personally am watching one as I am trying to continue my RE journey quickly (mainly to be done before RESIDENT EVIL 4 REmake is out!) so I want to play RESIDENT EVIL 3 ASAP, but I will most likely be returning to this game later on to play as Claire myself.

Overall, RE2 REmake is a great game, the shorter playtime is more than made up for with the great environments & the detail within them, and also the fact that there is 2 different stories to play through means that the game is twice as long as it first is, even if your second playthrough is most of the same areas.
Unfortunately I am unable to compare this game to it's original iteration from all those years ago, but I have heard it is faithful to the original, so I would hope that is true.

Next up is RE3!

Though I never played the original RE2, I have heard this kept the spirit of the game alive while bringing it up to the modern standards of a survival horror game. The over the shoulder view, atmosphere, sound design, and set pieces make this a truly terrifying experience. It's not even the ""jump scare"" moments but the anxiety you get waiting for something to happen. It kept me on my toes the entire time. This game kept the puzzles alive as well, which was fun and a nice break from the action. The enemies felt for more varied than the first two games (RE1 and RE0), which was nice. The boss fights were not overly complicated and changed up the mechanics each time which was nice. It kept things feeling fresh. The overall combat just felt really good. Ammo, while not completely scarce, was limited and made you think about how to tackle each encounter which I really enjoyed. 

I played entirely on Steam Deck and it played flawlessly. I had it set to high/medium mix graphics, and locked it to 40fps and 40hz refresh rate. It took me a little under 12.5 hours to complete.

Graphics

This game has some of the best real-time cutscenes I've ever seen, and some insane detail. The gore is very graphic too. One minor complaint though: the use of screen-space reflections. Turn those off

Gameplay

Gameplay feels like an improved version of Resident Evil 4, with updated controls. I enjoy the mechanic of zombies being nearly impossible to kill, and having to learn to exploit i-frames to beat them. G-Mutants and Ivies are also cool. Lickers are cool if they aren't alone, but if they are, they feel trivial to beat. Mr. X is awesome with how he pursues you unscripted, but sadly he can be easily cheesed. The interconnectedness is another great mechanic, allowing you to explore for optional loot. Bossfights are the biggest highlight, my favorite probably being the Super Tyrant. It feels awesome to dodge or stun him by the skin of my teeth 

Audio

The audio is nice, each enemy has a distinct battle-cry, so you always know how to approach a situation. All the characters have great voice acting. The soundtrack is somewhat lacking, but the highs are high. Mr X's theme feels like that of impending doom. And the lab escape theme (for both Leon and Claire) is also pretty intense. The Super Tyrant theme is the best in my opinion, helping make the boss feel like an epic battle. The credits song is also really good, feeling faithful to 90s grunge

Downsides

There is a severe lack of variety between Leon and Claire and the A and B scenarios. There's some change at the police station in the B scenarios, but then it falls flat. Also, the ending feels out of place? Like Sherry saw both her parents die, and then goes on about getting adopted and buying pets. Weird. There was also no buildup to Code Veronica or RE4 either. Not sure if the former is going to get remade, but the latter was. Anyways, these issues still aren't the end of the world, just a bummer",1690050901,1695758851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay in RE2 is classic survival horror where you need to explore the map and get key items to progress all the while trying to conserve the limited supplies you have.

so if you're on the fence about getting i'd say just get it. i've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it so far and am trying for all of the records, which is saying something because i don't often do that. i hope you enjoy this game as much as i have.

update: so oh boy have i logged a lot more hours. i was loving the game at the time of my original review just replaying it over and over. since then i have tried modding (so much fun), and then i took a massive leap into an area i had never gone before. i started playing the game faster and faster, i was chasing an S+ rank. normally i dont give a damn about rankings in games but something about RE2R has me going crazy to fill out that rank table, i already was loving the game a lot and mods were making me come back to it but holy hell doing such a demanding run of a game like this is not only rewarding but incredibly addicting, getting my first S+ was awesome the second was just as good. finally turned to hardcore so i could do it again there and oh boy was i surprised. they made hardcore  a genuine challenge, saving is not an issue at all but man they properly balanced it to be hard, it's not just the usual ""enemies have more health and do more damage"", they actually changed item spawns a bit and even took away some items (devious but fun). also yes i got an S+ on hardcore, planning to do it again, and again, and so many more times after. polishing up an already good run is an itch that this game both causes in me and scratches all at once. never before have i cared about ranks but this game changed that. if you've already played it a bit go for an S+ run or try hardcore, the major differences to how you can play the game almost makes it the definitive way to play",1591665607,1695362173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw the ending twice. 
(Leon A Claire B)

1. Leon and Claire's story doesn't really connect.
I can't feel the fun of the story that connects. 
It would have been better if the two stories continued more.

2. The character's movement is slow, and the action is low.
Adding more action is unlikely to reduce the sense of fear.

3. The enemy has a lot of energy. Should have had similar energy to the original. 
There's not much fun in killing enemies.

4. I've omitted the story enough to omitting them.
There aren't many useless stories. To put it badly, there is a lack of story.
I guess. I would have deleted the story to control the amount, 
to keep the play from getting boring.

5. It's just annoying to have a chaser.
It's not very scary, it just interferes with the game.

I know Resident Evil games have been done-to-death.  There have been many sequels, prequels, spin-offs, movies, TV series, VR simulators, and walking simulators of it over the years (Resident Evil: Survivor).  And it's easy for one to think ""stupid Capcom doesn't need any more money- it's all the same crap"". That IS true for some Resident Evil sequels- some of them ARE crap part 5 for example.  You're in Africa and you play as Chris Redfield: The Lamest Protagonist Ever.  Sheva is surprisingly more interesting.  ""Chris are you okay?  You gotta be careful!"" ""Chris are you okay?  You gotta be careful!"" God Sheva SHUT UP.  Where are the zombies?  I'm fighting mutated tribesman?  The final boss is Albert Wesker?  This game did not age well.  (Part 5 remake is gonna suck a**)

But in 2018 when Capcom announced that a Resident Evil 2 remake was in the works I was f****** STOKED.  

It's been out for 4 years now and I still play this like once a week.  Now that's re-playability.

The roadmap for this remake was already laid out for the developers (the 1998 game was a masterpiece).  Guns, chicks, rookie cops, zombies, viruses, mutants, resource management, the london symphony orchestra- all a blueprint for what could be the greatest remake in the history of remakes.  All they had to do was pull it off.

At a time when games are abysmally woke, unfinished, buggy, pay-to-win, and straight up greedy, here comes Resident Evil 2 remake to PULL DOWN THEIR PANTS AND S*** ON ALL OF THEM!

First off, it's extremely well-balanced.  The game is generous enough to give you exactly what you need, but not so much that it's boring because it will IMMEDIATELY challenge you with those said items.  Some kind of built-in AI that actively adjusts the difficulty by analyzing what you have.  This dynamically changes your run, and will force you to adapt.  And when it sees you're getting too much help- it throws you a curveball.

Playthrough after playthrough I've found that every interaction is different.  Sure monsters may appear in the same room as last time, but no two interactions are the same.  Repetitive but not tedious.  Difficult but not impossible.  

Resident Evil 2 differs from other survival horrors in that it actively changes.  It's also fair- it only punishes you when you do something stupid.  It doesn't punish you for no f****** reason like the Amnesia series games.

Maybe you'll play the classic 1st Scenario: all guns all items readily available and playthrough is reminiscent of your memories of the game as a kid, instinctively running down those corridors trying to remember what you did back then.

Maybe you want to go asymmetrical and play the 2nd Scenario: all item locations have been juxtaposed and Mr X keeps the adrenaline pumping as you literally have no time to manage your inventory.  GET OUT OF THE DAMN WAY!  I love it.

The story stays true to the original, it's exactly the same.  I mean EXACTLY like it even takes place in 1998.  That's good: I hate when they try to modernize the media to appeal to a younger audience. The younger audience is stupid.  The younger audience plays GTA V.  The younger audience doesn't know their a** from a hole in the ground.  But developers ALWAYS cave and thus ALWAYS butcher the legacy game to appeal to the younger audience, because they know these youngsters will throw money at it if it features Ariana Grande as the soundtrack.  If the in-game characters use TikTok.  If the main protagonist has a vag***.  (Hey I'm all for female protagonists don't get me wrong- I love me some ladies.  But it become extremely tiresome though because the women are always social justice warriors).  Claire is not a social justice warrior (thank God), she's just a lost chick trying to find her brother. 

The problem is when you modernize the remake too much it doesn't stay true to the original media.  It becomes a different animal.  You end up with a sh**y movie called ""The Departed"" where all the gangsters have cell phones and whack eachother in-between phone calls.  Maybe I'm rambling but you can't always expect a franchise to change their core product just to appeal to the stupid minority.

And fortunately, that's NOT the case with this installment.  

The only thing that HAS changed, and for the better I'm sure most players would agree, is the fixed camera angles.  They completely ditched the fixed camera angles and went full-on Dead Space 3rd-person perspective.  For it's time the fixed camera angles worked- but it's not appropriate for the 2019 remake.  With better tech comes the potential for better gameplay.  They saw an opportunity and they took it.  So the fixed-camera angles were layed to rest.

Some would argue ""it's not the same game then"".  True, but tell me this: have you played Resident Evil 1 remake?  It's boring as f*** am I right?  They kept the fixed camera angles in that game and it completely ruined it!  Slowed the entire pace of the game, those door animations are so tedious to watch OMFG just kill me now.  I'm falling asleep over here.

They've also added ""Challenge Modes"" that weren't in the original game: Reach the end of the map playing as various NPC's from the base game.  It's basically an obstacle course.  Super difficult.  Complete these missions and you unlock rewards like infinite ammo and character accessories. 

I could go on for days but to keep it brief Resident Evil 2 remake is a schematic for everything a good remake SHOULD be.  They covered all the bases.  Left nothing to be desired.  This game has everything.  It leaves you feeling full.  Like you just ate a steak dinner with a glass of fine wine.

Besides that, I've avoided the genre completely. That is, until I started catching onto how the Resident Evil franchise was praised. Friends and coworkers alike recommended it. 
  Long story short, I have 13 hours of playtime so obviously, I was intrigued by the story. The gameplay was confusing at first because again, I had never played a horror game. Overtime though, it was increasingly easy to navigate everything. The only thing annoying to me was ""the big guy"" as I like to call him. There were genuine times where I needed to pause the game to calm down, especially with him on screen.

Honestly I don't have much to say other than if you're at all interested in this series or just want a relatively good survival horror game, this is a pretty good pick.

The environments are gorgeous, and level designs is pretty solid overall, especially with how it encourages backtracking, the 2nd Story/NG+ approach actually made me want to replay the game even if it didn't change too much.

[h1]Really the only thing I'll complain about here are the bosses[/h1]
These devolve into boring matches where you just start kiting them around.
They're repetitive, annoying and overall I just didn't have much fun with them.

[h1]Besides that, it's pretty good[/h1]

Leon and Claire still have separate stories, but it’s not like in the original.
Still a solid 9/10 for me and one of my favorite Games.

Resident Evil 2 is the prime exampel of what remakes should be all about. In general i don't specially appreciate remakes of old games i much more prefer remastering old games. Because that is to give a something old a new coat of paint while retaining the original aesthetics, gameplay and in general how people remembered it. While a remake can easily become a whole different game but in the case of Capcom remaking Resident Evil 2 i approve of the result. 

The game has great story that step-by-step lures to into the horror of Raccoon City. It delivers a horrifying atmosphere that are worthy of all my praise. The very first encounter with Mr. X is something i found very scary and intimidating. Ammo scarcity, crafting, sneaky zombies lurking in the dark adds so much to the overall feeling of this survival horror masterpiece. Aesthetics, atmosphere, gameplay, graphics and sound are masterfully put together which combined creates a modern classic that will be an benchmark if you want to remake a game.

Before sharing my opinion on the game, I feel like it is imperative for me to share that I have never played any Resident Evil game before. Basically Resident Evil 2 Remake is my first time playing a Resident Evil series and to be honest it made me quite interested in the series. The game follows the story of Leon & Claire in Raccoon City after the city has been engulfed by a deadly virus which turns most residents into zombies. 

[h3]The Positive[/h3]
The gameplay is generally quite linear which isn't to say that it isn't hard but it depends on the difficulty you play on. Hardcore will be harder as it name implies with harder hitting enemy and lesser resources to be found. Mr. X or Tyrant depending on how you refer him will also chase faster. Now, I really like Mr. X, it adds another layer to the game as you can't linger on an area for too long as he will come looking for you. He is a menace, he will still find you wherever you are and especially if you are Leon. During my gameplay for both Leon & Claire, I can feel that he chases Claire less often. Is this some sexism from Mr. X? Glad it's 1998 and not 2023, otherwise he would already be cancelled. Jokes aside, I really liked him. The puzzles aren't overly complicated nor is it overly simplified. For me it's just as balance as it can get. Honestly, the story is pretty normal but it isn't bad by any means and I had fun playing the game. The overall gameplay is relatively short and most of my time is spend running or hiding from Señor X. There's also bonus content which you can play after you have completed the main game, I think the additional content is definitely worth checking out. Throughout my gameplay, I didn't really have anything bad to say about it. I really find it enjoyable.

[h3]The Game Design[/h3]
Despite the game being almost 5 years old, the graphics still holds up quite good. From modelling all the way to it's environment and texture, it really is remarkable how well it looked. I really appreciate that they redesigned Claire's outfit, I think this new looks definitely fits her better. The graphic isn't as demanding as it's newer releases and honestly I think it will work great even with a 6GB card unless you are the type of person that cranks every settings to ultra. The addition of Ray Tracing honestly did little to nothing to enhance the graphic. I for one believe it looks good as it is. On to the voice acting and environment sounds, I believe the team did a great job. For the music, there's really nothing much to be add, it fits well and overall I really liked it.

[h3]Overall[/h3]
To conclude, I definitely enjoy the game as a whole. Rarely if ever encountered any bugs and the game works really well. I think Capcom did a fantastic job with this remake, hope we'll get to see more from them. Honestly, I think the game is definitely worth the asking price if you are a fan of Resident Evil game and even if you aren't, I think this will be a good game to start from.",1693057271,1693057322,True,15,0,0.645712018013000488,0,True,False,False

Next install a load of non rt mods like supergirl  in thigh high boots  and play again. it hugely fun to play as supergirl or an anime character, theses mods add lots of replay to the game.

Resident Evil 2 offers the player a choice between two characters at the beginning of the game. Both characters (Leon and Claire) have a similar campaign, but there are some differences which make the game worth completing twice. The story takes place in zombie-infested Raccoon City, shortly after the events from the first Resident Evil game. Like in any true survival horror, your main goal is to survive while struggling to make every bullet count.
It's quite obvious right from the bat that this is a remake of the highest quality. The graphics and visual effects are truly outstanding and every movement seems natural and smooth. I don't think I've ever seen more ""realistic"" zombies in any game or even a movie. The music and sound effects are also impressive, on par with the graphics. Despite using dynamic camera, the game still manages to capture the characteristic creepy atmosphere from the original. Some new mechanics have been introduced (like the ability to board up the windows) and they blend in pretty nicely. Although you can find a variety of weapons and ways to upgrade them, you'll always be short on ammunition. This creates a feeling of constant dread in the player and makes the game incredibly interesting. The storyline is very engaging and I've often found myself chained to the chair, unable to stop playing. There are also a couple of bonus game modes which unlock after finishing the main storyline, but nothing notable story-wise. Incredibly, I didn't notice a single bug during both of my playthroughs - my respect to the developers. My only remark would be aimed at the boss fights, which are fairly scripted and sometimes tend to be annoying. I'd also like to see more story-oriented content added, but that would probably be an overkill.
I had high expectations, but this remake is really excellent. Hands down one of the best horror games ever made.

I've played the original, and I get where people are coming from when they say it's not exactly like the old version. But honestly, I think this game kicks it up a notch. The only bit that's a bit meh is the A/B scenarios – they could've done those better.

When it comes to the story, they've kept it mostly the same whether you pick Leon or Claire. Back in the day, playing A/B or Leon/Clair would give you totally different stuff happening. But even with that comparison aside, this game is seriously amazing.

Now, the highlight for sure is Mr. X. That guy is a total game-changer. He stalks you non-stop, amping up the tension big time. On hardcore mode, where resources are scarcer than ever, you've got to think hard about dodging him 'cause if he shows up with a bunch of zombies or lickers, it's pretty much game over.

On the flip side, the sewer part is a letdown in my book. I'm so done with sewer levels – they're just plain boring. But the lab part, now that's something different. The whole clean and sleek vibe is a fresh take compared to the usual grimy labs. And that boss fight with Birkin in the lab – that's the good stuff right there.

All the boss fights in this game are a blast, although I kinda miss the old Birkin design. It was cool seeing him change between fights in the original, especially his final dog form – that was something. In this version, his last form is just this blob thing on a train, and you're basically unloading everything you've got on it.

To wrap it up, this game rocks the Resident Evil series in a big way. Sure, it's got some differences from the OG, but honestly, they've made it better in many aspects. Mr. X amps up the fear factor, and even though the A/B stuff could've been spiced up, the game as a whole is seriously impressive. Just ignore the sewer part, enjoy the sleek lab, and relish the awesome boss fights.",1692326041,1692642063,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[h2]Positives:[/h2]

[b]Stunning Graphics:[/b] The visual fidelity of Resident Evil 2 Remake is exceptional. The attention to detail in the environment, character models, and lighting makes the game incredibly immersive.

[b]Atmospheric Sound Design:[/b] The audio design enhances the horror experience, from the eerie footsteps to the subtle groans of zombies. It adds depth to the game's atmosphere and keeps you on edge.

[b]Nostalgic Remake:[/b] The game does an excellent job of modernizing the classic while preserving the core elements that made the original Resident Evil 2 a fan-favorite. It's a nostalgic trip for long-time fans while being accessible to newcomers.

[b]Two Perspectives:[/b] Playing through both Leon and Claire's campaigns offers a fresh perspective on the events in Raccoon City. It adds replay value and encourages multiple playthroughs.

[b]Tense Survival Horror:[/b] The limited resources and the ever-present threat of Mr. X create a tense atmosphere that keeps you on your toes. Managing your ammo and health becomes a crucial aspect of the gameplay.

[b]Level Design:[/b] The intricate level design of the Raccoon City Police Department and other areas makes exploration rewarding. Finding shortcuts and hidden items adds to the sense of discovery.

[b]Strong Character Development:[/b] Leon and Claire are well-developed characters with their own motivations. Their interactions with other survivors and the unfolding story create emotional investment.

[h2]Areas for Improvement:[/h2]

[b]Limited Interactions:[/b] Despite Claire and Leon sharing similar paths, the game misses an opportunity for more meaningful interactions between them. Enhanced dialogue and collaboration could have added depth to their relationship and the overall narrative.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]

Resident Evil 2 Remake successfully captures the essence of the original while delivering a modernized and engaging survival horror experience. The visuals, audio design, and nostalgic elements create a truly immersive journey through Raccoon City. While the occasional bullet sponge enemy is a minor drawback and the limited interaction between Claire and Leon is noticeable, these do not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment. Fans of the series and newcomers alike will find Resident Evil 2 Remake to be a must-play title that offers both tense gameplay and a trip down memory lane. With its compelling story, well-designed puzzles, and thrilling survival horror gameplay, Resident Evil 2 Remake earns a solid 9/10 rating.

Some Tips:

Don't hammer your A button after dying. The game might occasionally ask you if you'd like to switch to 'easy' mode. Once you said Yes there is no turning back to a harder difficutly, from what I have read so far (except by reloading).

Do yourself a favour and play with a controller, on a big screen (or close to your computer screen) and without alcohol.",1591548802,1691924534,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly I like the story and characters. The RPD is now terrifying and even more so with Mr. X roaming the halls...(too bad this couldn't be done with Nemesis in RE3...come on Capcom). The sense of dread is very present throughout this game as you fight your way to finding out what happened and how to escape the nightmare.

One thing I think hinders this game is the fact it follows the OG too closely. Mostly in terms of size and story as it could've been expanded on (same with RE3).

When you shoot them and they fall to the floor, you have to ""kill"" them like 4 more times so they are dead for good.

Long version: I haven't played the original, so I was coming into this unbiased. I was immediately drawn in by the incredibly immersive, well paced start of the game, with the terrific ambiance of the zombie attacked building; I will give credit where credit is due, this game did an amazing job in the ambiance, I felt more immersed and stressed than I did in Dead Space or in TLOU. But then, unfortunately, the gameplay happened. 

Everything about it is illogical and poorly implemented - starting from the fact that apparently shooting a zombie in the eye, into the brain, from point-blank range 4 consecutive times is not effective enough to kill it, coming through a couple of unnecessary ""ticking clocks"" in some situations (a big, unkillable enemy teleporting out of nowhere in a room next to you and chasing you is not a way to make the haunting atmosphere more intense, it's a way for me to uninstall in laughter at the bad design) and all the way through ALL THE RIDICULOUS PUZZLES. And they are ridiculous. 

Don't take me wrong, a well implemented, rational puzzle is a good way to provide a much needed smoothness in the pacing of a game of this kind, give some breathing room, but the puzzle must have the semblance of sense to not break any illusion of verisimilitude. Why are there multiple doors with different pretty symbols in a damn police station? How does a badge get into a bejewelled box unlocked through a crystal on a scepter held by a statue that is missing its left hand? Why do I need a knife to just remove some half-assed duct tape off a board? Why do I need to get a damn card to open a garage door to get out when literally any window would have the same function? 

This also kinda swings back to another weaksauce point, which is the plot - it's nonsensical, and any attempts to justify puzzles using the plot as an excuse somehow make both of them worse. The dialogue is cringy and unnatural. 

I really cannot stress how great the atmosphere is, and as such how tremendously worse every other aspect of the game is to manage to completely ruin that.

P.S. I could also write an essay on all the QoL improvements that are supposed to be in any modern game worth even a single buck, like a free saving system and inventory space that isn't convoluted for the sake of being convoluted, but I feel like I already overspent by buying this on a deep sale and don't want to feel like I am wasting something further on the game by writing more. But I could. 

P.S.S. After finishing the game (I.e. true ending, B run with the other character)so I can kinda feel like I am making my money's worth, no, I don't want to change my review one bit. If anything, my opinion of it is worse, there was nothing redeeming about the second run and the ""different perspective"" as elements that made no sense to repeat themselves repeated themselves, and everything annoying I stressed above was actually even more underlined. I don't know which is the best 3rd person action horror game, but this is definitely not even close to being there.",1691074338,1691329112,False,1,0,0.444943815469741821,0,True,False,False

I played this game with a person that I will never be able to explain to anyone. I always try to talk about things and express myself regarding them, yet this person has been able to make me feel things I thought were impossible. I will never forget these memories. If you are reading this, thank you for everything.

Playing through this game was complicated for me, as it was my first ever RE experience, and I played it on Hardcore, as the person I played the game with told me it was really easy. I'll have to admit, it was easy, but it was also really annoying. Its combat system feels janky and unrewarding; the saves and their placement are not always the best; its map design can be quite tedious to walk through; yet, I still really liked the game.

With this game, I've realized that our enjoyment is definitely defined by more than things such as graphics, gameplay, storyline, etc. A game is an experience, after all, and all of our experiences are specially woven into our lives by all the factors that surround them. Although we all play the same game, it's different for all of us. Isn't that the magic of life?

Regardless of the silly story, characters, events, dialogues, items, etc., I enjoyed this experience a lot. It is not always possible to enjoy experiences like these. To whoever is reading this, please try to realize the beauty of living and the world around you. Even during the worst of times, there's still going to be at least one thing to be grateful for: having the possibility of living one more day. To live one more day means having hope. One cannot lose all hope unless one wants to lose the meaning of living.

I am writing this review as an ode to hope. Watching myself play parts of this game, laughing and screaming, and ultimately loving someone, has made me realize just how much I have enjoyed my life. Although the moments in which everything seems calm and beautiful are fleeting or ephemeral, it is important to always strive to have more of them.

To whoever is reading this, if there's anything that you want to do with your life that you are scared of trying, please go out and do so immediately. It is fear that limits our capacity to live. Try living a little more every day. Get a new hobby, read a new book, try a new game, or talk to that girl or guy that you've been interested in for a long time. At the end of the day, what matters is that you tried. We always have to, and we always have to continue trying. To live is to try.

I hope that you are having a great day.
For us, the future, love, hope, and obviously, life.

Bosses feel like you kind of have to ""muscle"" your way through them just by spending your saved resources which you might not have unless you know the game like the back of your hand. 

But perhaps that's part of the charm. Because resources are scarce, every action you take feels like it will have huge consequences down the line which really works to keep you engaged. 

But while it's a difficult game that can be rewarding to play, if you do learn the game really well, playing it kind of feels like just following a checklist. But up until that point, just learning the game and the layout of the map is a lot of fun.

Take the role of Leon Kennedy, a cop-in-training being transferred to the Raccoon City Police Department. As he arrives in Raccoon City, he'll notice that a violent outbreak has ravaged the city, turning citizens into infected zombies and regular animals into deadly creatures. Carefully manage your resources and navigate through the police department and other hidden aspects of Raccoon City to uncover the mysterious origin of the outbreak and put an end to it before all hope is lost.

RE2 is a survival horror game focused around inventory management and puzzle solving. Leon has a very limited inventory meaning as you traverse environments you'll have to make choices and sacrifices on what items you'll carry with you, what items you'll come back for, and what items you'll have to leave behind. You'll always carry some weapons and ammo, but not too much because you'll learn pretty quickly that these zombies are resilient, and your best path forward is often by dodging the zombies completely. Health supplies are also limited though, so risking leaving zombies alive can put your health at a risk and leave you wounded for long periods of time. RE2 is definitely difficult, as you won't be able to just sprint through and gun down anything in your path. Careful routing and resource management will be key to getting you out of your predicaments.

RE2 is pretty scary at times as well, though I would say the focus is less on scares and more on tension-building. You're constantly surrounded or being stalked by creatures whose only purpose is to turn you into  mush as you walk around these dimly-lit environments that are eerily quiet after the human population has abandoned them. While Raccoon City and the other areas you'll explore are unsettling set pieces, I couldn't help but also be fascinated by the visuals throughout. The RE Engine used to power the graphics of this game is an absolute monster and delivers some stunning details, both in cutscenes and in gameplay. 

Once you've finished the story there's a lot of reason to revisit the game. Re-play the story as Claire Redfield, the secondary main character of RE2 that Leon frequently encounters, and see what she was up to while Leon was exploring the police department. Play the New Game+ variants of their storylines to unlock the true ending. Try out the hardcore difficulties that limit how often you can save and increase the danger of enemies. Check out the extra scenarios, little side stories about how the outbreak affected other people in Raccoon City. The modding scene for RE2 is also pretty solid, I did a couple extra playthroughs of the game with mods enabled and there were some absolutely fantastic graphics and gameplay mods.

RE2 is a fantastic display of how a remake should be done. Taking the base game and completely rebuilding it as if it were released in the modern-day, while still retaining what made it special at release. It's got a great balance between horror, action, and puzzles that will make it an intense but enjoyable experience from start to finish. I highly recommend picking up RE2, especially when it goes on sale and especially in the bundle that includes the RE3 remake as well.",1691182014,1691182014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

introduced in the original.

I like that there's some jumpscares, but some of them are a bit unfair such as in the sewers after collecting the king and queen piece when the construction worker zombie comes right around the doorway with zero time to react unless you already knew he was there. I had to go back through that entire section again, which I didn't mind but it was a little annoying (I was going for no heals).

El primer Resident Evil fue remasterizado para la GameCube en el 2002, republicado en 2008 en la Wii y actualizado y republicado nuevamente en Steam en 2015 junto con una edición modernizada del Resident Evil Zero.

Con su secuela el tratamiento fue distinto, el Resident Evil 2 original fue publicado variedad de ocasiones en diversidad de plataformas hasta que en 2019 se estrenó su Remake, desarrollado con el novedoso RE Engine que anteriormente había dado luz a Resident Evil 7.

El trabajo realizado acá es excelente, una adaptación a los estándares de tiempos modernos totalmente fiel al concepto original sin importar los años de distancia entre uno y otro. La dinámica de exploración, backtracking y acertijos se conserva y se adapta junto a la exigencia de conservar y administrar apropiadamente la munición y los objetos, tal como el clásico del 98 pero más accesible, así como logró Resident Evil 4 en el 2005 al colocar la cámara detrás de la espalda.

Técnica y kinestésicamente tan refinado como un Resident Evil moderno; espiritualmente tan único e inexplicable como un Resident Evil clásico.

You are always on limited ammo so you need to be really careful what you use it for, and it takes time to kill them too.

The police station made me feel so much dread (in a good way) and is incredibly well designed, the story kept me hooked and goes in unexpected places, whilst feeling interesting due to the various scenery changes, and the fact that there isn't a map marker for your main quest encourages you to explore and risk your life - the game really doesn't hold your hand at all.

That the end of nine months reveals

Know that I will be there

So far, the story has me invested and on edge, wanting to know more, the writing is amazing and so is the CGI and little details, also the controls of the game are easy to get used to and to be honest the best I've ever seen! Leon's character makes so much sense. being the rookie cop he is yet filled with intelligence.

Things I've liked about the game: 
Leon's ass jiggling when he runs
Leon letting out those sweet noises whenever he's injured.
Ada in a red dress.
Leon's gorgeous biceps.
The way Leon blinks
Leon's puffy kissable lips 
Ada's boobs 
Leon's sexy hands

Though I need to add my opinion on things I think if were added they'd make the game way better:
Naked Leon mod 
The ability of letting Leon pleasure himself on screen
Giving Leon head 'cause he deserves it 
Adultery scene of Leon and Ada
Leon stripping down animation 
Leon dancing to Mr. X as a way to distract him 
Leon doing the whip and NAE NAE 

But that's just my opinion.

If you like slow traditional RE gameplay, go for it you'll love it as much as everyone else seems to have

It was the most boring game i've played in a long time lmao. I enjoyed 3 far more despite it being the one people didn't like lol, might touch it again for the claire story but I'm hesitant to.

It's just so much just boring running around finding keys to open doors which lead to doors that require more keys, it's just key searching with intermittent boring and/or frustrating combat because the damage calculation/ammo allocation is just bad.

The Story (I played Leon's) was great, but that made the long tedious gameplay more frustrating because I wanted to see more of the story.

Graphics and Visuals:
From the moment I stepped foot into the dark, desolate streets of Raccoon City, I was spellbound by the stunning graphics and attention to detail. Every corner of the city is beautifully rendered, with eerie lighting, haunting shadows, and atmospheric effects that contribute to a palpable sense of dread. Character models are incredibly realistic, showing off the emotions of fear and exhaustion etched on their faces as they fight for survival. The grotesque and terrifying designs of the various zombies and monsters are nothing short of impressive, giving players a sense of constant unease.

Gameplay:
The gameplay in Resident Evil 2 Remake flawlessly blends classic survival horror mechanics with modern sensibilities. The third-person perspective places you right in the thick of the action, making every encounter with the undead a heart-pounding experience. The scarcity of resources forces players to make crucial decisions about when to fight and when to evade, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay. Furthermore, the puzzles scattered throughout the game are ingeniously designed, striking the perfect balance between challenge and reward.

Story and Atmosphere:
Resident Evil 2 Remake is a masterclass in crafting a gripping narrative. The story remains faithful to the original but is skillfully expanded upon to give more depth to the characters and their motivations. Claire Redfield and Leon Kennedy, the iconic protagonists, are expertly portrayed, making you genuinely care about their plight in this nightmarish setting. Additionally, the game's atmosphere is thick with tension and dread, aided by the hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack that intensifies the overall experience.

Level Design:
The level design in Resident Evil 2 Remake is a testament to the developers' creativity. Each area is meticulously crafted, offering a perfect balance of exploration and danger. The police station, in particular, is a masterpiece of architectural ingenuity, with interconnected rooms and secret passageways that keep players on their toes. Additionally, the varying environments, from the dimly lit sewers to the foreboding underground laboratories, maintain the feeling of a living, breathing nightmare.

Replayability:
Despite completing the game multiple times, I find myself eager to revisit Raccoon City again and again. The game's branching paths, multiple difficulty modes, and unlockable content provide excellent replay value. Furthermore, the introduction of the ""2nd Run"" feature, offering a fresh perspective on the story, encourages players to dive back into the terrifying world of Resident Evil 2 Remake.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a triumphant return to survival horror greatness. Capcom has revitalized a beloved classic, presenting it in a way that will both thrill longtime fans and captivate newcomers.

Remember to conserve your ammo throughout the game and save your best stuff for the bosses. But if you have to shoot a zombie, I recommend just shooting them in one of their legs till it snaps so that they are left just crawling. When you finally meet Mr.X, he will roam around and patrol the police department essentially stalking you. Gunshots and explosives will alert him to your location so try not to make too much noise if you don't want him chasing you. The louder his footsteps are, the closer he is to you so run!! Don't waste your bullets on him, but if you must, shoot him a couple times in the head and he will be stunned for a good second.

This is the title that many people use to exemplify how a remake should be done. 
Almost everything about this game it's perfectly done, like the mechanics, the story, the acting, the enemies, THE GUNS (love the variety of guns), and the one of the main antagonist: Mr. X. I've played Claire's part and like it a lot, but I grew up with Leon S. Kennedy and I have to say that Leon A is my favourite way to play and replay the game.

One of the best parts of the game is Mr. X himself. He makes you stay alert all the time, which brings a sensation of permanent danger to the player, and makes him act carefully. This detail of gameplay favours immersion at its best.

Unfortunately, the only reason I'm not saying that it's a perfect remake is because I think it lacks something that the original had, which is the variety in each scenario for each character that the original had, but this one has the same story for each character no matter which part you play first.

It allows us to proudly say that this franchise has returned to its good old days. The remake is an incredibly scary experience in a wonderful atmosphere and has so much valuable gameplay that we can repeat it over and over again. Add to this, fantastic graphics, sound design and its good storyline are why you shouldn't miss Resident Evil 2 Remake.

[h1] STORYLINES [/h1]
Before I talk about the storylines, there is an interesting thing about the Resident Evil franchise, the [url=https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/two.html] EVIL NET [/url] service that allows you to view your game progress with a Capcom ID and connecting it to your Steam account.
Another thing that I need to say is the Steam Cloud Service, make sure to turn it on to upload your save files on the Steam Cloud Service, the only thing you need to pay attention to is that every slot in the game for saving will be about 5 MB. I recommend using less number of slots to reduce their syncing time.

[b] Spoiler alert !!! [/b]

[spoiler]The game has two storylines, each of them can be played by two main characters in parallel ways
 [b]Leon A - Clair B
 Clair A - Leon B[/b]
 After selecting NEW GAME, you have two options, Leon's story and Clair's story (each of which leads to Leon A and Clair A) but the game is not over yet, a SECOND RUN option will be unlocked in the menu which will allow you to play the game as second character as soon as you finish A. by putting these two storylines together, you will find out to the main story.[/spoiler]

But this is not the end of the story, the game allows you to get infinite knife and ammo after completing some challenges (Hardcore S+), which can be fun.
what I am trying to say is That [b]it is not a game that you just play once and leave it out![/b]

[hr][/hr]
[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]
Resident Evil 2 is really great in terms of graphics and audio aspects.  The creators of the environments of the original version have recreated the atmosphere in this version with excellent graphics, and the appearance of various characters, from the main characters to bosses and side characters, has been designed in the best possible way.  In addition to these, we also see perfect voice acting. Considering the eighth-gen graphics, they have excellent performance on current configurations so [b]you will enjoy the game even with a mid-range PC.[/b]

The puzzles are not too easy not too difficult and the game doesn't script your every move, i.e. You can search for the locker combination or just brute force it. May not be the intended way but it's great that the game isn't restricting.

In some situations, it's very obvious that the Zombies have scripted spawns. Some zombies are invulnerable until you run into them so they can then jumpscare and attack you. Little bit annoying, but ok. Would have had the same outcome but with a better atmosphere if you had significantly less ammo so you would actually be hesitant to potentially waste it on corpses.

2nd Run is not as satisfying because you have to solve puzzles and fight bosses that you fought in the 1st Run but it's not too bad. It's not a 1:1 copy. The 2nd Run ramps up a lot faster and you get the key items and weapons much quicker and already have a good idea of what you need to do. And you do get a very different POV of the story, entire new areas, and bosses.

As a fan of survival horror games, I had heard a lot about the title's immersive gameplay and chilling atmosphere. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.

From the moment I started the game, I was drawn into the dark and eerie world of Raccoon City. The game's graphics were incredibly realistic, and the attention to detail in the environment was astonishing. The dimly lit corridors, the haunting sound effects, and the suspenseful music created an atmosphere that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire gameplay.

One of the standout aspects of the game was the well-crafted storyline and character development. I appreciated the depth of the protagonists, Leon and Claire, and their journey through the zombie-infested city. Their encounters with various mutated creatures and the sinister Umbrella Corporation added an extra layer of intrigue to the plot.

The gameplay itself was challenging but rewarding. The scarcity of resources and limited ammunition forced me to carefully plan my every move. The puzzles scattered across the game provided a welcomed break from the constant tension, making me feel like a true survivor trying to uncover the city's dark secrets.

The zombies, of course, were the most terrifying adversaries. Their eerie groans and unexpected appearances around corners kept me in a constant state of unease. I found myself holding my breath every time I had to navigate through a group of them, hoping not to attract their attention.

As I progressed, the game became more intense, and the encounters with more powerful creatures pushed my skills to the limit. I often found myself fleeing from overwhelming situations, adding an element of panic and urgency that only heightened the overall experience.

Despite the chilling atmosphere and intense gameplay, I couldn't help but admire the game's design and craftsmanship. The attention to detail in the character animations, the hauntingly beautiful visuals, and the well-crafted narrative all contributed to making ""Resident Evil 2"" an exceptional gaming masterpiece.

In conclusion, ""Resident Evil 2"" is a must-play for any survival horror enthusiast. It successfully captures the essence of fear and excitement, leaving players with a sense of accomplishment and a lasting impression. This gaming experience will undoubtedly stay with me for a long time, and I can't wait to immerse myself in the world of Raccoon City again.",1690017893,1690017893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

RESIDENT EVIL, the way they walk growling/snarling at you at same time walking towards you, its feels unnerving, Like it wastes ZERO time letting you know these zombies WANT TO EAT YOU lol and if you slip up sucks to be you buddy git gud.. and you feel that with the ammo spread accross the game where they don't make you feel too overpowered but to the point where you need to do things timed or placed perfectly or else you just wasted all that ammo and will most likely die later on because of it, unless you are a master with the knife and grenades etc secondary items., also not to mention the few other perfectly done monsters waiting for you in the rpd station. I just feel like the zombies,for example, in this game the way they look and sound walking towards you just give you a classic zombie feel, what i mean by that is they actually feel like a true threat because it's only you, with 4 bullets in the dark with these things  and dont know wtf's going to happen next..l first time is always the best so dont rush it,


game-play is 10/10, story is 7/10  for a game that's meant on game-play,atmosphere, enemies, and replay-ability(speed runs,no death runs,no damage runs, no chest item box using, etc,etc,) the story is pretty decent could've been better but its definitely not the worst you'll see,  they have cut out some content like certain areas around Raccoon city i.e the city zoo(which would've been amazing to see imo.) also the sewers do miss spiders but ooh don't worry there's another surprise for you down their ;), game even has some dlc thats pretty cheap that does add alot more content to the game adding more replay ability in a sense, dude why tf are you still reading this go play it

It is an impressive survival horror game that is a joy from start to finish. Everything from the puzzles to the exploration were excellently paced meaning there was never a dull moment. As a precursor, this is my first Resident Evil, (after a failed attempt at playing the RE 1 Remaster) so I cannot compare it to the original or any other games in the series beyond what I’ve seen others talk about. From what I have heard, there is cut content from the original RE 2, but for a newcomer, this isn’t much of a bother. I would much rather take the updated graphics and quality of life improvements at the cost of a marginally worse, but still great story. And Leon’s story was exciting. Leon is a rookie cop driven to prove his worth within the force. Upon arriving in Racoon City, he is greeted with a zombie virus that has infected the entire city. He seeks refuge within the police station where he begins to plan his escape out of the city. It is here where you spend a majority of the game, completing puzzles and unlocking rooms in order to help you escape. The puzzles strike a perfect balance between difficulties. I wouldn’t say any were unsolvable, but there were some that required thought and thorough exploration of the map. The police station itself was fun to get lost in, despite the ever present backtracking you must do in order to escape. Progression feels natural as you slowly unlock each room in the station.I would have appreciated more NPC interaction and overall world building, but I suppose the feeling of isolation was intentional in order to keep the player on edge. This was one of the few games I’ve played that really kept me in suspense throughout its entire run time. The scarcity of ammo and lack of a direct manual save meant that each encounter must be met with caution. The gore and lighting also do an incredible job at amplifying this feeling of tension. This game is beautiful and is best played on low brightness in my opinion; it is a small addition to the game that can transform the atmosphere. After you escape the Police Station, you team up with a woman named Ada and the two of you work together to find out the cause of this virus. It is an interesting story of corporate greed that is easy to follow on the surface, but you can’t help but feel like you aren’t being told the whole story. The story isn’t deep by any means, but you really do feel like you’re missing a part of the story by not playing Resident Evil 1. It expects you to know a little bit about Resident Evil 1, which to my knowledge deals with the very beginning of the outbreak. It isn’t a deal breaker, but I wish they spent more time on exposition in the form of audio logs or journals because I don’t expect them to remaster the 1st game any time soon. I enjoyed this second part of the game. It was more linear and story driven which was a nice juxtaposition to the equally entertaining exploration of the Police Station. I found the boss fights to be pretty underwhelming. There were two of them and they honestly felt pretty clunky. The movement in the game is pretty slow and realistic and in the context of fighting giant monsters, just doesn’t make sense. The movement isn’t bad by any means, I just don’t think it fit well with the high intensity of the boss fights

I am a little disappointed at the lack of replayability in this game. I am a little unmotivated to play through Claire’s run as it revisits many of the same sites of the first run. The characters and story may delineate slightly, but on the whole, it seems to be a nearly identical experience with the added hindrance of removing weapons and progress, forcing you to start over from scratch.I will update if/when I decide to do a playthrough with Claire, but as the game stands, It is still an enjoyable experience without it. It nails survival horror and from a newcomers perspective, the story is engrossing. The 2nd run seems to be redundant and some parts of the exposition remain confusing, but on the whole it’s still a strong game. 8/10

RE engine, used since RE7, is a major factor in terms of graphics. The game looks great compared to other modern titles. From lighting to textures and animations are all good and run nicely. Even on low & old hardware such as mine (that still used DX11) can run the game fairly smooth. It’s regrettable now that Capcom decides to change the system requirements to compensate for newer hardware with Ray Tracing options.

The devs took so much care and attention with this remake. They didn’t just change everything to be more in line with modern shooting games. They pick and choose features and details taken from the original that resonate more with players. They keep most of the slow and intense horror atmosphere from the original, while also update things that didn’t age well or can be improved. Things such as slow and hard to kill zombies, scarce ammo, inventory management, save system, or even intricate puzzles are making a return. Tank controls & fixed camera angles are removed entirely. It is enjoyable even for fans who didn’t touch games from that era.

In the main campaign you can play as 2 different characters going through (almost) same events and locations. Leon & Claire each has their own stories that are worth playing in any order, much like the original. Both explore a few of the same locations while also offered different objectives, details, secrets & weapons. The remake also offered some scenarios and survival mode for players who want to enjoy more after the finish the main story. It is a complete package.

The game was enjoyable from start to finish. It didn’t frustrate you with backtracking, dead ends, missing puzzles, etc. You can progress through the story with relative ease without worrying much about getting lost or looking up online for clues & walkthrough. There are also plenty of consumables and upgrades for players. The map also features hints and indicators for items that you came across or missed during the campaign.

Overall, I really enjoyed my time with RE2 Remake. It is a solid remake of an already great title in the survival horror genre.",1689260699,1689260699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has all the original game had but with better camera, better graphics, better movement, and some little mechanic tweaks that make the game much more fun to play than the old ones.
One thing that annoys me is hitting so many times in the head a zombie and not killing it, but I guess it would be too easy if so.. I haven't got the Magnum neither, yet.. >:)
I bought RE1 and RE0 out of nostalgia, didn't really enjoy them, this is definitely a good way to start if you're new to Resident Evil.

Note: Finished the game with Leon and then with Claire 2nd run.
It unlocked ""The 4th survivor"", and I was mind-blown of excitement to play it, but WTH??!! It absolutely ridiculous, you expect a shooting mode of the game, you get a run through doing nothing mode, absolutely ruined it, I'm so pissed off!! 
It's just an extra mode, but man, how could they ruin such a cool feature so badly??!!!

I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

Rather than repeating certain scenes from Leon's playthrough, the developers could have made the two stories more interconnected. It would have been more satisfying to experience new and unique challenges as Claire, rather than revisiting familiar areas and tasks, such as encountering the Tyrant after putting off the fire from the crashed chopper or the greenhouse playthrough where we have to do everything we already have done in the first run.

Now, that Resident Evil 4 is done and was a wild success, they should stop. It went downhill on Resident Evil 5 and 6.

If you want a really good scare, but also gratification for solving puzzles with a healthy balance of strategy (don't waste that ammo) or if you just wanna look at Leon's pretty face, you'll enjoy this game.

As of writing this, i've played this for 14 hours.
this is my first time playing a horror game so as you can expect, i was pausing the game anytime i heard i creak in the floorboards, but because of how the game is structured, i was allowed to pace myself and take my time with the tasks, which felt really nice and i wasn't rushed by the action.
The sound design is FENOMINAL!! (i use a pair of Samson sr850 headphones, lovely things) God from Leons small breaths he draws when he spots a zombie to gunshots in a big, echoey room compared to a small one to the subtle ambience changes when you first visit an area, the sound mixing is the best I've heard in a game by far!
To progress in this game, you do have to grit your teeth and do a fair bit of exploring to find all the pieces to various puzzles, it can get a tad long-winded going all around the map to find a crank to open a door, but if you like that sort of thing, like i do, you'll surely enjoy yourself.
In summery, good adventure, long but gratifying gameplay and Leon. just... Leon.

Mr X. is the single most annoying piece of game design I've ever experienced. On a blind play-through it was purely frustrating.

6-9 hours of gameplay for both Leon's and Claire's route, totaling 12+ if you want to get both stories.
Clearing both isn't necessary though, since the campaign is 80% same for both. But if you liked the game it's worth to do the second route also.

These routes don't perfectly match story wise, since Leon and Claire are separated at the start of the game, yet in their respective playthroughs they're at the exact same locations & sometimes fighting the same bosses, so it feels less like playing an alternative route and more like playing an alternative timeline.",1688522266,1688523703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great game. Though it required a change in my mindset to get used to steering my character like it's an oil tanker but after I got used to that it was smooth sailing. So controls are a bit iffy, but only for the first hour or two. Once you realize you're not playing a third-person-shooter it'll be fine.

There's two campaigns. Two characters. You can complete story A on character 1 and story B on character 2. Or do both on the same character. Whatever has your preference. After that you can play a few more arcade bonus missions. So plenty of content.

If you're looking for a game to add to your completionist showcase this one is pretty fun. You may need to replay a campaign but it's so much faster the 2nd time through. Every time you beat something you unlock something that will help you on your next playthrough. The achievements aren't grindy and they're quite straight forward.

Initially I was absolutely not interested in seeing a remake of a game I already played. When I played the demo back then I was really surprised how the game turned out to be. I really liked it although I still wished that they would port the original on steam too.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
This time the perspective is switched from fixed camera angles or first-person view to a third person angle. I love change that’s neat. Especially how the controls work, your character is not moving in any way stiff anymore not that I disliked the control scheme in any RE before.

Also, the puzzle nature of the gameplay is back, you run around and find obstacles and try to overcome them, mostly by punching in codes or finding an item, like a key(card) or a valve. Although more “complex” text puzzles of the original are gone. Still this gameplay was always what I liked, coupled together with the enemies and resource management. Which fight should I pick, should I risk a health item or ammo, or reload an old save? Veteran mode is this time the only one that has limited saves via cartridges again. I like that there is a challenging but not overly difficult veteran mode, although there is no difficulty above that.

Combat is fun due to the extra challenges of manually aiming at zombies heads or other enemies that are out there.  They move unpredictable making it absolutely not an easy task. They took again the system with the personal defence weapons from RE1 remake, so the protagonist will stab someone and lose a knife if getting grabbed from the front.

You also find on your way upgrades for your weapons or completely new ones, along with a remake and improvement of the old games level design. Its very familiar but still completely different, especially in the lategame. I found the game absolutely fun from start to finish and cannot really complain much, aside maybe that the backtracking can be a bit too much and the feature that helps you highlight rooms which you completely cleared makes the game a bit too easy on the exploring. I rather wish it would only highlight either main quest items or only being on easy difficulty. S Rank will take you on highest difficulty 2 hours and 30 minutes. My first play through took me closer to 8 hours for a single character. Good length, not too short but not too long.

There are also a few challenges that unlock cosmetics (but there are barely any) or artwork and a couple of extra modes added on. Those extra modes are a minigame that brings you through mostly already seen places and is more combat focused by delivering a mini story. Neat. Sadly extra coop mode or some kind of mercenary mode the franchise is known for. Oh well.

[u]Story[/u]
As in the original you can play through the game as either Leon or Claire. They have some different story aspects but play through most of the same areas. I would say about slightly over 1/3 of their storyline and gameplay is different. You also have the A and B route again, which changes almost nothing in the whole game, I even have the assumption that it changes less than the original did. Main difference is only the new main pistol as mostly ammo for that one will spawn and the starting area of the game. Some puzzles have barely changed and just make the game a bit shorter. This is an aspect they could have just skipped and probably added only so original fanboys are not mad that it didn’t got included.

[u]Sound[/u]
A bit of a let down is the OST. They played it very save by making the OST less interesting. like the original and instead made it much more environmental, save aside a few tracks. Its definitely fine but not that memorable.

Game is available again in a ton of different dubbed languages. Also, the indoor sound design is really neat and the whole SFX they use was my highlight.

[u]Graphics[/u]
You can tweak a lot on the graphical settings. I especially love and give them kudos for actually showing pictures that resemble various effects. In literally all games I deactivate lens flares and bloom, but the pictures showed me an effect I liked so kept it. Neat stuff!

To the graphics itself, the game can run on a potato but offers scaling that you can have problems even with very modern hardware. Its great that they added this amount of customization. Its not the best looking game, but full of details and little animation quirks, like when zombies are about to grab you but you kill them in the same moment they fall against you while the protagonist pushes them off their body or they try to dodge them.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I really absolutely enjoyed my playthrough. It’s a short game with lots of replay value which I absolutely like. The remake stays somewhat true to the original but offers so many new ideas and environments making it a must play for people who liked the ps1 game. The only downsides I have are a few nitpicks which are overshadowed by the fun core gameplay loop.

Just finished my playthrough of Leon and I have to say this one was very enjoyable. For context, I never played the original so this review is unbiased in that regard.

This game functions very similar to RE:0 in terms of its puzzle layout - Central location at the start with a mix of puzzle and combat, with more action towards the end of the run. I tend to prefer the starting puzzle sections more than the combat/action but it still carried me through with story.

Characters are fun and voice actors do a good job (better than previous entries). Story is great and paced very well. However, noticeably absent is extra flavour text that you could read by inspecting point of interest in earlier entries (RE:HD and RE:0) - Perhaps this is a theme with the newer games but it was missed.

Combat and Inventory mechanics were great! This game being modern means it can learn from previous entries and do it's best to present the best of both worlds of challenge and ease of use. One thing that did stand out is the ability to perform critical shots, that wasnt present in the locked off camera games. Free aim allows for headshots, meaning that the 'lock-on' button is void. I often found myself rarely using the shotgun and just using the pistol for headshots (unlike HD or 0). The chase sections were some of the most fear inducing that I've experienced in resident evil so far! Made the puzzle solving in certain sections so much more thrilling.

The boss fights were so much more interactive and intuitive. What previous entries lacked, RE:2 makes up for! Bosses have multiple stages, well designed attacks and you can tell if you're damaging it or not. 

Overall, a solid entry in the series without much to complain about.

EDIT: SECOND RUN
The second run leaves alot to be desired. For context, I did Claire second run.

The gameplay is mostly the same, there is alot less ammo and more gun types - which does switch things up. This adds to Claires gameplay being more stealthy than Leons 'run and gun' style. This was a nice change of pace as I didnt need to expend as much ammo after knowing how to take down enemies more effectively. They condensed the intro down alot, which i feel was a bit rushed - this couldve been an opportunity to explore the same areas differently. The police station is mostly the same. Puzzles/doors are solved a bit differently, enough to keep it fresh.

Story wise its a bit of a mess. Sometimes they try to write Claires action matching up with Leons, but due to gameplay needs, you fight the same bosses and the plot becomes out of sync. I think they did a decent job, but it could have been done better. Claires story feels very barren, with alot less NPC interaction.


the 2nd last boss feels like a step down from the 3rd, and the last boss is another step down - i beat both last bosses on the first try, they felt easy. It was a decent cap-off to the story with the true ending. However, the 2nd run does fall down a bit from Leons 1st run.

Most of the achievements consist of doing a run faster, on hardcore, getting all collectibles, without using heals etc. I just used that as an excuse to do a run for each achievement because i liked the game so much i didn't care how time consuming it was.

The RE franchise has always been a favorite of mine, but i never got around to playing the 2 and 3 remakes, and i'm so glad i did. 

I can heavily recommend this game if you like survival horror, or just wanna fall in love with some characters and enjoy the beautiful scenery, puzzles and combat.

Leon é estupido, não sabe se defender contra um zombie despedaçado, zombies não se decidem  entre ninjas ou mortos vivos, as vezes nunca te percebem, outras giram tão rapido pra te agarrar que a animação chega a cortar.

Gameplay, terror é otimo e tenso, puzzles são irritantes, o jogo permite descartar items de puzzles importantes antes de completa-los o que pode te fazer ficar preso pra sempre em um puzzle, alguns não tem nenhum sentido, são praticamente dedução pura.

O jogo não oferece suporte pra new game plus, simplesmente depois que zera você tem que recomeçar tudo sem nenhum item, o que torna futil se esforçar pra coletar as armas e complementos.

Graficos, cheio de problemas visuais e bugs que ainda estão presente desde o lançamento, não da pra usar o SSR e mesmo com ele off ainda tem glitchs

Graphics are good, but at some points its lazy, for example you walk under dripping water, a shower for instance, and you do not get wet. Please. 

[h1] Gameplay 5 of 10 [/h1]

The gameplay suffers a lot because of the absolute AWFUL console porting. Why the hell do mouse and keyboard feel like playing with the most clumsy controller ever invented. The Joypads are NOT good, its the most awfule trash ever. 

[h1] Story 1 of 10 [/h1]

The story is absolute forgettable. The only time you feel just a little tense was when you are hunted by Mr. X, but that you can go into saferoom, and Mr X cant go in there, is the biggest fail ive ever seen in gaming. That just kill the immersion. Let him HUNT you where ever you are. Not this ""SAFE, you cant touch me here even though ive just past the damn door
No its not needed.
The story is pretty awful, there is nothing really exciting in the story, so you can a forget why you are there.

[h1] Sounds 6 of 10 [/h1]

The sound is okay.  the acting is, well, its there, nothing really WAUW about it, but neither something that will make you fall asleep.

[h1] Controlling 2 of 10 [/h1]
Its absolutely awful as mentioned before. tell me, why do you run like a one legged dwarf and as slow as wheelchair gandalf and get away from being hit by a huge monster or just a fly? Or run so slow that you get hit by everything, even hits that you clearly see should NOT hit you? I wonder how my monitor survived my rage i had somethimes because the clumsyness at boss fights. You dont rage because of the intense gameplay, because that part is missing in the game. You rage because the controlling is like an AWFUL joypad. GET RID OF THE GAWD DAMM CONSOLE PORTS!!!!!!

[h1] Fun 1 of 10 [/h1]

You are somewhat entertained when you are chased by mr. X else you are just running around and solving kindergarten level puzzles. Why not add some really challenging puzzles? Why must it all be so damn easy? Make great games, dont make ""in and out"" games with no challenges. I remember trying to solve puzzles in the 90s where i could think for days before i found the solution. That just gives you an satisfaction you never get from games anymore. Now, what you get from todays challenges is: ""Okay, was that it? move on"" No satisfaction at all.

[h1] Price 1 of 10 [/h1]

the 1 of 10 for price was at release. By now the game should be max 10 euro, so that is okay for that game. But they wanted 60 bucks bck then, and its not worth  60 bucks. And dear developers, I WILL NEEEVER BUY GAMES FOR MORE THAN 60 BUCK. Take your $ 70 or 70 euro or more and shove it. the way Triple A games are today, NO GAMES are worth 70 euro, not even 60 or 50. The triple A gaming is suffering so BAD.

Its time to throw away EVERYTHING what the gaming industry have done the past 13 years, and go back to when games were good, and start making good games again.

[h1] Over all 2 of 10 [/h1]
The game is okay, but it does NOT deserve Overwhelmingly positive, that it is not. Its an okay game, the best Resident Evil in a very long time, but there is not good story, and the scary part is not even scary. 
Developers cant even make game scary anymore without the CHEAP jumpscare. Seriously, who want that sh!t. Make it scary properly or dont make a scary game at all. Outlast and the first amnesia is worth finding inspiration.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Thank gawd i am done with this game, it is NOT a game i will replay. Its absolutely not worth another playthough.

There's a new over-the-shoulder control scheme that feels much more like a modern video game, and it keeps the same tense exploration and puzzle solving that made me fall in love with the original in the late 90s.

Zombies feel much more menacing and can sometimes take a handful of bullets to take down, only to get back up 20 seconds later. The way enemies react to your bullets is shockingly brutal—zombies will even crawl around without arms or legs until you eliminate them for good. Other iconic enemies like Lickers and Mr. X make their return, and I really like new, terrifying ways they’ve implemented them into the remake.

Classic locations like the Police Station and Umbrella Lab are updated with new passages and doorways that lead to other familiar sections, and I really enjoy the new altered layouts to make more logical sense. I do wish that some extended sections, like the Sewers, were a little less tedious though. But this is a great remake that Resident Evil fans are going to love playing through again, and it’s a game that newcomers will ultimately enjoy as well.",1687431798,1687431798,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

	[td] Content and Replay Value [/td]
	[td] This game sets what seems to be the standard now for how remakes should be done, and I’m here for it. RE2 has a story good enough to hold you even though it can be tongue in cheek sometimes. After you’re done playing the story, they introduce new scenarios for each playable character and the reward is the fully fleshed out ending. The best part is that each part takes about one dedicated sit down each! Therefore it doesn’t feel like you’re sacrificing much jumping back in! [/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td] Should you get it?[/td]
	[td] RE2 is great for newcomers and veterans to the series alike. Newcomer, you want a spooky puzzle game with beautiful graphics and a story? Here you go. Veteran, wanna see how the developers put a solid spin on arguably the BEST Resident Evil game? Have fun. This is solid grab; you’re essentially doing yourself a disservice as gaming hobbyist if you don’t grab it on sale. [/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td] Overall Verdict [/td]
	[td] 9/10. The game is good people. It still has the puzzles. Respectable spin on the story, Beautiful graphics. Respected my time as a gamer. And just feels good to play. I almost felt the inner speed gamer in me come out for the last two runs. I never feel that way. Plus I didn’t get to the DLCs which are just straight up fun. [/td]

[b] Setting & Writing: [/b]
Resident Evil 2: Remake takes place in notorious Raccoon City. You start the game as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield. Leon is on his way to the city to start his first day as a Raccoon City Police officer (RCPD) and Claire is on her way to find her brother Chris who is part of the RCPD. Their paths intersect just outside of the city where they witness their first encounter with the epidemic that has been spreading through Raccoon City. Chaos ensues as the protagonist find out how the epidemic started to spread, who started it, and the nightmare they’re living through to make it out alive. The game has three distinct acts, notable by location. If you’re a veteran to the game, you know the story and you know the bad guy. For newcomers, expect a exciting yet cliché story. What makes it work is that it never overstays its welcome and the story just keeps pulling you along, so you don’t have to think too long on non-sensical situations.

[b] Gameplay system & Bosses: [/b]
RE2: Remake implements the popular over the shoulder third-person view camera. The resident evil team first implemented this type of control and gameplay back in Resident Evil 4. This was such a popular design choice by the team that it stayed around up until Resident Evil 7, which was the first time the team decided to go to first-person view. Another staple to the story are the puzzles. Essentially, the Resident Evil series were escape rooms before they became a fad (fight me). To progress your way through the story you may find little trinkets and codes that will continue to open up your way forward. Sometimes there’s a little bit of backtracking, but what’s nice is that you have an unintrusive goal list that generally tells you what you need to do. On top of that, the map system marks areas that you haven’t been to yet, allowing you to do further investigation if necessary. The shooting mechanic in RE2 is very risky as you don’t know when you might get more ammo. This leans into the survival horror aspect of the game. Resources are purposefully limited, making you concentrate on each shot taken. Ammo economy is slightly more forgiving on the lighter difficulties, but you feel it none the less. Being frugal with your ammo leads to rewards such as having it for boss fights! Boss fights hurt if you make the wrong move. They hit like a ton of bricks. Granted, they move so slooowww. Having more resources at your behest makes them easier to deal with.   

[b] Quest, Mini-games & Challenges: [/b] 
There’s one main quest of the game and its simple, make it out alive. Everything you do are building block to that singular main goal. Yes, there will be little things you pick up during the story. But Leon and Claire are to make it out of Raccoon City alive. Now after playing through the game enough (because it does go by quick) you realize that this game can be speed-ran. Through speed running the game you get the most exclusive treats. This incentives learning all the puzzles, killing only what is necessary, and optimal pathing. Outside of this, RE2: Remake offers DLCs that add more story beats to the information you’ve gathered within the story.  

[b] Miscellaneous (art, music, etc.): [/b]
RE2 utilizes RE: Engine. This graphics engine has catapulted Capcom into a renaissance. Everything is beautiful, everything feels optimized, and it just works. The team knows how to set the atmosphere and utilizes the power of RE Engine to accomplish that. On top of the sound design makes your trek though survival ominous and spooky.

In games with limited resources like this one, I hate having a recurring unkillable enemy. Also, the windows that spawn unlimited zombies I similarly disliked. Those two factors made the game much less enjoyable for me. It was the worst part of the game in my opinion. Running around always worried about an enemy randomly appearing was scary at first, but it ended up being mostly annoying.

It wasn't until I was 12 or 13 years old that my parents bought me Resident Evil 4 for the GameCube after I wrote them an essay arguing that I was mature enough for the graphic violence and it wouldn't turn me into a poorly adjusted adult. I freaking loved that game. I never told them about the nightmares it gave me, though.

Then RE5 came out on the 360 a few years later and I was not a fan. I dabbled in other RE games after that, like Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, but I resigned myself to having missed the true glory days of the franchise, catching it's last gasp of the brilliance that was RE4. Then Capcom stopped playing games and released this amazing remake, which just oozes with dread, squishy zombie gore, and a deliciously oppressive atmosphere. I also really enjoyed the story (which I know is intentionally campy as hell, but I was pretty lore-ignorant before playing this game).

PROS
+Multiple improvements over the 1998 version. Kendo's misogyny has been replaced with a tragic micro-story, Ada has a better cover story, the Tyrant is much more intimidating, and the player's interactions with other characters (especially Marvin and Ben) are far more realistic.
+I know the REngine has been praised to death, but holy cow does it deserve it! Even on low-medium graphics, pretty much everything looks incredibly realistic!
+Whereas RE2's story changed based on which character you played as first, RE2R's has a defined story for Leon and Claire. The gameplay will change based on who you play as first, but the story will largely remain the same. By the way, the story is also greatly improved over the original.
+The voice acting is phenomenal. Leon balances the line of idealistic, ""happy"" rookie cop in deep poop, Marvin's every breath sounds pained, Ada's disregard for Leon slowly fades over the course of the game, Annette is pretty much perfect in every one of her scenes, and Claire really brings the emotion when she needs to. Also, the hyper-scared/frustrated/angry lines for Leon and Claire are 10/10.
+The setting of Raccoon City is phenomenal. Act 1's location has an overwhelming presence, Act 2's is dirty, gross, and uncomfortable, and Act 3's takes great inspiration from the movies, which I personally prefer over the original.
+Classic pains-in-the-ass like the Lickers and Dogs remain, while more silly creatures from the 1998 version like the giant spiders were wisely removed.
+The gameplay is a great reminder of what survival horror is supposed to be. Any time I wanted to move to progress the story, I would first map out my route, identify known obstacles, predict new threats, and grab a loadout for that single step. I'd then do that step (or die trying and start planning all over again), return to a safe zone, and start planning my next step. Inventory space is just as key in this as it was in RE2, making this very difficult, but very rewarding!
+The change to an RE4-style over-the-shoulder perspective greatly improves the gameplay over the original.
+The secondary-weapon system is a great addition of weapons while forcing each successful zombie attack to be another resource decision: do I spend this knife and save some health, or do I take the hit because I'm low on knives?
+The map is familiar to its 1998 version without being an exact copy, which greatly helps return players have a good experience.
+Zombies are actually scary again! There's no feeling like desperately trying to drop one who just refuses to die while he inches closer to you!
+The Tyrant, aka Mr. X, has far exceeded Nemesis from either the original or remake of RE3 as the best ongoing antagonist of the Resident Evil franchise. His constant presence is felt no matter where you go, and has some fantastic scares throughout the game, both in jump-scares and in entrances. His character is further felt in his increasing aggression as he suffers various setbacks throughout the game, and fighting him feels like fighting The Terminator. Not to mention: his face is just disturbing.
+Reading the notes is genuinely rewarding. Between giving hints for where to go/what to do, explaining apparent inconsistencies, and telling tragic stories, they add a great deal to the atmosphere of the game.
+Fun rewards for beating the game at higher difficulties, including infinite-ammo weapons!
+The 4th Survivor returns, posing a great challenge that feels akin to a New Game+ speedrun!
+Even better: the return of the Tofu Survivor!
+Even even better: you can run through the Tofu Survivor as other wonderful Japanese delicacies!
+Mods!
+Flamethrowers!
+DLC: The Original Sounds Pack is one of my favorite DLCs of all time. While the remake has better music for the boss fights, the original soundtrack has far better atmosphere for the entire game.
+DLC: Other options are worth a mention: the costumes are great (especially the Noir costumes) and the Samurai Edges help in the early game, but are well-replaced by the late-game handguns.
+DLC: The Lost Survivors provide some great challenge runs for players who have beaten the game, ultimately unlocking a Nazi Zombies-style survival mode! Great fun!

CONS
-My first playthrough for this was as Leon on Hardcore, and no matter what I did, I would always end up soft-locked near the end of Act 2, unable to handle the five or so G-Adults without dying. After beating Claire's playthrough, I was able to barely scrape through with only a grenade left thanks to liberal use of the now-unlocked infinite knife. While Claire on Hardcore is pretty doable, Leon is pretty much impossible without using speedrunner-level dodging or bonus weapons.
-DLC: While I like the Samurai Edges, they do technically provide an early-game advantage, if you care about that sort of thing.

And Claire is always ahead of Leon, shouldn't the secret door already be open, should't the doors using the T tool be used, and the god awful greenhouse puzzle, this shit should already be done. and the 2nd gripe will be the Tyrant. There is some massive jank with this behemoth of a man. Let's say you're running away and he's right outside a safe room, i've sat there for 10 minutes eating my lunch with the game running and as soon as i leave he's waiting for me outside the door, if i was playing on a hardcore and i got killed that way i would have uninstalled right then and there.

the atmosphere and sound design is great


however...


the game feels like a puzzle game sprinkled with zombies


**SPOILER ALERT**   i stopped shortly after clearing the chopper crash's fire... the large man who chases you down in many locations is just annoying as hell and i didn't had the patience to keep going after that... **SPOILER END**  but i bought Resident evil 3 remake aswell so i'll give that one a shot too


the game make you feel incredibly weak....you don't find much ammo and zombies die from 1-10 headshots...literally...the average bullet used to kill is 5 per zombie.......**with headshots only**


i first started with Leon on medium difficulty because i don't like the modern ""hard mode"" such as very low damage, bullet sponges and enemies hitting like tanks.....it's such an unimmersive incompetant solution to increase difficulty......Fromsoftware clearly knows how to make things difficult yet fair and rewarding...almost any other company still don't realise that's the way to go...and this game is no different.............going back to the medium difficulty Leon playthough, i gave up after 2 hours because the zombies were so annoying, taking multiple bullets in the head with too few bullets to find...and even then, reviving out of nowhere to make you look like you wasted all those shots...i then tried with Claire on easy difficulty...and even then the zombies are still tanky...however the bullets are more common, which i didn't had much complain


the inventory is also annoying to manage constantly because one time it's too full, the other you stored a key item which you now need and have to go back, etc.





graphic and sound design  9/10   ""great all around""

gameplay 2/10     ""too much annoyances and places you have to comeback later and have to remember""

Ремейки рано или поздно настигли бы нас, это должно было произойти. И самое главное, чтобы эти ремайки были на уровне, как и данное творение.

Только вот я не понимаю, почему обзорщики игры называют второе прохождение как ""вы узнаете что делает второй персонаж за время первого прохождения"".

The stories in this game are great; storytelling is excellent and the acting is exceptional. There is very good replayability with RE2R, as there are lots of different weapons for both Leon and Claire to use as well as having two different scenarios for both characters opens up a lot of different opportunities for different playstyles and loadout variety. Speaking of, as with all RE games since RE7, the weapons feel amazing to use and their modifications definitely feel noticeable.

My only ""gripe"" with the game is how scenario A for one character and scenario B for the other character don't really intertwine as they probably should; there are a lot of points in the game where it feels like Leon and Claire should meet (excluding the beginning and end of the stories) and locked doors would already have been opened when the scenario B stories start.

If you are new to the horror genre and want something that can grasp you into horror, this would be the perfect game to start off with. heck even if you are one, you'd be missing out on an experience. But why? 

Well, first off this is an remake of the original classic RE2, however in this remake, they expand the maps and gameplay further than what they imagined back then. Personally, i wasn't alive at the time when this game came out so i don't have much to say about that, however i would love the play the classic to compare these 2 and see how much technology and game development came so far. 

But the reason why this game is so fantastic and flawless is because the gameplay, inventory system, and its simplicity is what makes this game so fun and it successfully illustrates what a survival horror should be. its brilliant. especially on harder difficulties where it feels realistic and need to tread carefully.

Also, this game has huge replayability, since when u finish the stroy with 1 character you can choose <the second run> with the other where everything is different ( puzzles,codes,guns,ammo, item locations and DIFFERENT ENDING). I suggest you start ith Leon, an amazing character with very cool and fast ( if you unlock the attachments) weapons, with an amazing story (including romance) and an exclusive final boss fight. After you finish the story with him you should do the second run with Claire, where the guns arent as strong ( except from the grenade launcher) but there is  a lot of variety. Things are more challenging but you get to play and see so much extra content along with the <true ending> ( which is BEAUTIFUL).

Whilst REmake 3 lacked either vision, or funds, or time, or motivation - REmake 2 felt like a bona fide attempt to bring the classic game to modern computers. And it largely succeeds. Largely, because it cuts down on a lot of things that makes the RE2 unique. The trade off is that the game feels more straightforward on a single run. You can check off most of the story boxes and have a good idea what's going on in a single run, then play the 2nd Run just to see what minor story beat you missed. But because REmake 2's idea of a second run is quite literally the same game with not much added in sans different variables of engagement, it's hard to really convince oneself to do it. The option is there, so that's value, but whether it's done right is subjective. 

But I think most of the value is in the 1st run anyway. I loved that Capcom could marry in the puzzle-heavy gameplay of the old REs whilst retaining a modern feel and layout. RPD has been made well here, which makes me wish I could explore Spencer's Mansion in REmake 2 as a DLC. I'm rambling. Cut it short, good game. Play it.

The good:[list]
[*]Incomparably more atmospheric that the original. By default there's almost no music, aside from safe rooms, not even ambient tracks, just sounds of the surroundings, and it works really well. I'd say it's the most atmospheric RE next to RE7. 
[*]Storywise it's a bit more down to earth, realistic, dramatic, and has a bit more sense. Dialogues are more natural. The building layouts are more logical and realistic.
[*]Much harder than the original. The zombies are more dangerous and bullet spongy. In RE2 you had so much ammo you could clear entire groups of zombies without much trouble. Here, not so much.
[*]Mr. X is probably the largest improvement. Instead of being relegated to scripted appearances during which he was barely a thread and easy to ignore, here he wanders around the entire RPD, patrolling it looking for you. His loud *thump thump* stomping sounds are fantastic.[/list]

Many QoL features are taken straight out of RE1 Remake and improved, as well as other additions:[list]
[*]Rooms with/without items are marked on the map. 
[*]Defensive Items return, now called Sub Weapons, and can be used offensively.
[*]You can enable the original RE2 soundtrack if you so please.
[*]An orphanage chapter was added. The orphanage was only briefly touched upon in a document found in the original game.[/list]

These changes show the dedication and love of the developers towards the source material.

The mid:[list]
[*]Character movement speed is painfully slow. Almost as bad as Fatal Frame/Project Zero. It's more shuffling than moving.
[*]Leon and Claire are moaning so much when """"""running"""""" you'd think they're """"""running"""""" a marathon.
[*]Leon and Claire's comments during combat can be grating at times.[/list]

The bad:
The design decisions I wrote about earlier.[list]
[*]The game is pulling wool over the player’s eyes in regards to some of the mechanics, i.e. it's easier than it appears. Other RE games also have them, but not to this extent: in RE2 Remake having the knowledge of its inner workings massively improves your gameplay potential. For example, you cannot die on any difficulty if you’re not in Danger state, not counting instant death attacks. The knowledge of this alone helps you save a ton of herbs for the future. It also makes the R+B mix, which reduces damage taken by half for 3 minutes, much more valuable than a full heal R+G on Hardcore difficulty. What’s more, some weapons deal either reduced or increased damage against specific enemies, e.g. Leon’s shotgun is great against zombies and dogs, but is pretty crap against anything else. Furthermore, there are 2 boss fights [spoiler](G2 and Super Tyrant)[/spoiler] which seem cheap and frustrating, but which become very simple once you know the mechanics behind them.
[*]The inconsistency in zombie durability. I get it, they want you to kill zombies only in high traffic areas, and shoot to stagger to avoid others. Except attempting to stagger sometimes takes 3 head/leg shots, sometimes 10, sometimes even more. You’re still wasting a lot of ammo. Trying to avoid entirely is extremely risky, since corridors can be tight and zombies can double lunge at you. Yes, you have Sub Weapons, but there aren’t that many of them and you want to save grenades for bosses or large groups of zombies, instead of lone ones. On the other hand, for Leon, once you get the shotgun, zombies stop being a threat almost entirely, since he can decapitate them 100% of the time with it. The balance is really weird and ruins the resource management part. People complain about RE3 Remake, but at least it's more consistent there.[/list]

The above forces players to metagame almost to extreme levels on Hardcore difficulty.

Last, but not least: the biggest bone of contention among fans is the A/B scenario system. It was the best feature of the original, but in RE2R they neutered it rather significantly:[list]
[*]You do not have any impact on B scenario via A.
[*]All the puzzles are the same, some of them have slightly different solutions.
[*]Bosses are the same with the exception of last two.
[*]Storywise it’s almost the same like in the original. Claire meets Leon only twice, at the beginning and at the end.
[*]The biggest gameplay difference are that each scenario has access to a few different areas which the other has not.[/list]

Other stuff:[list]
[*]I tried 4th Survivor/Ghost Survivors and didn't bother finishing it. A trial & error speedrun mode. These kind of modes are a mistake of nature, a complete anti-thesis to what the game is about. Same with RE7's Ethan Must Die. At best they are a get-achievement-never-touch-again deal. It could work in RE4, 5, or 6, but not here.
[*]I don’t care about them cutting the giant spiders or moths, for me they never felt like they belonged in RE2.[/list]

That being said I found the replay value on this game to be a bit lackluster, not to mention the story never really felt catching to me in at least Clair's story line, I found her story to be more tedious than fun. One of the main reasons why I probably wont 100% this game ever. Leon's story is really good and it makes up for Clair's boring ass story. However even then I find myself being not very interested in the narrative after the second play-through. Also all of the extra bonus game modes are really fun and challenging but in my opinion way too challenging. I have raged more times over the stupid bonus content than I have playing Getting Over It. It really sucks in my opinion that this is apart of the 100% completion for the game, I still have no idea how to beat the 4th survivor. Overall though the game presented some fun game-play and good boss fights that I did enjoy.

So far, I have finished Leon's story and am part way through Claire's.  Good game.  Challenging at times.  I've never been so careful about conserving ammo before in a video game ... lol.  This game has taunt me avoidance of enemies vs. clearance; most games I have played a strategy of careful clearance of enemies works great whereas here there isn't enough ammo to get every last baddy (and have them stay down).

Anyway, worth the purchase and fun to finally play a series I had enjoyed seeing in film & TV.

I do think the A/B runs were handled far better in the original, which is a frustrating point for the remake as there are certains scenes that were cut in the remake that were amazing in the original, such as Ada sacrificing herself for Leon against mr X, Claire throwing sherrys pendant to get MR X to get submerged in Lava, etc.
