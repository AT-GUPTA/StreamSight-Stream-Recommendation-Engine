This trial version made my game drop from 160 to 40 in the menu, and eventually crash (but it did render the sight)

Third: i unistall all of this software and never will try again, not worth my time.

Some complain of input lag, I haven't had that issue.

You may need to run your game in borderless-windowed. It runs in a Playclaw Overlay, which basically means its whitelisted by all anticheats except VAC (won't work with CSGO)

It has a crosshair lean function, which is... OK, but not really that great. It does have a toggle current crosshair on/off function as well, which is useful. It can even be on hold to hide, which is great for scoping in, etc.

There is an editor that allows you to create any crosshair you could imagine. Or, you can upload a premade image. This is a fairly nice feature.

You can move the offest of the crosshair, which is ideal for games such as Hunt, with an offest screen view.

[strike]One thing that is missing is having a hotkey that could change the crosshair for me - 
Both the ability to press one that cycles my crosshair, and one that is a direct bind to the crosshair, so that it would switch between my hitscan pistol and my ballistic calculator for my sniper rifle when I select said weapons...[/strike]

[B][I]I take it back. IF YOU right click a crosshair IN HUD Sight, you can bind it to a hotkey. WOW> 5 STAR RATED APP

Personally, I see no difference between this app and the overlay provided by a gaming monitor or a red dry-erase marker and don't understand why it would be considered to be a ban/kick offense by Epic.  But, there you go.  Epic reserves the right to arbitrarily ban anyone for any reason.

I've used this with Cyberpunk 2077, Death Stranding, Psychonauts 2, The Forest, and probably some others. It works in both fullscreen and windowed modes.

- New ""hold key to view"" option is amazing. You can assing it to RMB (as inverted) and remove the overlay while aiming down sight.
- Crosshair Editor is dandy. Simple, yet effective.

Helps tremendously with FPS games that has ridicilous crosshairs. If this is cheating, i don't know, guess MSI Afterburner&RTSS is cheating too, or any other FPS counter for that matter.

You can it run it from the .exe directly within the folder, offline, just need to run it once on steam. 

Only downside is that you can never go back once you are aligned with your crosshair 7/24 within your favourite games.

it does have a few issues with images larger than 256x256 and cannot edit images larger than what feels like 150x150 without it clipping the right side off

my graphics card doesn't seem to like me using this with Holdfast Nations At War unless I reboot my pc beforehand, no idea why 


Devs if you read this I have some improvement suggestions:

1: See about making a steam workshop for user submitted crosshairs
2: Add a transparency slider so even if the crosshair is solid colour we can see through it
3: fix the pixel limit issues with large crosshairs
4: Add a few more editing tools, like drag and drop with a coordinate indicator, when resizing crosshairs in the editor you have to manually remove and place every pixel which gets tedious
5: Ability to make odd pixel count images like 61x61 so the exact center can be a single pixel or 3x3 instead of 2x2, would make things easier than readjusting the offset, some games have oddly offset shooting centerpoints that appear to be centered around a single pixel rather than a 2x2 block of pixels
6: Crashing  GPU issues, so bug fixes would be nice",1650554278,1650554278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Editor allows for a great degree of customizability, but could use a few more quality of life changes like color picker (if you are tweaking back and forth a crosshair with more than 1 colour e.g. for outlines), symmetry creation tools, etc. Some people might have also enjoyed a rainbow breathing option, though I think the editor is enough if you know your game's colour palette and you use at least 1-2 colours to make your crosshair pop.

Has a blacklist if you like to leave the program open but you use other programs that do not need it.

The only minor bug that I have encountered is that when you are saving a new crosshair from the editor, moving the text field window results in adding points to the crosshair graph. So really the only thing you have to do is not move the text box window at all.

Would like to see an option to assign more crosshairs to keybinds in order to change on-the fly depending on the weapon or the character you play as. Perhaps even a size switcher too. I was using a script with such functionality in tf2, so I am sure the devs could do that here too.

Good for any first-person game that you devote a lot of time on and that leaves something missing in the crosshair customizability territory. 

The price is ok for the ease of use it provides. I'd recommend it even more heartily if at least some the additions I mentioned were incorporated.",1645010243,1645010386,True,2,4,0.534313738346099854,0,True,False,False

The latest update also allows you to hold a key to enable/disable the crosshair, so you could bind it to RMB and have the crosshair vanish when you want to aim down the sights etc.  

Been using this recently to play Doom Eternal, and I haven't suffered any crashes or frame rate stuttering/lag, so it is working as intended.  Just remember that you need the program open in order to use it, and it should work fine.

Definitely recommended if you are looking for a crosshair app that wont cause lag or frame rate stuttering as most overlay crosshairs do.",1620749059,1620749059,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just create, download then throw in your document folders and load it. If you want to increase the size reload the crosshair on the website and increase there, the in app up-scaling seems pretty blurry.

TIP: Hold CTRL when clicking the offset for manual mode. The x/y axis starts from the center of the screen. 

10/10 so far. 

They're also implementing white-list mode, so it only interacts with the programs you specify, right now its in black-list mode. Their other program has been certified/cleared with almost every major anti-cheat, so this one shouldn't too far behind. BE SURE TO CHECK FIRST!!!

2nd tip: Move program shortcut to desktop to launch without being in game, my time played should be 0 but i didnt try it til later.

Also a quick access in the menu to quickly switch between favourited crosshair would be excellent.

Other than that, it's a solid program. Very low resource usage with minimise to system tray whilst active. Instant launch time, no crashes, also allows the option to import custom crosshairs.

DOOM Eternal has 2 crosshair options:
1. A visually well-made default crosshair which changes with your weapons and gives you additional information. The only problem - it doesn't display a dot in the center for precision shooting.
2. A dot. Nothing else, no additional information, no dot customization.

Now, I want to have a small ""dot"" in the center - that's how I aim and make micro-adjustments. But I also want the nice crosshairs the game offers me.

In comes HudSight to the rescue!
With it, I modified their ""cross + dot"" sight into a simple dot sight, scaled it down to 50% so that it's just barely noticeable and went to town on the demons.

I could not believe how better the game felt and how much more confident I was in my aim. Mind you, I aimed perfectly well without the dot, but it just adds a layer of confidence to my shots that I was missing before.

I'm a developer myself and, while I COULD make something like this on my own, the ""cup of coffee"" price I paid for it makes it more than worth my money and the time-save it provided me.

I play COD Warzone and have been noticing that my gameplay is off and it's hard for me to keep up against better players. I noticed my #1 issue was not being able to see my crosshair easily when not aiming down sights. When I flick on someone I was over shooting or undershooting mouse movement to the target. I play on a top end system with maxed out graphics so there is a lot of screen bling and seeing tiny little white cross hairs on a similar light background was very difficult. What I found out is in some backgrounds during gameplay I just can't see my crosshairs. I downloaded this product, made a neon green circle I can place around my crosshairs to assist me in knowing where they are. My gameplay has improved by 100%. Now I can flick on target and not spend time trying to figure out where my crosshairs are before ADS. Place the giant circle on the target, start spraying rounds as I transition to ADS and use sight/iron sights to kill person. This isn't just for older players but for anyone having issues seeing in games. No clue why COD Warzone doesn't have an option to change color of crosshairs but this program has saved my sanity.",1612038084,1612038084,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False
