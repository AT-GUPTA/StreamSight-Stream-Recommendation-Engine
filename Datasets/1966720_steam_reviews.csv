However I do enjoy this game with its old style graphics and near same layout of every abandoned  place to explore. Once you get the hang of all the tell's for when monsters are around the scare factor still increases a bit because you never know what type of monster is lurking. It can get frustrating from time to time with how often you can and do die. sometimes worlds spawn and loot is harder to come by on the lower difficulty.

[b] Pros; [/b] 
Very Memeable, Not THAT scary (But it can be at times)

Very good if you have friends, or risk online (There can be 10 year olds at times which is a con)

The Yippee Bug.

Pressing the bell at the company when your friends are trying to sell stuff so they all die :3

[b] Cons; [/b] 
No friends means not a lot of fun,

You cannot recreate memes if you have no friends. (I cannot recreate memes :steamsad:)

Online can be annoying as there are people with hacks at times, hidden mods that are client side and not server side (Meaning someone can have a mod without anyone else needing it)

Online is also annoying at times because of A: Echo, and B: Children with microphones (mostly echoey)

The Forest Giant. (Eats your head)
The Thumper. (Eats your toes)
Eyeless Dogs. (Waiter! Waiter! Another mechanical keyboard user please!!)


Overall, I have 22.2 hours on this game and I have not regretted spending £8.50 on it, so I think you should buy it personally if you like horror but also like dying unexpectedly and laughing about it afterward.

If you do buy the game because of this review, Welcome to the Company!
If you don't buy the game because of the review, That's okay too.

> Enter Lethal Company, the game everyone's been buzzing about. Promises of adrenaline-pumping scavenger hunts and heart-stopping monster encounters had me hyped. 💀💰

> But boy, oh boy, was I in for a disappointment. 😤

> Let's break it down, shall we?

> 1. **Low amount of content**: You'd think an intergalactic scavenger hunt would be jam-packed with variety, right? Wrong. Instead, we're treated to a handful of planet exteriors and a few interior rooms slapped together randomly. 🌎🏠 Stuff starts repeating faster than a broken record, leaving you wondering if you're stuck in some cosmic Groundhog Day.

> 2. **Boring gameplay loop**: Land, loot, run from monsters, repeat. Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? Well, it's about as exciting as watching paint dry in slow motion. No real challenge, just a game of luck. Either you make it out unscathed or end up as monster chow. Oh, and forget about fighting back—shovels are your best bet, but even that's a joke. 😒

> 3. **Lack of global progression**: Ever feel like you're running on a hamster wheel with no end in sight? That's Lethal Company for you. Quotas increase until you inevitably fail, and then poof! Your save is wiped, and you're back to square one. Talk about a slap in the face. 🔄💔

> 4. **Graphics that make you want to claw your eyes out**: Ever seen a game that looks like it was designed by a toddler with a crayon? Well, welcome to Lethal Company. The low-poly aesthetic might've been charming in 1999, but in 2024, it's just an eyesore. And don't even get me started on the character animations—they're about as fluid as a rock. 🎨🤦‍♂️

> So, what's the deal with all the hype, you ask? Beats me. 🤷‍♂️

> Don't get me wrong, there are *some* redeeming qualities. Playing with friends can lead to a few chuckles and scares, and there's a certain charm to the chaos. But let's face it: novelty wears off faster than Bob trying to climb a ladder. 😑

> Within hours, I felt like I'd seen it all. One guy plays lookout while the rest scavenge, praying we don't become monster bait. Tension fades faster than a summer tan, and the graphics? Let's just say they're less ""artistic choice"" and more ""lazy Sunday afternoon."" 😑🎨

> With lobbies breaking left and right, modded chaos, and cheaters running amok, it's like playing Russian roulette with your sanity. 🎲🤯

> And don't even get me started on the wasted potential. This game could've been a diamond in the rough, but instead, it's a lump of coal in the gaming world's stocking. 🎮👎

> So, unless you enjoy frustration served with a side of disappointment, save your cash for something with a bit more substance. Trust me, your sanity will thank you. 🙏

> TL;DR: Lethal Company is like a bad blind date—promises excitement, delivers disappointment. [/b]

[i] [b] Sting Featuring Ray Chen (Arcane on Netflix - League of Legends) - What Could Have Been[/b]

I am the pawn you've engineered,
In Lethal Company's twisted game,
And worst of all, to meet quotas I'm smeared,
Suppressing the part that hoped for fame.

I hope you know we had everything,
Till you shattered me, left bits and parts,
I want you to feel my quota plight today,
And I want you to struggle like I do when I play,
With monsters lurking, what could have been,
Oh, what could have been.

Why don't you care for what I am?
What we could have been.

I'm your phantom, lost in code,
You stripped me down, left me worn and torn,
Couldn't care less for the creatures you bestowed,
'Cause I, I was meant to be reborn.

I hope you know we had everything,
Yet you broke me, left my spirit scorned,
I want you to feel my monster stress today,
And I want you to suffer like I do when I play,
With monsters lurking, what could have been,
Oh, what could have been. [/i]

[b]  Title: Lethal Company with the Addams Family

[The scene opens with the Addams Family gathered in their dimly lit living room. Gomez, Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester, and Lurch are all present.]

Gomez: My dear family, tonight we embark on a thrilling adventure into the digital unknown!

Morticia: How delightful. Another opportunity to explore the darker corners of existence.

Wednesday: I can hardly contain my excitement. Finally, a game that matches the darkness of my soul.

Pugsley: I hope there are monsters. Lots of monsters!

Uncle Fester: And explosions! Lots of explosions!

Gomez: Fear not, my dear family. Lethal Company promises all that and more. Now, let us dive into the depths of the digital abyss!

[They gather around a glowing screen as Gomez presses play.]

Gomez: Ah, the eerie ambiance, the faint sounds of terror. It's positively enchanting!

Morticia: [with a smirk] Just like home.

Wednesday: Look at all the abandoned moons we can explore. How quaint.

Pugsley: I can't wait to encounter the monsters. They'll make excellent new friends.

Uncle Fester: And explosions! Did I mention explosions?

Lurch: [grunts in agreement]

[As they delve deeper into the game, they encounter scrap, traps, and monsters.]

Gomez: Ah, scrap! The currency of the peculiar. Let us gather as much as we can.

Morticia: [spotting a trap] How charming. A trap. How thoughtful of them to leave us such surprises.

Wednesday: [encountering a monster] Mother, father, we have visitors.

Pugsley: [excitedly] Can we keep it?

Uncle Fester: [brandishing a weapon] Time for some monster-bashing!

Lurch: [cracks his knuckles in preparation]

[They navigate through the game, facing challenges and overcoming obstacles with their unique Addams Family flair.]

Gomez: What an exhilarating adventure! I feel more alive than ever!

Morticia: Indeed, my dear. It's not every day we get to dance with danger.

Wednesday: I must say, the monsters were quite hospitable. Perhaps we should invite them for tea.

Pugsley: I've never had so much fun blowing things up!

Uncle Fester: [laughing maniacally] I feel like a child again! A very dangerous child.

Lurch: [nods approvingly]

[As they continue playing, the eerie glow of the screen casts shadows across the room, enveloping the Addams Family in a world of darkness and delight.]

Gomez: Ah, Lethal Company. A game truly befitting the Addams Family.

Morticia: Indeed, my love. A perfect blend of horror and humor.

Wednesday: Can we play again tomorrow?

Pugsley: I want to see more explosions!

Uncle Fester: I'm ready for round two!

Lurch: [grins in agreement]

[With laughter echoing through the mansion, the Addams Family continues their adventure into the unknown, embracing the darkness with open arms.]

[The scene fades to black as the sounds of their gameplay fill the air.] [/b]

[i] In the dark expanse of digital space, a game was born,
Lethal Company, they called it, with its shadows and its thorn.
Oh, Lethal Company, you promised thrills and frights,
But beneath your surface, we found sleepless nights.

Your moons were but a labyrinth, a repetitive domain,
With every turn, the same old traps, the same old monstrous bane.
We wandered through your corridors, our hopes held high,
But soon we found our patience wane, as excitement turned awry.

For in your realm, dear Company, boredom reigned supreme,
As we roamed your halls endlessly, like a never-ending dream.
Your monsters, once a terror, soon lost their ghastly might,
Reduced to mere annoyances, fading from our sight.

And as we faced each quota, a burden hard to bear,
We realized, with heavy hearts, you offered us despair.
But still, amidst our grievances, we tried to find delight,
Yet Lethal Company, you eluded us, lost in endless night.

For all your promises of fun, of terror, and of glee,
We found ourselves adrift, alone, in your vast, indifferent sea.
For in the end, it's clear to see, the truth we cannot hide,
Lethal Company, you broke us, in the shadows where we bide. [/i]

I would like to suggest some rework on stormy maps.

Knowing that I spend quite some time on stormy maps, I noticed that you can be safe by hiding a little time under things like infrastructures, boulders, pumpkins and trees.

I don't know if it is intended but I am really enjoying stormy maps with this gameplay.

I would still suggest to have better visuals or auditory clues to tell wheter you are safe or not : I think it will encourage more casuals players to tackle stormy maps in the end.

My last little suggestion would be to make trees more dangerous to stay around in stormy conditions : you end up bonking trees every five seconds and it becomes a little uninteresting on maps like Vow and March, or maybe just less trees.",1708778442,1708780199,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

2. Boring gameplay loop. You land, go in, grab stuff until you see the monster, then run away and bring stuff to the ship. There's no real challenge, mostly just luck. Either you quickly die or make it out. Alternatively, you can try killing monster with shovels, which exposes how bad fighting gameplay is (which is fine I guess, since you're not really meant to do that). 
3. Lack of global progression. Your quota increases until you fail to fulfil it, after that your save is wiped and you start everything from scratch.

The randomly spawning factory and mansion settings ensures that you rarely play the same maps multiple times in a row, providing a different experience each time. It would be nice to have the ability to inverse teleport to plays if they are selected on the monitor, however that is a personal preference.

Discovering the sight and sound mechanics of different mobs is interesting, and you are able to kill a majority of mobs through various means. Some are some that cannot be killed, but it would be nice to discover items in the building that can kill them, or at least temporarily trap or halt them (such as the coil-heads, ghost girl, and worms). 

The spawn rates of mines and turrets is also pretty decent, scuffed at some times with ridiculous high spawns, but is well balanced most of the time. Only downside is land mines spawning in entryways (inside main and fire exits), meaning you die the moment you enter and cannot proceed with game play. It would be cool to unlock or purchase an items which permanently destroys turrets, especially for high turret spawns. 

Different moons and their geographical environments and structures are well though out, are interesting to traverse and impact the game-play in a realistic way. The different weather events affecting the environments, such as rain creating quicksand, is a greatly constructed mechanic. It would be nice to get some new moons to explore in future updates, alongside additional internal layout (current ones are factory and mansion). 

Overall: I highly recommend this game as the game-play and mechanics are well thought through. I have met some great people through this game and believe other would enjoy this.",1708765168,1708765168,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Something wasnt right, every house looked to have a hole in it. i turned my high beams on and saw a silhouette of what looked to be a dog. But the size of a Lion. i soon saw that it had no eyes? as soon as i honked my horn the dog came RUNNING towards me, and it started to shake my car and next thing i know. im being eaten, alive, with no one to help me.

Even my friends playing on years-old laptops with no discrete GPU can play this game with very few hitches due to its visual style, which is my personal favourite part of Lethal Company.

If you have an Nvidia GPU, I'd recommend turning on Shadowplay and set up the instant replay highlights on a hotkey. This game is a GIF generator in the best possible way, and I've caught my friends dying in the funniest possible ways more times than I can count.

My only complaint isn't even directly related to the game - the most popular mod manager is called Thunderstore, and it's laggy and terrible, forcibly bundled with Overwolf - yet another bloated overlay I need to turn off and disable on startup. I hope that Zeekerss - the sole developer responsible for Lethal Company - eventually adds Steam Workshop support, perhaps later in Early Access.

For £8.50, this game is an absolute steal. If you've got a few friends and a spare evening, pick this one up and have a blast. It's worth the hype.",1708729603,1708730768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's fun, first off. I like turning the lights off at night, and having a horror-comedy gameplay session with friends. The proximity chat makes the game SO MUCH BETTER in my opinion. When you're far, you're lonely, and you can plot things to betray your friends, and it can be really funny. Mixed with that is horror, monsters, and dark rooms, and mixed with both of those is a goal to meet a quota by getting loot and bringing it to a ship.

Difference being, though, that you are the subject of that mayhem. Prepare to die a lot, prepare to get bullshitted.

The atmosphere is very stressful, as the game registers your microphone and most of the enemies act based on sound, which limits your communication using the in-game voice chat only. Don't you dare to cheat using Discord, you will lose the majority of the experience the game offers with it's narrow, dark hallways, where you might either find the salvation from getting fired by the corporation, or a scary creature you can't tell your friends about so it doesn't hear you.

Truly it has been mine and my friends' means to hang out during our busy schedules in which it's jut been so much fun. I haven't had such a great multiplayer experience since the early days of Phasmophobia so this was incredibly refreshing. 

Alongside the easy to understand game play the budding lore is honestly really interesting to get into??  The logs that can be found around the map are an interesting read and show how much love goes into this game. 

The monsters-- the MONSTERS are so incredibly cool even just design alone but also how they all function. Learning the quirks of each monster has been such a fun part of the game even if it can be frustrating when I make a personal slip up of not checking behind my back for the Bracken every ten seconds/j. Also the Jester is such a great concept for a monster. Seeing it to the eventual cranking makes even a repeat of the Jester such a nerve-wracking experience because of how just *final* it feels to have the Jester on your tail. Nothing beats the first time Jester experience of having a box on legs trying to harass you lmao

It's a simple premise and it sounds like it's going to be fun but when you scratch the surface away it's not for lots of reasons:

Visibility is awful.  I don't mean the facilities are dark, that's to be expected but everything is foggy, mushy and washed out.  You can't read text on the screens unless you press your face into them, half the time your torch just reflects off the fog in front of you and makes it harder to see down a dark corridor.  It just feels like I'm running around with grease in my eyes constantly.

The interface is very clumsy.  I get the point that doors should take time to open so monsters can grab you etc. but having four hotbar/carry slots and not being able to select items with a key, the only way being to use the mouse wheel which you can't invert and for me it cycles the wrong way (won't bother everyone).  Add in the visibility issue which affects the UI as well and swapping to your utility items is really frustrating.  Not in a challenging way but in a way that feels like it was done as a cheap way to add challenge.

Nothing is explained.  Again, maybe that's supposed to be part of the charm but it just feels cheap/lazy.  How do we use the terminal to open doors?  How do we sell items?  I could go on but almost nothing is explained and it doesn't feel fun to discover it just frustrating that it's not explained and not intuitive.

Communication is a problem.  We played ""fair"" and didn't use Discord while in mission but after finally working out that you can buy walkie talkies and the ship doesn't have a built in communicator you won't have enough cash to buy one for everyone and people not holding one can't hear voices from them very well.  Having someone talk three rooms away drowns out the voice from the teammate monitoring you from the ship who is probably telling you something important.  It's really hard to tell where sounds are coming from or how close things are.

Four of us played this and we're used to communicating on games but this just felt hard work in a tedious way.  I'm sure you can learn the monster patterns and ways to counter them but we just avoided them with help from the poor sod who had to stay on the ship and practise his typing skills instead of having fun.  The increasing quotas again feels like a cheap way to force you to up the difficulty and ultimately die.  The monsters are good for a jump scare but there doesn't feel like any challenge, if you're not careful they surprise you and you die and if you are they never get close.  If it looked a little cleaner and played smoother we'd maybe forgive some of its faults and give it more of a chance but unfortunately I feel like we wouldn't have our minds changed that it is ultimately a very shallow experience.",1708620511,1708620511,False,7,0,0.520067274570465088,0,True,False,True

This could maintain interest and motivate continued play.

The graphics are hideous, not even charmingly so, they just suck, visibility is non-existent to hide the god awful animation and models. Entity behaviour is entirely random and counter-less, or so obscure you basically wander around in the dark until you are murdered, after which there's nothing to do. It's funny listening to your friends try and contact you... the first time, after that you end up spinning up Netflix or something because your bored, at which point you have to ask yourself, is this a good use of time?

We basically figured out how to beat the game reliably within a couple of hours, anyone with a reasonably good set of explorers and somebody good on the terminal and you just avoid the red dots, stick to the safe spots. Since there's no method to ""out play"" the entities there is simply no point engaging with them.

As I write this review DOOM 2016 is on sale for £3.99, LESS THAN THIS HEAP of rubbish. You'll boot DOOM up and be amazed at the fluidity of the graphics and refinement of the genre... or you could cry yourself to sleep and buy this instead.

You can't change that, so my recommendation is to host a game or play with your friends (I recommend muting your Discord once the ship lands). Though I will say, there are nice and chill players here, you just need to search beyond the reprobates, cringe-lords, beta-male orbiters, femcels, and streamers. They have their own agendas and ulterior motives, so I can guarantee that if things turn sour, you'll get the boot. Avoid it, find cool players, just be polite, give them a few chances, and you'll have a hey-day. This is not a popularity contest, and the jester is not funny when he/she is taking a flying dump on other players, so I'd avoid being an obstacle as there are already enough of them that you'll need to overcome as a team.

Let me preface this by saying that The Upturned was one of my favourite games last year, and it placed Zeekerss high-up on my radar. They get horror, they get comedy, they get world-building, and they get writing. In Lethal Company, this one contains a similar flourish, though the horror is more self-serious and enunciated than the comedy is in The Upturned. There are funny moments primarily fuelled by player dialogue and ambient occurrences, but the world is bleak, unknowable, oppressive, and indelibly cruel.

It's accessible, but higher difficulties will give you a run for your money. The game-play systems are quite bare-bones, but the nuances of the game creep in latently, and there's a lot of secret little strategies, contextual details, and patterns that you will acquire piecemeal, learnt in time with a little bit of curiosity and experimentation. They enhance your understanding of the game-world as you acquire them and familiarity becomes your greatest weapon, far more so than a shotgun (though the shotgun is quite good, keep the safety on at all times). Also skips and exploits are possible but it's up to the developer whether such things should be preserved.

In terms of loop, it's minimalistic, but there's a lot of jelly in these doughnuts. This game does a great job at utilising a reductive approach, you're more or less naked aside from your jumpsuit, and the few tools you do have are mostly weak but balanced. They all come with compromise. You can't hoard items. You each have four inventory slots, and as a team you need to plan efficiently as the quota increases. You collect scrap, and deliver it to your employer, The Company. You are dogged by the fauna and weather of the moons (planets more accurately), and when I say fauna, I mean awful monstrous creatures, cryptid-likes, and nightmarish entities beyond accurate description. You loop back over and over again until the quota is unreachable. Missing the quota within the allotted time enacts the disciplinary process. You don't want that. But it will happen eventually.

There is next to no soundtrack. I loved The Upturned soundtrack, but for Lethal Company it works. Some more atmospheric textures and musical embellishments wouldn't be out of place, but sparse is a fitting approach. As a whole, Lethal Company is stark, isolating, barren, and sterile. Your colleagues are your only light in the darkness (unless you have a pro-flashlight). The world feels undead, it seems to want you to die, the creatures help that fact, and even your employer may dispense you.

I'm interested to see where this thing goes, because as far as the core experience is concerned, Zeekerss has nailed it so far, creating a unique horror in a world that I am curious about.

A fun old game overall. 8/10 so far, not as good as The Upturned in my opinion, but it's only a matter of time before I can officially classify that. I want more subtle allusions to the world and more lore-based tidbits to discover while I am playing this game, because as a whole the central experience and minute-to-minute game-play is already optimal thus far.

Sections that mix-up the format and focus on obstacles other than scavenging would be welcome as well, a crash-landing? Space-stations? Isolated combat scenarios? Marooning? Lost cargo? Debris fields? Inside the company? Links to Upturned? The last one is asking too much I know. A little twist of the unexpected goes a long way, but there's plenty of that already.

Playing solo to learn basics had me running in circles. First I had no idea how to look for or find the pod with items bought from store. So, no flashlight I was dead in the water and wasted two days. Second problem I had was finding the door to even get in building. How is a new player supposed to find it without looking at guides first?!?!? Finally stumbled upon it close to midnight third day without a flashlight. Dead in moments by unknown creature. With nothing to turn in at factory HQ I was stuck. Kept ringing bell because I did know the monster was supposed to eat you when pressing too many times. No monster. /delete in-game save file.

Lethal Company is a game that masterfully blends elements from various genres, creating a unique and thrilling experience. In this essay, we’ll delve into the reasons why this indie title has garnered attention and why it’s worth your time.

The Premise
Imagine exploring abandoned lunar tunnels with your closest friends, clad in hazmat suits, scavenging for loot. The catch? The tunnels are haunted, and grotesque, white-eyed monsters lurk around every corner. Your goal: gather valuable resources and safely transport them back to your ship. Welcome to Lethal Company.

The Riveting Loop
The heart of Lethal Company lies in its gameplay loop. Each successful run allows your squad to invest in better gear, from flashlights to high-powered jetpacks. The limited inventory space adds tension—you must choose wisely between essential items like flashlights and walkie-talkies. These tools are crucial for survival but can be challenging to recover if things go awry deep within a dungeon.

Challenges and Cosmic Horrors
The game throws a plethora of challenges and secret dangers at you. Hidden turrets, cosmic horrors, and unexpected twists keep players on their toes. Even in death, the experience remains entertaining. Watching surviving teammates outrun danger or scream while hauling a piece of scrap adds comic relief. The death cam captures these moments, making each playthrough memorable.

Sound Design and Wonder
Lethal Company excels in sound design. The eerie noises, mysterious areas, and frozen moons create genuine horror. It’s not about cheap jumpscares or mindless gore; it’s about the atmosphere—the feeling of being on the edge of discovery.

Multiplayer Magic
The game truly shines in multiplayer mode. Playing with friends enhances the experience. Whether you’re strategizing, laughing, or screaming together, the camaraderie elevates the gameplay. If you have a group of friends who enjoy multiplayer games, Lethal Company is tailor-made for you.

The Work-in-Progress Aspect
Despite its strengths, Lethal Company remains a work in progress. The graphics can be janky, and the lack of a robust story might leave some players wanting more. However, the potential for growth and discovery keeps players engaged.

Conclusion
In summary, Lethal Company offers an incredible multiplayer experience. Its low price point makes it accessible, and the thrill of exploration, combined with the camaraderie of friends, ensures that you’ll lose yourself in its haunting depths. So grab your hazmat suit, assemble your team, and venture forth—there’s plenty left to discover on the frozen moon of Rend123.

Remember, sometimes the scariest things aren’t the monsters in the dark, but the secrets waiting to be unearthed. Happy scavenging!",1708543157,1708543157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lethal Company is an ambitious addition to the world of tactical shooters, offering a blend of intense action and strategic gameplay. Developed by an indie studio, it seeks to carve its niche in a genre dominated by giants. This review aims to provide a balanced assessment of its strengths and weaknesses.

Graphics and Audio (4/5):
Visually, Lethal Company delivers a solid experience. The environments are richly detailed, from urban landscapes to dense forests, creating immersive battlegrounds. Character models are well-designed, though lacking some variety. The game's sound design is commendable, with realistic weapon sounds adding to the immersion. However, occasional glitches and optimization issues detract from an otherwise polished presentation.

Gameplay (3.5/5):
At its core, Lethal Company offers a satisfying tactical experience. Players are tasked with completing missions ranging from hostage rescue to sabotage, requiring careful planning and coordination. The game's cover system and variety of weapons provide tactical depth, encouraging strategic thinking over brute force. However, AI behavior can be inconsistent, with enemies sometimes exhibiting unnatural reactions or patterns. Additionally, the lack of a robust tutorial can leave newcomers feeling overwhelmed, impacting accessibility.

Story and Characters (3/5):
While Lethal Company attempts to weave a compelling narrative, it falls short of its aspirations. The plot revolves around a private military corporation embroiled in global conflicts, yet the storytelling feels formulaic and fails to fully engage players. Characters lack depth, often feeling like archetypal soldiers rather than fleshed-out individuals. Despite occasional moments of intrigue, the narrative struggles to leave a lasting impact.

Multiplayer (4/5):
Lethal Company shines brightest in its multiplayer component, offering intense competitive matches and cooperative missions. The diverse maps and modes cater to various playstyles, ensuring replayability. Cooperative missions are particularly enjoyable, fostering camaraderie as players work together to overcome challenges. However, occasional server issues and matchmaking imbalances can hinder the overall experience.

Replay Value (3.5/5):
While Lethal Company offers a decent amount of content, its replay value is somewhat limited. The campaign, while enjoyable, lacks branching paths or meaningful choices that incentivize multiple playthroughs. Similarly, the multiplayer, while engaging, may struggle to retain players in the long run without regular updates or additional content.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Lethal Company presents a mixed bag of exhilarating moments and missed opportunities. While its solid gameplay mechanics and multiplayer offerings provide moments of excitement, shortcomings in storytelling, AI behavior, and replay value prevent it from reaching its full potential. Nevertheless, for fans of tactical shooters seeking a new challenge, Lethal Company offers an experience worth diving into, albeit with tempered expectations.",1708542094,1708542094,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

Graphics are hit and miss for some people however I feel the lack of HD and 4K modern style give this game a simple quirkiness that is lovable, it adds to the simplicity and goofiness for me, I also like that it makes the game accessible for all as you do not need a powerful computer to play it. 
The sound on this game on the other hand is absolutely out of this world! I would highly recommend game chat as it adds so  much to the experience.

It's early access so yes there are some bugs, but don't let this put you off trying the game they are not game breaking.

Skill level is a non-issue in this game also as you are destined to eventually fail and be ejected into the depths of space. 

The mod support for the game is fantastic which I think will be what keeps the game fresh as vanilla can get a little tiring after a while. 

I really hope the dev team keep the casual feel to the game with further updates, and I am for once excited to see what the next update holds in a game.

It's very affordable and it's guaranteed that you will have a ton of fun (with friends). The graphics are really simple and have a slight touch of some toon shaders that just fit perfectly into the artstyle. It will 100% run on your grandma's computer without a struggle. There is some optimization issues though, but that will definitely get fixed in future updates. The gameplay loop is really simple - you and your team land on various abandoned moons ranging from a pretty safe industrialized desert moon to a very dangerous frozen, rocky moon with lots of unknown entities waiting in the depths of dark hallways for the perfect moment to strike. Your task is to explore said moons and collect leftover scrap to meet your 3-day profit quota. When the deadline finally arrives, you need to immediately sell your stuff at ""The Company Building"". The profit quota increases and then the cycle repeats. What does happen when you don't meet the quota? Well... let's just say you get promptly ""fired"" from ""The Company"" and you have to start over. This game is great with friends but if you're a person who prefers the solo experience, you're gonna have a bad time. The game is awfully hard while playing alone. The RNG might sometimes kill you just because it feels like it and you're going to lose all of your collected scrap. I do not recommend playing Lethal Company solo as it is just straight bullshit. If you're fine with losing your progress over and over again then be my guest but it's not worth it. There is one amazing thing with playing solo though. The game becomes... awfully quiet. There's something about the atmosphere when you're alone that's just frightening. It builds tension really well and you're always on your toes. It leaves you with a feeling that a monster could jump out of every corner. Still wouldn't recommend it. Just get some friends with you and you will have so much more fun! Overall this game is awesome. Even though it's still in early access while writing this review, it still feels like a finished product.

Released amidst a sea of competitors, Lethal Company manages to stand out with its blend of intense action, strategic depth, and a compelling storyline that keeps players on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

Gameplay: 9/10

At its core, Lethal Company offers a highly satisfying tactical shooting experience.

Each mission presents a variety of objectives, from stealthy infiltration to all-out assaults, allowing players to tackle challenges in multiple ways.

The game's weapon customization system is a standout feature, offering an impressive array of options to fine-tune firearms to suit individual playstyles. Whether you prefer silenced pistols for covert operations or heavy machine guns for frontal assaults, Lethal Company has you covered.

Graphics and Sound: 8/10

Visually, Lethal Company impresses with its detailed environments, realistic character models, and stunning special effects. From urban landscapes to dense jungles, each location feels distinct and immersive. The sound design further enhances the experience, with dynamic audio cues adding to the tension during intense firefights.

Storyline: 8/10

While not groundbreaking, Lethal Company's storyline serves its purpose well, providing a compelling backdrop for the action-packed gameplay. The plot unfolds through a series of well-crafted cutscenes and in-game dialogue, keeping players engaged as they uncover the sinister motives of the game's antagonists.

Replay Value: 7/10

Each moon has its own fauna and dangers, which for the most part are static and an abandoned facility, usually with multiple entrances, which is generated based on a random seed, keeping the game fresh and exciting.

While you can venture on your journey alone and try your luck with the unpredictably brutal worlds, where the game truly excels is in co-op play. You can join with either your friends or public lobbies of up to four people. The game actively rewards planning and communication. Even staying behind on the ship, while the rest of the party explores the facilities, is a viable approach. One of the most crucial tools provided by the company is the terminal and monitoring systems on the ship, allowing for one player to observe party members who are alive, guide them to significant pathways for more scrap or an exit, inform them about lurking dangers, open blast doors, and disable turrets.

Though the facilities may seem calm at first, they look undoubtedly eerie. With limited resources, venturing deep into each maze to reach that last piece of scrap for the quota may sometimes seem necessary, but you may soon find yourself lost, panicking, and unable to find your way back. But more importantly, you are never truly alone in the facilities; something far more dangerous than a few turrets lurks in the darkness. Some creatures might not be particularly dangerous unless disturbed, but others will actively seek you out and prevent you from ever leaving.

Graphically, the game may not look stunning, but it doesn't have to be. The subliminal spaces that the game employs, along with simplistic graphics and an intense focus on the details and dangers of the world, are what keep you on the edge of your seat.

The sound design is absolutely phenomenal and heavily works to the game's advantage, especially in the closed spaces within the facility. The echoing sound of footsteps approaching or hearing voices from afar fuels the feeling of dread and excitement.

Overall, the game is not perfect, far from it. There are numerous bugs that may seem unfair. But the company never claimed that anything is going to be fair; the odds were always stacked against you. Eventually, you will lose, you will fail to meet that quota, and when you do, there will be someone else to replace you.",1708481911,1708481911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, Lethal Company broke through my shell and I ended up loving it, and it's not because it's not scary. One thing I appreciate is not having screamers. With games like FNAF, I never liked how the fear factor was just the fear of getting a loud jump scare. This game is genuinely terrifying without needing something to shout loudly into your ear periodically. On top of the scary aspect, the game also manages to be quite funny. I've met a lot of fun people on here and the game is still a blast to play 90 hours later. I don't think I've ever put this much time into a game as quickly as this one. I give it a 9/10.

The most impressive thing is that even when you're terrible at it, it still manages to be fun, which means you can bring along people of all skill levels and they'll still have a great time. It's super fun to rack up huge quotas and keep the company happy, it's equally fun to get absolutely obliterated by a bad dice roll because a disastrous run is usually delivered with such swift brutality that it's hilarious.

The mod community for this game gives it more or less infinite replay value at the moment, which is just an added bonus, but even vanilla Lethal is outstanding. I've played 50 hours and probably watched 100+ hours more. 

The only thing I'd say is that it is absolutely at its most fun with groups of 4 people or more, so I hope that the player limit in the vanilla version is increased substantially (I'd say 8 or 10 as the default limit is ideal) before it goes to 1.0.",1708389689,1708389689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The simplistic gameplay loop is not only designed to make you keep improving skills and pushing your high score, but also leads for boundless fun, especially with friends. This game is tailored to all types of players. The scavengers, the fighters, the explorers, and the people just looking for a casual good time - everyone can find something for them in Lethal Company.

I've always loved such media as the SCP-Foundation, so encountering monsters inspired by such was as much as a horror as it was a joy. Their designs are simplistic, goofy, and sometimes cute, but often terrifying upon first contact. Stumbling upon a new enemy, panicking and adapting to their abilities is all part of the fun.

The items in Lethal Company are what truly keep the game worth playing. They add an unpredictability and utility to the game that can make you feel remarkably stupid yet remarkably clever at the same time. Yes, I can spray my friends with fluorescent paint, but I can also mark my way back to the ship. Yes, I can squish my friends with ladders, but I can also reach places of the map not available to me before. Yes, I can blast music through my boombox and have a dance battle, but I can also lure enemies away with the audio.

Part of what I find so enjoyable about Lethal Company is the lack of information given to you. Often I find games will throw mountains of text at you, explaining every nook and cranny, every tech and tactic, and it can become exhausting and subjugating. Zeekers has done a wonderful job at allowing you to find information yourself in the world, particularly using your 'scan' ability. Finally understanding how a particular enemy or obstacle works, and learning how to combat it, is an amazing feeling, because you know that it was YOU who figured that out.

People may call the art style 'ugly' but I believe it to be genius. It's gritty, it's unsettling and its simplistic nature really lands itself home in my personal love for unique graphics. The world of Lethal Company is not somewhere you belong, and the aesthetics have reflected that perfectly.

The game runs very well on my sub-par laptop, mostly due to the low poly-count, and I have only ever encountered a few glitches (most which made the game funnier and all which fixed with a simple reset on the server). Mods are easy to run, and servers are easy to set up. This is an efficient game with endless enjoyment that I'm sure will keep us all entertained for years to come, and is WELL worth the price. 

Truly, Lethal Company is a game that proves simplism superior.

First, the gameplay is beyond expected from a game like this. Being able to play it again and again with your friends over and over without having the same experience twice is a very rare find these days, especially in the indie game industry. Usually games like these get boring after a while, but I am still finding this game overwhelmingly fun.

Second, the voice chat mechanics are very innovative. An example is when you are being eaten by a snare flea (it's covering your head), your voice sounds muffled to others. Are you in a different room than your friend? Their voice is going to sound different when it comes through a wall. Even the proximity chat is amazing. I've NEVER seen voice chat like this in any game ever, and it's crazy to me that it comes from a fairly new indie dev.

Third, the gameplay mechanics overall are amazing. The main objective (collecting space trash from different moons to fulfill your ever-growing quota for the company) is so simple, yet depending on where you go it's always going to be a different experience. You can encounter monsters, hazardous weather, and even get lost in the facility that you entered. It has amazing replay ability (like I mentioned before) and is a very fun game to play with your friends.

All for the price of $10 or less. There is absolutely no better way to spend your money on Steam than on this game.

The game was made by a furry. (I'm a furry so I have a bit of bias hahaha.)
The game is randomly generated, which is bad ass.
Collect funny little things and sell em'.
It's more of a light horror game so it's not too scary but can give you a scare.

The horror aspect is perfect for a game like this, where you scavenge searching for junk, metal or even lollipops! Lethal Company has it's game solely based around taking risks, and what I mean by that is by searching deeper for junk is very rewarding but the 'entities' lurking nearby will not mess around. This game makes you prone to almost every sound in the game, as the game uses frequent sound queues or even music to hint towards some sort of creature, monster or entity (whatever you want to call it) as if you don't stay aware, a lanky man might just come from behind you and break your neck. Aswell as the horrific monsters like spiders, human-like monsters without legs, big demon dogs with no eyes and even a pile of ooze! There is this quota that you have to reach which is a small some of money that you get from selling the pieces of junk that you find. But if you don't reach the quota, you get fired! (shot into the vast abyss people call space). Lethal Company is purely based on it's cooperative factor meaning playing with others is the most efficient way of playing other than playing alone.

In my honest opinion, Lethal Company's traits sort of clash towards Phasmophobia. if you haven't played this game yet, then there is this terminal that you can use to oversee your teamates location aswell as the location of nearby entities. Because I say that Lethal Company is like Phasmophobia, in Phasmophobia if you're playing in multiplayer mode, you can use a computer in the van to look through cameras aswell as your teamates (but only of they're wearing a head camera). One of Lethal Company's aspects that is like Phasmophobia is their use of walkie-talkies. Both of these games have walkie-talkies that are used to communicate with people that are far away, but in Lethal Company you have to purchase walkie-talkies as for Phasmophobia you get one for free.

(...) For years to come, Lethal Company will be one of the first games that you would probably not find a cheap copy of. This game has been in production for many years now as said by the developer... And I respect that...

Though its graphics aren't the greatest, they are certainly unique and are perfect for this type of game. The various planets are great, each with new environments, mechanics and most importantly entities. There are over fifteen entities to come across when exploring the abundance of facilities. Each one with a horrifying design and some even scarier sound affects. Each entity is fun to come across and makes for really innovative game play that isn't otherwise seen in other horror games. Another fun mechanic is the customisation of the character/ship. There is an abundance of items that can be utilised to decorate the interior of the ship and the character. The items that are used e.g radios, flashlights, spray cans etc are also a cool addition. Obtaining a certain amount of parts from each map can be a bit repetitive at times though. The lore is intriguing as well. The true standout of Lethal Company has to be its multiplayer. It's so fun playing Lethal Company with friends. Especially with all the entities inside the buildings, it will make for some memorable, terrifying and hilarious moments. With some amazing multiplayer and some terrifying moments, Lethal Company makes a great lasting impression. 7.5/10",1708254729,1708254729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has a good VR mod that is feels near-native. I totally recommend getting this if you want a game to have a fun time with your friends. Warning, can be scary for some. Lots of dark areas and enemies that will creep up on you and scare the shit out of you. Also, DO NOT PLAY THIS WITH DISCORD, USE THE IN-GAME VOICE CHAT!

It is genuinely terrifying and also very tense, especially when you cant tell if everyone else is dead. I would definitely recommend if you have friends to play with. The only slight problem I have is that when you get fired you lose everything, it would be nice if there was permanent progress like cosmetics, maybe permanent skins for the characters or even the ships. Another slight problem I have is the water, whenever you are interacting with water it is just a miserable experience, especially when you are stuck in it and cant get out but you arent drowning. But compared to everything else in the game these are just minor complaints. I would be nice for future updates to feature things like new maps that you can visit earlier in the game and being able to join a lobby at any point.

The Graphics might look unappealing but after you play a few rounds you realize that it fits perfectly for the games mood and overall style. A retro looking horror game where you have to bring out scrap from random facilities to sell them to a misterious company for money. During your expeditions you will find some data logs which uncover more and more about the games lore and this is what I love about this game. If you are a individual who loves to explore you can explore maps to find data logs and read them on the terminal for some extra lore. To whoever has a problem with an enemy then I've got to say yes. I can understand but if we take a bigger picture those enemies are just making the overall experience of this game a lot more appealing and fun. If there wouldn't be a challange for anyone then the game won't be anymore. But with this game there are always more and more challanges to be come over to. This is why RNG really carries this game. The different layout and monster combos really turn this repetitive game experience into a challanging and action full gameplay which I simply cannot get enough of.

[h2] COOP MODE - The Right Way To Play [/h2]
Up to you and 3 Dummies collect alot of Scrap, run away from or shovel gang alot of the Enemies; rinse and repeat. Def has alot of Comedy-Horror Vibes, alot of notes takin from SCP:CB when dealing with certain monsters. Alot of screaming, alot of fun; Good stuff. That Rock & Stone wholesome togetherness is here. (Wouldn't mind seeing some crossover content with DRG someday BTW.)

[h2] SOLO MODE - Help me Plz, the Bracken is Comi- [/h2]
It's just you, alot of running, alot of screaming, alot of dying, and none of the fun. The game suddenly becomes ""shit your pants scary""--scarier then even a single night with Freddy. For record--If everyone dies, you lose everything you collected.....""You are 'everyone' now"".... You die, that's it, run's over.  

The only reason why you would ever solo is if your masochistic and doing a Solo Quota 10 Run...or you have no friends (ok, maybe you do but they don't have this game or they are not on.) It's good practice for staying alive but, yea, not fun.

[h2] MODDED MOD -- Thomas The Tank Engine is coming to kill me now. What is this; Sodor Fallout? [/h2]
The Third Way. For record on my part--I don't like modding. It's ether a hassle, corrupts the game files I'm trying to mod, and/or ultimately fixes a broken game that deserves no credit & wins the game awards. Is like using Steroids at the Olympics if you ask me. A game should stand on it's own two legs first before modding it. 

That being said; The game w/o mods is ok, I think. However, everyone and their grandma's grandma mods this game and it requires ether manual editing or the use of some outside-party website and an app that is sketch to me. The site is probably fine but it just doesn't sit well. Workshop support when? Maybe that mod site that DRG uses would work too. 

Some mods do fix or add quality of life like TTS Chat, Prox Radio, being able to buy Shotgun Shells, play YT vids on the TV....Lewdy Models....*Ahem* and other things. As a newcomer (and as anyone should do first)--I wanna get good at Vanilla Mode first before even installing a mod.

[h2] Overall Bottomline - tl;dr [/h2]
Give the game 2 airhorns out of 10 for Solo but 6 of 10 for Coop. Mods n/a. Hope to see this game improve and grow.",1708138458,1708139037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I LOVE co-op games. I also enjoy games that offer more than your average horde shooters, competitive shooters, or other gameplay formulas that have been copy-pasted thousands of times.

I will admit that this game is cheap and not necessarily a bad game, but the overwhelmingly positive review score is an insane exaggeration, in my opinion.

Compared to other co-op giants such as Deep Rock Galactic, Outlast Trials, and even Left 4 Dead, this game's gameplay loop has the depth of a rain puddle. The first 4 or 5 runs are fun and can turn out interesting, but after that, you'll realize there is nothing more to this game than non-stop scavenger missions in uninteresting locations, with some enemies and jokey interactions thrown in.

I can definitely see and acknowledge that this game has a unique premise and design going for it, but I simply feel like the current review score is misleading.

----------------------------------------

[17-02-2024] Edit after more hours playing and seeing the game develop:

Although I still think that the overwhelmingly positive review score is a bit of an overexaggeration, I simply cannot deny that this game has a very compelling charm to it and I am therefore changing my review to positive. And even though the actual gameplay is still very flat on a surface level (imo), the variety in dangerous encounters (not to mention the immense amount of mods available for this game) really does spice up the overall experience. However, I would still not recommend this game to anyone looking for a single-player roguelite. The game is clearly and thoroughly crafted from the ground up to be enjoyed with others, whether they're friends or strangers.",1699787669,1708125739,True,0,0,0.508463203907012939,0,True,False,True
