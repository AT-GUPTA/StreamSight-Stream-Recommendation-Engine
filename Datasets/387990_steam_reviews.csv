Scrap Mechanic does two things very well - you can create vehicles with a high degree of freedom and customize your character. I really liked these portions of the game. The vehicle creation is the perfect combination of intuitive yet complex that is hard to achieve. Aesthetically, the game looks great. It's strong systems as well as the potential it has likely justify its $20 price tag.

Scrap Mechanic has an early combat system that is somewhat lackluster. You hit things with a hammer until you're well into the mid game, at which point there are a few varieties of guns and vehicular weapons. There are two types of enemies in the early game that, while looking good, behave very similarly. The hammer doesn't really have any stratagem involved - you cannot power attack, block, upgrade it or your armor, or heal during combat. You can hurl water out of refillable buckets at your enemies to momentarily stun them (and enemies do a reasonable job of dodging to make you time this carefully), but eventually you end up swinging with your hammer again and trading blows. Combat becomes a chore since you have to slowly regenerate health between fights or exploit the nearest body of water to reliably fight off 3-4 enemies.

As your progression to mid-game is largely blocked by your ability to acquire scrap metal, components kits, and circuit boards, the game ends up steering you away from activities that it does well and are entertaining back to a combat system that is arguably less well developed than Minecraft's. This is true for both picking out new clothes and building sick rides - you keep getting funneled into raiding ruins for the aforementioned goods so you can build the next vehicle part. I wouldn't even say that this experience is bad so much as it just feels tedious. 

I would suggest the following for future development:

1. Improve early game combat with the hammer by making it quickly upgrade-able with scrap metal and/or giving the player other melee combat abilities (power attacks, blocking, healing during combat, etc.). Consider increasing scrap and component rewards to circumvent the tedium, since this steers the player back to what the game does right faster.

2. Decrease the crafting requirements for the level 1 chest and offer this in the initial craft bot menu. This will give the initial 'scrap' vehicle that is slower than the player can run an actual purpose beyond being a tutorial car.

3. I would consider making crafting stations craft-able by the player. Location locking where you can create these on the map feels limiting to me, though I appreciate that you can move them once created.

I think this is especially important since players could refund the game before getting to the more enjoyable portions of it.",1708909998,1708909998,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are three main game modes: Creative, challenge, and survival. 
Creative is great for people who like making shit. Also, the in game world editor expands these possibilities. This mode is the core part of the game and is what you are mainly paying for at this time.
Challenge mode is good for puzzles and sharing yours with other people. Think of it like the type of game Portal and Portal 2 are centered around. This time while making shit, you can have people walk around your shit via Workshop.
Survival is ok. It has grind but not too much. There isn’t a whole lot of content either at the moment, only a small story in the very start of game play. Mods [strike]aren’t[/strike] [b]are now[/b] officially integrated into survival, called custom gamemodes. Some examples are Fant Mod, centered around new tech, and Crashlander, centered around a story.

When you die, you drop all your stuff. So, you go to find new things, lose all your old gear, respawn far away, and without your stuff, it is now much harder to reclaim your stuff.

- Change light and day time to see light effects
- Rail systems missing
- small wheels, rail wheels
- robs
- gear wheels (all kind of those)
- air plain parts,wings, rotors to build plains and helicopter
- a static third eye camera perspective to avoid continue moving within 3D world.

- water simulation, rivers, waterfalls, see
- building boots and ships
- more easier way to switch between those three toolbars

Well, 2 years later, nothing came up.

Game is fun, I really enjoyed it, but there's a moment I was hoping more from the game as promised by developers.
Actually, they are just teasing on twitter some features (when they take time to care about their community) every 6 months but no content release nor update to make the game optimized.

I'm starting to think they will release the 1.0 version as is without any further optimization... I hope I'll be wrong (and be glad to change/delete my review).

Your imagination is the limit when it comes to creating solutions to any of your problems.  Bearings, engines, logic gates and timers let you go nuts with your creations, well beyond just vehicles.  Automate your doors and lights in your base, put your base on your car!  Have some pistons and timers?  Slap a watergun and tank next to your farm with just a few sensors and auto water your crops when needed.

Imagine building a car that you swear will revolutionize the automotive industry, only to witness it doing the cha-cha with a tree before bursting into flames. Scrap Mechanic is that perfect blend of creativity and calamity – a masterpiece of engineering followed by an epic fail that leaves you wondering if you should stick to simpler hobbies, like knitting or napping.

Physics, the unsung hero of Scrap Mechanic. Prepare to witness the laws of nature take a vacation as your vehicles somersault through the air like acrobatic whales attempting synchronized swimming.

Back then, the game had really great promise and actually had semi-regular updates. [spoiler](Real shocker, I know!)[/spoiler] Development eventually slowed down, but not so much that it felt like the devs abandoned us. Once the Survival Update hit in 2020 [u](almost exactly 4 years after I bought it)[/u], I thought development would pick back up.

[h1]BOY WAS THAT A FREAKING LIE!!![/h1]
After Survival released, we had only a few other updates, one to fix and restore Challenge Mode, and the other to update creative mode with the new stuff. After that... nothing. Occasionally a Devblog or small (And I mean [i]small[/i]) update, but still nothing.

4 years later in 2024, still nothing. Near total radio silence. Supposedly they post teasers or something on Twitter, but I haven't even seen anything that looks good in those post as it is. I don't even use Twitter anyway and I genuinely couldn't care less what happens there.

There are many games that entered and left Early Access in less than half the time since this game first became available. 8 years is clearly more than enough time to make a quality game. The developers keep saying ""We're working real hard,"" and ""The next update is coming soon,"" but in the last 5 or so years, they have failed to deliver on any promises they've made outside of delivering Survival mode. Unless they have some [b]MAJOR[/b] comeback, and [u]actually[/u] start producing regular updates and manage to maintain some level of contact with the community, then the game is going to end up Dead On Arrival.

   You know when the last major update was that actually added content? It was 3 years ago. 3 years. On top of that, you hardly ever get any updates on how progress is going and the developers haven't said anything to the community for over 4 months. This is an amazing game with amazing potential, but it's run its course. These developers are severely neglecting this game and its community to the point that it's on its last legs.

Just a couple months ago they filed for the trademark for the name ""Crew Commander."" How about instead of making this ""Crew Commander"" game, you command your dev team to do their job? 

   Scrap mechanic is the embodiment of great potential with little care. It all solely relies on its community to provide content to the game because the studio that made it can't do so itself. At this point, the people in the game's community have probably made more content for the game than Axolot themselves. I would like you to picture Scrap Mechanic without mod support and without custom tiles, maps, community creations, and mods. How long would you play? All of those are because of the community. They are the life force of the Scrap Mechanic community and it's dying. 

  It's sad. Sad that such a promising game has had such neglect. Sad that such a hopeful community has been abandoned. Sad that this game studio cannot set its priorities straight. Sad that we might never see a full release of Scrap Mechanic. Axolot, please fix your dying game.

-This review is a summary and my closing thoughts on what this game is from long-term experience playing it. I will also share my thoughts on it as an amateur engineer.


General review.

     This game released into early access when I was in middle school. Most of my experiences came from the years predating survival mode (I still do not consider survival mode, and I will get to those reasons later on). As of the time of this review, I am a freshman in college studying mechanical engineering partially because of this game's existence.
     In the first 3 years of this game, I got into a booming community with many up-coming YouTubers who created their own communities. I spent most of that time doing casual building and making friends. At the time, the limitations were up to how much fun you can have with others, and how much you can contribute to a community.
     Survival came along, and the game died. All of the game's focus went towards grinding in survival mode (not fun) and discovering (a lack of) story. When I mean ""died"", I mean, the community would never return to the fun state that it started in. YouTubers had been leaving the game to pursue other, more rewarding games and content creation that would result in the immense success of those content creators.. but nobody seriously came back after survival's release in 2019.
     Between 2019 and present day, my experiences have been about pushing the game's creative mode boundaries. Not often have I played with friends to just mess around, nor have I returned to casual playing - because that became boring, especially with no community to look forward to taking part in. For fun, you must take on a very pro-level project such as replicating something from real life, putting a ton of details into a build, or build a ""Hide and Seek"" map. Chances are, the game will become boring because it lacks the ability to discover, progress, and as of today's state of community, well, a lack of community.

     Why don't I consider survival mode? It is because it put a big dent on the game's potential. The developers are stuck in a loop of what they wanted their game to be from the start. They have never paid attention to their own community, they have never made any attempt at all to try to connect with their community. As a result of the bad connection, the community faded. We now have a game that has little ties to the people who actually played in its early stages. Survival's development halted the potential of the game because 6 years of time was spent to add content - with no improvement on the game. You will encounter a bug, glitch, or lack of optimization at minimum once every time you play the game.

     Why did this game have potential? It is because of what the game is at its core. It is an open world physics sandbox that is nothing like any other game. You can build creations that are a part of the world, build a house, build a car, build a plane, any form of transportation you can think of, all in the same game. Build a city block-by-block? sure! You can even do programming with integrated logic parts, let alone the fact that you can control mechanical mechanisms using logic. The modding community (of the past) worked really hard to to create what the community wanted, to see through the game's potential, and take advantage of it, which enhanced the possibilities. It is because of the game's core that I loved it, and I would recommend it to anyone for those reason.

     What is the game now? The game is now ""Scrap Mechanic Survival Mode"" and NOT ""Scrap Mechanic"". People come to this game because of survival mode, which is not the iconic identity of the game. Survival mode is a disappointment due to a lack of story and progression, LOTS of material grinding, and no clear end goal. The only reason to play survival mode years-on-end is to build a pointless base. You do not even need to build anything to 'complete' this game. Just build a basic vehicle, and live in a pre-generated structure. Since this is considered as an 'engineering sandbox' I was expecting survival mode to have more automation, the need for specialized transportation systems, a way to build a running civilization, but no, the focus is on the story, world exploration, boss fighting, and a lot of resource grinding.
     To put into perspective, I played survival mode between the 2019 release, and 2020. I completed everything there was to complete, and I got bored. Building a base was all that I could do, and I never saw a clear end goal in needing to do that. I would rather build a bunch of cool stuff in creative mode than waste hours grinding away at getting materials just to 'automate' or 'advance' something with no end-goal use. It is currently post-2023 and the developers have still not made a major game-changing update since the survival update in 2019. This game might as well be abandon-ware for that reason.


Game perspective as an amateur engineer.

     This is a fun game to pass time, explore mechanics, and for younger people, a great way to introduce yourself into engineering. You are limited by very basic mechanic principles, which is just enough for beginner exploration - It is what got me interested in engineering and design.
     Do I recommend this for professionals? no. It is advertised as a game to ""engineer your adventures"" but the reality is, there is no adventure to 'engineer' and you will do zero engineering. Sure, designing an advanced survival mode farm with self-defense systems for 'raids' is engineering, however, that is just about the only thing in this game that has a problem to solve with many ways of doing it. For the level of engineering required to play this game, any kid can do, which is fine, but that means that there is no advanced problems to solve, you can only create your own advanced problems by over-engineering what is already easy to do. Survival mode aside, in creative mode you must accept that what you build is more so for the art of building and designing, which is true about creative mode of any game. You never get to actually solve problems.


Why I still play this game.

     I only play this game as a hobby. It is a way for me to relieve my brain of the creativity need especially when I do not have available time or resources for real life projects. With that said, just about any game can relieve me of that need such that I do not depend on this game. Unfortunately, the only way to feel accomplishment in this game is to do a large project, which either results in many flops, or a creation that gets little attention from the wrong people. If you design a build for the intent of engineering something for other players, a player will spawn it in to check it out once, and never look at it again. No point in trying to do advanced engineering for that reason. So, I am left with just building things for myself for fun. The game is just another tool for that, and is not unique from any other game.


What this game should have been.

     This game never needed to be a physics sandbox. The developers should have focused on the story aspects of a basic survival building game. It could have been a lot more like Minecraft, a creative and survival game that has no physics or mechanics to it. If the focus of the developers is truly on the survival mode story, they wasted their time by designing a physics sandbox game. Up until now, the game's design could be modified to not majorly rely on physics or building with mechanical parts. 'pre-sets' could have been used to make vehicles, with players not needing any background knowledge on how to build things.
     Long story short, this game from the beginning had untapped potential, with the wrong developers, and the current development of the game does not require a highly potential physics sandbox to achieve. There is more to the game than there needs to be.

This game doesn't even launch without internet access! Moreover, it seems to have been forgotten by its devs.

[h1] Cons[/h1]
[list]
    [*] [b]No offline mode[/b] (Main reason for the thumb down)
    [*]No LAN multiplayer
    [*]Early access, in development for many years, and there are lots of bugs around still...
[/list]

[h1] Pros[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Lots of options to be creative: microcontrollers, logic gates, pistons and more!
    [*] Survival mode is really fun and it has a lot of potential
    [*] Some very cool mods: Crashlanders, FantMod, and some great challenges too...

At the basic level, you will probably design a car for travel, a machine for cutting trees, and a machine for mining stone. After that, you need to find a reason to build anything else, as there are very few reasons to proceed with farming or exploration within the game world. The only additional material beyond those basic activities are the warehouses, which are like a sort of dungeon with rare loot at the end. Personally, I find the warehouses to be extremely challenging and very fun, and I have a lot of ideas for tiny vehicles for breaching them.

But, here's where things get odd.

This game was first released 8 years ago. The last devlog on their own official website is from 7 years ago. Their Facebook page was last updated 4 years ago. Twitter is similarly dated, although at least has posts from within a year ago. Despite this, there are devlogs posted on the publisher's website (Axolot Games) showing off planned content from as recent as last year (and a hotfix was released only a couple months before my posting this review). In other words, the game [i]is[/i] being worked on, but the dev team is essentially no-contact and the whole situation feels like the game has been abandoned.

Despite this, I have been having a blast and I don't see myself slowing down! I spent a week designing a tank with complex driving logic and a high-volume rotary cannon for killing big red bots and [i]it actually works as designed[/i].

In my opinion, this is a complete game. If no new content is ever added, it's still a very enjoyable sandbox of blocks. I can readily do things in this game that I have wished for years that I could do in Minecraft. Like I said, it's LEGO with no instructions, but the box of parts is overflowing.

For the gameplay itself, in spite of what you might read about the physics engine, it's surprisingly reliable. For example, I built a scissor lift that actually functions as intended. I also built a hanging bridge that forms a proper catenary when draped. None of these things lag out my system. People have built actual working piston engines.

For comparison, I once tried to build a bit of landing gear in Space Engineers that was an arm on a hinge pushed out by a piston and it caused my entire ship to slowly rotate due to phantom forces, even when stationary. That is quite possibly the most simplistic machine linkage that anyone could ever build, except perhaps a lever. Yesterday, in Scrap Mechanic, I built a Scott Russell linkage that functions perfectly (just Google it, it's neat).

That said, it does get weird when you use a spinning thing to spin a thing.

The music is nice. The dynamic lighting looks really good when done properly. The enemy AI is a mixed bag. It's a bit clever, but not brilliant, either. The story is about 3 minutes long and doesn't even cover the bare minimum (ie, it doesn't explain trading).

Survival mode is very fun once you get rolling, but the initial start is the most disrespectful game I have ever played in terms of the player's time. It takes [i]hours[/i] of manual farming and grinding just to get the basic materials you need for chests and a small vehicle that isn't absolute ass. Farming glue is a horrendous waste of time that I literally just bypass by cheating (the only thing in survival that I cheat at, but I do it shamelessly in this case).

If you like designing machines to solve specific problems, buy this game! Which is to say, if you ever wanted to get into designing robots, or have very fond memories of MindStormz LEGO, then it is a ridiculous amount of fun.",1706541811,1706542345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Don't spend a dime on this, nor their other titles. Go get yourself space engineers or something similar.

Those toasts taste awful and one nearly burns your entire house down
Desperate for toasting glory you search for some toast videos on youtube
All these people making enoromous and gloriously looking toasts make you jealous and sad
One day, you discover that you sorta don't need to make overcomplicated toasts to enjoy your snack. You also notice tiny differences between toasts and their preparation
You finally enjoy a proper toast, but the more you eat, the hungrier you get
Your hunger for toasts gets bigger and bigger with every known recipe
You start modifying your snacks and try challenges from other toast fans
You achieve toasting heaven, nothing can stop you now, you have mastered the art of toast. You begin preparing your masterpiece.
After several hours of hard work you end up burning it.
You look back at all your progres, and you realize that you don't have to make every toast perfect. It's in the dedication, will to learn from your mistakes and enjoying little victories on long and hard path.

This game is sweet combination of pride, joy and relief you'll feel after every successful mission although you also get hours of excrutiating pain, swearing and mental breakdowns. Get this game for full price, it's worth every penny.

main problem is that the devs seem to have abandoned the game as the last update was a hotfix in november 2023 with the last update prior being from over a year prior, the game is still far from completion with a major part of the game missing as there is still no ending to survival and the last dev log from when the devs were active shows something that we still haven't gotten including new enemies, new ruins, new building blocks and updated survival progression.
Until the game gets support and updates this review will stay as a not recommend which is hard for me to say as I have followed this game through development since near the beginning and have had countless memories with friends or even alone on creative worlds building things and having fun.

The tiny chunk of the story mode is quite good too. And I do admit, I did have quite a bit of fun playing through it.  But the ""story"" runs out almost instantly. The gameplay becomes a neverending stream of repetition after just a few hours. You can still progress your game, build more stuff, like better vehicles, farms, bases, defenses, etc. But it won't change the fact that at a certain point, nothing new happens. Not to mention, all this may be wasted when (if) the ""chapter 2"" update ever drops.
Because yes, that's the biggest issue with this game, the devs seem to post lots of fancy ideas in their devblogs, but the pace at which they are pushing updates is non-existant. The game was released back in 2016 and since then it did have a few minor QoL updates, but only 1! major gameplay update which introduced the ""story mode"".

The only thing that somewhat saves the game, are custom game modes (basically better versions of existing survival mode) made by tallented members of the community.

Is short:
If you want a game where you can just build wacky stuff and don't care too much about weird physics - Scrap Mechanic is totally servicable.
If you expect a story-rich survival experience - this is NOT the game for you. (and with dev's snail pace of updating, it won't be, for a very long time)",1705236307,1705236307,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

After spending considerable time in the world of 'Scrap Mechanic', a game that's been on the market for seven years, I find myself at a crossroads in terms of my recommendation. This title, at its core, is undeniably fun, especially when playing with friends. The collaborative elements and creative freedom offer an engaging experience that shines in multiplayer mode. However, this enjoyment is marred by significant drawbacks that cannot be overlooked.

One major issue is the story mode. Initially, it presents an intriguing concept filled with potential, but this quickly dissipates as you encounter its limitations. The deeper you delve into the structures and the world, the more apparent the game's unfinished nature becomes. Game breaking bugs are not just occasional annoyances; they are frequent enough to halt progress and diminish the overall experience.

Despite being in the market for several years, 'Scrap Mechanic' still feels like it's stuck in an early alpha stage. The lack of development progress is disheartening. It's as if the game has been abandoned by its developers, leaving a skeleton of what could have been a fully fleshed-out adventure. This sentiment is further exacerbated by the developers' habit of promising new content and updates, which, as time has shown, seem to be empty promises. This ""carrot on the stick"" approach does little more than build false hope among the player base.

It's a peculiar situation. On one hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the initial stages of the story mode and was genuinely excited about the potential 'Scrap Mechanic' had. There were moments of true enjoyment and creativity. However, after years of waiting for improvements and content that never materialized, my patience and enthusiasm have waned.

In conclusion, while 'Scrap Mechanic' can offer fun moments, especially in multiplayer, the myriad of issues, from game breaking bugs to unfulfilled developer promises, overshadow these positives. It's with a heavy heart that I find myself unable to recommend 'Scrap Mechanic'. The game, in its current state, is a shadow of what it could have been, and it's a disappointment to see such potential go to waste.",1705189768,1705189768,False,58,4,0.758379697799682617,3,True,False,True

Furthermore, the glitches negatively impact the game's immersion and challenge. Instead of focusing on the creative aspects of building and problem solving, I find myself constantly battling against the erratic behavior of the suspension, which takes away from the joy of experimenting and perfecting my designs.

This game is a bit like Valheim and Sons of the Forest with it's survival mechanics (i.e manage your hunger, thirst & HP) and combat however the building is quite unique in this game as it mixes a cube/grid placement system with the freedom to use inventory items as well as building materials and built objects. 


I'll give it a score of 8/10, it loses 2 points because; 
there are 'quality of life' improvements that can be made to the building, general game-play, combat, physics and multiplayer connectivity. From what i have read, the development team has abandoned this game which is sad because it has a lot of potential and i feel that this game could do quite well in the current market of survival-builder games.

Post 2023 and the devs still communicate as much or little as you would expect based on anyone who is going to critique the game for its worth will tell you. Sadly the game is still where it was when survival was left. The patches have helped maintain some sort of relevance to it but sadly the devs just drag their feet on communicating to the community. They probably are hard at work on chapter 2 which was rumored to release sometime but after 2 years of survival quiet I am beginning to think they don’t care what the community feels or perceives their lack of communication as. Maybe one day ADev will become the dev we truly would like to see them be when this game first had hype and following. Now it feels more like a rundown town with a mayor and a one legged sheriff.  

Woaw as a patch update you have done something to your coding because nothing works right. Bearings go whatever direction they want, tires and engines do what they want, this game is working toward the boneyard.

vvvPre 2021vvv
As an early access game I am very happy with what I am seeing. Very excited to see where the creators and developers go with this before the full release.

UPDATE
Game used to be fun granted it still works in its current state as it was left with its somewhat stable physics if you set it to advanced. Not sure why or how but the devs have decided the little news about development approach is best for its community, while the entire community is going back and forth at each other over whether or not the devs are still working on it. Seems like devs have zero care for their community, develop things that make the community go ""You went that route?"" (Like stupid clothing articles that do nothing for hit-points or protection in the first place. The game is under developed and behind as far as its community is concerned. I had high hopes for this game but with the lack of information I guess we can deem this a lost cause...",1602730532,1704400462,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,3,True,False,True

i stopped playing because of lack of new content.

so dont get it and think there will be more than there already is.

       In the current build of the game 0.6.6, there are performance issues that just make the game unplayable with advanced physics (also the only valid physics setting for anything). I would have said nothing about this if I was playing on a potato laptop with an Nvidia 1050 and some old Intel CPU, but I am instead playing with a Radeon 7900xt and  a Ryzen 7800x3d, both being high end, and nearly reaching the top in gaming performance. Now don't think that performance issues are going to be met all the time like on most new releases, but you will meet them and will be painfully obvious, be it a new complex build that makes extensive use of a lot of pistons, blocks hitting each other (frames drop whenever you are about to hit builds that aren't welded to the ground or on the lift, doesn't happen to small stuff, i.e blocks or just parts, but to bigger builds like vehicles, robots, anything that can move). Sure, maybe this is pretty hard to optimize, but consider this a warning if you will buy this game that big builds will set you in the single digits frames if they are about to hit another build. Sure it's in early access but that isn't an excuse for horrendous performance.

         Another problem you may encounter is doors not being able to close, simply why, it can fit inside the door frame, and it is one just stuck on the frame not closing, needing you to update the build's weight/mass (spray a block or remove/add one to it) to get the door closed, this I feel like it has something to deal with hitboxes because I get stuck sometimes to the wall whenever I am running alongside it. Maybe the door issue is on me and I suck at making working doors or the fucking hitboxes are made bigger than they seem (being 1 mm bigger in volume). A small inconvenience but one that occurs every time I close any door. (this happens to doors that use bearings, haven't encountered a problem when I was using a door based only on pistons). 

          Also outdated tiles that haven't been updated to use the trees that can be cut since survival launched. Very annoying cause those tiles look great and I want to cut those trees to be able to make a house in that area.
         Time for the small stuff, lack of proper console commands, being able to change gamemodes, i.e survival to creative and vice versa, would also love if we got a no clip gamemode which is creative but lets you clip  trough the walls.
          Now that I got over the bad parts of the game, here is the good stuff.
          
          This game has AMAZING community content, mods that give more blocks to build with, more interactive blocks to use and there also community made tiles and maps, there are also builds that have been uploaded to the workshop so you can mess around with them, take inspiration from them, (you can steal the logic systems from those builds have and use them for your own), of course you can also upload what you have made to the workshop. There are also mods that offer new content.

          Scrap Mechanic doesn't have the most jaw dropping graphics, but also doesn't have the worst ones, they are alright honestly.
          
            Creative with friends is nice, you can have a demolition derby by using cardboard or glass and some spud guns put on top of your car or some other spot, making it stand out, or just plain up build cardboard tanks and see who is the more skilled builder and driver/gunner

            Overall, if you don't care about getting content updates, buy the game while on sale, if you do care about the content updates, wait until this game finally gets that big content update and only after that should you consider buying it. 
            I want to add I haven't played most of survival as I haven't found it fun. Did play with a friend and the experience got better, but we haven't continued playing. Not the review to look for if you want something about survival.
            It sucks that the only game that has most of the freedom of Minecraft and has the technical aspects that allow you to make working vehicles and robots, is stuck in this cycle where we don't have any content updates  that I believe are needed for the game.

(But if a developer does see this comment update the game already or mi gonna cry)

(wait for the game to go on sale before buying it though idk how worth it is for full price considering its been in early access for 8 years or something like that)

The only negatives are some glitches, but this game is still early access and some could argue that you can make cooler things by exploiting them. Overall I love this game and can't wait for the upcoming survival update.

UPDATE (24/12/23):
Survival has released yay! The update was massively hyped and took forever but it added so much new content and changed the entire game. After the survival update dropped I personally was expecting that to be the end of waiting for updates, I figured they would happen much more often moving forward. Oh how I was wrong. The lack of updates makes it hard to keep playing the vanilla game, however hopefully when chapter 2 drops it will be awesome and won't disappoint. The best update so far in my opinion however is the addition of modding support, people can now add their own content, which to some degree makes up for the lack of vanilla content. I still recommend this game and think it is fun to mess around in, their are performance issues and issues surrounding their update schedule that need to be worked out but just looking at the game in its current state I definitely recommend it and I believe you'll enjoy what it has to offer.",1573030575,1703421044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Graphics and UI: It has a colourful art style that is consistent throughout the game and ok shadows making the game generally look great. The UI is clean and easy to navigate. The menu screen lets you build things in it's background making it very customisable. My only complaint is that the graphics are calculated on the menu screen so my computers fans run loudly even when I'm not playing the game. Overall- Great

Performance: Depending on your computer, the game can almost be unplayable at times. If I spawn in two slightly complex creations next to each other, My FPS drops to 20. You can turn down the physics quality but that makes any vehicle completely collapse in on itself. Overall- Bad

Updates: It only has one big update every 2-3 years because of the small number of developers. But, when the updates do come out, they are massive and completely change the game. Overall- Bad 

Creative Mode: You can create your own tiles or stick together the default ones to make any world you want. You can build with infinite resources and spawn in saved structures on a lift. Overall- Great

Challenge Mode: It has well designed levels that get progressively harder and introduce more game mechanics as you play. It also lets you easily download more community created levels so that you never run out of them. Overall- Great

Survival Mode: Similar to Minecraft's survival mode. Its well balanced but quite empty and unfinished at the moment. Its very fun and half of my playtime was spent playing survival. Overall- Great",1702761589,1702761589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

TL;DR: The game is super glitchy. The physics are broken. It lags even on a fast computer when you make something even a little complicated. It freezes and crashes, sometimes the whole computer. Maybe good for messing around but serious gameplay is basically impossible.

So I got this game because my friends wanted to play it with me. I had fun making some cars and stuff but then I wanted to do something more ambitious. I tried to design a cannon using thrusters to propel a projectile. Problem is: the game's physics engine is EXTREMELY limiting.
Try to move something to fast? It will clip through and break. Try to spin something on a bearing fast? It will distort and probably break. Try to connect something (like a suspension spring) that's half-extended to another thing with the weld tool? Sorry. Want to control a piston to be able to stop at multiple points? no. Even when I used a popular glitch (potato guns shooting destructible blocks that transfer the momentum to the ammo) to design a gun, it would sometimes just explode or not shoot anything. I can't even aim it down, because when I try, the physics can't calculate the new angle and it just clips the ammo straight through the turret, exploding the whole thing! It's like a sandbox game, but creativity and complex design is just banned. Oh yeah, also it's super taxing on your computer. I have a ryzen 3700x (brand new with the motherboard as well!) and the game lags with just one of the glitchy tanks I made. The game also freezes and crashes. I'm making this review after the game crashed my whole computer (I had to reboot twice!).

Survival needs polish.

****This game has been abandoned.****

I hope i'm wrong but with the lack of communication and rumors on reddit it's dead. They got their money and left. With that said any game from Axolot Games should be thrown in the trash. If a developer can't live up to their promise or at the very least communicate they aren't worth anyone's time.

Too bad, i was excited to see this game finish and grow.

Previous review:
I'm a big fan. The physics are developing well, I really enjoy the build freedom, the game is a lot of fun. I'm hoping for some quicker development however. My backlog is starting to turn into an Early Access graveyard. There is a good update on new bot baddies coming so that's great to see. They are working on it, i'm just growing skeptical or maybe cautious is a better word on early access games. I have too many taking a really long time to get near a 1.0 launch. 

BUT keep it up dudes and dudettes! Very promising so far!",1646962181,1701889543,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The building mechanics are incredible with a physics system that is deep and robust. You can almost quite literally build anything that you can imagine. The limitless freedom with intense levels of potential creativity forge a wildly enjoyable experience. This applies to both Survival and Creative mode. Specifically, the functions of the pistons and bearings make for some incredible inventive opportunities. Combine that with the switches, controllers, and buttons to control your machinations down to the last block.

Being multiplayer is another gold star feature that should just be a baseline addition to any large scale game like this. Being able to goof around with friends and theory-craft off of each other in real time is absolutely phenomenal. It is also fair to mention that the multiplayer stability is fantastic, even with massive amalgamations of technology. 

The only cons I could see are that the game itself is very slowly paced in the beginning and that some people might not prefer the stylized art style. These are very much by design, so it boils down to personal preference in these situations. Aside from that, performance can be an issue with more ""ambitious"" builds. I would assume these are just technical limitations that will be addressed in the future, though.

As for improvements to the game itself, I do have a few suggestions. Large dedicated multiplayer servers would be one off the top of my head. More food recipes would make the early and late-game much more fulfilling/varied with the crops you have access to. Mob variety is big with me, but I understand that is the focus of the next large patch, so I won't linger on that notion. I would also like to see a larger variety of weapons, primarily the ability to use different melee style weapons aside from just the hammer.

All in all, I understand the lack of new content. As long as they work as hard as they have on this base game, we will see something that is more than worth the wait and that will be truly magical to experience.",1701830465,1701847943,True,2,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,True

Edit:
So, it's been a few years, and even I must admit that this game is being developed at such a negligible pace, that well, it might as well not have a development team.

it was fun to be able to build vehicles, structures, catapults, etc.

When survival mode was released I was excited, I enjoy the survival mode for some time, but then the excitement of things being new went away

It seems in the survival mode (at least for me) a lot more time is spent working to get more materials than having fun having fun building.
I tried a custom game mode call ""less grind"" which was fun.

Recently I tried making a catapult, and a projectile was launch downwards through the ground, what the game used to do when and object went through the ground was teleport the object up a the lowest height the object could be above the ground and not colliding with any other objects.

But I couldn't find the projectile, I tried riding a chair as it was launched through the ground after some time falling I was teleported high above the ground but the seat went missing.

To me it seem like the game removed the seat and the projectile, to me it seem the scrap mechanic devs changed the game to punish the player for exploiting the glitch, but to me it seems the game punishes the player just for encountering the glitch.

I think a lot of people have been asking for the game to be easier, and add things like, propellers, and wings, but the dev logs say that there going to add a lot of thing that will make it harder, like adding harder bots and making blocks flammable.

Materials being expensive and and blocks like wood being flammable does seem realistic to me, but quite a bit of realistic things aren't fun.

Scrap mechanic is a quite a unique game, I hope it becomes fun for me again, I don't know of a game that can replace it.",1572548183,1701784423,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Nothing at all about anything stated is in the game or shows any sign of ever being implemented. The same is true for last year- simply stating ""This would be cool if we put it in our game!"" then radio silence for another year.

For all intents and purposes Axolotl have literally forgotten this even exists- which considering this is their only game is quite confusing.

Please understand this is not early access, it is dead. There is nothing new coming to this game, the game is dead. The game has not had anything done to it in years, and is not under any development because it is dead.

The game was released in early access on January 20, 2016, and has since garnered a dedicated fanbase due to its unique blend of creative building, exploration, and survival elements. In this detailed review, I will explore the various aspects of Scrap Mechanic that contribute to its fun and engaging gameplay experience.

Scrap Mechanic places players in a post-apocalyptic world where they take on the role of a robotic mechanic, tasked with maintaining and building various contraptions to survive in the harsh environment. The game features a robust building system that allows players to create a wide range of vehicles, machines, and structures using a variety of parts and components. From simple cars and trucks to complex flying machines and automated farming systems, the only limit to what players can build is their imagination.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of Scrap Mechanic is the freedom it offers in terms of creativity and experimentation. Players can design and build their own custom vehicles and contraptions, testing and refining their creations to achieve optimal performance. The game's physics engine adds a layer of realism to the experience, as players must consider factors such as weight distribution, center of mass, and power output when designing their creations. This results in a deeply satisfying gameplay loop where players are constantly iterating on their designs to overcome challenges and improve their efficiency.

In addition to the building aspect, Scrap Mechanic features a vast open world for players to explore, filled with diverse biomes, resources, and hostile robotic enemies. The game encourages players to venture out into the world to scavenge for materials, discover new locations, and uncover the secrets of the game's lore. The sense of exploration is heightened by the game's day-night cycle and dynamic weather system, which adds an element of unpredictability to the environment.

Survival is also a key component of Scrap Mechanic, as players must manage their hunger, thirst, and health while navigating the world. This adds an additional layer of challenge and urgency to the gameplay, as players must balance their building and exploration activities with the need to gather resources and maintain their well-being. The game's survival mechanics are well-balanced, providing enough challenge to keep players engaged without feeling overly punishing.

Scrap Mechanic supports multiplayer gameplay, allowing players to collaborate with friends or strangers to build, explore, and survive together. The cooperative nature of the game opens up new possibilities for creativity, as players can pool their resources and expertise to tackle larger and more ambitious projects. Whether it's constructing a massive base, organizing a farming operation, or embarking on expeditions to distant biomes, the multiplayer aspect of Scrap Mechanic fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork among players.

Furthermore, the game has a vibrant and dedicated community that contributes to its ongoing success. Players frequently share their creations, mods, and gameplay experiences through online forums, social media, and content creation platforms. This exchange of ideas and resources enriches the overall experience of Scrap Mechanic, providing players with an endless stream of inspiration and new content to explore.

Visually, Scrap Mechanic features a charming and colorful art style that complements its lighthearted and playful tone. The game's environments are rich in detail, with each biome offering its own distinct aesthetic and atmosphere. From lush forests and rolling plains to desolate wastelands and industrial complexes, the world of Scrap Mechanic is a joy to behold and explore. The game's character and creature designs are equally endearing, adding personality and charm to the overall experience.

The sound design in Scrap Mechanic also deserves praise, as it effectively immerses players in the game's world. From the ambient sounds of nature to the clanking of machinery and the whirring of engines, the audio elements of the game enhance the sense of presence and engagement. The game's music further enhances the mood, with a dynamic soundtrack that adapts to the player's actions and surroundings, adding an extra layer of emotional resonance to the gameplay experience.

In conclusion, Scrap Mechanic offers a compelling and enjoyable gameplay experience that seamlessly blends creative building, exploration, and survival elements. The game's robust building mechanics, open-world environment, multiplayer capabilities, and charming visual and audio design all contribute to its appeal and longevity. Whether playing solo or with friends, Scrap Mechanic provides a wealth of opportunities for players to express their creativity, overcome challenges, and immerse themselves in a vibrant and dynamic world. With regular updates and a passionate community, Scrap Mechanic continues to evolve and expand, promising even more fun and excitement for players in the years to come.

The creations that can be made using vanilla parts are rather primitive, so mods are a must for any moderately advanced logic systems if you would like them not to take a few years to process.

Edit. It came and it went. Scrap Mechanics had so much potential but the studio just treats it like some bastard child. It get little to no updates and hardly fixes bug if at all. 

Scrap Mechanics was one of the games I was dying to play when I decided to get a PC. I made sure to get something with the specs to play it IN 2016. I got a 970m and played it looking forward to the survival update on the horizon. I foolishly even checked in on it every once and a while. Turns out by the time they would released it I would be on a 30 series card with 50 series on the horizon.  The studio barely every fixes/adds content and seems to have given up on ever taking this game out of early access. I hate it, but I can't recommend a game that even the dev studio doesn't want to finish. Even if they finish it now it may be too little too late.

Scrap Mechanic stands out as a true masterpiece in the world of sandbox gaming, where the possibilities for creativity seem boundless. As I delved into this pixelated universe, I quickly realized that it offers a challenge much more significant than initially anticipated. The game requires a level of skill and strategic thinking that adds a delightful layer of complexity to the experience. Building intricate machines and structures demands careful planning and problem-solving, making it a much more challenging but ultimately rewarding endeavor. Scrap Mechanic manages to strike a perfect balance between the freedom to unleash your imagination and the need for skillful execution, creating a gaming experience that is both stimulating and gratifying.

[h2] With what should you start? [/h2]

When you start playing Scrap Mechanic, it's a good idea to begin with Creative mode. In Creative mode, you have total freedom to be as creative as you want without any limits. You can try building different things, test out crazy ideas, and learn about all the different parts in the game.

Once you've had fun being creative, you can try playing in Survival mode. Survival mode makes the game more challenging. You'll need to collect resources, make things, and deal with a world that keeps changing. It's a bit harder than Creative mode.

The switch from Creative to Survival is like moving from practice to a real game. You use the skills you learned in Creative mode to tackle the tougher situations in Survival. Just know that Survival mode is tougher.

[h2] Story mode [/h2]

Scrap Mechanic plunges you into a colorful world where you, a skilled mechanic, land on a planet filled with malfunctioning Farmbots. Your mission: repair and maintain these robots while uncovering the mystery behind their chaos.

[i]For more information, please watch the video. [/i]

[h3] Conclusion  [/h3]

In summary, Scrap Mechanic masterfully weaves creativity, challenges, and a captivating narrative. The transition from freeform building to strategic problem-solving adds intellectual depth, while the mission to save humanity. This game is great for smart people! It mixes imagination and skill, giving you a fun experience in a robotic world. If you like games that make you think and want something exciting, this one is highly recommended.

And lot of players have stopped playing the game because it's been in the early stages for a long time. Waiting for the full game can be tough and some people have gotten bored and left. It's important for the developers to make the game really good when it's finally ready so that players come back and stay.

The game is decent so far. The ""mechanic"" part of the game is pretty good if you're in creative because all the parts are available. So there's a lot of building and experimenting you can do. 

The problem for me is survival. I feel like the progression in the beginning is waaaaaaaay too slow and some things I have to look up because they're so hard to find. 

They really should take a page from BOTW because the progression is so natural in that game even without much explanation.

Fighting is a chore and clunky but absolutely necessary for progression. And, AFAIK, there is no way to upgrade your weapons to be more efficient in fighting. Baddies come after your crops every few minutes with no real explanation.

The creative part of the game is fun but in survival the progression is so slow that you won't be making anything decent for hours.

Hopefully, they work on the progression and make fighting a better experience because I don't feel like the fighting mechanic feels good or is fun.",1656181015,1701168772,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Which is why I am giving this a bad review. Creative mode is fun for a while though I can't vote for them as separate things. I would give a thumbs up to the creative mode.

               Is it just me or is this game really meant for just multiplayer? I have been around for a long time in this games development while putting in a lot of hours in creative. I drooled for survival before it came out and when it did it was a solo experience and... well, it was so much grind, with needing the food and protecting the farm and then hopefully killing bots to hopefully get component kits while also still trying to farm materials to build up defenses which are getting destroyed so you need more material. I like playing solo in a lot of these games since my friend group tends to be the Valorant types and I am not. I am glad for the mod integration so now I can put farms where ever, that by itself has helped putting farms out of reach, which still makes it difficult since getting water to it is a pain. This has lead to other noticeable things like balance issues in recipes, combat issues and hp values being static, RDM of the component kits (A SUPER ESSENTIAL THING USED IN A LOT OF RECIPES AND ALL UPGRADES) being dropped , and the scrap vehicle parts start with makes it worthless to try and use as a vehicle, it's not worth it. Sorry this is long winded and I hope the Dev team see it, I very much love your game but parts of it make me not want to play it. 
        I know this may not be my place but a couple of possible solutions: component kits as a recipe would be the biggest, willing to put the grind in to do that (within reason). Level ups in health or armor for your character, a magnet block or a connector dis-connector block that would help make tools easier a cool tool changer arm on a bot. The UV beds you are adding are very cool and would help a lot but it seems to then add another problem of adding yet another type of fuel on board or going through fuel faster and more component kits being gobbled up. 
      I remember earlier in the development you all asked for suggestions on what things you would like to see added.  I think i would have suggested different things seeing how survival turned out so far. Early game is still so grindy that it feels punishing. Thank you I am also leaving this as a review I realized as writing this is a good representation of my experience.

-Edit- So, I have close to another 100 hours. Whelp can't say anything has changed, I have to wonder what is going on? I have been watching twitter and... I don't know if anything in survival is going to get better, explosion bots, jumping bots, and climbing bots. Fire and underground stuff. Grreeaatt, I understand you are giving us a nice ability to grow things away  that shouldn't mean build 3 new bots to blow it all to hell. The turret looks cool, it looked cool a year ago. Climbing wheels made with goop awesome, how about anything to make early game marginally easier? How about ways to limit grinds? At this time I still only spend my time in creative because as a single player, survival isn't fun to me. I have seen YouTube video of people playing funny enough it usually starts after they have already progressed enough to have a defensible base and material to go do things. I wonder if that is due to the early game being just hitting trees over and over and over again... Anyway looking forward to the update hopefully this will fix things. (I am still hoping for a connector or magnet if nothing else just being able to pick up stuff with ma hands)",1667501065,1701128355,False,33,3,0.609760820865631104,0,True,False,True

Creative mode allows you to let your mind roam free, creating whatever mechanism floats your boat. Unless it's a plane. Scrap Mechanic has mod support and as such allows more creativity on that front as well. The learning curve for making good vehicles and creations is a rather steep curve I find, but if you stick with it it should get easier.

Survival mode allows you to get a basic feel for the game with an added survival mechanic and progression system. Farming plants and animals provides you with the food you need to survive, some of the materials you need to craft, along with plants to trade for useful tools. A challenging world enemy also exists that grants you access to a dungeon like area where you can receive the highest tier plants currently in game. Creativity is somewhat limited in this mode as you are limited by the resources required to create your vehicles/farms and upgrade the technological components within, such as your engine, or pistons. More is planned for the survival mode however, and in time things like a story and more progression will be added

Its a Really fun game if you have friends and you can enjoy together max 20 hours. Then you start to realize that there is nothing you can do much more. Everything is same ; musics gets boring , monsters are same (just 5 and you don't see 3 of them when you beginner)
The Devs just gave up to update the game since couple years ago i think. And they don't even try to make money on it. This game has a huge potential but i don't understand why they stop update. If you give this game to ""Modders of scrap mechanic"". Im sure they'll update every single month and they'll add some crazy thing to this sh*t.

Or even capable to give us some weekly news or at least monthly news. I totally understand how much work it is to make a game but come on, you have to keep your people entertained, it's not nothing much. We would be pleased to see every month a small silly news about a bug fixing, a small mob. Now that i remember, I've seen in an old devblog that you've said you will put some birds, as decorative to make more ambiance, you even shared a picture of it.

I've been playing the game for years and survival mode is very promising, it's definitely not completely there yet but there's already a lot to do and more gets added every once in a while.

In short it seems that this is one of those games that is ran by devs that are so incredibly slow with updates that the community gets upset each time between updates, with how long it takes for something meaningful to happen. 

It's a game, they should just admit is a bust, release as 'full' here and start work on another game. It's kind of like how 7 Days to Die has been in development early access for 7+ years now. There's a point of ""Shit or get off the pot"". 

I didn't enjoy my near 8 hours playing the game. The loop is not engaging. You have to destroy a specific mob literally HUNDREDS of times to get enough resources to do minor things. The robot you have to kill is not incredibly easy to kill, so you wind up spending a lot of extra time to kill them, where the other robot you get to take out is incredibly easy to the point of 'why exist?"" 

 You have to travel for looooooong periods of time of just going straight to get middling resources.
'
It's not a good game. It needs a lot of QoL features, which aren't likely to show up for the foreseeable feature... which is meaning *YEARS*. Not months, not in a single year, but multiple years. 

This game is likely never going to be finished or ready to play. Unlike 7 Days to Die, which actually has a somewhat enjoyable game loop, even in its' incomplete state. 

This game ... was not fun. At no point did they let me make a machine to solve a problem. It was ALL... ALL manual to obtain resources. 8 hours in the only machine they allow you to make (via restricting resources) is a crappy car that is impossible to control because they give you not round wheels. 

Like this game's early game experience is a literal ""fuck you' for anyone who isn't already sold into the late game. I didn't look into videos or anything, just bought the game because it looked good and is up my alley for style of games. 

So, you need to do your research to play this game. And that's not what I was looking for. I was hoping for a well developed game, not this trash.",1700672796,1700672796,False,1,0,0.516212880611419678,0,True,False,True

But the dev team is absolutely horrible.. the game needs more content, and they are ''working on it'', since the beginning of time.
Don't get the game at least till chapter 2 is released.

Edit: Also I forgot to mention this, but the more you play, the laggier it becomes.. after you have one or two complex creations, the game starts dying. This is not much of a problem if you are playing alone or with a friend, but once there are 3 or 4 people in the server, the FPS die.
Better wait for chapter 2 for that reason as well, since they're supposedly working to fix that problem.

The large majority of the scrap mechanic community has grown tired of the lack luster existence of developer communication and development headway. If the Dev(s) would communicate more frequently with the community about what is going on/ what the road map looks like/why content updates take so long, it would improve the interests within the community. I can respect that they have lives, like I have patients.. But from a business standpoint, they're community hype is dying and they're potential interests are decreasing for the lack of community management and content. 

 It's a excellent game idea, but it's only an ""ok"" game. The content just isn't as deep as it really should be, and the game can't handle multiplayer once everyone is actually underway with their own vehicles/to many moving parts/to many programed things have to be synchronized.

With the time they appear to be spending in hiatus, they probably could have made the game over in unreal engine 5. Let's all hope that, or something in response to the community is announced soon.

Something I fear.. 
This community is becoming a bit hostile, and rude.. 
When I read these rude things, it's apparent that they just don't have the patients to kindly ask the devs to not give up.
I do not want the devs to be discouraged, they don't deserve that. They deserve to handle the situation by the helm, and follow through with their dream. Develope the awesome game you set out to make.
I enjoyed my time playing your game, I just want more/better.

Unfortunately I am far too stupid to even partially utilize the game's extensive mechanics. That's not the problem here though.

Survival mode is just... weird. You have to defend your crops from attacking robots, but exactly the way you go about that is not very intuitive. While resource gathering is REALLY cool, there's a lot of trial and error involved when it comes to base defense and the dodgy physics coupled with the insane potential complexity of your machines really only serves to build frustration as opposed to giving the player an opportunity to advance. Adventuring is fun but it's high risk and low reward.

The worst part is the fact that the game is, without question, dead in the water. I haven't played this game in like 4 years and yet I am absolutely certain the game hasn't changed. It's really a shame.",1700406704,1700406704,False,3,0,0.548687517642974854,0,True,False,True

But the developers have all but abandoned it. Outside of one or two Twitter posts from time to time, showing ""upcoming features"" that never get released, the have been silent for more than a year.

Updates teased 5-6 years ago, still haven't been incorporated.

Lag issues when playing multiplayer are extreme. Even playing single player, frame rates take a massive dive with even fairly uncomplicated machines, and I'm running a pretty decent gaming rig. 

Certain physics issues that have been in the game since launch 7+ years ago, remain in the game. 

This follows the pattern from the game Raft, which had a lot of promise, updates early on...but the last few chapters came across rushed and disjointed. Then the devs have been completely silent about updates, fixes, etc.

This game took a very large and needed leap by adding the survival mode, a mode in which you have gated progression and lack of resources slowing down your progression.
The issues with the survival mode are not immediately spotted but shortly after playing for several hours you notice the problems.

-Gated progression is a joke, the ""gating"" in this game consists of gathering some scrap metal and breaking burning trees around the crash site. Apart from this the only challenge you face is killing the enemies in the beginning of the game over and over for component kits as if you are trying to drop a high rarity item in an MMORPG, a very bad joke.
After this you can unlock almost any item available for crafting.

-Automation is nonexistent, for a building/tech based game you would expect at least some convenience while progressing and to offer the players the possibility of not repeating the same tasks they have been doing since the beginning of the game.
In this game however the devs thought it would be a good idea to give players mining drills to get metal quickly so they don't have to kill beginning mobs on hours end, but then decided to limit that to high quality metal only, so even when you have all the quality metal you need, because you don't have the god damn beginning rusty scrap metal, you are limited from crafting a relatively large portion of the crafting catalog.

The 90% of the value in this game resides in the creative mode where you can build whatever contraption or vehicle you want without being limited by the highly uncreative and uninspiring methods to farm resources while being offered no help in limiting the grind.
If you love building sandboxes or artificial difficulty to make the game seem like it has a lot more content than it shows, this is the game for you.",1699619433,1699708968,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The creativity and dedication that you can put in your vehicles and machines is abnormal and very special compared to other survival games! You can make every Playthrough/World unique by trying out for example: a moving house, a raft or maybe a tower that has a very unreliable elevator that launches you so far up that you ragdoll of of it. In all seriousness tho, the amount of creative input in this game is quite limitless.
Combine that with the addition of multiplayer and Creative/Challenge mode and you got yourself a good time.

The Survival mode however can be grindy, but with it's great custom game support Scrap Mechanic got you covered, as there are many different Community created settings/mods that you can try out from Cheaper Recipes to New Explorable Tiles to literally a Raft like mod designed to change your complete workflow! So Community contributions make this game so much better and can improve your overall experience. Of course can you make them yourself too, although that gets a little bit more technical.

Well, actually, nothing changed at all since then. It's the same old story with no noteworthy game updates having happened in the past 2-3 years.

You can consider the game dead, get it on sale or on a key site. There are dev updates from the Baroque era on the game page but it's pretty unlikely any of that will actually make it into the game.

Speaking of which, the game itself seems interesting and I thoroughly enjoy building mechanical things with it and I'd love to play it some more, but...
--> Can't play offline (even single-player)
--> No updates at all. Survival launched 'as is' with a lot of stuff missing
--> Devblog 'content teasing' with nothing to actually show for it
--> Radio silence

Stay clear from this game if you:
- share your library (thus going offline) with virtually anyone
- want to play when there's no internet (train, uni, holiday, ...)

Cons: survival mode:
Survival mode is unfinished and a grind just to play and the tutorial is not clear on things so if you’re here for a survival game, just don’t... unless you like grinding games
But if you’re here for the creative aspect then stay and read this

Cons: challenge mode:
The included challenge is not really clear when you get to at least 15 and more
Creating a challenge needs a lot of logic experience 
Community challenges are some times just tedious 

 Cons: creative mode:
Demolition derby’s or games where you destroy others don’t really work here

Pros: survival mode:
I can’t think of any but again I only got up to the end of the tutorial so idk

Pros: challenge mode:
There is a workshop for challenges
You can create your own challenges, 
You can send them to any friends who own this game

 Pros: creative mode:
You can play with your friends who own this game
You can do slip ‘n slide challenges with the low friction blocks
You can create boats with bubble blocks
You can find mods and creations on the workshop
You can build planes but need a mod to do that

Overall, if you want the survival aspect of it, just don’t pls
But If you want the creative aspect then this is a good game for that

Old review from years ago:

Fantastic game but the fundamental code design seems incompatible with complicated machines or multiplayer that is performance friendly.

The setting, gameplay, and creative options are all top notch. It's easy to execute your ideas and have them work predictably. I would also describe the current state of survival to be incomplete. There's enough here to enjoy for many hours but it is obvious that the world is missing key elements and polish. 

I found few to no bugs during my 100 hours of playing, which is impressive, but I would like to see improvements made to performance when creations scale up or become more numerous in a server. The game has 9 or so physics settings so you can improve performance, but the simple settings do not simulate mechanical systems effectively so once you turn down physics, expect better performance at the cost of having your vehicles unable to drive or move correctly. I found the 'introducing the controller' video to be somewhat disingenuous for this reason, as most of the creations showcased would not run at even 30 fps on a decent gaming rig.

I highly recommend this game, but expect your creations and your multiplayer lobbies to remain small in scale.",1637511328,1698161841,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have 1Gb ethernet, on average 800Mb. My friend has 140Mb on average, also on ethernet. We play on survival with hardly any player creations and I'm the host, using an alright PC, i3 9100F, which, although not great, is not even 60% used. Also, I'm running 42GB ram, got >100GB of free space on my nvme SSD, I have a 3060 with 12GB of VRAM. It certainly isn't my PC being shit. He has 42 GB of ram too, gtx 1660, i9 10gen, and in singleplayer there are absolutely no issues. Oh, forgot to mention, we live in the same city, too, so its not ""ThE uNdErWaTeR cAbLeS"" doing all that. And in valorant, playing on server that are based in our city, i have <2 ping and my friend has usually <15. In scrap, creative multiplayer all works well. Its only in survival that he has any lags. My character, on his screen, is all good, no desync, but the vehicles lag horribly. And its not our fault. I hope survival gets optimized next update.

If the rating system were more refined, and a positive is a 7/10 or better, I would put this game around a 5 or 6 out of 10. 

The general gameplay loop is good. Collect, farm, defend the farm, iterate on your creations, repeat. I definitely enjoyed my time playing the game, especially with my 2 friends, as evidence by the 125 hours I sunk into it on the multi-player world & my solo world. There is a learning curve, in how to properly build machines for your play style, and the building system is pretty good. It has its quirks, but all ""engineer"" games do. 

The problem stems from longevity, grind, and development timeframes.

Grind: 
In order to upgrade your machines you need component kits. To get component kits you need to go out and clear randomly generated structures to loot the chests & kill bots. The problem comes from the drop rate of the kits & the quantity needed for each mechanism, and them not being retrievable once you install them in a mechanism. Couple this with the stack limit of 10, and a small inventory you have to do a lot of go out, clear a structure or 3, return to base to offload materials then repeat the trip. 
You can avoid some of that by putting chests on your vehicle, but rapidly you will clear out the near POI's and they take a long time to regen, so you have to go further out to get more of these kits. 

Longevity:
The next big issue is the optimization in the game is... lackluster. If you play anything like me or the 2 friends I played with your machines will get complicated, and the more moving parts your machine has, the worse the game runs. 

Before we stopped playing, my machine, if it wasn't welded to the ground would halve the framerate & ""tick""speed of the game, while the more advanced machine my friend made would cut it down by 75% or so. 

Because of this, making a jack of all trades machine is actually not good because of the performance impact it gives. Which means you need to make more, smaller vehicles to specialize in one small task. 
This goes back to the grind problem, as you need component kits for pretty much every important mechanism.

Development Timeframes:
The devs definitely like this game, and the companion game Raft. The problem with scrap mechanic update schedule stems from a couple of known reasons, and a few I will guess at. 
The known reasons are the dev team split their attention and started other projects before finishing this one, which is fine I applaud them for doing so especially since both games are good. The real issue seems to come from what I call ""goal bloat"" (there is a correct term, I am just forgetting it at the moment). 

Goal bloat is what the big problem right now is. They released the initial version of Survival (the main game) back in mid 2020. They announced Survival update 2 back towards the end of 2020. Each devblog since they had added additional new goals that push the update back. Do not get me wrong, new content, thoroughly tested is very very good. The problem comes from they should have split chapter 2 into multiple parts, or heck just make each successive update the next chapter. The reason I consider this to be the biggest downfall of the game right now is one of the biggest features of chapter 2 is heavy optimization improvements to the engine and how physics calculations are done, which in turn will greatly affect creations & complexity ""limits"" the game currently has. 

If the dev team had split chapter 2 into smaller segments, rather than let goal bloat delay the update by 2 full years at this point I would not have these criticisms, as the promised optimization would probably have solved most of them. 

All that said, if chapter 2 includes all the stuff they promised, it works well, and optimization allows for more build freedom & complexity, I think it will be worth the wait. 


TLDR: 
Game is good, can get grindy, complex machines or additional physics calculations bog the game down a fair amount. Necessary optimization has been pushed back for approx 2 full years due to shifting goalposts with chapter 2 (next major update) due to the development team adding more content than initially announced / expected.",1696177518,1696177518,True,12,1,0.672167122364044189,0,True,False,True

Overall in its current state, no, wouldnt recommend to anybody, forget about it for another 3 years and it may be good then. Also may wanna include everything shown in the trailer as well.

Original review was made over 3 years ago... Apparently this is a trend of theirs to wait years and years for an update... How does this company even survive with little or no potential sales as you do nothing with the game for years? Seriously sad and crap model for customer appreciation. Could be a great game but im sure your next update will come out and it will offer another 20 hours of repetitive content that will be extremely underwhelming... quit waiting years and put content out, such a waste of time and hope.",1589333866,1694913984,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The first side is the good side revolving around the Creative and Challenge Modes. They are phenomenal and they allow you to invent some of the most insanely awesome and innovative creations that you can think of. Vehicles, Houses, Games and All sorts of other things which can easily keep you entertained for hundreds of hours if you're the creative type of person. Plus you also have the steam workshop where you can try out other peoples ideas and even test cool mods if you're up for it, however this is basically where the fun sadly ends.

Now for the bad side. I know some people will feel differently than me on this, but Scrap Mechanic has been out for a long time, and the game has always revolved around having fun with your friends and being creative, Then one of the most anticipated features finally came to the game in the first half of 2020 and that was the Survival mode which a lot of people including myself were looking forward to. When you watch the trailer everything looks fun, but i promise you it wears off quite quickly, especially if you are not new to this game. The survival mode is basically the same as Creative, but the world looks better, and you have to keep yourself fed and hydrated as well as grind for any form of resources, That's it. There is nothing nice and fancy about the survival mode and To be honest the Developers enjoy Teasing the players with their Devblog's showcasing all the new features that they're working on, but unfortunately they have only made two updates to their survival mode in the last almost 3 and a half years.
To Add to that, the survival mode makes crafting a very tedious task, and nor do they entertain you with any ounce of a story. Let me show you what i mean:

Survival Mode Features:
- Player needs to be fed and hydrated, else they die.
- Player has to farm a ridiculous amount of resources in order to build anything that actually can be durable enough against 
  the enemy bots.
- There are no Story elements yet, Just a logbook, that's it.
The general gameplay of survival goes like this: 
Gather and farm crops (crops are used as currency), Don't die to the bots whom continuously raid your base for the crops. Once the Crops have been harvested, sell them to a farmer NPC to get ammo and or weapons and or food. Take what you have earned and repeat the cycle. This is survival, nothing more and nothing less.

The game has so much grinding on survival with so many features that have been left out which apparently is still being worked on, so if you are going to buy this game, Please do not do it thinking that the Survival mode is complete or even close to completion. DO NOT buy this game if you are looking for a story because you will not find it at this moment. Please do not misunderstand what i am saying in this review as i have enjoyed this game for a long time as i would play it for many hours on a friends account, and the creative and challenge modes are worth every penny, but the survival mode is honestly not worth purchasing at this moment.

So in a nutshell, be sure to buy this game only if you are happy playing a currently incomplete survival mode or if you want to build tons of cool stuff in creative. If you are wanting a story then you wont find it at this moment, and the developers haven't specified when their next update will arrive, but one thing i can tell you is that it has been over 1 year since their last survival update and it can easily be another one or two years before the next update is released.",1694348374,1694348374,True,27,3,0.75767594575881958,0,True,False,True

I enjoy the creative mode a lot, as it has a lot of community content and is all around just fun to mess around with. However, survival is where this game truly shines. It has a super satisfying gameplay loop, in particular with farming (although grinding for component kits can be tedious). Exploration is a ton of fun, unlocking cosmetics is a cool reward, the ""combat system"" (if you even want to call it that, it's just hitting things lol) is simple but enjoyable, and building complex creations to more efficiently harvest resources is both fun to do and rewarding to complete.

It's super addicting, and although new content comes out infrequently, there's loads when it does. (And it's all of super high quality, with not a microtransaction in sight!)
Not to mention the beautiful art style and great music.

The building mechanics are intuitive and enjoyable, allowing you to let your imagination run wild. I've created numerous designs and shared them on the workshop for others to enjoy.

While I personally don't care for the survival or challenge mode, the building aspect alone keeps me engaged and entertained. The ability to construct various vehicles and see them come to life is incredibly satisfying. The game offers a wide range of parts and tools to experiment with, giving endless possibilities for creations.

The community aspect is also a highlight, as you can easily browse and download creations from other players. It's a great way to get inspired and see what others have come up with.

Overall, Scrap Mechanic is a must-play for creative minds who enjoy building and designing. Whether you're into survival challenges or simply want to unleash your creativity, this game offers hours of fun.

Crust dough:
1½ dl water
1 tablespoon of oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 dl rye flour
1 dl wheat flour

Filling option 1:
2 ½ dl water
2 dl of rice
7 ½ dl of milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg

Filling option 2:
8 dl of water
2 dl of rice
2 dl (lactose-free) cooking cream 10% or 15%
1 egg

Filling option 3:

2 dl of water
2 dl of pre-ripened, whole barley groats
1.5 l of milk
1 teaspoon of salt
1 egg

For greasing: melted butter and water

First prepare the filling:

Preparation of filling option 1 and 3:
2. Mix rice or barley in boiling water and boil for 10 minutes.
3. Add milk and let the porridge slowly boil for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally along the bottom. Leave the filling to simmer under the lid for 10 minutes.
4. Season the finished porridge with salt and cool it.
5. Mix an egg into the cooled porridge.

Preparation of filling option 2:
2. Mix rice with boiling water and cook for about 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.
3. Add (lactose-free) cooking cream and salt. Let the porridge simmer for about 10 minutes.
4. Pour the porridge into a flat container and pour a splash of cold water over it so that a crust does not form on the surface of the porridge.
5. Mix an egg into the cooled porridge.

Making the pies:
1. Mix cold water, oil, salt and flour with a wooden fork. Knead the dough until smooth and firm.
2. Sprinkle a mixture of rye and wheat flour on the table and pour the dough on top of the flour. Roll out the dough into a disc about 1/2 cm thick.
3. Press poop from the plate with a drinking glass.
4. Place the poops in stacks of six so they don't dry out. Cover the stacks with a plastic bag or bowl.
5. Use a rolling pin to roll the dumplings into thin round or oval shells. Stack the shells on top of each other and sprinkle rye flour in between. Cover the peel stacks with a plastic bag. Fill the shells as soon as possible so they don't stick to each other.
6. Take the crusts on the baking table, spread a spoonful of filling in the center of the crust (1 cm thick layer of filling) and leave about 1 cm of empty space on the edges of the crust.
7. Fold the opposite edges over the filling and crease the pies with your index fingers.
8. Transfer the pies to a baking sheet on baking paper.
9. Bake pies at 275-300°C for about 15 minutes.
10. Grease the pies with melted butter mixed with a splash of water.
11. Stack the hot pies in a bowl on top of each other and cover with baking paper and a cloth. Serve with traditional or egg-free egg butter.

Traditional egg butter

4 eggs
2 dl cottage cheese
100 g of butter or margarine
(4 tablespoons chopped parsley)

Put the eggs in a pot of boiling water one by one using a tablespoon and cook for 8 minutes.
Put the boiled eggs in cold water for a while, so the shell comes off easier.
When the eggs have cooled, peel them.
Put the eggs on a large plate and chop them with a fork or use an egg cutter.
Mix in cottage cheese and room temperature, soft fat.
If you want, you can add chopped parsley on top.
Eggless egg butter

1 tsp pre-cooked chickpeas
250 g firm tofu
150 g of margarine
1 teaspoon of salt

1 dl parsley and 1 chili

Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Roughly mash the chickpeas with a fork.
Crumble the tofu.
Mix chickpea and tofu crumbs and margarine. Season with salt.
Chop the parsley and mix in. Also chop half of the chili and mix in. Garnish with chili slices.",1657723380,1693120306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The last two major updates were 'Challenge Mode' and 'Creative Mode' - both of which do nothing for me. Instead, we get teased a lot of really cool features that, once released, will most likely cause the player to lose their progress and create a new world. This isn't an issue, since its an Early Access game. But, it would be nice to have some incremental updates so that we could enjoy these cool features.

Being an EA game, most devs showcase content that will be released in the near future, not years down the line. Due to what seems to be an evolving scope creep, you are basically paying to play a demo while you wait for the full release. The devs don't give much in the way of developmental updates, and the only reason it doesn't seem abandoned is because it sold so many copies they should have plenty of revenue to continue development.
But, with the features they've shown, there better be a plethora of content they've kept secret - because there's no way it should be taking this long to release what they've showcased...unless they're just sitting on their thumbs and enjoying the payday they got from sales, deciding to develop down the scenic route.

The gameplay is fun and there are tens of hours of content, depending on how deep you want to play. Some of this playtime will be a grind that's not as painful as other games. There are players with hundreds and a thousand plus hours - i'm sure creative mode and steam workshop helps with those numbers. But, this game will be a lot better once its released and you can count on your game not being wiped or having to rely on inconsiderate developers to supply additional content.

i definitely do not recommend this game, based on the route development is going. But, if you are enticed by the steam page, the videos, and don't mind potential world wipes, long waits for content, or a potentially abandoned game due to the typical EA, 'family / personal / health / team moving on / insert most used excuse here' issues outcome, then it's worth a purchase. Plus, its been nearly three years. Unless it gets abandoned, your wait will be significantly less than others.",1693077251,1693077251,False,2,0,0.512658238410949707,0,True,False,True

The game has not changed at all, the steady development I praised 3 years ago is nowhere to be seen. Survival is STILL in no playable state, at this point it is ridiculous, pointless robots are being added / teasered but no core game mechanics whatsoever are added to the survival mode. The last major update this year was for the challenge mode, which came after the survival mode and I feel like no one asked for the update. What people have been asking for is a playable co-op survival mode, which is nowhere in sight after [b] 3 years [/b] of active development.
Ultimately I had to change my review to not recommend.

[h1] Steady development, worth supporting and waiting for [/h1]

Most people are a bit hesitant when it comes to invest money in early access games, since developers often lose their goal / motivation and the desired outcome isn't met. Not the case here.
The delevopers are very passionate and are non stop working. While they keep you waiting and making you unpatient, they're always sooner or later delivering an update you've been long waiting for.

I've had this game before any signs of a survival mode and now I'm insanely happy it has been published. While it still has some flaws (for god's sake add a map, please) it's a pleasure observing the changes this game goes through. Survival is already fun to play, even so more with friends!
While this game is more of built to let you build dynamic stuff like vehicles, they're also working on static stuff, so you're able to build houses etc. At least it's more optimized than it was in the beginning.

All in all I'd say give it some time, support it and come back to a wonderful game.
You already can have fun right now in creative mode, creating a new project with friends. Can't wait for the final product.",1592938063,1692996094,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So, Scrap Mechanic, huh, crazy game, Scrap mechanic is a fun sandbox to let you express your creativity and go wild, with it's nice and snuggly building system you will be making stuff from cars to bikes to planes, to working calculators and hover-tanks with practice.
Mods are a massive part of scrap mechanic too, they really improve the experience in my opinion, but learn the game normally before delving into the steam workshop.

Scrap mechanic also has two other modes if doing anything you want isn't up your alley:

SURVIVAL: an extensive survival game that has all the great features of scrap mechanic, build bases, set up traps, create cars to transport fruit to sell, explore giant warehouse dungeons, all while defending your farm against the enemy farmbot hordes!

CHALLENGE MODE: challenge mode lets you put your building skills to the test, learn to create wall crawlers, ball carriers, and just a fast car with limited resources, there are also custom challenge trials that can be created, downloaded and played via the workshop.

Plus, if that wasn't enough (how?) custom games can be made within and downloaded.

I'd say scrap mechanic is pretty worth it! Of course, the game is in early access and survival is not finished fully, but what we have now is great, and it can only get better from here.",1601486994,1691513923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

     I write this review for the 0.6.5 version of the game, after the Survival update, but before the Survival: Chapter 2 update. Instead of outright praising or disparaging the game like so many other reviews would do, I want to share one of my favorite experiences with the game.
     Before I do that, there are some bits of information I'd like to get out there. On the one hand, I'd like to contextualize the story so that you understand, but on the other, I want to help you avoid it in-case the question of ""should I purchase this product"" can be solved by explaining the core principles of the game.
     The game currently has four modes (Challenge, Survival, Creative, and Custom Game), which all revolve around the building mechanics. You will be building a lot in pretty much every mode (except maybe Custom Game, which is player-generated content).
     The story I'm going to share comes from my time in Survival Mode, which currently has very little content. There are three things that you can do: collecting materials to build vehicles and bases, farming to buy new stuff and to eat, and going through unforgiving warehouses full of robots to reap decent(-ish) rewards. There is no story, so it is essentially a sand-box where you can do anything that you feel like doing, except you can starve or be bludgeoned to death by hay-wire... hay-bailing bots.

This should be enough information for me to start my story.
     I was on an excursion to find an oil source. It is pretty tedious to jump into the ocean looking for oil deposits, so I was looking for a lake that give me an infinite amount of fuel. I was at the far reaches of the map which is (surrounded by ocean). I was between a forest and the ocean, which gave me just enough room for my exploration vehicle to fit on the beach between them. While I was out chopping down trees, I was ambushed by two Farmbots (the big red bois). I drove part-way into the sea while I was trying to escape, and that's when my car was promptly diced into pieces. While I was able to jump on a rock in the ocean, taking the ruin of my vehicle with me safely, I had lost two vital parts: one of my wheels and my Driver's Seat. My only Driver's Seat. Without the Driver's Seat, there is no way to steer my vehicle, and no way to stop me from falling out. What made things even worse is that my vehicle was carrying chests which I filled with hours of gathered materials (hint: that is a bad idea), some VERY difficult to obtain (including some stuff from a few Warehouses), and I did not want to part with them if I could avoid it. That meant that if I died, or if my chests or any more parts were broken, I'd have to forsake those materials and all of the progress I made. There was a lot at stake, more than in any other game I've played, and it was completely caused by me. I really like how, even though there isn't a lot of content in Survival, the game mechanics interact with each-other in a way that rewards and punishes my actions in a very natural way.
     What I ended up doing was taking the blocks that I had to create a make-shift cockpit, and then I created a trike. I placed the engine where I could see it, and then I took off.
     After sliding past the Farmbots (which were trying to shoot me with poison from the ocean floor), I was able to start heading back in the dead of night. While I was making my way back, a group of four or more Haybots (hay-bailing robots) were chasing me, and I wasn't able to go full speed or there was a risk of me falling out. I had to constantly monitor the robots chasing me, the balance of my vehicle to avoid tipping, and where I was going to not run into anything. I kept on using the lift to reposition my vehicle (as I had no steering). Then a Farmbot noticed me. Farmbots are much faster than Haybots, which meant that I had to up the speed on my craft a considerable amount just to keep pace with it. My vehicle, as I expected, tipped over, and tumbled down a big hill still with the robots in hot pursuit. I was barely able to get my vehicle on and off the lift before the Farmbot caught me: I saw it swing its scythe, I was that close.
     I eventually escaped their pursuit, and in an additional thirty minutes of meticulously positioning my vehicle and handling its acceleration, I arrived at my base. The sense of relief I felt coming back to the base was one of the most rewarding feelings that I have had in a game. I almost felt the ""you got back home"" feeling, even though my base is literally just four metal walls. While I was objectively worse off than I was before, having lost some progress on my upgraded seat and still not having located an oil pond, I was able to take a challenging scenario with limited resources and make it back without losing more.

There's my story.
     I could not recommend this game to everyone I met. Not everyone has the motivation to make fun experiences, and even people who are inspired to play with a game's systems may not like the systems present in this game. This game is by no means centered around its story, but rather the systems with which the player can interact. At the end of the day, I'd argue that most people aren't going to be as interested in a building sandbox as I am. However, if you are part of the developer's target audience, this may become your favorite game as it has become mine. I hope this has helped you in some way.",1671570696,1690776347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I watched a video on this game the other day and I was intrigued. After doing a bit of research (looking in the comments) I found out that it was this game. So far I've only done the challenges and creative so as to get a feel of the games mechanics.
So far here are my finding. Firstly there is a steep learning curve, as the mechanics of building do take some time to get used to, particularly in regards to vehicles. However, after figuring that out (the challenges were a great help as they are more akin to tutorials!) Vehicle construction was a breeze. I haven't gotten to the survival part of the game yet but I imagine that it'll be extraordinarily fun.
A quick note though, flying is incredibly difficult (makes sense considering you have to think 3 dimensionally in construction and flight.)
Edit: I've now been playing this game for a total of 29 hours and it's still loads of fun. Since my original posting I've delved into the realm of survival and it is amazing.

My gripe is that it won't support left-handed, when this is a trivial thing to fix.  Have the game read the OS settings for the mouse keys.  They have a keybinds.json file, but that doesn't fix the problem when I edit it as some people have claimed it should be edited.  But who cares?  Just use the OS settings like you were supposed to.

UPDATE: It's even worse than that - when I used VoiceAttack to change my mouse settings as a macro (it just openned the mouse settings and flipped the left to right or right to left - no magic here), the game remained unchanged!  It still forces me to use the other mouse button regardless of what Windows has set up as my active mouse button.  This really stinks!

Now you would think ""no big deal"".  But that's because you're right-handed, so you never run into this.  I find it enormously frustrating that games ignore left-handed people.  But they are relatively rare - most games get it right.

If I could refund this I would... I think this is what I noticed when I first bought the game, and I haven't touched it in years, and it's still as bad as it was when I first tried it.",1689905885,1689988993,False,1,0,0.491071432828903198,0,True,False,True

When I'm bored I often just start this game and keep improving one of my flying machines or build some random idea that I had. This is the best 20€ I have ever spent in my life. (My mom bought it for me but you understand what I mean.) You can build whatever you want in this game.

The only thing that is not very good in this game is the water physics. To make something float you need to add bubble plastic, the more bubble plastic you add to your creation the more it will float. It's just not a very good system because most of the boat will just consist of bubble plastic. In real boats you can use that space for other things like kitchen, beds etc. In this game you cant because the entire boat is filled with bubble plastic.

Also there is no aerodynamics in this game. You build flying machines with thrusters instead. But there is countless mods that improve this game. Like with aerodynamics.",1688110450,1689423135,True,32,4,0.758590221405029297,0,True,False,True

Apparently I was too close to a static structure and my loot bag clipped through the wall and I couldn't get it. It had around 5 hours of gathered materials in the bag. So I decided to start a new save since I had to grind for the materials anyway and wanted to get a new world gen. The second time I got reset was when I got raided for farming, as you do in this game. The robots came to raid my farm and I killed most of them only to find one of the little robots near my crafting robot 5 minutes later. The Rat bas***d destroyed a large chest with crafting materials in it and 10 hours of grinding just evaporated along with all my food stores. Sure, I get its a survival game and I probably should have been more careful about where I was placing things and built a protective shelter but its very bad game design to just delete hours worth of progress for something like not noticing a rogue robot in the far end of my base just wreaking havoc. Perhaps just drop the contents of the chest on the floor, or you lose 15-50% of what was in the chest. Maybe i'm playing the game wrong but dear lord, for being in early access since 2016, this game should not be this broken. It plays like an alpha build, the combat is braindead, hitboxes are shaky at best, automation aspects are broken(I'm talking  about the water cannon which specifically says it will make watering easier, well It only shoots in one static spot and you can't aim it so what use is that? to water one spot of farm?). There's a lot of good ideas here but I just cant get behind something that has been out for 6 years and doesn't seem to have made any progress.

I will say for a sandbox creative game it does provide a decent experience. The building is okay and it's fun to mess around building crazy things and just screwing around. However, this doesn't make up for the fact the survival mode is completely unbalanced and just not fun (not to mention that is their main focus in marketing... see Scrap Mechanic: Survival). I wouldn't even take the survival mode for free. I wish I could get a refund but I chose to give it a chance and play at least 15 hrs to see if it gets better.

It would be even better if it had more frequent updates to keep the playerbase engaged, but other than that, the game is absolutely amazing and incredibly fun! My friend and I were so hooked on it that we played all night, went to school in the morning, and then came back home to continue playing.

The game really allows your imagination to run wild, which can be both a good and a bad thing. Sometimes, I think that the National Security might be monitoring us because of the way we talk and the advanced technology we develop in the game, capable of commiting crimes so unimaginable and goofy that the history books will credit us for the most damage to the robots in the game and make humankind think ""damn i´m glad they were on our side"". 

I'm really looking forward to Chapter 2. Even though Lego Powerminers might not make a comeback, we can still have fun roleplaying and reconstructing those sets while digging tunnels in Scrap Mechanic. can´t wait to systematically eradicate those underground robots for the fun of it!

This game has gone through so much change since January of 2016 that it's truly inspiring that such a small team of developers have put *SO* much care and detail into their work.

There have been times where i don't play the game for a while, but i *always* come back to it whenever i'm in the mood to just build whatever comes to mind in creative mode. The survival mode feels well thought out and while i do wish it was a bit more instructional on how to play for new players, i'm sure that will be expended in future updates.

The core gameplay mechanic (haha, pun) of building machines to accomplish your goals is simply incredible, something that I've wanted in a game for *years* before this came out, and i've been hooked ever since.

I will admit, there's a bit of jank to this game, it is still in development after all, but I've not come across anything in my over 650 hours of playing that was completely game breaking, unless it was something i did myself, usually involving mods so dabble in that at your own discretion if you like.

But at least it saved the amount of time I spent on worlds. Except it lost all my clothing items... And I can't seem to access any newly claimed ones...

But hey, at least it doesn't crash, so thats good. Not to mention the survival mode is a lot of fun... It's just... Well... Warehouses. I can't seem to ever get enough spuds... But hey everything else is fun, especially those big red guys, oh they can do some damage. Until I pull up in my 300 ton wip, outfitted with drills, teir 3 concrete battering rams, and saw blades. While pulling a trailer that's twice the weight, carrying a fully automatic craft system. And if that ain't enough, I got 2 mountable spud guns... That I can't ever get enough spuds to use...

it has been EA since 2016 and it still is as rusty as I first started playing this game, seems nothing has changed over the past 7 years, which is kinda sad. I don't even know if they are actually updating this game.

It is used in short range air defense missile system designed to protect military units from air attacks in all types of combat situations, including during march.

In 2017, official tests of the newest air defense missile system Bagulnik (domestic variant which is currently named Strela-10ML) were successfully completed. In May 2019, the Russian Defence Ministry decided to introduce the system into service. The Sosna-R missile system, developed by KB Tochmash, is a successor to the 9K35 Strela-10 and serves as a cost-effective alternative to the Tor missile system and Pantsir-S1. It operates in passive mode using various imaging systems such as thermal and TV cameras, along with a laser rangefinder, to detect and engage targets. The system can effectively function under the control of different battery command posts, with the FPU ""Assembly-M1-2"" (9S80M1-2) being the most preferred option due to its resistance to jamming. The Sosna-R system utilizes a tracked SAM launcher mounted on the MT-LB vehicle, capable of carrying 12 missiles with a range of 10 km and an altitude capability of 5 km. The reloading of all 12 missiles can be accomplished within 12 minutes.

The serial production version of the Sosna-R is based on the BMP-3 IFV and provides the ability to engage targets while on the move. The crew consists of a driver and a gunner. The system is armed with 12 9M340 missiles stored in transport-launch containers arranged in two banks of six. These 38 kg, two-stage missiles employ beam-riding guidance and are capable of engaging aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, aerial bombs, small-sized air attack weapons, high-precision weapon elements, and light armored vehicles. The missiles have the ability to change direction during flight and are equipped with a combined impact/proximity laser fuze. The payload includes two warheads weighing a total of 7 kg. The fragmented-rod warhead is designed for proximity detonation near the target, while the armor-piercing/fragmentation (AP-Frag) warhead is triggered upon impact. The system exhibits high resistance to jamming and can also be equipped with an additional small-size acquisition radar.

In addition to the Sosna-R missile system, the Palma anti-aircraft artillery system incorporates eight Sosna-R precision surface-to-air missiles with laser beam guidance, along with two AO-18KDE rapid-fire guns. The Palma system serves as a defensive component, intended for the protection of ships, naval bases, coastal infrastructure, aerodromes, and other vital facilities.

[b]Reasons why i don't recommend this game:[/b]

- It Cannot be played offline! (why?????)
- The game will crash from time to time. 
- The Game is not optimized (FPS drops for silly reasons)
   Ex: Park 2 cars close to each other and FPS will drop from 120 to 10
- Don't even consider multiplayer If you don't have a High End Pc 
   and a perfect internet connection.
- For a solo experience, survival mode is pointless and full of grinding.
- Survival Combat system is trash and exhausting for solo experience.

It boggles the mind that this was such a popular, loved game, and it would have been so easy to maintain a good pace of small but meaningful updates to the survival gameplay. But possibly they just got bored with working on it, or moved on to newer projects that are more profitable for them.

It's a smaller studio but apparently they work like the worst kind of capitalist corporations. Hell, even corporations understand how important is not to abandon things and ruin their image, especially if said things are generally successful.

biggest issue i have had by far is oh my god tapebots are awful. it's tape why does it do fifty five damage. why do some EXPLODE. what. why. another thing: it's totally possible to get spawncamped by bots if your bed happens to be around a lot of them, please just like add some period of invincibility when you respawn so i don't get my skull flattened by three tapebots and a farmbot again
if those new bots they're adding in the next update are any worse then i do not recommend this game at all. otherwise yeah the survival mode is okay and the creative mode is cool. i forgot challenge mode was a thing because i have peanut brain and can't actually make working contraptions other than the boat you slap really hard to move

This game is heavy on your PC and does have a higher cost, but I think it's well worth it if you get it while on sale. This is one of my most played games and the replay ability is pretty good. Make sure to check out the mods too. 
Cons.   My biggest con is the time there is between updates, I do understand it is a complex game using their homemade physics engine as well as they have a small team, but it's killing the game, after three play through's of this game spanned over the few years I've owned it I've finally gotten to the point I can't do another play through without new content.

I am adding my voice along with others. I hope the devs pay attention, but they don't seem to look at steam or reply in steam at all.

They announce an update, then nothing..
They announce a new and different update, then nothing..
They announce another new and different update, then nothing..
Repeat.

Either the updates are a lie, or they really need to learn the term iterative development. Stop making new features and finish the ones you have already announced. 

Devs, the a majority of the community has lost faith in you.

I will update ... probably never.

Whenever i try and build anything more advanced then a car (2 bearings) the games physics fucking shit themself. even placing a flat plate of blocks on a flat ground makes them have palputation. Objects at high speed just dont interact at all, having more then 8 bearings on a creation lags. Having 2 creations next to each other lags horribly, all bearings spawn at 0 degrees position so good luck building some sort of part with rotated arms beacuse they will spawn in themself. Honestly the bearings are the most atrocious piece of gabage in this game. Sometimes when a vehicle hits something at high speed the bearing decide to not work and the parts that were connected just fly out everywhere phase through blocks and get stuck sometimes semi phasing inside the vehicle and make it take off beacuse they want to get back to their original position. Vehicles just jumping when up for no reason when driving on a flat road  (which you can actually see in the trailer), etc.

If someone says -well just lower the physics level, then a bunch of other shit brakes, like suspension just giving up entirely and not working. For a game made around vehicles with working parts you would think that physics would be top notch in orther for the creations to actually work but no. Its made really just to support baby shit like a car or a boat

*If anyone wonders im am a creative player and bought the game before survival was out, and play exclusively creative.
*If anyone wonders what ,,advanced'' vehicles am i building i mostly like building tanks, which often involve having multiple bearing moving  one object in the tank (for example a turret where you need at least 4 bearings for the wheels 2 bearings (without mods) for the turret, and 1 bearing for the gun to move up and down) and the shitty physics cant even handle something as basic as a turret moving without it getting stuck for no apparent reason when the vehicle is on a slope or even when its on flat ground",1681911342,1687991743,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game has been in Early Access for ages and i followed it since then, at that point there was nothing but Sandbox stuff like building bases and vehicles to test out the games capability. (Will get on that quickly.)
Ever since then however its main selling point has been its worst outlier being a uncapable physics engine.
The Game barely uses resources from hardware and seems rather limited by its own software.

Then Survival came out which had a mixed start but eventually came on its own.
However the game has still been plagued by a major issue that has not been fixed, and barely remedied which of course is not enough for its issue;
Bad physics engine performance.

The frames crash down simply from having two cars next to each other, or a 4+ wheeler simply because, the suspension part is for some reason so demanding.
It's natural that players tend to build oversized vehicles or constructions in sandbox games and devs always need to have a engine bracing for it but this game engine doesn't even come close, 2 cars are enough for things to start to have an effect.

Several times me and my friends would have to drop the middle or lategame just because the game engine was stressed out just because of two 6 wheelers (One Harvester, the other a Transport) which aren't even doing anything besides being parked.

But of course the second we start driving it's all a slideshow.
We eventually dropped down to bogey suspension to have as little suspension parts as possible but the performance is still far too unsatisfactory.
We were not even close to finishing building the base.
We both are equipped with RTX machines neccessary for VR and the game barely uses the resources neccessary, as the game seemingly is limited by its own software.

Considering the snail-pace development, and that this issue has been lasting for 7 years with still consistent reports on Forums, this just not acceptable.",1674458643,1687951725,False,5,0,0.503188133239746094,0,True,False,True

Update:
I played this game a lot since i posted the original review, and i have more to say.

Firstly: The game may not get much updates, but mods make the game much more fun and expand the possibilities A LOT.

Secondly: These 3 years of playing this game i made a lot of memories with my close friends, it just feels so good to realize that we are still making these memories, but saddens to think that soon all this will be in the past...

Thirdly: This game is hella buggy but its just f*cking hilarious to see ur buildings fly because something got stuck in itself.

I apologize for the lengthy review but I got some shit to get off my chest and to stand up for the mod community in this game.
- This game came out well over 6 years ago, they've made piss poor progress in updating, communicating actual timeframes and expanding the games internal systems. Best you get are the extremely irregular Dev blogs, that are more a- The Devs actively lobby against the modding community, sending Cease and Desists to mod creators and making their game harder and harder to modify. The fact they have such a HUGE community that wishes to play with mods, supporting with this should of been a no brainer for the Devs and Axolot...
- As for the games age well.... call me old but I'm getting nostalgic reminders of OG Rust Beta and its Legacy Age drama.... 
Its about time that Axolot starts adding smaller updates to the game and actually progressing the game. Make it fun to play again at the very least because holy cow that's what mods are for...

All I got to say to finish off this is... Axolot, start giving a shit about your community and make the game modifiable to a user friendly level. We payed you 20$ in good faith you'd actually make it out of Early access in the first 5 years... Its been well over  2 years since you put out a worthy update (Challenge mode doesn't count because its stupid and no one plays it), you've been teasing ""major"" updates for literal years... like y'all are compensating for something at this point.

There's also logic gates, which, combined with the physics and wiring system, make almost any build far easier to make in Scrap Mechanic than in Minecraft.

*The physics are often a little glitchy. Watch out for the suspension glitch (tho it can be very useful too) and be ready for unstable physics when large forces and/or small distances are involved.

I'm tired of getting content previews, I'd also much prefer they use spoiler tags, kinda like Valheim, so that we can maintain a sense of exploration and discovery.

The building system, while simple is very effective at creating very detailed shapes. The logic system is even better, outdoing minecraft redstone by a mile. As of writing this, I have had the game for more than 4 years, with 600+ hours of playtime.

     creative mode: 
  creative mode is the first mode played by many players, for a good reason. creative mode is a good introduction to the game, the physics (which i will get into later) are consistent and can be reduced. the only problem with creative is the lack of... anything; yes, you can spawn bots and play against them, but if you don't have a friend to play with, creative gets boring and lame (known from experience.) additionally, if you have something that spins too fast and you step on it, it could yeet you out of the map, past the point of detection where the game keeps you in the map.

     survival: 
  survival fixes many of the problems with creative mode, and more; it gives you a sense of purpose, while being better with friend, it doesn't need them to keep from getting horribly boring. As much as i would like to explain the advantages to survival, most of them contain spoilers (therefore, i will not list them) the problems with survival are vast and many, the most clear one is the development era. the development era of survival was pre-survival it was full of many devblogs and teasers. it would have a release date but then get pushed back (due to covid) i am not blaming the devs for this, they had very few developers with such a small studio however, they greatly over hyped the survival release. first, they announced survival mode too soon, this would mean that people would get exited for it, but since survival wasn't even 1/8 done, many people's hope and patience died, causing the mode to get over hyped. additionally, there were too many devblogs with feature that never got implemented, these features may get added in future updates, but since they were announced and never added, the mode felt barren compared to what was announced. ignoring the over hyping of survival, the main problem is the grind; it isn't horrible, but it feels disappointing when you finally get something good (this will probably get fixed in chapter 2, where they are adding blueprints that you need to find)

     challenge mode: 
  this mode is my least favorite mode: it doesn't really do anything, and the skill curve feels off compared to the rest of the game (survival is medium hard at first, then it levels off. challenge is more exponential)

     mods: 
  mods are a great way to take the game and make it crazy, for many people, they only play with mods, for other people, the don't like mods. i cannot give a realistic review for mods since there are too many and they are heavily opinion based. 

     custom games: 
  to some people, survival is boring and bland, but they want mods to add to it. however, survival cant be modified without changing game files. so, how do you mod survival? make a custom game. custom games are great since they aren't mods, but infact, a baseline. a great example of a custom game is scrap factory (made by Dr. pixel plays) this custom game turns 'peaceful building game' into 'roblox tycoon but better' and that is just one of the examples of the stuff you can do with custom games.

     In conclusion, scrap mechanic is a great sandbox game for everyone and is worth the money, before you write a bad review, take a minute to check if the mode that you are playing is what you like, if not, then try another one.",1578761351,1687312489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Given that the survival mode hasn't received an update of any significance in over two years, and that the next update has no ETA the devs will commit to but will be the update that brings the game out of early access, you will see one of three things occur:

A) the update drops in 2023 with three years worth of content updates, bug fixes, and optimizations, giving us an entirely new game and bringing the survival mode and multiplayer experience to where they should be.

B) the update drops in 2023 and amounts to what is ultimately a minor story update and some new parts but does nothing to address: the lack of meaningful progression, the incredible grind for components, and the overall instability currently plaguing multiplayer. The game joins the ever-growing ranks of the physics builders with no actual gameplay a la Space Engineers or Stormworks. 

C) we get one or two more Devblogs but no update. Add one to every number or year listed above and continue waiting.",1605766075,1687037223,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Is the best sandbox game i ever saw, cuz this really lets you create all kind of vehicles, from simple cars to complex giant bases. The tematic is also very fun, and figthing against some robots too. The only flaws that i see are that you need too much grinding, and that you need more story and parts (like plane parts) but, just install a mod or 2 and its solved!! (I Highly recomend ""Fant Mod"").
So if you like this kind of games, i recomend to buy it now (cuz the price now is soo low) and waiting till the next update that will be very EPIC!! (Just watch the devblogs).
I also recomend playng whit friends, wich gives you a very much better experience, fighting with machines or collaborating and soo... And you can use Youtube to learn some good tricks and tips ;)

Saw the update posts and thought I'd jump back in, experience some of the new content since it looked really cool.

Steamcloud kept my save and the save file is over a year old. There is no new content. At all. STAY AWAY.
The best we've gotten are little images, concepts and gifs. Even if they do eventually come out with that content, how fucking long will it take to fix the innumerable bugs? That's assuming it even comes out at all and this doesn't get abandoned.

Give your money to an Indie dev that actually gives a shit about their playerbase.

Edit:

TL:DR The melee combat makes Skyrim look like Dark Souls, the terrain physics are a slippery nightmare, the farming makes me yearn for taxes and the one thing I wanted to do in the game, I never had time for.

As for the game itself, I got this for the survival. It is a slog. The concept of advancing and building up your vehicles sounds fun. The execution is not.

Gathering resources is a bit of a chore, but not too bad. The problem is what you get out of it, which is very little. And what you do get, you may have to refine and lose about 50% in the refining process.

The farming is an absolute chore. Easily the worst part of the game and it is tied to progression. In order to get a ranged weapon, you have to farm. Also to eat, but you can get around that, kind of. You HAVE to get a ranged weapon because the hammer is a goddamn slap fight with the fork bots.

Watering your farm is EXTREMELY tedious. Each soil plot needs to be watered each time you plant. This requires one bucket of water, that, in order to fill, you have to walk up to water and click for each bucket. In order to use buckets for watering, you'll need a lot of them, and they cost you precious resources and time. Watering can? What kind of space-age tech is that?  Alternatively it takes one shot of water from the watering cannon to water one plot. The watering cannon is not something you can hold, oh no, nothing fun like that, and it's not a stream, it's one little shot of water. You have to design a structure to irrigate your crops. Look it up on youtube, save yourself the nightmare. It sucks.

Then you need defenses, but defenses are frustrating too. Want a sawblade to defend your farm? Joke's on you, the damn bots shy away from it, making them perpetually stare at you, out of range of your defenses. They do this to your vehicles too, which makes the bots so annoying and not satisfying to deal with. Having them standing still would be great with a potato gun, but if you don't, now you have to step outside your defenses and melee them, which is a nightmare all it's own. Oh and if there are multiple bots, you're probably going to die, and god I hope you remembered to put your spawn point nearby.

All of this crap takes away from the reason I got this game: To make cool vehicles to overcome terrain and other challenges in the survival world. But most of my time spent was on keeping fed, designing a farm and watering, gathering resources with minuscule returns, fighting with physics scrounging for component kits to make literally anything you build actually worth a damn... it's not fun. It's busywork stopping you from exploring an interesting world ( which is not present, as far as I know,) or overcoming challenges using your vehicles and tools.

What ended my last run was welding. My trailer, which had all of my chests full of resources, kept sliding and rolling around on the uneven terrain of my temporary base. I tried blocking it's wheels and it would still somehow slide along the ground. I took the wheels off and it would still slide. I eventually got fed up and welded it to the terrain, and that worked. However that was along the path the bots would spawn every night to attack the farm. So I tried to put it off to the side and weld it to the rock wall.  Unfortunately, it welded upside down, and the majority of my trailer became submerged into the terrain. I broke the piece attaching it to the wall, but nope. It is now a structure, with all of my chests completely inaccessible. Fuck you scrap mechanic and your buggy, wonky physics.",1685260128,1686534425,False,3,0,0.525691688060760498,0,True,False,True

I did not care for this game so I will place here a recipe for huckleberry pancakes instead.

Huckleberry pancakes.

1 3/4 cups all purpose white flour
4 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups of buttermilk
5 tablespoon butter, melted
2 large eggs
1/2 cup Huckleberries
In medium bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt, set aside. In small bowl combine buttermilk, butter and eggs. Add buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture, combine until mixed do not over mix (I prefer to use a whisk it does the best job). Fry at 400 degrees. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle and sprinkle with the huckleberries.

Cook on first side about 3 minutes until bubbles appear along the edge of the pancake. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more and golden brown. Serve with a big pat of butter, and some pure maple syrup ( get the real stuff it is worth it).",1686338090,1686338090,False,0,3,0.370354384183883667,0,True,False,True

The advertised gameplay is barely present, it is unplayable without a guide, and it offers very little for the money you're spending. The devs abandoned this game for 3 years, and based on the recent dev blog, I do not have high hopes for improvement anytime soon.

I really enjoyed this game in the beginning, but I am updating my review to say that I have grown pretty disappointed in it since I purchased it 2.5 years ago. Since then, I've played many more small team Early Access titles, including others from this developer, and they have far exceeded the offerings we have been stuck with for some time now.

I think the source of my feelings stems from the fact that the developers decided that the story mode and gameplay should take a back seat to their sandbox vehicle builder. It became ""how can we make funny car physics"" the game, instead of that mechanic adding a unique twist to the story mode gameplay, as is advertised.

Even with the little story that does exist, it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to make any progress with it. It felt like we were grinding for hours and not getting anywhere because managing hunger and thirst was such a burden. I tried replaying it with a variety of different people, and each time we hit a point where managing resources was all we were doing, and it got tiresome really quickly. 

Also, there is very little guidance provided - No tutorial, no storyline to follow, no hints. You HAVE to play this with the wiki open to figure out even the most basic game mechanics. Without it, the game is impossible to progress in.

The team has just come back from hiatus to update the game again, and what they're offering is... More enemy types? In my opinion, the storymode in this game needs a huge overhaul before they start adding in more shiny things for us to look at. Otherwise, the team may as well re-brand the game as a funny vehicle driving simulator.",1596168278,1686099886,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

edit: i forgot to mention that yes the game has terrible optimization and the multiplayer is subpar, the performance was an issue with my earlier builds of cars and whatnot yes the devs should work on making the game use more then 2 cores HOWEVER that doesn't stop you the player, from learning workaround to optimize your creations so they run at more then 2fps.",1673989352,1685585114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In its current state, however, it is not worth the purchase. Development seems to be pretty slow, and it's currently in the funk of Early Access where you can't tell if it is going to pan out yet. 

When it becomes more content complete, may very well be a solid game, but right now not worth it.

================================

UPDATE (Spring 2018): Almost two years since I wrote this review, this game has made almost no large-scale, meaningful progress.

I classified this experience as a fun little sandbox to mess around in, with some neat little features.

Today, it's no different. Just a cute little sandbox with some tools to mess around with. 

There really just isn't much of an excuse. Look at Rust, having a comparable dev team, and pushing out significant content patches on a weekly or biweekly schedule.

================================

UPDATE 2 (Summer 2018): After giving up pretty hard on the game's pace of development, I've noticed that the last few months have seen much much more meaningful progress towards survival mode and the gameplay that the game initially hoped to feature. The quality of updates has increased dramatically in every sense. I really hope that we can see survival mode in the next year or so.

================================

UPDATE 3 (Winter 2019): Well I guess my hopes were a bit much, we're four years into Early Access, and there's still no end in sight. Who knows, at one point it might get there. Here's hoping that the game is even functional and playable when they've finished filling it with content, given how inconsistent the game's performance seems to be.

================================

UPDATE 4 (Winter 2021): Jeez, it's been two years since I took a look at this game and it's still not even close to being a functional, complete work.

Every update blog says the same thing: Delay, Some Progress, Delay, Some Progress, Delay. 

Tons of new fluffy doohickeys to mess around with, but still looks like there's no... game...

See you all in another 2 years? Maybe then we'll be there?

I see there have been no released updates for two years, but their social media has been active and every few months they post an update about a huge ""Chapter 2"" update. 1) Stop ignoring people asking for more communication on update progress and release dates. 2) If you bit off more than you could chew with the huge ""Chapter 2"" update you're planning, you need to ship smaller updates. Your game still needs some really basic stuff.

- It needs a map, or at least a compass
- I spent 30 hours wondering why this game didn't have a block, or any kind of defense option, only to find out that the sledgehammer has a block but it's ONLY IN CREATIVE MODE AND NOT IMPLEMENTED IN SURVIVAL? COME ON
- I keep accidentally putting switches inside walls and 16x16 slabs inside floors that are gone forever, hanging inside the void just out of reach. Your building mode needs polish - and you're ignoring it to work on a new ""mining"" mode?
- An enemy that can swarm you in numbers, and kills you in two ranged hits, on ""NORMAL"" mode in a game with no armor and only one kind of health item that takes whole seconds to use is ridiculous
- My character is currently stuck inside the ""outside"" area of one of the vent ducts in a warehouse, after one of the red grenade robots started shooting grenades into a vent I was in, destroying the floor underneath me. Seems like it would be easy to put some blocks down and climb out, except some asshole decided you shouldn't be able to place bricks in warehouse levels, or even move around the pre-placed boxes to make a staircase out.

I miss when this game received updates. Since the release of survival mode in 2020, this game has seen no substantial additions aside from a yearly drip feed of content for challenge mode. As it stands, survival mode itself is nothing special, and content for creative mode has stagnated. If you've never played it before, Scrap Mechanic is still worth the $20 for creative mode alone, but if you're buying it for a survival experience, or returning after a few years hoping for something new, you will likely walk away underwhelmed.


[b]2017 Review:[/b]
If you have an imagination and love building things with moving parts, get this game! It isn't too hard to understand, the only skill required is a basic grasp of sequencing tasks (rotate bearing 90 degrees, then extend piston 7 blocks). Currently the game only has creative mode and a single map, but survival mode and procedurally generated worlds are planned. There are also currently no weapons in the game, but potato guns are going to be added in a future update.

TL;DR

Pros
-Lots of fun tools to work with
-Relatively frequent updates
-Easy to understand
-Good physics engine
-Your imagination is the limit (you can build anything you can think of)
-Steam workshop support
-You can put two toilet paper rolls together to make a paper towel roll

Cons
-Early Access, so survival mode, day/night cycle, weapons, and enemies are not yet added
-May lag depending on how complex your creations are
-No player customization (yet)
-Your imagination is the limit (you can't build it unless you're able to think of it)

Overall, creative people will enjoy how much this game has to offer, but people with limited creativity may find themselves getting bored after a few hours.",1504652451,1685221694,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are a couple of things that I think could improve the overall experience while we wait for the next update, hopefully coming soon.

1. While I have close to 500 hours on record at the time of posting a review, the game at this time feels a bit empty. I have completed all warehouses, and all I have left to do at this point is finalize my base while waiting for chapter 2. I would like to see more frequent updates with smaller amounts of content rather than the tsunami of content being promised by the developers for over 2 years now. For future content updates, it would be great if we seen new content every couple of months, even if on a smaller scale.

2. Multiplayer improvements would be a great area to be focused on if nothing is fixed in the upcoming update. At this time, multiplayer is practically unplayable with the amount of issues surrounding it, hopefully the developers will focus their time and resources to fix this so playing with friends is a much smoother experience. Because we all know, games like Scrap Mechanic is much more fun with friends.

Overall, this game is a great experience. It is a challenge to the mind to figure out all the different things you can create with the available parts, but it will be much better to get new content to play with, hopefully coming soon rather than later. I love this game and knowing the fanbase is dying out due to a lack of content and what feels like empty promises from the developers, I am hopeful Scrap Mechanic will become revitalized with a player base that can enjoy the game as much as I have.",1684794916,1684794916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!
I'll start with the positives first (because unfortunately this game also has some negatives)
- It has a large community that creates many different buildings and mods.
- The story is okay, but there's something missing.
Now let me start talking about the negatives
- Unfortunately, but updates are rare
- When you're a new player, it's hard to learn how things work, like logic gates
And now my ideas to spice up the game a bit
- Add steam achievements
- Add new biomes
- Add new animals such as birds, boars and goats
- Balance some enemies and also those that appear
- Add missions that will give you npcs

The loop:
Grow food, defend against the bots who are upset by your farming, eat, drink, gather up their parts and local resources to expand production, repeat.

What's here is a complete game, and a far more complete experience than a good deal of ""finished"" games.  There's not just physics construction, but reasons to do so; problems to deal with and challenges to overcome.  And I'm talking about in survival, not just the challenge levels.

The game progresses smoothly, gives you the basics in a straightforward manner, and leaves you to your own devices.

Surviving is not difficult; growing enough food to keep the mechanic alive is easy to do even without angering the bots, which leaves plenty of time to figure out how to build something bigger, better, faster or ... more specialized.

Trees don't respawn ... instead, as you gather materials and locate landmarks, the cramped forests become rolling landscapes where you can see roaming little bots from greater distances, making it easier to line them up and run them over with a combine (for instance), snatching up their dismembered limbs for use in an even larger combine.

I've been enjoying it again lately, and can heartily recommend it as a very enjoyable game.  While it is still in early access, and it's updates are few and far between, this game is already easily worth the $20.  It's a unique take with impressive stability.  There's nothing just broken here, and that alone is a big deal in this market.

However.  The Dev team is out of touch.  It's been 3 years since survival released. I don't want to sound like a ""whiny gamer"" but its frustrating considering after 250 hours i set the game down to wait for the next survival update.  That was 2 years ago.  I imagine Covid played a part in this, as did the final push to get raft finished.  (but now theyre pushing that to consoles so....the dev support i thought scrap mechanic was going to get, probably won't happen.)

The grind in this game is unreal.  Without mods to adjust drop rates for things, the grind takes forever alone.  I think the reason the drop rates are so low is because even with a decent pc (3070 10700k, my pc is no slouch)  a small automated farm and a couple complex vehicles absolutely TANK fps.  Very heavily CPU bound, mainly because the physics all run off one core. 

The Devs seem to like to go AWOL for 6 months at a time?  To the point where the community considers this game abandonware.  I think they had some major direction problems in chapter 2 development, not knowing where to take the game, while being choked by their physx problems, only to then get tbagged by covid shot this game in the foot.  

I'm only not recommending this game until the new ""massive"" update comes out.  IF what the devs say is true, we should be getting an entire game rebalance, and over double the content and pretty much everything the community has asked for and more...We just want the devs to communicate more.  Tease us, even if its just a tweet every couple weeks.",1683815044,1683815044,False,2,0,0.505235612392425537,0,True,False,True

I used to fill up shelfs at Wal-Mart and Tesco, but Scrap Mechanic Survival gave me a new opportunity and i don't need to work in these lesser-class jobs anymore.
Be like me, buy your own diploma now for 19.99€ and fulfill your dreams.

Now to the serious part:

Scrap Mechanic is a sandbox-style game that allows you to build and design your own vehicles, machines, and contraptions in a sprawling open-world environment. Developed by Axolot Games, the game offers a unique and engaging gameplay experience that rewards creativity and experimentation.

In the game, you play as a mechanic who has crash-landed on a planet filled with scrap material and hostile robots. You must scavenge for resources, build and customize your own vehicles, and fend off the robotic enemies that inhabit the world.

One of the game's standout features is its building system. The game offers a wide variety of building blocks and parts that you can use to create almost anything you can imagine, from simple cars to complex machines that perform a variety of functions. The building system is intuitive and easy to use, with a wide range of tools and functions that allow you to create and customize your creations in real-time.

The game's graphics are also impressive, with a colorful and vibrant art style that makes the world feel alive and dynamic. The game's sound design is also top-notch, with a variety of sound effects and musical cues that add to the game's immersive atmosphere.

In addition to the main campaign, the game offers a variety of multiplayer modes that allow you to collaborate and compete with other players from around the world. This adds a level of community to the game, as you can share your creations with others and discover new and innovative designs from other players.

One potential downside to the game is that it can be somewhat challenging at times, especially when it comes to building more complex machines and vehicles. However, this also adds a level of depth and strategy to the game, as you must think critically and plan out your designs in order to succeed.

In conclusion, Scrap Mechanic is a fun and engaging sandbox-style game that rewards creativity and experimentation. With its intuitive building system, vibrant graphics, and immersive sound design, this game is a must-play for anyone who loves to tinker and create.

survival is extremely unbalanced and unless you have a spud gun(which is hard to obtain) you can't go any where without dying.

Play for creative, not survival, i only play because i'm stupid
(56.5hrs at time of review 1)
review 2: I like this game now :)

I stand by my last review for the most part but once i became better at the game and created a flying machine the game became fun, although that is absurd because I shouldn't need glitches to have fun.
It has a charm.

review 3(385 hours): I love this game so much, the possibilities are endless and the challenges persist when creating no matter your skill, i've made a cargo plane, a jet, a truck, a self stabilising monowheel, a trike, a bike, a mobile survival base, a submarine, a tank and a farm so big all the soil in my survival world couldn't fill it. I love this game so much, the possibilities are insane. If you like low priced games with insane amounts of freedom in your own creativity then buy this damn game.",1647032929,1683483935,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,2,True,False,True

Everything in this game is completely and utterly dysfunctional. Not a single thing I think I have done in this game has worked as it should, to the point where it is quite frankly, impossible to play. The physics engine in this game is so infuriatingly bad, that collision is not a feature, and rather a bug. Collisions between creations send your FPS so low it might as well be displayed as a fraction. Also, bearings and pistons are somehow not strong enough to hold themselves together and will sag so much that it'll become completely detached and start floating a metre away. The game also includes suspensions, but they will provide your creation with enough rotational momentum to send you spinning in constant circles with more than enough force to take off from the ground after simply colliding with pretty much anything. Not only is the physics bad in the first place, but it’s incredibly unoptimised and laggy, especially between creations, as mentioned earlier.  The developers however, for ONE TIME in their lives, listened to the community, and added a physics slider. The developers, however, made this feature completely and utterly useless, because using said slider will somehow make the bearings EVEN SAGGIER, to the point where they have complete 3 axis movement in all directions. The terrain has horrible collision, to the point where half the time there's no collision at all. If your character has enough velocity, they will simply fall right through and you'll get this annoying pop-up saying ""Hey! You're playing the game wrong!"" as if there's a right way to play this steaming pile of crap. Then, you'll be teleported up, and for some reason in survival, you'll be teleported so high you'll probably end up falling right through again.

Speaking of survival, it is so incomprehensibly broken and boring to the point where it's no longer a game anymore. I don't know how anyone could play survival without half of the main story items (if there even is a story), because half of them are missing and if you even can get them, they will probably fall through the map somehow. To give an example of how common this is, during every single one of my playthroughs, at least one thing has fallen through the floor, into the abyss never to be seen again while being kept entirely still as I explore the map. The story, however, is so half baked that it barely ties in together at all. It's lazy, disorganised, and completely contradictory. The map is also filled with warehouses, their only purpose being a little bit of loot, some cosmetic items, and most importantly, some special seeds. Different warehouses have different amounts of levels, each level getting harder. However, the warehouses with more levels have no more loot than the smaller ones meaning there is no real reason to battle your way through them. Survival mode is mostly spent grinding for component kits just so you can upgrade your creations, or fuel to power them, but there is one thing that really takes over the survival gameplay loop: farming. Farming is incredibly important in survival, as it will supply you with ammo for your ranged spud guns, food, and probably most importantly, it will allow you to package your produce. The reason why packaged fruits and vegetables is so useful is because you can use them to trade with the trader. The trader is the only way to acquire spud guns, which is pretty much its only use, as the rest of the items are extremely overpriced. The special seeds mentioned during the earlier segment on warehouses are used for trading, their use being for the spud shotgun, and spudling gun. However, these guns are not necessary at all and are quite expensive considering that planting these seeds will up the difficulty of your farming. The reason farming these more advanced fruits and vegetables is harder is because of the raid system. Each night, your farm will be raided by a collection of bots, found throughout the map, who will try to destroy the crops. The more advanced the seeds are, the more bots will come, and the stronger the bots will be. Not only this, but some crops take multiple days to grow, unless you use fertiliser. You will have to re-water each crop every time you farm, and you will have to fight off the bots over and over again each time you farm, just to get some basic resources or to slightly “upgrade” your weapon. In my opinion, the fact that you will have to spend most of your entire playthrough doing the same, gruelling tasks repeatedly just to slightly progress or create a basic contraption, simply isn’t worth the time, and unless you are more focused on achieving things like the alternative weapons, limits off a lot of the fun in this game.

The worst part is survival isn't even the main focus of the game. The main, original, mode is creative, and is also riddled with bugs. The map in creative is WAY smaller even after they increased the maximum map size. The main focus on the creative mode is on, well, being creative. However, it doesn't it do very well. Any innovative idea you have will be slammed head first into a metaphorical brick wall until you regret any intentions of executing it. In the end, you usually end up either having to scrap the idea entirely, do the same idea over and over again slight differently each time, or if you're dedicated, then painstakingly tweak and remaster the design until it works (if it works). Now, I'm going to talk about the multiplayer. Oh boy is the multiplayer absolutely UNPLAYABLY HORRENDOUS. I played this game a lot with my friend and he could not take one step without the game sending him into a jittery mess of random velocity and collisionless teleportation. Even past the most basic features, it somehow gets even worse. The optimisation in multiplayer is almost non-existent and chaos ensues should you spawn in an even slightly complex creation. You know what I said earlier about saggy bearings, well anything that involves physics with something it’s attached to will end up completely desynced half the time and will jitter and overextend only to correct itself moments later, disorientating the player. Also, a bit problem is the input lag. To be fair, it’s usually when playing with an unoptimised mod, but when there’s input lag moving around is almost impossible. Blocks place a second late, your character moves a second late, everything happens a second after it should. Usually, the result of this is clearing the whole world, losing progress on old creations, just for it to have a chance of working again.

The developers decided to add one final mode, called ""Challenge Mode"". However, challenge mode doesn't have many of the parts and features and has no real extra features of its own apart from the basic mechanics. It’s not really a main mode and doesn't contribute much at all to the game. In addition, Challenge Mode suffers from a lot of bugs that will probably not get fixed for ages if at all. There are many incidents of not just me, not just my friend, but even youtubers and just the general community, crashing for no real reason during challenge mode. Previously, it was also hard to get some things working due to the limitations only lifted almost 4 years after its release in the 0.6.0 update that added 10 new inbuilt levels, a cosmetic set for beating all 50 of them, and some copied, long-overdue features from survival.

Apparently, that wasn't enough though, as in the same 0.6.0 update the developers decided to add a new game mode. They titled it ""Custom Game"", and it's a way for modders to make their own game modes using the “Scrap Mechanic Mod Tool”, which was overhauled in the same update. This was a good feature from Axolot purely because it allowed dedicated and talented people to fix the mistakes they couldn't.

In conclusion, this game is absolutely amazing, and I would recommended it to anyone of all kinds. It's really fun especially with friends.",1682192847,1682699768,True,64,62,0.756007373332977295,7,True,False,True

Multiplayer has server-wide lag spikes which as far as I can tell are unavoidable. Animation bugs look silly, certain items cannot be picked up if placed in certain places, among a myriad of other small issues.

Survival is not ready for public consumption. Certain resources seem to simple have a chance to never spawn, and it lacks an overarching ultimate goal. What more is that the balance hits this uncanny valley. This game's greatest strength is being able to create interesting contraptions. But just getting to that point requires a ton a resource grinding and luck. My GF & I literally spent 4 hours between us just looking for cotton, and could never find a single one. Making basic things should be cheap and easy, and those basic things can be used to harvest enough resources to feed into advanced things.

Otherwise, creative mode is pretty good if you can motivate yourself to create.

of aviation,


there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.


Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

The bee, of course, flies anyway


because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.


Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.


Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.


Barry! Breakfast is ready!


Coming!


Hang on a second.


Hello?

- Barry?
- Adam?


- Can you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.


Looking sharp.


Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.


Sorry. I'm excited.


Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.


A perfect report card, all B's.

Very proud.


Ma! I got a thing going here.


- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!


- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!


Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!


- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.


- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.


Never thought I'd make it.


Three days grade school,
three days high school.


Those were awkward.


Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.


You did come back different.


- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.


- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.


- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.


Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.


Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.


I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.


I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.


That's why we don't need vacations.


Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.


- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!


- Bee-men.
- Amen!


Hallelujah!


Students, faculty, distinguished bees,


please welcome Dean Buzzwell.


Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...


...9:15.


That concludes our ceremonies.


And begins your career
at Honex Industries!


Will we pick our job today?


I heard it's just orientation.


Heads up! Here we go.


Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.


- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.


Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco


and a part of the Hexagon Group.


This is it!


Wow.


Wow.


We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life


to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.


Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.


Our top-secret formula


is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured


into this soothing sweet syrup


with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...


Honey!


- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!


- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.


- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive


to improve every aspect
of bee existence.


These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.


- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.


Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.


- What does that do?
- Catches that little strand of honey


that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.


Can anyone work on the Krelman?


Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know


that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.


But choose carefully


because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.


The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.


What's the difference?


You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off


in 27 million years.


So you'll just work us to death?


We'll sure try.


Wow! That blew my mind!


""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?


One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.


I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.


But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?


Why would you question anything?
We're bees.


We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.


You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?


Like what? Give me one example.


I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.


Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.


Wait a second. Oheck it out.


- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.


I've never seen them this close.


They know what it's like
outside the hive.


Yeah, but some don't come back.


- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!


You guys did great!


You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!


- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.


Their day's not planned.


Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.


You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.


Right.


Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.


It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.


Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.


Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?


Distant. Distant.


Look at these two.


- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.


It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.


Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!


He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!


- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.


What were you doing during this?


Trying to alert the authorities.


I can autograph that.


A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?


Yeah. Gusty.


We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.


- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!


A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.


- Maybe I am.
- You are not!


We're going 0900 at J-Gate.


What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?


I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.


Hey, Honex!


Dad, you surprised me.


You decide what you're interested in?


- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.


Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?


Son, let me tell you about stirring.


You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.


You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.


You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,


maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.


You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?


That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.


Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!


- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.


You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!


- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!


Wait till you see the sticks I have.


I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!


Let's open some honey and celebrate!


Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.


Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!


I'm so proud.


- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.


Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.


Yeah, right.


Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...


- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!


One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.


- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!


Wow!


Oouple of newbies?


Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!


Make your choice.


- You want to go first?
- No, you go.


Oh, my. What's available?


Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.


- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.


I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.


Wax monkey's always open.


The Krelman opened up again.


What happened?


A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.


Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.


Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!


Oh, this is so hard!


Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,


humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,


mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?


Barry!


All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...


What happened to you?
Where are you?


- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?


- Out there.
- Oh, no!

There weren't too many problems early on, but the game peaked with the release of survival mode years ago.
Scrap Mechanic's been in Early Access  for over 7 years now, Development's been agonisingly slow, especially considering they have a decent sized team.

Check the discussion page - There's evidence the developer basically abandoned Scrap Mechanic to develop a new game (Crew Commander).

But no updates or improvements to the Survival Mode 
and some light updates to Challenge Mode in March 2022 

To bad !! The game had so much potential when Survival mode first came 
but then again progress is even slower then 7 days to die and that saying something 

At least 7 days to die has more to do and see 
Cause when u have build your incredible machines in this game 
the rest of the game is Stale and boring no Story no missions no impact and its clunky to 

SO don't buy it before the Devs put in a lot more work and love  !!!!

Update inc new DEVBLOG 27/03/2023  MAYBE THIS YEAR MAYBE NOT
Will be the first Big Content update since Survival Mode came out --> May 7, 2020 <--
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally it's almost time!!! A new chapter + new bots to play with what a joy
Too bad no date has been set for all those goodies

and that with so many good titles coming out like Hytale, Nightingale, Dune, 7DTD A21
New super massive Valheim update, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria
Palworld ect I hope it's not too little too late, well, we'll see, I guess
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Chapter update

At the risk of sounding like a broken bot: while we still don’t have an exact release date 
For the next chapter, we are still aiming for this year. 
It’s worth mentioning that the next chapter has turned into a behemoth of an update, with a ton of new content. We remain confident that it will be worth the wait. We know that it can be frustrating and boring, but we have to make sure it’s great.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1679311182,1679311182,True,2,0,0.501905977725982666,0,True,False,True

As with any creation based game, you are almost entirely limited to your imagination; whether that is limited to recreating objects from other games / movies / franchises or creating your own unique designs. As with most creation based games, you are locked to a 90 degree build grid which is the only other limitation.

As for the game: the survival mode was exciting at first but quickly became dull without any real goal. The story is not existant (chapter 2 will introduce quests and the story line).

For the game mechanics: logic can get pretty hectic, but other than that the game is relatively simple, with the hardest thing being creating neutrally buoyant aircraft.

Updates are few and far between, sometimes taking so long it almost feels like the dev(s) gave up on the game. 

Overall I would give it an 6.5 out of 10, just because it is a rather average creation game, but could easily turn into an 8-10 depending on the quality of the Chapter 2 release and all future updates down the road.",1679044429,1679045108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The only thing that bugs me is the wheel physics could be better, racecar physics one area where the game Trailmakers is far, far better.

Challenge Mode is excellent, it give you limited parts and asks you to build a vehicle to solve a puzzle. This is honestly where Scrap Mechanic shines, in my opinion. It focuses on the best parts of the game, being the impressive physics engine and programmable parts.

Survival mode is a mixed bag, I recommend bringing a friend for it, since there is some grind at first gathering materials. There are fun puzzles you can solve by building machines to help accomplish tasks such as gathering wood and stone, rescuing trapped farmers and packaging and transporting produce to the trader. These legitimately challenge you to actually build machines with some complexity, which like I said is where the game shines... The dungeons, on the other hand, are generally designed to go into on foot with a melee weapon or spudgun, turning the game into a discount FPS.

[hr][/hr]
Scrap Mechanic is a fantastic sandbox game that allows players to create their own machines, contraptions, and vehicles using various materials and components. 

[b]Mechanics/Physics[/b]
First and foremost, the game's mechanics and physics are simply outstanding. The movements of the objects, as well as their weight and momentum, all feel incredibly realistic. This means that players will have to carefully consider the designs and materials they use when creating their machines, and it adds an element of challenge and creativity to the gameplay.

[b]Graphics/Sound Design[/b]
The graphics are also impressive, with vibrant colors and excellent attention to detail. The world feels alive, with different environments, creatures, and objects that add to the game's immersive experience. The sound design is also well-done, with appropriate sound effects and a catchy soundtrack that adds to the overall fun factor.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
The game's single-player mode is enjoyable, with various missions and challenges to complete. However, where Scrap Mechanic really shines is in its multiplayer mode. The game allows players to collaborate and build together, which can lead to some truly impressive creations. Players can also join public servers or create their own, providing plenty of opportunities for social gameplay.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
One of the only downsides to Scrap Mechanic is that it can be a bit overwhelming for new players. The game has a steep learning curve, with a large number of materials, components, and mechanics to master. However, the game's tutorials and helpful community can make this process much smoother.

Overall, Scrap Mechanic is an excellent sandbox game that provides endless hours of entertainment for players who enjoy creative building, problem-solving, and social gameplay.

Getting off the ground is difficult, and the game doesn't provide you with any direction on your priority list. You can waste LOADS of time if you don't know what you're doing. So, here's How To Get To The Fun Part.
Firstly, start in the Puzzle/Challenge mode. This will help you learn the basics of How To Build Vehicles, with limited parts lists and clear objectives. You don't have to 100% it, but its plenty fun and will guide you through vehicle design pretty damn well. Then, once you have some friends on, load up your survival file.

After getting to the mechanic shop, make a Craft bot and a resource refiner, then AS SOON AS YOU ARE ABLE, make a Gas Engine, a Drill, and a Resource Container. This will let you start mining the big stone blocks for metal, which is about 10X faster than trying to kill robots for it.

I believe that still, just waiting for the new survival chapter.
This game has given me hours upon hours of fun and I don't think many other games have done that for me in the way that this game gets you to think out how you want to play, set goals in survival or trying to understand how to use a logic gate for more that a two way door.

All in all, fantastic game I will always recommend to someone looking for a creative mechanical building game.

What you get right now is a pretty fun experience creating a slew of different vehicles and devices. The system for making moving part is fairly straight forward allowing you to make anything from a simple door to as complex as a house that folds up into a car.

I played creative mode only a little bit. Honestly, this is probable where the game shines most at this point.

Survival mode is pretty fun, but without any major endgame goals. Collecting resources and slowly building your first rudimentary contraptions is great! Later on however,  'Dungeons' or whatever they are called do not allow you to build. It sort of defeats the purpose of being a 'Scrap Mechanic'. If your creative, you can fit a small vehicle through the entrance, but it doesn't feel like this was intended. More of a happy accident.

The combat is currently lacking. It ranges from easily kite-able melee bots to ranged enemies that blow through your health in a few hits as soon as they are agroed. It can be fun to create contraptions to kill bots, but it's sometimes hit or miss when they take damage.

As a mechanic, you must explore a vast open world full of resources, collect parts and tools, and build everything from simple vehicles to complex machines.

One of the game's strengths is its building system, which is both intuitive and powerful. You can snap parts together in various configurations to create your own unique designs, and the game's physics engine allows you to test and refine your creations in a fun and interactive way.

The game's graphics are also a highlight, with a charming and colorful aesthetic that brings the game world to life. The sound effects and music are catchy and upbeat, adding to the overall enjoyable experience.

The game also offers a variety of different modes, including singleplayer and multiplayer, as well as different challenges and objectives to complete. The multiplayer aspect is particularly engaging, with the ability to collaborate or compete with other players to build the most impressive creations.

One potential downside to the game is that it can be quite challenging, especially when it comes to building complex machines or vehicles. The learning curve can be steep, and the game's complexity may be overwhelming for some players. However, with practice and patience, the game offers a deeply rewarding and satisfying building experience.

Overall, ""Scrap Mechanic"" is an excellent building game that will appeal to fans of the genre. With its intuitive building system, engaging gameplay mechanics, and immersive multiplayer, it's a great choice for anyone who wants to unleash their creativity and build amazing machines and vehicles from scrap materials.

You can still be considered the driver at fault even if the police or your insurance company divide the blame 51% to you and 49% to the other party. But some types of accidents are clearer in terms of liability and fault.

Rear-Ending Another Car
You might have been driving too aggressively or following too closely if you hit the back of the car in front of you. Insurance companies will often assume the fault is yours when this happens.1

Driving Under the Influence
It will cast a lot of doubt on any statement you make about your accident if you were driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while intoxicated (DWI). Drunk driving is such a risky practice that it will cause most insurance companies to raise your rates right away. Your license can be suspended in 42 states as well if you receive a DUI or DWI.2

Note
It might even be legal for your insurance company to refuse to make payment for your injuries if you receive a DWI or DUI.

Not Obeying Traffic Signals
It's referred to as a ""moving violation"" if you don't follow traffic and obey signals, signs, or directives. There are many kinds of moving violations, including driving through a red light, failure to yield, rolling through stop signs, and driving the wrong way down a one-way street.

Your insurance company will assume that you're to blame if you ignore traffic signs or signals and then crash. These types of violations can also result in points being added to your license. More points can result in higher insurance costs.3

Using a Cell Phone While Driving
Using your phone while driving isn't against the law in all states, but texting while driving is banned in 48 states and the District of Columbia as of 2021.4

Being on your phone doesn't always mean that you were at fault if an accident happens, but you should be truthful when telling police what you were doing when you crashed.5

Note
Distracted driving is a big red flag for insurance companies. You can probably count on your insurance rates going up if you're ticketed for texting and driving. Your rates will also increase if you cause a crash or fender bender because you were on your phone.6

How Does At-Fault Accident Insurance Work?
Insurance companies decide who's at fault in an accident by relying on the legal concept of negligence. This means that you failed to act in a way that a reasonable person would act if they were faced with the same situation.

Your insurance company might use ""comparative negligence"" to assign a percentage of fault to each driver involved in the accident, or it might assign ""contributory negligence."" The payout you receive could go down based on how much your actions contributed to the incident.7

Each state is unique, but insurance is fault-based in most states. States in which this is the case are also known as ""tort"" states.

The insurance company of the at-fault driver pays repairs, medical expenses, and other costs in tort states. Medical costs for the insured person are paid by their insurance company, up to a certain amount in no-fault states. Property damage is covered by the at-fault driver's insurance.

What It Means if You're in an At-Fault Accident
The best way to avoid being at fault is to obey the law and drive safely. But you may still be found at fault sometimes. You might make a choice in a split second that ends up being the wrong one.

The best thing to do if you're in a crash or fender bender is to not admit fault at the scene of the crash. Take photos of the damage, and exchange insurance information. Wait for the police to show up. Then give a truthful account of what happened.

The insurance adjuster will review your side of the story, as well as the police report, the other party's version of events, and the damage done. Then they'll decide who was at fault.

Note
The kind of insurance you have will play a big part in what happens next if you're found to be at fault. Bodily injury liability coverage will help pay the medical expenses for you, any other people in your car, and the other driver. Collision coverage pays to repair the car.8

Make sure you understand your state's minimum car insurance requirements. You'll want to have full coverage for personal liability and property damage liability if you're found to be at fault. You can be sued for the additional costs if your insurance doesn't cover the damage to people or property when you cause an accident.

Sometimes you can't avoid an accident. Your insurance rates will often rise when this happens regardless. But there are steps you can take to avoid being the cause of a crash. Put your phone away while driving. Avoid using alcohol or drugs that may impair how well you drive. Obey all the legal and safety rules of the road.",1677733896,1677733896,True,2,0,0.49757695198059082,0,True,False,True

I played this game with my wife, nearly two years ago now. We played coop survival together, and while it has some fun things to offer, and it's not actually very buggy or anything, it just feels dreadfully short and incomplete. 

And it's just not changing, it's been nearly 2 years. The devs regularly post dev blogs every 2-6 months or so. They've even done an occasional patch. But essentially, there has been no real new content for this game in over 2 years.

For example, enemies in survival mode. There are only 4. The wiki lists 7, and has variant colors of one of the original 4. But, none of that exists yet. All of this has been shown or discussed in dev blogs only. And that's just the tip of the iceberg on this issue. There is a mountain of content that has been shown and discussed in dev blogs.

I think there could be more layers to survival, but I'm biased towards that game play. I'm blown away by all the simple things this game doesn't have.  How is there no Pause? How is there not a map function? Why does it grind systems to a halt while mining resources? These seems like really simple things the devs should have knocked out by now. 

I can't recommend a game just because it's got good bones. There needs to be more progress in fleshing this thing out and it just doesn't look like that's happening.

This was one of my most cherished games back in my early college days, and I spent so much time waiting for Survival (and being let down by it) that I didn't even notice that no genuine content has been added to the game in nearly two years.

I do not recommend it to new players if you're buying this for the survival experience. For that reason, despite my hours and nostalgic love for the game, I can't recommend Scrap Mechanic. It's been in early access for over seven years, and I honestly have never had the impression that Axolot has any intention of finishing this game. Go for it for the creative experience if you can knab on sale, but the core development isn't going towards the content that makes this game good in my opinion.

2023 update: they added some stuff, but VERY little. the core aspect of the game is still the same. there is almost no real reason to explore the map, nore a real good reason too. the only reason you would do this is to get the final plants to then harvest those and get the final guns. but there is no reason to do this, because after you get the guns you have absolutely nothing to use them on that you can't already kill easily. the game needs some SERIOUS work. not sure what, but the only thing to explore is the factory. granted, they updated it a bit. more areas inside of it. but it just feels bad to me, running around in circles just trying to find the elevator to the next level. but, it seems like the devs gave up on the game, very few updates. that, or they are ramping up for a huge one. only time will tell. 

i played the game a bit more after the review, not much has changed. it took a long time to really get a handle of how to do things. but i do still think that the drills and saws need to be optimized to just work better i really hated how i had to go over the top just to be able to mine some rocks. this game is not really meant for casual players, but if they optimized some stuff, i could be. 

This game isn't ready yet by far. ive been waiting for survival mode to finally get this game and its REALLY shallow. mining rocks is a serious pain. it takes WAY too long to really get to any point where you can kinda start building stuff. the worst part is you just have your hammer for a LONG time. that's it, just a hammer weapon. the only way to get any other weapons is to go through alot of effort to farm up resources then take them to a place, then get packs to trade for a weapon. im 20 hours in and im at the point to trade, and i just don't care. the game is just too shallow. and i spent like 2 hours just trying to mine these rocks, the drill is such crap. once you FINALLY get it and get to rocks, your drill just bounces off of them, and you don't have any way to control it other than connecting it to your motor, which means you have to drive to run the drill which means pushing your drill off the rocks. i tried making forks with blocks to catch the rocks so the drill sticks a little better, but you still end up hammering all the smaller rocks. there is just too much grind and annoyance to the game. what did it for me is i finally ran out of components to build things and i need to go out and just farm up bots, but if i have to swing my hammer one more time, im gonna kill myself. so im just gonna uninstall instead. they need to add more to make the loop less basic. sure you can make anything, but getting ANY resources is such a pain, its just not worth it. ill be back in a year or so see what new things they have. but for now, not really worth it yet.",1589090436,1676963393,False,4,0,0.510177552700042725,2,True,False,True

Just fake promises that they are working on something and we just have to wait some more, but I'm reluctant to hold my breath.

This game is fun, and addictive in my case, but it's severely plagued by bugs and bad coding. There are some major features to the game that haven't yet been implemented, which is contrary to what the devs said about getting it as perfect as possible when they delayed it.

Currently, what you're looking at is a game that's roughly 75% finished when you discount bugs. So it's fun if you can handle bugs, but be warned some parts are a major grind. I would say right now it's only just a no from me.

UPDATE: This review is nearly 3 years old at this point, it'll probably say older because I've edited it a couple times.

After a short burst of frequent updates following the launch of survival mode, the game at this point gets updated every 12-18 months, rarely any of it bug fixes. The devs are very transfixed on a ""chapter 2"" for survival, which has been hinted through the highly infrequent dev blogs, so this may appear at some point. Bear in mind the game has been in early access for 7 years as of writing, with the initial trailers for the game having dropped nearly 10 years ago, so this second chapter may be a while.

TL;DR, game is full of bugs that are unlikely to be fixed, gets updated very rarely. It's as close as you can get to abandonware",1470844313,1676923974,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

building all sorts of creations and is surprisingly badass for a super colorful game. the robots are amazing and the survival worlds look so cool.
one thing is lag happens a lot but I'm running it on a low-end pc so it should be fine for most players.

want to look at the game before you buy it? just read the dev blogs or watch scrap man on youtube 

this is a super fun and creative game that appeals to most users.

387990,132738493,76561199189202569,24,3,1126,0,636,1707003645,I'm not going to say that it was a waste of money the game is fun and looks great. But the problem is that I feel limited to what I can do. First off getting food and water is a struggle I can be full on hunger but then start starving 5-10 minutes later. Second there is a timer that becomes shorter and shorter the more you plant. What happens at the end of the timer is there are robots that attack my farm and take my only source of food and water keep in mind that it take around 25-30 minutes to grow most crops. So my farm is ruined due to there being 5-8 farmer robots that take 5 hits EACH to kill and do an average of 25 damage. So I am 4 hit against 5-8 robots? It makes it hard to progress because I only have 20 minutes to explore and I have to plant food or else I die due to starvation. I understand the game is in beta it just doesn't make sense for that to happen. I don't have friends who own this game and don't really want to play with strangers yet but now I feel scammed and it was a waste of time due to this slow and unbearing progression. Even if I am there on time I always lose some crops due to the sheer amount of robots against 1 person. I really have no hate to the game or the devs I think that this needs to be put out there and it shouldn't be in the game.,1676238914,1676238914,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,True

Love this game, as a 1k+ hour player in ARK this might be my new ARK. Gotta say though, not being able to drink water or find an early source of food is a real shame, It created an infinite death loop for me that I had to solve by dying over and over again in order to secure what should have been a basic game mechanic.

Also as a first impression, the fork wielding robots that gang up and chase infinitely from the get-go seems like a challenge better left for a little bit later on, not even ARK pulls that crap and ARK notoriously hates new players.

Awesome game and an easy thumbs up, the depth and possibilities make me think I'll sink hundreds of hours into it, but from a new player experience the gateway is broken IMO.",1675983994,1675983994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Creative: its easy to understand how to make anything you want within reason, and all of the tools are given to you with decent explanation. You can go from a simple car to a complex flying machine without having to learn every little feature. 
Making simple things, yet the detail is amazing just takes time. After playing creative for a while you realise that some mods almost feel required, the game only gives you 2 types of wheel ""big"" that is far too big and ""small"" that is far too small.

Survival: driving far from spawn looking to pick up something cool and then getting one shot by a tape bot and soft locking yourself isn't all that fun. 

Length-
Because of the shear amount of things you can do, you will never feel like there is nothing to build, collect or fight. End game survival can get somewhat boring, though there are 3 other game modes and multiplayer to check out.

Personal Experience-
This being one of the first ever games i had on my steam account, my opinion could be very biased, but all my friends i have played with found it fun. After years of playing i still occasionally play it and never feel like I have ran it out. The cosmetics, though not micro transactions, are still a massive pain to get for people who mostly play creative and make workshop content.

Would be awesome if the developers reworked the game like many other ""Early Access"" games are, it would bring back a lot of the player base and breathe fresh air into the game.

Edit- After a near 6 month break I expected to see some progress from the the Developers in the actual game not teases on Twitter. 

Its a fun game and although the suspension glitch ruins a lot of really cool ideas for vehicles, I believe the games worth $20 but with no recent updates you have to rely on the modders to keep the game feeling ""fresh"". Still, even after that you gotta take like a week or so long break from it until its fun again.

I follow the rule where if you can have fun playing For a $1 a hour of entertainment the game is worth it. And for $20 id say its definitely a worthy game, but it will get stale quickly with barely any updates...ever...

Being able to build things in 1st person as a humanoid, is in my opinion, a lot more desirable than building things as a free-cam, and it's the main reason I prefer this sandbox over Trailmakers or Besiege. It keeps things simple. If you know how to play Minecraft, this has the exact same idea, just with more in the mechanical department and less in the architectural.

The physics are pretty good in my opinion. Out of the other few games I've played, I would have to say this one has the best. Things don't feel outrageously heavy is one of the main things I noticed. There are some glitches though which can break the immersion (Suspension Glitch), but there are ways around the glitches.

The mod community is very strong. There are lots of good mod parts that seem like they should have been in the game in the first place. Modders for this game could be seen as equal to the dev team at this point.

Everything also builds on a smaller scale in this game (but not tiny), which is nice because it means you can make more complex and detailed builds, without making them gigantic in relativity to the character.

Survival mode is also really fun for at least a little while. They're still working on it (It's taking wayyy too long), but I think it's pretty neat. The Worldgen and world design are both really good, the story-telling is sufficient, the map is huge, there's secret POIs, and Warehouses are one of the most interesting things in this game to explore. But, there are still a lot of problems.

Progression is not linear at all. You go from very slow progress in the early game, to extremely fast progress in the mid game, which easily takes you to the late game. Warehouses are arguably not rewarding enough upon completion. Some things remain tedious to do or get even in the end-game (Glue and Beeswax). Traction still sucks throughout the entire map when you're using a heavy vehicle.

One of the biggest problems with this game though is the new-content cycle. It's soooo slow. The devs release game-changing content only once every couple of years or more. But when they do finally hit the release, it's a huge amount of stuff. I think a ""Smaller Updates/Shorter Wait"" would be much more beneficial for this game.

But yeah, it's good overall. Creative mode especially, but Survival is pretty fun too if you ignore some of the problems.",1607370474,1675830986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

also the game is taking over 70% of the processor while running
game engine is pretty buggy ngl 

but if you would like to build literally anything then here is the perfect game for you
there are plenty ammount of mods that would make building easier for example small thrusters 
also map elements such as train rails
you can get pretty creative in this game
you can even build a flak cannon and shoot at a giant hidenburg
or make armored train with cannons and other stuff 
you can even make a giant castle with big gate and walls and everything 

would recommend this game but devs should get back to work instead of saying comming soon and then wait 6 years for the new update

Scrap Mechanic is hands down one of the best games I have ever played and I have over 1000 hours on it. It's a game that allows you to build anything you can imagine and is a true test of your creativity. The game has a wide range of tools, materials and parts that you can use to build your contraptions. And with the help of mods, the possibilities are truly endless.

One of the best things about Scrap Mechanic is how accessible it is. Whether you're a seasoned builder or a newcomer, you'll find the game easy to pick up and start building right away. The controls are intuitive and the tutorials are helpful, making it easy to get started.

What makes this game truly special is the community behind it. Players from all over the world have come together to share their creations and mods, making it possible to build truly amazing contraptions. From flying machines to massive, multi-level cities, you'll find all sorts of incredible creations to explore and enjoy.

The only downside to this game is that the lag can sometimes limit your building. When you build something that's very large or complex, you may experience some lag. However, this is a minor issue and doesn't detract from the overall experience.

[hr][/hr]
In conclusion, I give Scrap Mechanic 5 stars. It's a game that truly pushes the limits of what you can build and has a vibrant and supportive community. Whether you're a seasoned builder or just looking for a fun and creative game, Scrap Mechanic is a must-play. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I reached a point where I no longer want to play it. There are some things that that I wish they would change. These ideas if implemented would have kept me playing a bit longer. I should state that I'm only interest in survival.

Gas efficiency improvement for thrusters- you are limited of how far you can go from base, very limited unless you have a box full of gas.

NPCs that you can recruit to help farm and defend - maybe even capture and reprogram bots to our side?

Different shapes for building blocks - this would expand your creative builds for obvious reason

Finish the game - it's been early access for way to long.

Just a few points for now

[b]No Blueprints In Survival[/b]

There's the creative mode, and then there's the survival mode. You design something in creative, save the blueprint, then build it in survival and put it to use. Standard practice for those vehicle building games, right?

Except no. That's not how this game works. What you build in creative stays in creative, as there are no blueprint saving or loading feature in survival! The best you can do is to memorize the design in creative then try to manually replicate it in survival.

[b]Repetitive Gameplay[/b]

The survival mode is just one huge grind. You'll need large amounts of scrap metal and component kits to build anything decent, and the ONLY way to obtain scrap metal is by killing the Haybots. Crates drop component kits too but they are often in ruins guarded by Haybots so you'll have to fight them anyway. There are only a few variations of said ruin, so exploration gets old real fast.

So, survival is combat heavy. But how good is the combat system anyway? I'll just say this, there are 4 weapons in this game in total. The hammer you start with is the ONLY melee weapon in this game. The other 3 are guns that shoot potatoes in different ways. (Yeah, potato guns. That's about as awesome as it sounds.) On the other hand, there are 4 types of enemy, but for most of the time you'll only see 2 of them. 

4 types of weapon (actually feels like 2), 4 types of enemy (only 2 are regularly encountered). You can draw your own conclusions.

[b]Ridiculous Numbers[/b]

Apparently the devs went with guesstimation when setting up the numbers. For example, a Thruster costs 10 component kits to build, and another 40 to upgrade to Lv5. And you need at least 4 of them to build a functional hovercraft. How many component kits you get from clearing a ruin? Around 3-6.

Then there's the late game enemy, the Tapebot, encountered in and around the warehouse. It deals 55 damage per shot in normal difficulty. You have 100 HP, and no armor whatsoever. Yes, that means two-hit-kill. Did I mention it's a RANGED enemy with lighting fast reflex and pin-point accuracy? Sufficient to say, if it finds you before you realize it's there, you are dead.

If you think you can handle them by sniping outside the warehouse, wait until you get inside. Where in a cramped environment, they often appear in groups of 2-4, mixed with an even more powerful version. Have fun riding that elevator over and over again to retrieve your corpse!",1674497078,1674676044,False,24,2,0.574652791023254395,7,True,False,True
