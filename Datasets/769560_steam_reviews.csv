Firstly, this game has some SURPRISINGLY stellar English voice acting. (I think I recognize Matt Mercer???)
The text translation is DECENT. It is only incorrect about a few effects, while others still make sense or can be surmised. The text quality drops off more in the DLC, sadly. 
The aesthetics and visuals are excellent. 
The story is... nonsensical. The mystery they tried to create falls flat because it is not nearly built-up enough, and the reason why I‚Äôm even fighting most of these friendly-sounding creatures is well beyond me. I just found out that under Achievements > Boss Story > Normal/Boss, that EVERY enemy has a fairly lengthy blurb. I‚Äôm pretty sure very few people will even look there, but it‚Äôs neat to know!

Mechanically, the game is decent:

The classes feel soooo good to play well. They definitely scratch that strategy & combo itch. 

It‚Äôs no ‚ÄúSlay the Spire‚Äù in terms of difficulty, clarity of understanding what‚Äôs going on, or understanding what effects are currently on you, but you really don‚Äôt need to most of the time, due to the lower difficulty. 
I DO wish the enemy‚Äôs turn could move a little slower so I could read the cards being played they play them a little better. The card play history does NOT help since it is very short, and only shows cards that did not get countered (if even that). 

A lot of the effects (specifically Chilled, Frail, and Bleeding) are pretty throw-away effects that function exactly like armor or bonus damage, but with a different name.

There have been many complaints about the game being UNPLAYABLE because of those BUGS:
[list]
 [*] enemy sprites are too big and only the feet are visable
 [*] enemies' turns are slow and sluggish
 [*] bosses have way too much HP
[/list]

Unfortunately, the developer didn't fix this issue, but if this happens to you, then you can fix it by changing your date / region setting to English. I made a small guide how to do that in Windows 10:

Edit:
Wow, this game is even better than I first thought. (slight spoiler)
[spoiler]I just finished my 2nd playthrough on hard mode, which was also my 2nd time playing as Ranger, and I accidently discovered a whole new area with the TRUE final boss. And I'm really hyped right now, because though I was still struggling with building a decent ranger deck, and though my deck was not that great, I was able to beat it on my first try, because I had some cards which I took on a whim and which turned out to make a really good combo.

I didn't play Slay the Spire, so this is my first game of this kind and I didn't have much experience in this stuff. That's why I'm so excited about it.[/spoiler]

Overall, what I really like about this game is how you first start weak, and then you gradually discover more and more cards, until you piece them together to form strong combos, in sometimes very unexpected ways. It's just so satisfying when you discover new strategies and when these work out. This, combined with the awesome atmosphere of audio and visuals is giving me such a good and unique experience to justify buying all DLCs just out of pure gratitude.
