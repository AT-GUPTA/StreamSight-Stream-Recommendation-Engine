I had some issues with a few of the puzzles, but it's certainly possible to plod through them without searching up a guide.  It's nice to activate those almonds, and this game does a good job at getting you thinking.  I'd say the true difficulty from the puzzles comes from perspective, as some of them can be quite large and it can be difficult with a first-person perspective interpreting what the actual 'puzzle' is.

Game design is excellent - captures the feel of a technologically advanced USSR. Crafting system allows you to try out new weapons and builds. Open world experience is good. 

Combat is a bit clunky. The fact that any enemies downed in the open world get resurrected in seconds is highly irritating - you are better off running past them and avoiding combat. Also don't like the save system which forces you to replay in case you failed a jump or prompt. 

Story, dialogues and character development are not up to the mark - the fact that the protagonist spends so much time swearing as a reaction to events is grating.

Overall 3/5 from me. Interesting premise - could have been executed better.",1708880473,1708880473,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You can clear and area only to be swarmd again moments latter cuz an infinitely spawning amount of repair drones come and and fix the cameras that you destroyed. cameras that can increase the alert level and spawn more robots, and on top of that, wile your fighting the newly spawned swarm of robots, the repair drones build more our of nothing. You'd now think ""destroy the repair bots"" right? not really, I'm not exaggerating when I say they spawn infinitely, your ammo tho is not infinite and its expensive. 

The amount of back tracking every 4 minutes is also annoying, funny for the first 3 times but annoying as most things revolt around a lock door, find key, open door go back to get key to open next door. On a another mission I had to get a ride the train thars on above a set of stairs, meaning I had to go get a ticket from one of the dead bodies..... all the way back down the stairs cuz you cant inspect for a ticket ahead of time before your told about it. Finally you get a ticket and your told its expired, so you have to run all the way back,  not only down the stairs but all the way back the road to the last area to get a different ticket, only to then be told you dint need it cuz your a soldier. 

Another problem I had is weapons. Upgrades and getting weapons on top of healing items need blueprints, all witch also need parts, making ammo uses the same parts as healing items, upgrades, and even building new weapons. So crafting gear can make getting that new weapon even longer, making heaing items harder, and ammo very very limited.

The right skills into character and a maximum (usable concurrently) of three individual abilities like electro shok or my favourite telekinesis. Ramping all enemies in the air is so much fun. The best thing in gameplay is not only combat. There are many other little ""minigames"" and the leveldesign puts the gameplay on another level too.

Storywise there are no complaints to make. The story is solid and you have to think about it yourself and can make decisions. Not to many cutscenes (that is not bad for the story). Well the design of the levels and whats happening there and good voiceacting tell a hell of a story and everything feels very immersive. There is waaay more to say about the game, but lets stop here.

Już przy pierwszym spotkaniu zauważyłem tutaj bardzo duże podobieństwo Atomic Heart do Prey. Gra bowiem powiela nie tylko koncepcje ale również mechanike Prey. Jak dla mnie majstersztyk. Prey jako prawowity następca System Shock'a 2 wkońcu otrzymał swojego własnego następce. Względnie ponieważ kanwa nie plasuje się tym razem w klasycznie kosmicznym sci-fi, a na ziemi. Ten właśnie element tworzy zasadniczą różnice między grami. Nie będe tutaj wchodzić w detale dotyczące ogromnego podobieństwa tych 2 produkcji, a powiem kruciutko. Analogicznie mamy pukawki i mamy zdolności nadprzyrodzone. Także występuje drzewko ulepszeń obu kategorii. Toważyszy nam również ten sam crafting amunicji oraz bojowych akcesorii. To nie wszystko... W Atomic Heart nie brakuje rozproszonych po mapie komputerów z których głębiej zapoznajemy się z fabułą świata gry w formie lirycznej oraz zapisanych dźwiękowo wiadomosći które sobie progresywnie odsłuchujemy. Cała różnica między Atomic Heart a Prey polega w zasadzie wyłącznie na otoczeniu które znajduje się w zupełnie innej kategorii. W tym wydaniu futurystyczno-staroświecka sowiecka dystopia.

Kreacja sowieckiego zakładu 3826 stoi na rzetelnie wysokim poziomie. Niesamowicie immersyjna adaptacja wciąga na liczne godziny nieprzerwanej eksploracji. Szczerze przyznam że ciężko było oderwać się od monitora, a na karku mam już grubo ponad 30-stke. Bardzo miło zwiedzało mi się wszelakie zakamarki danej nam do dyspozycji mapy. Ponad połowę gry spędzimy co prawda w podziemnych labolatoriach, jednak po przejściu gry będzie nam wciąż mało. Tam bowiem z kroku na krok zapoznajemy się z tajemniczą fabułą sowieckiej korporacji.

Rozrgrywka jest okraszona wspaniałym złowrogim klimatem, ozdobionym genialnym soundtrackiem, który składa się na przemian z Rosyjskiej muzki ludowej oraz Techno. Jakkolwiek niedorzecznie to w tym momencie brzmi, uwierzcie mi na słowo, SUPER soundrack. Ciekawostka... w grze usłyszymy nawet utwór Polskiego wykonawcy świętej pamięci Mieczysława Fogg'a. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67c6GYxK48

Grafika w Atomic Heart jest zaskakująco dobra. W osłupienie wprawiają w szczególności ostre jak brzytwa pełne detali tekstury, które nawet w skrajnie bliskim spojrzeniu, wciąż zachowują swój pierwotny gradient. Zdecydowana większośc gier na rynku nie potrafi wykonać tego elementu do porządku, a tutaj jpozytywne zaskoczenie. To samo tyczy się wzorowej filtracji tekstur na dystansie. Te dwa aspekty w połączeniu z pięknymi efektami oraz poprawnie działającym silnikiem fizyki w zupełności wystarcza, by zbudować celujące środowisko graficzne gdzie nie ma się w zasadzie niczego przyczepić. I nie potrzeba tutaj cudu zwanego Ray Tracing czy innych tego typu niepotrzebnych pochłaniaczy wydajności.

I skoro już wspomniałem o wydajności to już wam mówię jak wspaniale Atomic Heart śmiga. 5600X + 6900XT na absolutnie najwyższym ustawieniu 3440x1440 + FSR (jakość) zapewnił w zupełności stabilne 100 FPS ograniczone przez odświerzanie matrycy monitora. Dodam do tego że podczas gry nie uświadczyłem absolutnie żadnego crash'a czy wszelkiego rodzaju bug'a. Brawo za solidny kody gry. 

Przejście gry zajęło mi niemal że 30 godzin zabawy. Jest to wynik bardzo podoby do porównywanego tutaj Prey. Jednak do Atomic Heart są w drodze 4 dodatki contentu które bez wątpienia wyraźnie wydłużą poświęcony czas.

Jedynym elementem do którego muszę się niestety przyczepić to poziom trudności który jest niedorzecznie niski. Żałuje, bardzo żałuje, że przy rozpoczęciu gry nie wybrałem najwyższego poziomu trudności Armagedon. Grając na normalnym poziomie dosłownie nigdy nie miałem najmniejszej potrzeby na wytworzenie amunicji czy innego rodzaju akcesorii. Skrytka była aż przepełniona tysiącami sztuk amunicji i setkami różnych przyrządów leczniczych. Wspomne tutaj że tego typu sytuacja w Prey miejsca nie miała, a ograłem go również na normalnym poziomie trudności. Zasada o której dowiadujemy się już na bardzo wczesnym etapie Atomic Heart (i Prey także) to fakt o ogólnie stromym poziomie trudności, który wywiera na graczu swojego rodzaju nacisk by ten raczej częściej stosował broń białą lub zupełnie unikał potyczek z wrogami (oszczędzając w ten sposób amunicje na nadchodzącą bardziej kluczową sytuacje). Niestety w Atomic Heart dzieje się zupełnie odwrotnie, a poziom trudności jest niedorzecznie niski. Niestety nie uświadczymy tutaj jakiegokolwiek wyzwania. Każdego napotkanego wroga możemy bez skrupułów odstrzelić z pompki a późniejszego boss'a wykończymy bronią białą. Bez problemu... 

Przechodząc do konkluzji wypada sobie zadać pytanie czy Atomic Heart jest lepszym dziełem od Prey. Analizując wszystkie aspekty gry subjektywnie skłaniam się ku Prey. Nie mniej jednak Atomic Heart to bardzo BARDZO solidna produkcja, która zapewniła mi nieprzerwaną pełną ekscytacji i wrażeń przygode, którą z chęcią bym kontynuował.",1704677496,1708802354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a slight Bioshock vibe, thanks to the ""glove"" mechanic assistant used in combat that can be leveled up.

Overall, I enjoyed the ride but didn't feel the need to plat the game. Highly recommend picking this one up on sale!

Some quibbles that didn't make this my favorite game: 

- Basic dialogue/personality (the main character spends 98% of his time swearing and saying the same things over and over)
- Weird combat pacing and balance issues. Sometimes bosses jump you from nowhere, and if you get cornered and knocked down, you can't get back up, dodge, or control your character in any way before getting knocked back down AGAIN. The game tells you this is intentional, which is okay, but sometimes it felt frustrating
- It's difficult to tell when the story is more open world vs. when you're locked out of doing things, like testing grounds
- Story mission marker is not always in the right spot
- Some puzzles are tedious and repetitive
- Super lengthy cut scenes that felt like overkill
- Loot collection not always worth it and often redundant
- Consistent game crashes, especially when riding elevators, even on my gaming laptop, so I recommend saving often",1708538029,1708538029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL;DR
Janky cutscenes, a lot of glitches, falling through the floor has become an expectation instead of an exception, dialogue feels unnatural, powers all do one thing with not a lot of variety in usage i.e. shock stuns, frost freezes, shield blocks, telekinesis lifts, polymer jet boosts other powers and debuffs enemies, all of which have minor upgrades like increased damage, range, lowered cost, or increased effect. You are going to be using these a lot and it quickly becomes a loop of use power-> attack-> use power -> repeat till everything is dead. Not much opportunity for creativity or unique scenarios.


I enjoy the atmosphere and the tone of this game, wasn't quite what I was expecting but I won't hold that against anyone. What I will hold against people is the fact that the entire first area of the game is a fetch quest and the protagonist has multiple voice lines mocking the fact that it was a tedious scavenger hunt. Why put something in the game that you are then going to openly mock as poor gameplay? I hear you say, ""but development was rough and riddled with rewrites and overhauls so they may not have had time to fix these things"" and I say to you, ""Fair point."" So I kept playing and as I was exploring the open world, keeping to the sidewalks mind you and not doing any sort of skyim-esque clipping or glitching, I would just fall straight through the floor and be trapped, having to repeat small areas. This has happened three times in three different areas. Supposedly there was a recent hotfix that solved this issue but it has not been effective for me. All-in-all this game spends a fair bit of time mocking its own flaws and falling short in a lot of ways. It's got a cool atmosphere for sure but more than anything the gameplay and narrative is just bland and uninteresting. If my refund doesn't go through I'll probably keep playing it here and there but it's hard to enjoy it when you might glitch through the floor at any moment and you are having to actively try to ignore all the games shortcomings. I hope that your experience is better than mine.

Fun game play, beautiful graphics and scenes, and a semi linear story line that is enjoyable.

There are a few bugs though, if your car rolls and you open the door towards the floor, enjoy flying infinitely till you get bored and reload your last check point.
On top of this, if you're climbing on an object; turn to leap and turn back quick enough you get partially stuck in the wall you were originally climbing on.

I was excited for this game from the moment it was announced, despite the oft-repeated rumors of it being a vaporware scam, and it did not disappoint.

Unusual for a release by a Slavic studio, the game was also released in a fully functional state with few bugs, very little jank, and no crashes without requiring several massive patches over the course of a year or more following release.

The game itself is a Soviet echo of Bioshock, with some elements of Portal.  Combat is quite similar to Bioshock, where you have an upgradeable arsenal of weapons and plasmids (neuropolymer abilities) and a common tactic useful throughout the game is to shock an enemy or throw it in the air with your glove, then blast it with the shotgun. Thematically, the game is also reminiscent of Bioshock, depicting a fallen utopia filled with corpses. The polygons (which are optional areas containing powerful weapon upgrades) are puzzle-y sections that reminded me of test chambers from Portal. 

You could call it derivative, but I don’t care. It combines elements of games that I like a lot and produces a product that I really enjoyed playing. I found the game to be pretty easy on medium difficulty, and would probably have played in hard if I could do it over.

The graphics are awesome and the game ran well at close to max settings on an AMD RX 6600. If you love Soviet aesthetics, you’ll be in heaven playing this game. It perfectly captures the look and feel of an idealized Soviet Union. Playing the game is like walking around in a propaganda poster. 

Resources used to purchase and upgrade weapons/glove abilities can be recovered 1:1, so you’re not punished for exploring different weapons and powers. If you don’t like something you bought, you can just return it and put the resources towards something else. 

The couple minor negatives: platforming is fairly annoying and has some weird design choices. You don’t auto-grab a ledge that you’re jumping towards unless you continue to hold the jump button. If you jump and let go as you ordinarily might you’ll fall, potentially to your death. There’s one polygon with moving ledges where I struggled for about 45 mins getting through it, as there were no save points in the course of the series of difficult, annoying and fatal jumps. This isn’t too big of a deal, as it’s something you need only do occasionally and is not a central mechanic to the game. If platforming featured more heavily, this would be a serious problem.

Constantly respawning enemies in the open world segments were annoying. Small flying robots spawn out of a hive and repair killed enemies. It would be nice if you could destroy the hive and have 10 or so minutes to explore at your leisure instead having to constantly knock flying robots out of the air.

The game is not 100% bug free. There’s some minor stuff, such as the player or enemies getting stuck on level geometry or rarely killed enemies getting stuck in an idle animation instead of becoming a corpse. In all, I think I can count on one hand the number of times I faced these issues in the course of my playthrough. This is perfectly acceptable to me, even good.

The English voice acting is godawful, just total trash. The Russian voice acting is top notch. I speak Russian and it’s legitimately great. My SO doesn’t and she had a little trouble keeping up with subtitles, as the font is kinda small even at max, and characters talk a lot and fast. All the same, you should play it with Russian audio and English subs. Some of the translation choices are odd, like P3’s meme worthy exclamation of “crispy critters” would be accurately translated as “fucking pastries”. 

All in all, these are minor gripes and this game is worth it at full price, for 30 bucks it’s a steal. I bought the standard edition and then later added the dlc pass, because I couldn’t get enough!",1708315031,1708315031,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

From the moment you step into its twisted world, you're captivated by its atmospheric charm, reminiscent of iconic titles like Bioshock and Half-Life.

At its core, Atomic Heart delivers on all fronts. The gameplay is a seamless blend of classic FPS mechanics with a dash of innovation. You'll find yourself effortlessly sliding, climbing, and combat rolling through the stunning environments, each one meticulously crafted to immerse you in its dystopian atmosphere.

Sure, there are some quirks along the way, like the protagonist's penchant for swearing and his over-the-top antics. But fear not! The solution is as simple as changing the voice language to Russian, instantly transforming those cringe-worthy moments into authentic expressions of Soviet bravado. Suddenly, it all makes sense, and you find yourself laughing along with the protagonist's absurd antics.

The story, while straightforward, draws you in with its mysterious narrative and compelling characters. And with the addition of DLCs like ""Trapped in Limbo,"" the adventure only gets better. Explore new dimensions, face off against unique foes, and unravel the secrets of the protagonist's past in a mind-bending experience that will leave you craving more.

Let's not forget about the soundtrack, a pulsating symphony that perfectly complements the game's surreal visuals and adrenaline-pumping action. With each beat, you're transported deeper into the heart of Atomic Heart's twisted world, where every corner holds a new surprise.

And for those looking to expand their journey, the Atomic Pass offers access to a treasure trove of additional content, including exclusive skins, weapons, and more. It's the ultimate way to dive even deeper into the captivating universe of Atomic Heart.

In conclusion, Atomic Heart is more than just a game; it's a wild, unforgettable ride through a world where the only limit is your imagination. So grab your gear, change your voice language to Russian, and get ready to embark on an adventure like no other. Trust me; you won't regret it.",1708197213,1708197213,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Complete love & hate feeling with this one.
First of all, I expected something different, and when it turned out to be a puzzle solving game I was disappointed. I wanted it to be more of survival, just shooting style.
The visuals are great, combat is good, guns are OK, but something isn't quite right. The boredom I felt each time the character was in the dreaming state, it just felt forced.
Game end is not to my liking, it forces you to want to play DLC which I started and exited the moment I realized my weapons are not carrying over.
All in all, I finished the main game, and I guess I am recommending it. It's good if you like the puzzle kind of games, but buy on sale.",1708194538,1708194538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So first of, I loved the game, interesting narrative and the way it got spread through the game was really nicely done.
Depending on how you played the game and how much information you got from pcs, watches and so on, then the choice at the end was a given to you. I just like how it did that, as it made you playstyle feel as if it had an impact on your game, if you went through the game like an ignorant person you probably did the wrong choice first, but if you picked up all the tiny clues along the way, then you probably went for the right choice. I also liked how the last safe point before the big choice was placed, as it gave you a last chance to at least grasp the minimum amount of input in that big room, to understand your choices better.

Now that aside I wanna come to the negative side of things or rather of this game.
In all honesty it feels kinda unpolished and rough around the edges, most noticeable with the dialogue. At a certain point I just stopped on the spot the moment dialogue came in. And that is because it just can be ended abruptly by everything and everyone, at any time and that gets annoying really fast. 
In like the first half of the game, I had more dialogue ending prematurely, then I had it actually finishing, which is in my opinion a huge issue and makes you miss out on a huge amountof lines and also gets you quite upset every time. It can be ended by enemies, watches, areas and sometimes things I didn't even notice, sometimes just other dialogue starts, thats not important and overwrites the story one, especially the alarm 2 one is here at fault. Now the not moving idea seems good at first, but does destroy the flow of the game, as some dialogue was tried to be made in a way that it starts the next piece, when you reach a certain point. So a few times my conversation with charles got revived after 5 min, when I had almost forgot what it was even about. But move to fast and the next pack of dialogue starts before the first is even finished. Also lockpicking and dialogue doesn't get along in this game at all, make one thing inaccessible  while the other goes on, but don't overlap the two intervaces on top of each other.
Another point is playing the game on controller, I played through the entire thing on my tv, with a little exception of two hours when I played on my monitor with mouse and keyboard, but to that in a sec. Playing with controller is hard, like mind-blowingly hard and clunky, bossfights are a nightmare and that mostly due to fast moving enemies and the slow camera movement, that you get with the stick. But you can't up the sensitivity of it, as the aim assist and auto aim isn't working at all and you aiming for enemies gets rather problematic. Fortunately you can get pretty op with the skill tree later on, which at least makes the enemy clouded areas a breeze (with telekinesis), but bossfights are still ugh.
Now I also did play with mouse and keyboard and combat was way better and fluid with that, but I got motionsick pretty quick from it and I couldn't find settings to ease that, that's why I could only play about 2 hours that way before I couldn't bare the headache anymore and wanted to throw up.
There were a few other issues like climbing and the jump an run, that just felt underdeveloped for some of the areas you had to apply them to, but wasn't to much of a deal breaker for me.

Now to the endings, I feel strongly like there should have been a third ending, if there actually isn't one and it has just not been found yet. The two normal ones feel both out of place, the first to abrupt and the second gives you a hint in a particular bossfight, that suggests to me as if there was another way, a certain voice in my head if you know what I mean. Now like I said maybe there is one that hasn't been found yet, but if there isn't then that feels very wrong and doesn't really do our character justice.

Now last, as I said I enjoyed the game a lot and probably will replay it a few more times with a more completionist run, all in all can really recommend it and hope others will see it that way too, if you liked bioshock, then you will like this one too and a few eastereggs and allusions to it are included for you as well.

I didn't read reviews or anything on it, never even watched anything but the first trailer YEARS ago. Only things I heard were it being ""Soviet BioShock"" so I finally bought it, since I really liked the BioShock series. It took a lot of aspects I liked from other games and put them together with a very interesting storyline. It has really good melee combat and gun play, abilities and perk trees reminiscent of BioShock, the looting and crafting reminds me of Gen Zero (which was one of the few things i liked in that game). The open world isn't too much of a focus but its fun to explore, especially once you figure out how to temporarily shut down the robots in that area(not spoiling how to do that). It has great combat music, and P3 is incredibly sarcastic and I love him. There's more I could say but honestly I just beat the main storyline and wanna get back into new game+ and see the added challenges.

It has all the advantages of the indie game: it feels like a labour of love, it is sometimes odd in the delicious manner that can only be achieved away from marketing departments, a detailed and original setting, and so on. But it also has all the disadvantages: it is overambitious and spread too thin, it somewhat buggy and both rhythm and difficulty are very poorly balanced. In short it feels as if the play-test was either cut short or ignored, both in terms of bug and of gameplay.
The production is overall high-end: the graphics are neat, the sound and voice acting are good (although rather generic despite the soviet theme), the gameplay loop is for the most part fun and relatively varied. The dungeons however are all very similar and linear. The boss fights, as advertised in the videos, are probably the most exciting (but also excruciating!) part, but there's not that many of them. 
The scenario so far is confused and not particularly breathtaking. The narration is disjointed and frustratingly amateurish, and the writing and/or translation is lacklustre. The setting does have character, although not nearly as much as it thinks it does, or as the trailer might let you think. The landmarks are interesting although they mix various soviet styles (i.e. Constructivism, Brejnevian space-age, etc.) and the end result is a somewhat bland mush, or at least not as exciting as it premise could have been. The whole map is also rather samy, with hill after identical hill and village after identical village. In short, it is one of those many games that would have been much better had it not sought to jump in the open-world bandwagon.
To sum up: I payed 30 euros for it and that's more than it is worth if you ask me. Keep in mind I am a cheap MF, usually buying my games long after release. I was hyped by the trailers, and expected an immersive sim with a tight plot. Instead I got a wacky grind-simulator.

It now looks a little different than years ago but the graphic is really nice. To all the shitposters here which played the game not longer than 20 minutes to an hour i have to say, you can´t make yourself an opinion without playing this game longer. The UA and RU war has NOTHING to do with this game. Of course it is full of russian propaganda, but do we criticize such things in 60% of all other games which are pro USA? NO! War is war, politics are politics and games are games! And it´s even fiction in this game! The story plays in no real existing land. So just enjoy this game which has a good story, nice game mechanics, good translation and a strange sense of humor. Yes, the main character is not the most friendly guy, but who cares? Skilltrees are good, all weapons are very customizable and i could tell a lot more of satisfying things. 
EDIT: There were some bugs like in nearly every game, but after patch after patch etc. it got better and the game is now really good. I just bought the 2nd DLC but i didn´t finish the main game yet, so ""Trapped in Limbo"", which looks really exciting has to wait, and of course the 1st DLC hast to wait too.

A very long review just to say that I am disappointed and dropped the game halfway.

First of all, let me clarify that I was very excited to play Atomic Heart since the trailer of 2018, in which they showcased a dystopian and green type of Metro 2033, in this case dominated by very interestingly designed machines. I was really sad to see how much their vision had shifted from that original presentation.
The marketing team did a great job at portraying this post-apocalyptic ""kind of"" open world experience, and I totally fell for it. The game even allows you to play 1h of demo before deciding if its for you or not! Isn't that nice?

The demo presents you with this magnanimous view of what could have happened if the Russians won the war. I was hoping to experience through the demo the flying cities, cars and robots after it had all gone south in their world.

However, this image does not exist. The game really insists on taking you underground through a linear path as soon as the demo is over and the actual game starts. To labs and bunkers, where you can enjoy thrilling puzzles (that range from easy to 'die jumping from platform to platform because P-3 is incapable of sprinting or jumping properly') and enemies that get a bit too old after 4 hours of gameplay. 

I wish I was kidding, but you really unlock the map after 4h of gameplay. At this point, once you are out the world looks nice, really nice, I get why they won an Outstanding visual style award. It is so natural that you can not go for a stealth run because you can not possibly distinguish enemies from enviroment without scanning 24/7, therefore there is no actual gratifying way to avoid enemies without triggering alarms. However, this is still the part I enjoyed the most, as it allowed some type of freedom of choice and exploration. 

This, of course, is an illusion that does not last for long, as after The Ballin Boss the game decides that you probably already miss going underground and doing more puzzles for like 1 or 2 more hours. This is the point where I dropped the game.

Look, I really wanted to like this, and it pains me the most, but I just can't. If you are looking for a russian action shooter, play the Metro games. If you like the dystopian world idea of the game, go for Dying Light. If you like the combat and abilities system, give Bioshock a try. If you are even more specifically more into robot dystopias, even Horizon Zero Dawn works, I guess. I can't really tell you to spend money on this game, even at 50% discount like I did, knowing that you could get a much more memorable experience somewhere else.

Everything about this game feels like a Marketing campaign to sell you the first 2 hours of gameplay and hope you don't notice all the little things that feel a little too off about it. You could play it with russian voice acting to have a laugh or two instead of the serious english guy, but even with that, P-3's character is just mean for the sake of it. To Charles, to himself and to everyone. It just keeps adding as you go, It's all just a pretty mask to hide a game that is as repetitive, tedious and hollow as the robots in it. Fantastic marketing for a game that can be completed in about 12h though. Even the ""sexual content"" tag that they proudly put in their steam page is a 1 hour gig that dies out for the rest of the game and you never hear of it again.

Skills and weapons are okay, but nothing really ground breaking or new here. Although to me the weapons feel a little unresponsive and underwhelming. What bothers me most besides gameplay just being boring is how much the game mocks itself and the character. I don't think I have experienced something like this in any other game. Also there is so much dialog and so many cut scenes (Can't the character stfu for 5 minutes?). The so called ""open world"" is just  tedious. If you want to stay undiscovered and do some exploring it just takes so much time. To stay totally undiscovered seems to be impossible at least for me. No matter how much I scan, how careful I try to be, I get discovered. I think it is meant to be like that.

The comparisons with Bioshock are there for a reason and a lot of the gameplay reminded me of a mix of that and a stripped down far cry. The DLC's, the first two of four at the time of writing were a mixed bag. The first is an extension of the main game, but it throws so much stuff at you it easy to get overwhelmed and the the second DLC was an attempt of a ""surfing"" game and a platformer. 

I got the game because the second DLC looked so amazingly weird, but I will admit that it was a let down.... although it was fun to learn more about the PC's background, I would probably skip it on a replay. there was just so much luck based nonsense in the form of obstacles with the surfing part it really sucked the fun out of it, esspecially when I got stuck trying the same part over +20 times because success was determined on a certain small, turning platform that I just couldn't match with the speed, the angle and the jump. 

The weapon system was pretty nice. I liked the dungeons where you unlock most of the coolest upgrades and woah boy, the moment I unlocked the expanded magazine for the shotgun was a turning point. The character upgrading was pretty nice too, and I had to re-spec a few times with certain tricky bosses. The power were alright, but I never tried anything more then the electric powers (counting shield and spray as utility here, shield was very useful).

There is a lot to talk about so I’ll streamline my thoughts.

This game has a surprising amount of puzzle solving. Especially if you are doing the side missions. I personally love visual puzzles but this may be an issue for those who want a straightforward action game.

Let's start with a BIG PRO. THE MUSIC IS AMAZING! I have never even heard of some of these groups before.

You get a nice boat/car/plane ride in the beginning. Reminds me of Half Life 1 train. I really like these calm before the storm moments.

Well Animated machines. Great Damage modeling on enemies. Cool set pieces like the see through whale in the museum. Visually there are some really nice objects to look at.
Well optimized. 

Combat does offer a bit of variety, you got the nice quickdash, the jump and ledge grab is actually more useful than it seems during a fight. The powers recharge quickly and are actually pretty spammable so you can use them along with the guns often. There is melee but I found it awkward and was happy abandon it. You can do a melee focused playthough if you are into that.

Issues

No quicksave. Not a huge problem except for the massive number of bugs I encountered. Combined with unskippable cutscenes and you got a huge issue.

Got stuck on scenery quite a bit.

Infinite Elevator loading screens. 

Apparently the above 2 issues have been patched. I don't feel like new game plus so I'll just take people's words for it.

The main character says “Crispy Critters” all the time. He is also kinda dumb. There is a storyline reason for this but believe me when it will aggravate the player. 

NO custom map markers when on the map. A huge issue for people doing sidequests.
Too much time spent in indoor environments. The first area of the game is dull, especially after being treated to a very cinematic opening. It does feel a lot better when you get onto the main map and hop into a car. Even then a lot of facilities are hallways and repetitive rooms.
Fetch quest after fetch quest. A lot of character treat you like crap even though the protagonist is the most useful person on the continent apparently.

Lack of true bosses. Most bosses just become regular enemies/sub-bosses later.
Weapon variety: The rocket Launcher makes the entire game a joke and all boss fights a breeze. Most of the weapons are pretty boring, standard game stuff. The fully upgraded pistol is pretty cool though and the energy weapons that use battery instead of ammo does help mix it up. Along with powers. 

Lastly the story. I explored everywhere, got the upgrades and did everything. Overall, I enjoyed the main story as well as the little side stuff you only get in terminals and audio logs. It is pretty linear and dumps a TON of information at the end.
The story does end of the cliffhanger that continues in the DLC. (Which is very short and takes away your weapons)

Main game and 1st DLC was a solid 33 hours.

The gameplay loop wasn't half bad until you get halfway through the game and realize most of the weapons are straight booty. The dream section was interesting but definitely had me wanting to just get back to the regular game after a little while. 
The open world encourages you to take down spawns and ""take back"" the city but the robots get spawned and healed so often that it makes it a huge chore and takes WAY too long. Didn't make me want to clear anything since I could just sneak around everything to the main objective and progress the story which is incredibly dry with seemingly random elements added. Voice acting isn't bad but the dialogue gets really annoying and/or cringey with just poorly paced lines during gameplay. Definitely needed some more time with translation fitting.

The bugs I have encountered are with the TV screens in the recreation rooms; they only show white screens with no sound. The other bug is also in the recreation room and involves the videos that are supposed to play in the upgrade Charles menus; again they're just white screens.
Searching for solutions has shown that this bug has been present since launch and that the developer has not addressed it, or even acknowledged it.
Like I said it may not sound like a big deal, or that it even breaks the game but I do not know if there are other screens throughout the game that contain important information that I have missed simply because the displays are broken.
For information I'm running the game on a 4090/14900K with the latest Nvidia drivers.

There are also horror elements in it that give you a weird sense of dystopian chaos and on the other hand the environement itself is an actual futuristic utopia.

People have complained about the dodge mechanic being too hard to use, enemies doing too much damage, and there being too many enemies in general. This is a complete skill issue. I don't know what kind of baby a$$ pre-school sh1t games these people usually play, but the game was easy as f*ck - even on the hardest difficulty. 

The enemy variety is lacking however, which is a shame because the overall gun/ability/fight mechanics are great. The roster isn't *that* lackluster, but it would've been nice with e.g. more bosses. I thoroughly enjoyed playing through this game and I'm looking forward to playing the DLCs as well. I will say though that the lack of fast travel can be a bit of a headache at times, but it's not that big of a deal. At least you get to explore the beautiful world.

The most annoying part about this game is the main character. While he has his moments, he also has many annoying ones as well as the stupid ""crispy critters"" catchphrase. What is he 12 or something? This is a minor thing though. The main issue for me is that (in the beginning) he was veeeeery negative. He was pretty obnoxious and it was at times a bit rough listening to his whining. Although this *does* make sense when you get further in the story. It's just a bit much at times.

This, however, is perfectly understandable once you reach the end. It would've been nice to have gotten slightly more context in the beginning though so you could have a chance to understand his anger. I don't know if this is intentional, but there are also times where he acts like a goofy meathead. Asking questions for something that has an obvious answer. He is a little dumb, but even Charles acknowledges this at one point, which is hilarious. 

Other than the minor issues, the game is great and I highly recommend anyone who is into sci-fi games to give this a shot. Solid 8/10.

- It feels like a soviet bioshock, if lacking some atmospheric depth. The visuals are great and I love the game design.
- The story is longer then I thought and contains some twists, however nothing in there is really surprising or immersive.
- The rare bosses are well implemented and a surprising challenge at first.
- The protagonist is unrelatable because he simply accepts whatever he is being told for most of the game.
- The enemies are rather boring, repetitive and incredibly dumb. 
- The biggest problem this game has, however, are the bugs, espeacially due to problems with collision. I've been stuck on ledges or in corners more times then I can count. 
- Why the hell is my first upgrade the ability to walk through a laser barrier and later on I still simply get killed by them?
- The open world part feels very sterile and repetitive as well.
- The weapon upgrade system is not very impressive, because it somehow does not change the handling of the gun by much.

Combat is kind of frustrating when your melee'ing and dodging and you get caught in a corner and get ganged beaten unable to get out (maybe play on medium? not hard like me) . Not to mention entering the polymer and trying to exit through a door caused me to get stuck.Will stick it out as setting is interesting to me(initially drawn in from bioshock and prey comparrisons) and the music ost is great from old pop songs on the radio  to upbeat techno while fighting.

I followed two pieces of advice I found on Reddit: I turned down the difficulty to the lowest setting, and reduced outside exploration to moving as fast as possible between points of interests leading you to isolated underground areas where you can find loot.

The plot is kind of interesting though. In my opinion, this should have been a strickly linear game. The open world nonsense disrupts the storytelling and lengthens the game with nothing but frustration.

I've just finished the game after around 30 hours. I was ready to quit after I few hours but I continued to play out of spite because I wanted to get something out of the 40$ I spent. The endings left me rather unsatisfied. I uninstalled it and will never play it, or think about it again.",1707614239,1707614239,False,32,11,0.61250758171081543,0,True,False,False

Russian voice acting is great, melee is though, gun play satisfying, good story, great world building, great soviet inspired designs, meh platforming, sometimes fails to show subtitles but doesn't impact gameplay.


All in all, Atomic Heart is a great performance coming from first time developers. It has modern gameplay, good stability and optimisation. 

On hard difficulty it's challenging without being nearly as hard as a soul game. Story revolve around the proven traitor / crazy science / danger from being too greedy plot and it's a well done one. 

Except for the platforming that is meh but thankfully limited, every system is either good or great. Definitely worth a try especially on special.

To me it's a far better game than the far cry series and the setting is refreshing while being very close to how late soviet artists view their country. Not a utopia, just something they put effort into making it work for them.

Warning, this game does not pander to the OP MC fans in the early game contrary of far cry and the likes. Think more of a very tamed soul game or tamed Surge 2.",1707589034,1707589034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There was a lot of screen tearing. I couldn't get past the game after the first boss fight outside the first testing ground. It just didn't feel fun.

I tried replaying it a couple days ago and got to the same point. The movement on the robots was improved. They didn't have near as much screen tearing. But I fell through the map in 4 different areas along the main map and facilities. Often restarting from a save 5+ minutes back. It still has a lot of bugs that ruin the experience for me.

It still bothers me that the other English voice actors are actually fun to listen to (Granny Zina, and The Glove mostly) but the main character felt lame. The powers/upgrades don't feel very fun either. They don't feel very strong ,and feel reused from similar games, but feel basic. 

I will say the graphics look very good. I did like the art style of this game very much. I really did like the direction they were going, I just wish they would have polished it up a lot more. I was expecting this to be the next Bioshock but the story, powers, weapons, characters, and overall game weren't near as much fun.

Played on the hardest difficulty it's kind of a challenge since you can die with about 3 hits from enemies, but imo that what made it fun.
PD: The main protagonist it's kind of an ass and most of what he says doesn't really make a lot of sense but well, i bought the game not exactly for a likeable character or great dialogues, but for the great graphics, challenging bosses and crazy non sense stuff this game have.
PD2: Highy recommend buying only the base-game on sale (without DLC's) , since for now apparently they're very short and not really worth since you're getting much of the best of the videogame from the base game.

Pros: 
Shooting feels very weighty as week as fun and melee combat is great, with some interesting weapons to back it up. along with glove powers, most of which are fun to use

Drop dead gorgeous art style, with a weird, futuristic, Soviet vibe

Pretty good story, with some good twists and turns to keep you interested 

Has best catch phrase of all time: “crispy critters!”

Really good performance overall, with indoors holding at 140 fps and outside areas holding 90 -100 fps on atomic settings. 

Graphics look gorgeous with some really cool areas to explore, animations for enemy attacks are really detailed and work well.

Interesting puzzles with cool ideas all around, really enjoyed solving them.

Someone must of been insane on the dev team, because some parts in this game are outright insanity(in a good way) 

Cons:

Voice acting isn’t the greatest, with English voice acting sounding stale and weird, but it kinda grows on you so don’t mind it as much as I used to

Bosses are kinda boring, with the exception being the final one,

The “open world” really isn’t open, kinda just a really big path to follow, but don’t really mind this.

Dialogue is heavy, and often overlaps accidentally 

Slight texture and item pop in can occur in outdoors, but doesn’t really effect gameplay 

Overall, if you like bioshock, fast paced shooters, and great stories, I can whole heartedly recommend this one

+ The main character is well developed, in the beginning you will think he is a jerk with anger issues and at the end you will want to put your hand on his shoulder and tell him it will be alright, not going to spoil
anything if you pay attention you will notice whats what! DLC 2 Limbo will give you more information on
his condition.

+ Very detailed world, the inner workings of communist ideoligy are portrayed with near perfection, I might have missed the deathcamps, maybe add those in the DLCs? this stuff needs to be tought in schools! Its always: ""Nazis here, nazis there!"" but why do we not talk  about the guys even further to the left more?

+ This game is beautiful and runs like a charm, roughly 25h long if you do everything and look in every corner. 2 DLCs out and 2 more planned.

+ I liked the upgradesystem and I hope the DLCs will add some more weaponupgrade-types and special attacks, you can specialize against certain enemy types, also use energy-weapons they are ""free"" just need to use another weapon to charge them (upgrades are there for that as well!).

+ On a surfacelevel the weapons seem kinda dull at first, but when you look at the upgrades you will come to love them. Also be aware of attackspeeds and impact of weapons, it will make you secondguess if what you are running is really the best. I literally upgraded another melee to full at the final part of the game and had a blast! Just find the one that suits your playstile or has the special attack that you need for specific situations and cant live without it!

+ The game is at its best in the more confined areas (the research labs and the mainquest areas), dont get me wrong there are some really nice areas in the open world as well, but at times its kinda empty. Use your
scanner to find the areas you are best to avoid, because there is nothing to gain.

+ Enemy design is wonderfull, there are a lot of robot enemies and all bosses are machines. I hope we will 
see some more mutant type enemies, these are a little underdeveloped, the stronger variants are amazing 
to fight thou!

+ DLCs are amazing so far and quite varied in gameplay! DLC 2 Limbo is just insane, you dont need to do all the content it offers, it gets kinda hard. Pay attention and be quick with your inputs and you will do fine, it is not QTEs dont worry.

- Open world needs a touchup here and there, feels empty in the outskirts of the playable areas, there are cars to get around quickly thou so you dont waste  your time!",1677858330,1707337827,True,1,0,0.522279024124145508,0,True,False,False

In truth, this game has all of the basic ingredients that compose an amazing narrative coupled with gripping combat the likes of which has brought us game series such as Dishonored and Bioshock. Unfortunately that's about where it stops, as everything in the game just feels ""off."" Though the attack patterns and designs of the enemies are very unique, the way the combat feels is very lack luster and unsatisfying. Platforming and traversing the world is very clunky, especially when on ledges and swimming through the clear gel. The main character is also weirdly agitated with not a lot of discernible reason or established prejudices to inform the player as to why he treats certain characters the way that he does. The main character's dialogue is also just a bit cringey at times and feels like he belongs in Cyberpunk 2077 rather than his own game.

There is a heavy communist/futurist look to it but it doesn't seem to do much with the theme beyond the visual style. As another reviewer said, it was likely because of the risk political criticism entails in Russia, so good on them for keeping themselves safe.

Game quality is excellent up to a point in the game (Theater mission) where some really annoying bugs show up:
- Accessing locks or leaving locks becomes super slow (switch to desktop to fix this)
- Magnetizing orbs (pressing F) usually doesn't work. Very frustrating and time consuming.
- Some Monsters freeze for no reason.
- Can get stuck behind walls or obstacles.

Плюсы:
- биошок в СССР, что забавно, да и в целом сеттинг, обстановка и саундтрек радуют
- вполне интересная прокачка и лут
- достойная гафика, хотя жаль, что нет тех же отражений в зеркалах

Минусы
- постоянные вылеты и зависания игры
- раза 4 я застревал хз где в текстурах и без перезагрузки не вылазил
- постоянно спотыкаешься о какие-то предметы и не можешь идти дальше (особенно бесит в бою)
- юмор - я хз, кто целевая аудитория игры, но такое ощущение, что играешь в симулятор парня с района
- и сюда же сюжетная тупость персонажа 
- баги: не открываются некоторые ящички, подвисания, плохие модели из за которых хз как проходить те ли иные места
- разбор лута - ну вот правда, вы не играли в другие игры где похожие вещи группируются и можно выбрать какое кол-во разобрать? У меня под конец был сплошной скроллинг в инвентаре
- лифты: это боль, потому что их много и они Доооолгие почти все 
- чутка скудноватый арсенал и если пылесосить карту - к середине игры есть все и дальше чутка скучно
- управление боль, чувствуешь себя стенографистом или пианистом
- нет настроек геймпада хотя с ним можно играть. В итоге играл на клаве, а но даже на ней боль.
- сюжетные повороты сначала заставляли плакать, потом смеяться, потом хотеть побыстрее закончить или просто забить.
- боевка боль, потому что куча клавиш и эти моменты с ""нажмите резко E, а нет, надо не резко а много"" - ну я может и криворукий, но не до такой же степени? чтобы почти каждый такой поворот фэйлить.

В целом же по скидке можно брать и играть. Особенно стоит отметить тот факт, что команда сделала свою первую игру (если я не ошибаюсь) и она вышла даже более-менее норм (с натяжкой, скидкой и просто потому что наш продукт).

To many Puzzles, and also it's like if this game HOLDS ITSELF BACK on purpose, even the main character comments on the annoying tasks.

I wish they can do an update where they can do something about the Open world, instead of Temporarily disabling the robots, it'd be nice to disable them in general, and making Random encounters with Robots in certain areas, so it won't be to empty.

Wish also, in a future update they can make us turn off more of the HUD, like the Crosshair of weapons.

The Story has a twist to it at the end, the music is amazing

Gameplay itself is a mixed bag, it's frustrating to deal with enemies, it'd be nice for them to also overhaul or revamp the gameplay, make enviromental changes, like barrels be able to explode when shot at.

I finished the game and I really enjoyed it! It has it's weird and wild moments, but I liked the dark nature of the story.
Gameplay was pretty solid and I had a lot of fun blasting through robots and zombies :)
I actually liked the puzzles in the game (I know a lot of people hate them) to the extent I had to finish all the Test Chambers :))
It is a weird game, like Wolfenstein: New Order, The New Colossus, etc in an alternate history.
The vision and the art design is really awesome!
Soundtracks are very good as well and then we have NORA ^_^ which made me laugh so much with every encounter :)) (She really is a ""special"" AI).

So the game  is a MASSIVE THUMBS UP!

However, because of the 5+ years of Ray tracing trailers and announcements and the fact the game released without it, all I can give it at the present is a THUMBS DOWN. This is because you can't PULL OUT a FEATURE 2 days before launch and expect to get away with it!!!

It was one of the motivations for an upgrade to my system - it is very much a game of 2023/2024, and it will wallop your VRAM, hard drive speeds, system RAM - you do need a beefy system, suffices to say. Beyond the technical specs, I count this as one of the Soviet simulator games. Singularity and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. seem far more adjacent to this than Metro 2033. It very much feels like Bioshock Infinite, but from a Soviet world.

I was prepared to enjoy this, play it right through to an audience, but it has glaring stumbles.
1. How much arguing and dialogue goes on that adds very little beyond annoyance to the game for me.
2. How little actual commentary there is on Soviet Communism there is, despite the game taking place in what amounts to Floating Soviet Utopia.
3. You're expected to sneak around at least some of the time - but the difficulty of enemies outdistances your weapons fast and early - and you will get into boss fights that will seriously turn you into goop, no matter how upgraded your weapons are. Dodging really does not work how it should.
4. You're going to be shooting robots. And plant zombies and monsters. That's about what you're going to be doing.
5. QUICKTIME EVENTS.
6. The amount of Reddit-diving you have to do to understand how to change in-game language settings without changing the entire UI language too.

I wanted so much for this title, from the bottom of my heart, and it fell far short, far far short. Play Singularity, Metro or S.T.A.L.K.E.R if you're wanting that Soviet shooter feel. This title is very gorgeous, but ultimately is just a shiny Soviet box around late 90s FPS stealth gameplay with some crafting/upgrading stuff in.",1706396635,1706396635,False,19,1,0.533887207508087158,0,True,False,False

For the motherland:
- Combat that is very similar to Bioshock.
- Freeze, electrocute, and smash your enemies with superpowers or with an arsenal of weapons ranging from standard shotguns to lightning cannons. All of which can be upgraded in various ways.
- You purchase upgrades from a large, red, anthropomorphized refrigerator.
- Very impressive art and environment design. It resembles a parody movie where a retro-futuristic version of 1950s Russia dominates the world. I am uncertain whether it is intended to be ironic or not. It is quite extraordinary.
-Enemies pose a significant challenge, as they often have the advantage, particularly in open-world encounters. This dynamic creates a more tactical and immersive combat experience, akin to a simulation game.
- Some mechanics are not explained very well, it might take you a bit of trial and error before you get to grips with some things.
- There are MANY puzzles. Thankfully Youtube exists.
- You can't place custom waypoints on the map, why is this not a feature?

Overall this is quite enjoyable.

I was following its progress as more and more came out about it. To my mistake, only did I just decide to purchase this game and play through. This being my first single player game in years. I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. For a studio who has only this game on their record, is a very high bar. There are some flaws yes, occasional bugs, of course. However, the atmosphere in this game is bar none one of the best in any game I've ever played. The game was scored well in my opinion, it gave the world life, as well as highlighted intense moments in varying ways. The enemy design is very unique and gives me an oddly nostalgic feel with its retro futurism. I personally loved the difficulty of the combat as well as the puzzles. Some how the devs created something that felt like Bioshock, Half-Life, Fallout, Dead Island, and Portal had a baby. The story to me at first felt a bit off, but the atmosphere kept me in, then slowly I fell in love with the protagonist and the cheesy dialogue that he delivered. The ending is bar none top 3 game endings ever for me. All in all, I give its a 9.5/10. The Fahrenheit orb physics is my biggest gripe of all. I never review games often, but I had to do this one.

edit: combat is still jank a year later, only way I'm enjoying the game is cheating in ammo, main character is annoying piece of shit that has the mental capacity of a 4th grader. Man doesn't even want to try and learn simple sciences or simple communication skills. I find the theme and actual science theories in the universe INCREDIBLY interesting but I don't get to hear half of it bc the MC decides it's too much to listen to. Also the dialogue has a large tendency to either stack on each other or skip entirely when another one starts playing (I'd be fine with one or the other, but having both just makes me think they didn't even try to fix it)

Also the fact the game needed to be updated later to add a FOV slider is fucking insane in 2023.

Combat Score: 3/10 (you get 2 points cuz the guns are actually enjoyable when you have ammo)
Lore Score: 8-9/10 (can't give a definite score because the MC won't stfu and let me hear shit for more than 5 seconds)

so after looking through the reviews, 
i'd like to point some personal opinion here:

- most complains of the game, are that ""it is not like other games"" and their features. (no fast travel, can't save the game at any given moment, 
well, its a good thing, you do want different experiences, otherwise you'd be complaining that ""it is like all other games"".

- the game does reminds of bioshock, which is great, im sure a lot of people missed its style.
but it isn't made to be similar in any way.

- the mechanics isn't explained fully, so enjoy the experience of learning, this is how games ALWAYS were until recent years, 
nowadays we became extremely lazy and got used to games which are designed for braindeads, so it won't hurt you to activate your neurons.

- the dialogues give you a lot of information about the story, if you want to skip it, you are playing the wrong type of game, try multiplayer games instead, they have no story.

overall, the game is amazing and great to have something which isn't ""Americanized"" with toxic propaganda,
the graphics are amazing along with the NPC designs, the combat system is challenging if you take it seriously and understanding you are not a god, so you also plan your steps and if to engage in combat.
and the story is very rich also.

It even has the ability to chop up corpses which is very enjoyable. Sadly there are some issues though, the main one being performance, the games framerate is all over the place, it can go from 30fps to 160fps and everything inbetween, sometimes it even goes as low as 20fps and stays there which seems to happen at random or sometimes after opening menus, no idea what the problem is with the game I can't tell if optimization is just really bad or there's some sort of memory leak, sometimes the cutscenes are out of sync too which probably also has something to do with the framerate. Combat is alright but dodging seems pretty bad when you're in a tight corridor since there doesn't seem to be any iframes a lot of the time you end up dodging into an enemy attack. The other main issue for me is the voice acting, sure I mean it isn't bad in fact its pretty well done however since its meant to be set in Russia I would have liked at the very least for the characters to have Russian accents like in the Metro games. Other than that though I'd say a solid game. Performance aside overall its well made and even has a lot of optional content if you want to spend a lot more time with it.

The story was really good, the world building, lore, the alternate time line of how WW2 ended and where the world was at that point in time.

The art and style of the old soviet era that is applied to a lot of the deigns in the game. The buildings, robots and more. 

The gun play and progression was really good. Inventory management was really good as well and I love how everything is explained and rooted in science, like just whipping a rocket launcher out of nowhere. I really liked how it also didnt punish you if you felt like changing things up with either abilities or how a certain weapon was upgraded, you got all of the materials back so you could just try new things and not have to grind, grind, grind. 

Which there was no lack of enemies to kill for materials, which got a little frustrating at times but, I eventually just started to ignore and somewhat sneak past stuff.

Puzzles were also really enjoyable too, though I felt like some of them werent as good as they could have been. I did some harder ones that made me think some, actually use that brain matter, and then a couple were just straight forward, was a bit of a let down. 

I will say that while I found everything good, really detailed and thought out and rooted in lore and the science in the game/story, it didnt feel as immersive as it could have been. Like it was too clean and sterile, but I guess that was the point of it trying to be some kind of utopia. It just felt like I was almost there in being fully drawn in, but not quite. Though towards the end I was there.

And speaking of utopia... The Twins. The Theater was a favourite area. A lot of interesting displays to view and enjoy.

The DLC was also really enjoyable and the fights were more intense, though much more arena focused. Was really good to have more story and lore. Like I said at the start, im looking forward to more of the DLC.

Also, that Boss of the Gym email that was slipped in there in the dlc on one of the computers. 10/10, amazing reference, hope theres even more. Not to mention all the other nods to other games in it.

Edit: Speaking of 10/10 and DLC, the sound track! Get it! Its so good! Cant believe I forgot to mention that.

main character and his company charles have good chemistry and relationship between them is good but other characters even dr sechenov dont have good characterization but story is good in overall but ending was such a disappointment for me
graphic is beautiful but there are some bugs in it such as stucking in objects or fps drop in big envirments but nothing huge may destroy your experience
music and voice acting are great nothing there is nothing else i can say just great
gameplay has 2 side action and platformer in action gameplay work excellent gunplay and abilities have such good combination and using them are so much fun variety of enemies and bosses are good and satisfying 
in platformer side game has a few problems such as sergey cant grab edges and fall or things like it 
in overall gameplay is best thing about this game for me
open world elements in game just about going from A to B and most frustrating things about doing this is infinite enemies coming from nowhere and want kill you so bad and you should just run from them because they come forever it feels like its 2000s game and lack of content in open world and very bad map design made you just run throught enemies for next mission there are 8 place name testing ground for loot and blue print that i think them make them to justify their open world tag nothing else

What is really baffling to me is the way they decided to narrate the game. There's annoying mostly braindead puzzles all around but the protagonist is actively complaining about them. The self awareness doesn't preclude from criticism though and this is where the issues really lie. The game designers knew that some parts of the game were kinda questionable and they acknowledge that, breaking the fourth wall while doing so, but that begs the question: Why did they feel the need to put that in the game anyway? Who knows.

Anyway the game starts you off going into this really boring long underground complex session before opening up the amazing ""open world"" to you before putting you back into a slightly less boring but still long underground complex again! This is where I'm at right now. The game just crashed on me (second time total) so I decided to write this review.

The spectacle of it all is really worth seeing and the visuals are really impressive and imaginative. The combat is serviceable enough to carry the experience, it's challenging and does require you to use your abilities thougthfully.  The puzzles and the narration detract from the game I think. The puzzles feel really forced and out of place, the narrator and protagonist ragging on them doesn't help. The bdsm fridge is a bit much too but maybe I'm just too old and grumpy for that kind of humour.

All in all I recommend it for the style and the rollercoaster type experience. If you really enjoy shooters, especially ones like Bioshock then this is worth a go. If you're really easily annoyed by questionable writing/narration and stupid puzzles then stay away.",1704918428,1704918428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  1  The dialog is really annoying F being the default key isn't that bad as I got use to it quickly. Not being able to scroll through dialog options so having to click number keys to select an option was awful.

 2   The candles were annoying they can be dropped, shot, exploded, thrown, wacked, and smashed but putting it in my bag/pocket that just isn't OK. The candle you get from the ballerina though that was OK to store. Also the candles you put in furnaces having to hold F and then also try any move is not difficult but not easy when playing on keyboard, this is obviously a controller game.

 3   The dandelion cameras, not sure if it was just my game, but they didn't do anything unless I just stood in front of them they never went off. If I just walked and didn't stop they were no problem.

 4   Maybe it's just Steam but the achievements were very buggy which I've never experienced before playing a game on Steam. I played on the Armageddon mode since there were achievements locked to that, beat the game or what I assume was the beating the game, but not achievement claimed. The apple pie achievement for collecting 114 apples, there's only 100 apples in limbo yet counted and got the achievement. Ultimate storm said to use some weapon or skill, not really sure, got the achievement by having the swarm blow themselves up. There were others but you get my point.

 5   The final mission confronting the doctor and killing the twins it bugged out on me twice. First time it played the cutscene then one of the twins jumped on me and for less than a second a prompt to hit a key popped up, failed obviously, screen went black and loaded and was in the fight but it stuck completely black. Second time reloaded went in and it jumped straight to the fight no cutscene and the twins bugged out and couldn't progress the dialog or do any damage. Third time reloaded and went in and finally it all worked and I beat the twins and the game.

  6  The game has areas that are nearly pitch black dark and for some reason we have no flashlight. Yes we have CHAR-LES which acts like a light sort of. It would have been nice to just have flashlight as an option.

 7   Not sure if just my game I actually played once got a little more than halfway through the game then restarted the whole game to see if it would fix my problem. My inventory was messed up, several slots would be off the screen so when items were in my bag I couldn't actually see them unless I removed everything, sorted, then finally I could see the items as they got moved to the front. I should state this was only a problem when using the NORA, as just pressing I my inventory was fine.

 8   Sticking with inventory why is disassembly right click and hold but also right click and hold is a way to move the inventory up and down. Disassembly is also incredibly slow meaning it takes forever if you have lots of useless items and more chances to accidently move the mouse which moves the menu and stops the disassembling process making me restart it.

  9  All of my cutscenes were buggy, bad, poorly made whatever you want to call it. Lipsyncing would be way off, they were so slow, and half the time it felt like it made no sense how the characters would act in the cutscenes vs in game. Just my opinion maybe I just didn't get it or understand.

  10  The map, why can't I make my own way points. Trying to track stuff down and having to guess if you're going in the right direction was annoying. Also like half the time I would open the map the player arrow saying where you are just wouldn't be there so I'd have to guess. Also why no minimap or interior map for doing the testing grounds or any place that wasn't outside. The game wasn't confusing or poorly laid out I give them points for that. I think it's safe to say 99.99% of all games I've ever played that have a map have either a minimap or maps for interiors. They're just nice to have in my opinion.

 11   Map related, fast travel. Having a car was nice for covering ground faster until the car got stuck on something. It would almost fit the theme for their futuristic advancements. I was thinking once you complete a testing ground you unlock the ability to fast travel between each testing ground. It's not too overpowered as you'd still have to do a fair amount of walking/exploring but when wanting to go back to the other side of map it would have been nice.

Again I think the game is good, no crashes, no stuttering, looked fine, played well. These are less problems and more of my opinions and preferences. The only thing I'd say is an actual problem is my point on how slow the game is through the opening and its cutscenes. With them being bad in my opinion made them feel even slower. The game is definitely worth trying and maybe once all the DLCs are made and released I might buy them when they're on sale and try them out.",1704757383,1704757383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What can I say, appart of all background rumors regarding Gazporm's investments, I would say that it's ""bad for good"".
Finally good piece of art that connected to Soviet past without hollywood cliche. All details are from our soviet childhood and for us, kids of 80s,90s the game is a rare door to nostalgie
People who didn´t play or don´t know the plot couldn´t say that AM is created as a propaganda stuff of Soviet Union. Before say it, watch letsplay or wathewer.
For anyone outside I think Atomic heart will be something unique and maybe you won´t understand the whole deep of the product but at least you will be surprised.
Other big pluses:
- Music
- Main Plot
- Characters
- Small details that goes though the whole game, like ""Ну Погоди¨ (soviet Tom and Jerry) in the rest room etc

MINUSES
Of course you came to read what's wrong with that game
- And I will tell you that it's January 2024 and the game still has bugs. If you not just running through the story and trying to explore the factory you will suffer from platforming part because it's very glitchy. SOmetimes you will stick in textures during jump or element of interface (switching between abilities) is desapearing. I will suffer a lot when I was trying to explore all polygons because of that. 
- Awfull face animation. It's something from Bethesda I guess, sometimes voice sounds appart of what happens on the screen.
- Voice acting. I am not sure how it goes in EN version, but in russian actors is overacting too much. I think it's fault of sound/actors director or something like that. 
- Graphics. Don't get me wrong, AM looks nice but seems it goes from past generation, water is like in Cyberpunk in the day of release, just a dead texture.

Anyway, I am proud that we have something that is connected to our culture and I hope it will open doors for Slavic calture, because the market is tired too much from Holywood stories.

If you can appreciate or at the very least tolerate the game's protagonist, Atomic Heart is a thrilling, fast-paced game carried heavily by its Soviet Russia inspired visual story telling and world building. Combat might be challenging for some early on but it only takes a couple upgrades to almost completely outpace the normal difficulty. There is a decent variety of weapons and skills to try but I found that once I had the loadout I was most interested in using, there was very little reason or incentive to try other things. Not necessarily because other options are bad, but whatever works for your play style is probably all you need to beat the entire base game.

Press F to suck.

I can’t help but feel the opening is designed to burn through the 2 hour refund window.

The first time you run the game it performs terribly - jittery and unresponsive - while it slowly installs graphic assets. Then the New Game opening sequence is a boring railroad where you have little agency while an enormous volume of exposition is dumped on you.
Characters, names, and concepts wash over you, and you can choose to slow down and read all about them, or keep trying to get to the game so you can evaluate it.

Then you start the tutorial sections, which is time consuming. All the while you’re waiting for the game to properly begin, to feel its rhythms, but it’s too late - you’ve been swindled out of 2.5 hours, and you can’t get your money back.

Ok, so you’re in too deep now. You keep trying it, but the more you play, the more you find the controls are awkward, combat is tedious, and the level design is unclear.


The characterisation of the world feels strange, too. It’s trying for an alternative dystopia to BioShock, but the world of BioShock was powerful because it explored specific problems in Randian Objectivism.

Atomic Heart appears to make no such specific critique of Soviet Communism, and the whole thing ends up feeling hollow; like some other story wearing clothes that don’t fit.
(Also, you couldn’t have gotten voice actors with Soviet accents? The performances were fine, but jarring.)


The art direction is very nice, and deserves a shout out. The levels are filled with handsome assets, but that’s not enough to save it.

The story is VERY short, and doesn't attempt to create or develop any meaningful characters. Because of this, you are left with an almost far cry style game, with a lacklustre open world to traverse between story beats.

In terms of how the game feels, the movement and gunplay feels too floaty, as if lacking weight behind actions. Enemies get samey and become annoying obstacles to magdump between objectives.

It's a brilliant mixture of the top features from my favorite games (Bioshock, Portal, Metro, Max Payne) with some unexpected plot twists and stunning graphics. There's not too much land to explore, but the plot is unlike anything that I've seen so far. The beginning of the game is absolutely awesome, I think I stayed in that part for 30 minutes just watching the parade, exploring the area, listening to various dialogues, talking to people and listening to the old favorite music. Man, you can even drink a soda or eat an ice-cream! The graphics is unbelievably good, the level design is definitely worth every praise. Additional locations (labs) allow to get the best loot and weapons and are full of puzzles. Enemies are sometimes quite challenging, but defeating them brings satisfaction. There's a new game mechanics that I've never seen before - the protagonist can ""swim"" inside gel blobs in order to reach certain parts of a level. Crazy robots add some spice to the game. Overall impression is very good and I definitely recommend this game to everyone who survived the 90s (if you know what I mean).

It has a lot of small flaws, but it's one of those games that gets you hooked at a certain point and doesn't let you go until you've finished it.

The hardest mode is challenging but fair without any bulletsponges.

Everyone has Bioshocked it to death and it does occur to me from time to time but Bioshock is a distant memory now. In hindsight, it didn't age well or was especially great, especially Infinite - yuck. I tried to play through even the first since I got the metal case SE on 360 but couldn't, it was 'enjoy the opening, uninstall' Bioshock for me.

You'll see the first city thing on youtube a lot if you're researching, robot parade blah blah but the reveal though the clouds to Royksopp was such an awesome opening. The characters are really good, I totally get the humour but most people mightn't. P-3 had me in from the start and glove is such a good side character to provoke him into arguments. It's a great dymanic. One thing I've started doing when researching games I'm unsure of is get a playthrough and watch every 5 seconds at every 30 minutes. It works. Fuck 'before you buy its...'. Everything is subjective as is this.

The upgrade system is good but goddam that upgrade robot, 30 yo nesters: wear headphones when your Mum is cleaning your room or force feeding you. There's no penalisation for scrapping your stuff to try other stuff. What you give is what you get back and it's the first I've seen.

- menus and upgrade tiers are clunky and unexplained; poor QOL
- major upgrades (e.g., new weapon blueprints, new powers) are just arbitrarily awarded to you when you reach certain points, not found organically in the world or contextualized in the plot.  You just enter save rooms and sometimes get a notification that says ""XXX unlocked.""
- a lot of random things are awkwardly hypersexualized; e.g., you build weapon and power upgrades at a machine that turns everything into an over-the-top double entendre and talks like a porno written by a teenager.  I'm not coming at this from a PC perspective, sexual content is fine in principle, but the ""sexual"" content in this game is awkward and feels like it was just arbitrarily shoehorned into the game to be edgy.
- the English-language voice acting for the main character is distractingly bad, and he says ""crispy critters!"" all the time as an exclamation/curse.  It is not explained.  It never becomes less weird.",1704330449,1704330449,False,14,1,0.53288733959197998,0,True,False,False

Ребят, мое глубочайшее почтение всему 3D отделу, арт директору и всем всем всем кто сделал настолько ЖИРНУЮ, красивейшую энвиру с охyNTEлbHEйшим дизайном роботов. Я снимаю шляпу. То, как игра выглядит, как она звучит - это просто невероятно. Атмосфера крипового совка передана безупречно. Я влюбился настолько в этот дизайн, что в ближайшее время собираюсь замоделить в пластисити какую нибудь пчелу. Вы прям меня вдохновили. Спасибо.

Геймплейно играется как Prey + Bioshock + Portal 2, мне очень понравилась боевка, оружие стреляет и долбит весьма уважаемо, зрелищно, эффектно и с импактом, прям кайф.
Я бы хотел во второй части иметь возможность комбинировать большее количество способностей перчатки одновременно. 2 + полу бесполезный шокер - маловато. Плюс физику можно было бы привязать к боевке, например метнуть какой нить стул в робота перчаткой как в Dead space
Головоломки - прям хорошо. Ни разу не загуглил, спустя несколько минут начинаешь по тихоньку понимать решение. Сделано прям хорошо и с креативом. (самый тупняк был только в предпоследнем комплексе где играет рок в траве сидел кузнечик)
Я узнал только в дополнении, что оказывается на tab есть вспомогательное меню, так и не понял есть ли оно в основной игре, имхо обучаловка какая то должна быть. В одном комплексе например я совершенно случайно обнаружил, что оказывается я могу перчаткой не только притягивать, но и отталкивать предметы. 

Сюжет. Комуняги как были людоедами так и остались. Людям, которые пишут про ру / совок пропаганду не мешало бы хотя б тезисно ознакомится с сюжетом, такой демонизации совка я не встречал еще ни в одной игре (без шуток). Последнее чем может игра считаться - пропагандой коммунизма блин.
Мне понравилась сюжетная линия, мне понравился лор, миро строение, я залипал на плакаты, На дизайн лабораторий, то как окружение рассказывает что там вообще происходило, на офигительно поставленные кат сцены, а слушать Чарльза - одно удовольствие. Играл на английском языке, возможно на русском как то иначе не имею понятия, на инглише я прям кайфанул. 

Мне не понравился паркур. Он дубовый, совершенно не предсказуемый, я знаю как решить пазл, я не знаю как правильно прыгнуть что бы получилось то, чего я хочу. Это раздражает, это прям бесит, благо таких моментов не сильно много.
Мне не нравится концепция открытого мира. В данной игре он не нужен от слова совсем и был добавлен ради галочки либо просто сделать больно. Концепция когда ты всех убиваешь, а потом всё живое респавнится работает только в соулс лайках. Prey не смог и вы не смогли, делать в открытом мире вообще нечего, он буквально пустой.
Общение с трупами - иногда хорошо, иногда дич. Но бесполезно абсолютно. В игре буквально валяется несколько сотен трупов и после 10и уже не подходишь и скипаешь. Я понимаю, что труп не нужно анимировать и это такая интересная форма интерактивных записок, но прямо скажем хз. Надеюсь во второй части этих разговоров будет в разы меньше, что бы ценность каждого такого собеседника возросла в разы. Хорошей идеей было бы прикрутить кт рупам какие нибудь подсказки для головоломок, ключи для комнат, тайники и может еще что нибудь. Ща это просто как голосовуха в телеге, не более. 
Жигуль ... не будем совсем уж о плохом.
Спасибо что выпилили весь кринж с Элеанорой. Видел обзоры - это был прям мрак. Сейчас кринжуха только в двух местах по сюжету (ну и всё дополнение) вытерпеть можно. ""Вытерпеть можно"" - не лучшая характеристика для персонажа, надеюсь во второй части этого позора не будет. 

Дополнение ""Инстинкт анигиляции"" - сделано на коленке. Добавили классную пушку и лопату - респект. Два (вроде ?) новых противника - ну прикольно. Проходится за два часа, эмоций не вызывает, всю снарягу в начале отбирают, эффект Deus Ex, а Элеонора просто бесит. Дополнение можно разве что перетерпеть, что так же не является хорошей характеристикой для дополнения.

For the motherland - 
- Combat which is very reminiscent of Bioshock.
- Freeze, electrocute and smash your enemies with superpowers or with an arsenal of weapons which range from standard shotguns to lightning cannons. All of which can be upgraded in different ways.
- You buy upgrades from a big red horny fridge. Literally a big red horny fridge.
- Very cool art and environment design. It's like a parody movie where 1950's retro-future Russia rules the world. I'm not 100% sure if it's supposed to be ironic or not. It's insanity. 
- Enemies feel like a real threat, you aren't an unstoppable killing machine because they mostly have the upper hand especially in groups in the open world sections which gives the combat a more tactical immersive sim feel.
- Very funny dialogue and bad voice acting. Your character will say ""Oh shit!"" when a boss appears but the tone of his voice is more like someone who just found out they forgot to buy milk and eggs.
- One of the enemies is a crash test dummy looking dude with a porno moustache.

For the Capitalist scum - 
- Some mechanics are not explained very well at all, it might take you a bit of trial and error before you get to grips with some things.
- There are MANY puzzles. Thankfully Youtube exists.

After beating the game 3 things really stand out to me. 

1. The parts refund system. This game offers a 100% refund on all 'power' and 'weapon' upgrades you spend. Which means that you can fully spec everything into the arms you are using until the next Nora (shop) visit and then change it up to try something else. Being able to sell off a weapon, try another and go back or jump to the next was absolutely wonderful. 

2. This is a linear at it's atomic heart. It's a story driven game with no side missions outside the testing grounds that added a open world feel to allow some exploration, freedom and mat gathering. They did a great job making a linear game feel more open world but don't go into this thinking it's an open world game, or you'r going to hunt for side missions that don't exist and hidden things that don't exist. All upgrades are in the testing grounds and you pick up all the mats you need along the way but can prep and kill more in the open world if you want too. 

3. Polish and balance. Graphics, design, music, levels, sounds, Voice acting, cut scenes, lore, everything, it's all polished really well. The balance feels off, like it's a few passes in but not tight yet, some bosses get quick-time instant kills, others have moves and attacks that will basically make you spend the fight on your back unless you came with shield. Then there is the poly jet and ice with ice weapon combo where you just perma freeze a boss and kill them. 

Thoughts;
Buy for a linear-ish game experience when you want to drive to a goal at your own pace back without having endless side quests or collectibles hidden in holes all over the map. Totally worth the price but I do think the game was over hyped, it's a great game and a new IP for sure but it's not like is really breaking ground with anything other than a clean polished game.

3. Had to reinstall the game after about 25 hours of gameplay as it was crashing multiple times at a specific spot in the game (only thing that worked, tried everything else). I also disassembled a massive amount of items from the storage I had collected (reinstalled, then disassembled everything), not crashing after doing that.

Thematically it doesn't hold up the way it should - it's not clear exactly what its argument is for/against communism/capitalism and whether free will is good or bad. The open world aspects don't play out well, it has the same type of open world as halo infinite. I think something more linear would have been better here. They could do a better version of an open world game but not without significant plot revisions. The climbing puzzles are miserable which turns the extra dungeons into a chore to rush through so you can get the weapon upgrades; imo puzzles centered around your glove powers would have been much better. Without the open world fluff the game isn't really very long. The cinematic animations are terrible for some reason, it's strange because the gameplay animations are excellent. Lots of reskinned bosses. The unique bosses they do have are pretty good. It really does a much better job in the DLC where they create a more DOOM Eternal / Bioshock hybrid, that works really well and if they made the base game just like that it would have been a much better game. It was quite clear that they had to make cuts to the game in order to make deadlines which usually is symptomatic of a game going way outside scope, lack of creative discipline: some things that are obviously meant to be bosses are just solved in cut scenes, there's a bit of a patchwork of half fleshed out ideas going on, and a lot of content is reused without nuance. The gameplay is good, the enemies are fun to fight, the world is creative and interesting, the graphics are excellent, it runs very well. While i can't recommend the game, I think this studio has potential. If they hire some good writers to craft a professional story, reign in the scope development, and hammer out the gameplay mechanics more, ditch elements that are just not fun. they could make something pretty impressive. \",1704122869,1704122869,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I'm just going to give all the bad upfront. Overall I think it's probably still worth it but maybe get it on sale or wait for updates. 

I consistently had an issue on the over world when the security alarms were at level 2 where using the charged up attack with the default axe on frozen robots caused the game to crash. Like very specifically those circumstances. Other weapons were fine. Might have been the shockwave upgrade on it? 

The player indicator on the map would randomly disappear. This also made finding the undergound labs more of a pain.

The upgrade menu and reading logs on computers were very sensitive and janky when using a controller. Sometimes a highlighted item wont select and it brings up something else or you'll lose the option to scroll and have to mess with it or use a mouse instead. 

Subtitles are way way way too small. I had the UI size set to max and quick time events and subtitles over NPCs talking were microscopic. When you'd move closer, the subtitles would move back too. It was like they were running away from you. Most deaths were because I wasn't able to read the quick time events. 

Audio logs are super tiny and hard to notice. 

A lot in this game is copy pasted and bland. This is compounded by the fact that there is a ton of non interact-able junk that looks similar to the interact-able loot-able kind. You'll see this with green cabinets and desks that can be looted right next to ones that can't. However, you just vacuum everything up with your hand so it's partially mitigated. But it's pretty ugly and boring to look at. It's not super fun to explore to be honest but most loot isn't unique and the unique loot is marked on the map. So once you accept that there isn't much reason to explore a lot and mainly follow the story it's better. 

The game wants to be Bioshock super hard and falls flat in pretty much in every regard. It even has small recreation of a scene from Bioshock. Not that it isn't fun or doesn't have an at least somewhat interesting story. But drawing the comparison isn't making it look good. Also, there is like an hour long worth of info dumping in the last part of the game. Some of it important and some not. Literally puts in a room with 13 computers each with like an average of 4 text/ audio logs. You don't have to read it all I guess but you should expect your players to want to and pace it out better. It just made me think, ""yeah, remember when bioshock made you read 50 emails in a row?""

All the powers are pretty strong but just feel a little off. You can only use 2 powers at a time. The game lets you freely respec points so I don't get why they limit you to trying only 2 things at a time. But you'll probably discover that it's super easy to just freeze everything or pick up literally everyone in a twenty mile radius and slam them on the ground with mass telekinesis. The game feels like it's trying to set up cooler combos but just kinda doesn't explore anything with it.

The controls are a bit weird and felt wrong to me at first. It takes some getting used to. The only time I died in a real fight was early on when i tried the combat goo which  does nothing on it's own at early levels and accidentally did that instead of freezing them and then got stuck in a corner and beat down.

Overall I enjoyed it but like just barely. Several times, especially when it was crashing on me I was ready to say fuck this game and quit. The story and combat is nice enough but feels a little lacking and full localization would have helped as you really have to get up close to something for a subtitle to appear for a poster so a lot of things just blend into the already bland background unless you can read Russian.

I think the best way to say it is if Bioshock is a 10/10 then this is like a 6 or 7 out of 10.",1704063755,1704063755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every aspect of what makes a game, and notably what makes this game good, starts blurring or flat out starts to decline:

-Music is great & unique, implemented in key and unique points. Then it take's a doom-style turn, not only in regards to genre but implementation (literally every millisecond of combat)

-Combat weapons & abilities stand out from each other & are unique, then as more enemies gather in both numbers and styles, as you acquire/find further upgrades, it all kinda just blends and doesn't matter what you use, even attempting to fight via honing in on ""weaknesses"" only have a minimal impact

-It applies an open & closed world, which is neat and transitions well between the two. The open world could have had more potential in regards to exploration, unique fights, ect, so it feels like a large but ultimately wasted world. I'd say though that the biggest failure in regards to the world and what inhabits it is the implementation of their ""enemy respawn"", which is significantly forced via repair bots where you can expect pretty much everything you fought to be repaired, on the spot, w/ no impact to health or damage or efficiency, within 5-20 seconds, making large group fights basically impossible and a fight of attrition because by the time you kill 3-4 bots, fight the other 3-4 bots, the other 3-4 bots you killed will likely be rebuilt. Running isn't an option either as they will just follow you, and in many cases, running away before they are rebuilt will still result in the fixed robots to come track you down.

*This is probably the most significantly impacted quality of the game*
-Story & world-related details are discovered and reveled, mostly, naturally, though it does attempt to squeeze in exposition where it can to fill in gaps. Then, eventually it's like they stopped caring or just wanted to get to the end, because the story starts feeling like it's blinding jumping all over where eventually there's a totally spontaneous & shoehorned 180 in the story. You are no longer experiencing the story via game progression and almost entirely from forced exposition via lengthy cut scenes & in-game walk 'n' talk segments that, at one point, quite literally lasted a half hour. The approach to the end just feels so excessively rushed, anti-climactic, and just doesn't logically make sense if you look back on the whole game without taking the shoe-horned portion of the game into consideration.

Still willing to suggest it, because the first 1/2-3/4 of the game is GREAT, but holy shit is that other segment & end just the hugest let down.",1704042995,1704042995,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

some enemies you encounter end up being uncreasonably tanky and too difficult to deal with where you deplete all of your ammo and end up using your axe 80% of the time (and if you are unlucky at one room you end up fighting 2-3 mini-bosses at the same time)
the story was ok at the start of the game but slowly started to fall apart and becoming more and more rushed
if you are still planning to play the game i reccomend that you go through every side-area and side-quest because otherwise you end up having a bad time at later rooms  and especially at the final boss if you pick one of the endings (currently there are 2) and most of the time you dont get any sort of fast travel and you just get a old shit soviet car until right before the end of the game

Pros:
Combat is tight and the style of combat is mostly up to the player. Upgrades can be refunded which is huge for sections that require a specific ability or to return an upgrade that didn't quite turn out as expected. Being able to upgrade a weapon, then turn all those upgrades into different ones when you find the schematics is slick.

Puzzle sections are refreshing without being over stayed. When it does feel low-hanging the game doesn't take itself seriously and breaks the third wall on itself tastefully.

I love reading emails off computers in games, this really brought back the feeling I got from doing the same thing in Fallout.

Cons:
The pacing is different for the story at least for what people might be used to when compared to modern western games. Its a slower burn than the fact paced action would suggest, but with an open mind that can be refreshing.

Before I continue, if you don't care about the gameplay much but like the visual style, just play this game on easy mode. You might actually enjoy the game because enemies are such bullet sponges on normal difficulty.

Cons:
- none of the weapons were particularly fun to use in the main story
- the open world aspect sucked. i wanted to explore but without a fast travel system i couldn't just ""in and out a 20 minute adventure"". 
- throwing a swarm of enemies with janky animations is supposed to be fun?
- the god awful dodge system with tiny number of i-frames.
- i couldn't just strafe a lot of attacks that seem like i can strafe but my movement speed was too low.
- some attacks do unreasonable amount of damage for how fast they are.
- none of the boss fights were particularly fun except the first geology bot thing and the twins. 
- i have more fingers on my right hand than the enemy variety in this game
- DLC sucks.
- 50% of the content was me looting enemy corpses because why auto loot.

pros:
- pretty
- okay story
- full refundable upgrades
- glove upgrade system

Maybe they were trying to go for a more challenging game but the game is heavily imbalanced. Either crank the inflated health and damage on enemies down in ""normal"" difficulty, or just recommend easy difficulty.

The only boss I did start fighting methodically was the (DLC) [spoiler] 3 arm BEA-D boss [/spoiler]; but the fight sucks so much I didn't want to waste my time. The DLC story didn't make me care about what's beyond anyway.

So after putting in around 10 hours, I have to say my initial meme review doesn't do the game justice.

It's a large game with excellent graphics, and good mechanics, enemy variety and takes notes from games such as Prey, Bioshock, Doom, and Soma. The weapon mechanics are good, and the crafting is non destructive, along with leveling, so you can vary your playstyle as the game goes on without losing any invested points. There is quite a lot to explore. The graphics and optimization are top notch. There's a lot of interesting concepts and puzzles, and the characters are unique. I bought the game at full price and it's worth it. 30$ is honestly a steal. I have probably 30 hours of play left at least. The game takes place in a fictional soviet 2nd industrial revolution with the discovery of nanopolymer. Robots and other production improving experiments go berzerk and it's up to you to stop it. 

The soundtrack is unique and incredible.
The scattering of questionably posed mustached mannequins is a fresh meme.

2.) the abilities are weak there are not fun  I use mostly the weapons 95% the time  playing this

3.) the locked doors puzzles.....GOD THE LOCKED DOORS PUZZLES  there are to many of them as soon as you  solve one there going to be another one  behind that one. there are just too many.

4.) your MC have no run button and feel that you can't strafe especially in a boss battle.  he feels so damn slow in a boss fight.

I can easily say that this game has one of the best Loot mechanics, the aim at the boxes and just hold F to loot everything that is inside makes looting really fast and efficient and doesn't waste your time with any tedious duplicates that you might get.
The Gun Upgrade systems were great even if a bit overpowered due to the fact that once you fully upgrade the Saw you can easily chop every enemy there is.
After putting various upgrades on your guns their form and functions change and they look pretty pleasing to look at and fun to use.
The Glove Upgrades on the other hand were pretty weak and gave you a few basic abilities with some decent upgrades that don't really change the game play much, aesthetically they look like a watered down version of your Hand from Bioshock. They are sadly not a lot of abilities and you will be mostly using the SHOK, Freeze and Gravity ones.
The Melee combat on this game was done very well even if it can take a bit of time to get used to the attack patterns of the enemies.
The biggest issue with the gameplay is the bloody REPAIR DRONES.
Whoever though that it was a great idea to not be left alone when exploring the world after destroying the cameras and robots should be fired. This mechanic is just awful and almost ruined the entire game for me. It stops me from exploring areas since if I destroy an enemy, another one comes flying like a flock and starts repairing it, if I destroy the repair bot then new ones come and you are left with only a couple of seconds to check before they repair (and spawn) the enemies that you destroyed.
This mechanic has seriously stopped me from exploring most of the areas and even the dungeons (which I really enjoyed finding and finishing since they gave you cool upgrades). After the 3rd dungeon I couldn't be arsed  to waste ammunition on an endless wave of annoying robots and repair bots.
The entire game would have been more fun if this mechanic was removed and the robots stayed dead when destroyed.
Enemy variation was decent and there were some fun Boss Fights.

Story:
 The game starts off pretty awkward at first not feeling sure which kind of story it was trying to tell, after the half way it starts putting the pieces on the right spots and begins to tell a pretty interesting tale criticizing the Soviet Ideal. The ending was pretty great and the twists were pretty good (did not see some of them coming not gonna lie).
There is a minor issue and that is the execution of the twists.
I am not fully sure if it's an issue with the writing or the translation from Russian to English but a decent portion of the story scenes and conversions between characters were just hilariously bad, from the way they talked with each other (angry teens lmao) and the story elements that they tried to execute were just very badly executed which made me not really care about the serious moments or just straight up laugh at them. CHARLES Voice actor was pretty great and there was a decent cast too but most of the Voice Acting was ranging from meh to cringe (except the robot fridge which just made me constantly horny bravo).
The DLC can get you a different ending but alas I think it feels cheap and won't be paying for it.
I feel like this game would have been way way better if they focused more on polishing what they had and improving some aspects (removing the bloody repair drones) and also not making that big of a world to check( that was mostly full with the same enemy type and buildings).
It might have been better for the overall experience to focus on a shorter game that had interesting things to say rather than making it that lengthy and making the player annoyed and wishing to finish the game as fast as possible.

However.
I'm a longtime lover of indie and early access games, and am no stranger to bugs of all sorts. This game is barely playable. Do not buy it. Even if you want it. I wish I could refund the 20 hours of my life because the bugs are game breaking and have existed since release.
For example, there is an ability upgrade that increases loot dropped by affected enemies. If you use this ability, the game will crash about half of the time you kill said affected enemies, making the upgrade a literal hindrance.
Additionally, I'm plagued by a bug that has corrupted my save, making every chest I loot contain nothing, including the unique chests containing weapon upgrades, locking me out of a key part of the game.
Considering the pain of the 4 hours introductory section, I cannot in good faith suggest anyone spend any money on this game unless they intend to fix the game themselves.",1703538413,1703538413,False,5,0,0.527474880218505859,0,True,False,False

If you said yes to ANY of the above titles, just buy Atomic Heart when it is one sale (now). You will not regret it. I had to stop myself from drawing parallels between the above games and Atomic Heart because simply put, Atomic Heart pulls good mechanics, story telling, humor, and design cues from all the best genre defining titles (above) and then executes them WELL. You can stop reading here. If you buy it, you will enjoy it. I won't spoil anything below, but I am marking it as a spoiler because you really can stop reading here if you are planning on playing it.

B-E-A-UTY: First off, this game looks GREAT. If you have a machine that can handle it at maximum settings, this game is gorgeous. (It isn't too taxing.) It isn’t next generation or ground breaking in any regard, but it’s just PRETTY. Think the airy-ness of Bioshock Infinite mixed with the grit of the new Wolfenstein series. Just a good looking game. 

Music: Dear GOD. The MUSIC. So far, Atomic Heart has released 3 albums worth of original soundtrack and there are some fucking BOPS in there, let me tell you. Mostly metal and electronic, but the sound of this game is PHENOMENAL. They did the work right, the music always makes you feel a certain way, with purpose. It is top tier. It may never reach the cultural significance and universal acclaim of Halo, but it is every bit as well done, IMO. I have been listening to it standalone all week. 

Story: The story is a roller coaster. A well written, self aware, satirical romp through a violent world of robots and other enemies. Like any roller coaster I know of, you are strapped in and set on a very specific track, but the designers knew what they were doing. IMO,  not all games have to be open world “choose your own adventure” games to be enjoyable. It seems to me that the designers tried to foresee what people would say about this game after it was released, and then poke fun at those things in the writing of the game. It is REALLY well done in that regard and quite funny at times. My only real complaint is the ending. The closing of the main story left a little to be desired, almost certainly to leave room for expansions and sequels, which I do not always appreciate. I like my campaigns tied up with a nice bow. That said, the first DLC has thus far picked the story back up and sated any disappointment with that lack of closure. 

Grind: There  is very little in the way of grinding in this game. The primary means for weapon improvement is several optional dungeons spread throughout the world, and they are filled to the brim with challenging combat and puzzles. Some are more challenging than others. I did not find these dungeons tiring, but actually quite enjoyable. The game does a great job of switching up the styles of the challenges.

Combat: Unlike the story, combat is where you get to exercise some free will. You have 12 main weapons available to craft, and each can be SIGNIFICANTLY modified to match your play style and preferences. If you want to be a melee main, you can do that. If you want to massacre silicon targets at longer ranges, you can do that too. Combat is fast moving, exciting, and pulls a lot of feeling from DOOM… move or die. Dodge mechanics, special abilities and weapons can all be used to create a nice flow state where you vibe to the music and visit destruction upon the metal horde. It’s great. 

In short, this game is a new standard of the genre for me. Not because it is exceptionally unique or new, but because it takes the lessons learned from all the best games in the genre to this point, and makes GREAT use of them. From the writing, it’s clear this was the intent, and they succeeded. You should play it and see for yourself.

[h2]Strong Cultural Connection[/h2]
As someone with a Russian cultural background, I was particularly excited about the Soviet vibes in ""Atomic Heart"". Despite my personal inclination towards Western European culture, this FPS action game's distinct Soviet-themed setting captivated me in a uniquely entertaining way.

[h2]Gameplay and Aesthetics[/h2]
The game brilliantly melds its thematic elements with solid FPS action gameplay, creating an experience that is both immersive and exhilarating. The Soviet-era aesthetic is not just a backdrop but an integral part of the game's identity, adding depth and intrigue to the overall experience.

[h2]Outstanding Soundtrack[/h2]
A standout feature for me is the game's soundtrack, which I consider a masterpiece. It enhances the gameplay experience, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere and setting.

[h2]Anticipation for DLCs[/h2]
I'm eagerly awaiting the release of all the DLCs for ""Atomic Heart"". The prospect of diving deeper into this game's world and exploring more of what it has to offer is something I look forward to with great anticipation.

[h2]Final Recommendation[/h2]

Pros: It reminds me of bioshock in terms of gunplay and ""plasmids"". 

Cons:

 The english voice acting is bad. I initially tried playing with Russian as the audio with English subs but the subtitles moved so fast and they were pretty small I gave up and switched to the English audio.

Switching between Abilities is convoluted even though the control is right on the HUD, ""Switch Up on d-pad"" which literally did nothing. After a couple of google searches I found LB to be the other ability I had equipped. 

While listening to an audio diary the main character P-3 will interrupt to talk to your glove, Charles and the audio diary keeps playing. That to me, feels like a bug that was never addressed.  

The tips in the game that pop up and Pause the game are very abrupt and there's nothing smooth about it. It almost feels like you get smacked in the face. 

The 2 biggest complaints I have are about the action and the way the game has you navigate through areas. Right off of the bat, I was completely disinterested in the action sequences that were happening; falling out of the sky wasn't surprising, the fall itself wasn't exciting or fun to be a spectator of. It was so very bland and disappointing. I felt like I was playing a poor demo. As for how the game has you navigate areas, there is one example that sticks out. You're going through the rubble of a cable car street and there are different levels as the top layer has collapsed so you can move downward and up again. A particular enemy appears and its' as if the game is (without the player having any knowledge about how the enemy's travelling pattern is) expecting you to know where to go or what to do. I like challenges, I like figuring out things, but this particular example just feels like you aren't even given a chance.

The game is fine on my UHD apart from the holographic database screens slow down everything which is not surprising because they cancel then replace the welcome screen you see when you activate them, which is confusing. The outside is quite slow and the spinning blades sometimes evaporate. Other than that, running around destroying the 'malfunction' only to find it is an intrinsic part of everything in a communist utopia is great, apart from me realising too late that you can use a car at one point.

It didn't want to make me grind for 100 % completion, but I wanted to see the story to the (rather insipid) end.
The dodge-and-shoot type style of combat is not really my thing, and I quickly switched to easy mode. If your pleasure is overcoming a difficult fight you repeated ten times to get the dodge/attack timing just right, I couldn't say if it was well done.
The story is very linear, and if you want to get upgrades you have to stray off the main path, where enemies respawn, and this gets annoying. The puzzle for the upgrades (and those for the door locks) are simple, maybe tediously so. It's hard to get the difficulty for those mini-puzzle games just right. 
In terms of level design, there are cues to tell you where to go/what to interact with, but not always, and that's a problem. If an elevator door opens with a red button, then all similar doors you can interact with should do so. 
Crafting/upgrading does not feel like something you want to grind for, it's just part of the game that you do as you advance. You don't get that feeling like in other games where you really want to collect these materials to get that ONE upgrade for your favourite weapon.
The humour is a pleasant release from the serious story, although it's sometimes misplaced or laid on thick (not Duke Nukem thick). It won't get you out of the story but the game would have been fine without. 
Overall it's a good game, even though it has flaws it's worth a play.

The enemies are way too tanky for a shooter that tries to be fast paced everywhere else. Then there are the drones who shoot you with lasers, staggering your character and shaking your camera around. You have like one second after recovering to shoot the drone, before you get staggered again. Extremely fun when there are multiple drones.

I now think the positives are outweighing the negatives. Some elements of the game are quite good. The voice acting can be quite funny. The graphics is really good, and some environments are well made. But it is not a clear recommendation. In my review I mostly write about the negative stuff. But still I think this game can be worth checking out if you like FPS, story rich games. If not at full price, then at a sale.

The game started well with a cool intro and atmosphere. But from there, it is a bumpy ride, with some parts good, some less so. You get a feeling of being hunted all the time, and I don't really like the ambiance in some parts. It's too dark and gloomy. There is no respite, and you have no allies, except for a glove that talks to you. There are also elements which I guess were supposed to be funny, like talking dead people, which doesn't really check out. Then there are bodies hanging in cables that are curled up in big loops. It just looks strange and unnatural, and you get no explanation for it. Stuff like that.

I kind of like the looting, resource management, and tweaking of weapons.

When it comes to combat, there are some enemies that are very hard to kill. When they discover you, you are most likely dead meat. So you have to sneak past them (I think), but that doesn't suit me, and it's also very difficult because there are cameras everywhere. It's confusing that some enemies are supposed to be a up for a fight, others are almost invincible. They don't show up in the scanner when you scan for enemies, so my guess is they are not meant to be killed, but avoided instead. Other reviewers have also mentioned these swarms of spawning robots, they are really a setback.
 
One of the worst things in combat are the special attacks that some enemies have, that are supposed to be avoidable by dodging, but are not quite that easy to dodge. More often than not when you try to dodge, you get hit anyway. I'm not sure why, but it seems they take into account other parameters than if you have pressed the dodge button in time, like possibly that you manage to dodge far enough, or in the right direction (I haven't managed to find out). But it doesn't make sense. In most other games, if you are in time with the dodge button, you manage to dodge. Not so in this one. If you fail to dodge 70% percent of the time, then it becomes quite useless. Or as happened to me, I started to dodge like crazy and always tried to keep my distance from enemies (in melee combat), just to make sure I was never hit. But it takes the fun out of the fight, right? Anyway it didn't quite work either.

I played at medium difficulty, and the game seems to get harder and harder. Even with upgraded weapons, it become more and more difficult to get by. I usually have no problem with medium difficulty in other games.",1702222378,1702293887,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The game initially sets high expectations with its captivating open world, but disappointingly, much of the gameplay occurs in confined spaces, which can sometimes be frustrating. The tasks sometimes felt like mini-games of Minecraft, which seemed somewhat childish. Moreover, the game is plagued with bugs and texture issues, which, despite the patches released, remain problematic six months post-launch. These bugs also affect the boss fights, making them monotonous and predictable.

However, the game's storyline deserves special mention – engaging, with an impressive final. The unique references to Soviet songs and the overall soundtrack add a special charm to the experience. The efforts of the Russian developers, despite a limited budget, are commendable. The graphics, while not next-gen, are still visually pleasing. The musical accompaniment, especially the techno versions of Soviet songs, adds a unique allure to the game.

I rate this game 8 out of 10, with an additional point for including a song by Muslim Magomaev, which particularly bribed my Azerbaijani heart :D

If we were to judge by the trailers from a couple of years ago when the game was still in its early development I was honestly expecting more horror aspects instead but that doesn't mean it's terrible.

Okay now, let's get straight into the game. there are a lot of things to say about this game.

The first thing that you might notice is the unique artstyle of this game. While it might not be everyone's cup of tea I personally find it really amusing, in fact, it was the first thing that caught my interest back when I laid my eyes upon the first trailer I came across on youtube. The artstyle has this funny polished vibe to it. The second thing that I can commend is the combat system of it, it feels flawless and you flow through it very naturally. Certain types of enemies will require a different way of approach and it really makes the strategy fun and not repetitive. Although the weapons progression feels a little out of place, you get some weapons near the end game and that point you barely get any use of them since you either have focused your upgrades on other weapons or you are already used to the previous weapons.

The only major complaint that I think is worth pointing out is the story near the end of the game. They build up this good hype from the beginning until the middle part of the game but the ending is just not satisfying and doesn't make any sense in my opinion. I see a lot of people complaining about the protagonist being too annoying but I don't find it annoying and honestly, at least it's still better than most games. I heard that the DLCs that will be released in the future might serve as a more satisfying story to the base game.

At the end of the day, this is definitely one of those games that you need to at least try once in your life so you can look back at your history and go ""Oh hey yeah I remember playing that unique artifact"".

The game really works against itself and the tasks you have to do are SUPER REPETITIVE! Im not even joking about that part. They even have the character you play as have ALOT of voice lines talking about ""why the fuck are we doing the same task over and over again"". Its really boring especially when your character keeps bringing it up. its not a bad game but not very well made. the layout of the map is open but the game wants you to go to certain places and it activates character dialogue, then the game wants you to stand in one spot and not move while the dialogue is talking and if you move to far or progress it gets cut with other dialogue and you amiss out on whatever story you were going to be filled in on with no way of getting it back.

I just fought a giant robot ball, it was not very difficult to beat. 

Right now im stuck in an area and have been facing the same looking humanoid robots they have ones wearing white shirts and ones wearing black shirts(these are apparently the main and only enemies they freaking have) (or humanoids that are infected by plants but with pretty much the same attack moves as the robots with white shirts and black shirts) they have some others like ones with blades and ones that throw misses at you but the majority is just humanoids with white shirts and black shirts. Its kinda boring fighting the same enemy all the time. every now and then a different kind of enemy comes along and its challenging because you haven't fought them but its not that hard to kill them and move on. 

Cut scenes are really weird and the way you transition into them. if your listening to story via audio and then stumble into a cut scene it gets cut. The character you play as says the dumbest one liners, its funny at first but damn its repetitive. the game is OK its different and the aesthetic is cool and unique. i would get it on sale. but not full price.

First off all, if you don't have a QWERTY keyboard and would like to play with KBM, you're already screwed. You'd think you could just rebind the keys and get on with the game, but selecting dialogue options is for some reason impossible. Only way to resolve this is by changing your keyboard layout to QWERTY in your OS settings, which is not the hardest of fixes but it's a little bit silly that we are required to change stuff in our OS just to play the game. You could also use a controller, but imo that doesn't work well for this kind of game.

Next, I've never experienced motion sickness playing a video game. But this game loves to toss the player around and flip them upside down. I got motion sickness for the first time because of this game, which is really annoying. If you get motion sick easily, this game might not be for you.

The game is also very sexual. That would be fine with me, it's an artistic design choice and I normally don't mind this at all. To each their own, but less than 2 hours in and it got to the point where it's honestly creeping me out.

This game does have a lot of potential. A game that feels a lot like RE but in a futuristic robot apocalypse sounds exactly like my kind of game. But if you're used to the combat in RE against all the slower zombies, fighting against those quick and nimble robots might take some time to get used to.

Firstly dont get fooled by the people saying this is Soviet/Russian propaganda, the game has a soviet era setting, yes, but it isnt for that motive that it can be classified as propaganda or biased. If you think so you probably have very little in terms of IQ. The game even has a few jokes and bashes towards the soviet/communist society.
Anyway, graphically the game is great, there are a few enemies which are fun to deal with, you have access to a lot of cool and fun skills and weapons which u can modify and upgrade, the combat feels nice and somewhat fluid depending on the enemies (some bosses might be spammy). The soundtrack is just incredible, it fits the game so good and also has a ton of variety in terms of genres. In regards to lore, the game is very great with a lot of details and some hidden stuff, i recomend reading a lot of the PEARS (the computers). The optimization is just amazing, nowadays games with such optimization are very few so this is very nice to have. The story is also nice, it has a lot of twists leading to two endings which are different.

With all this being said, i also have a few bad things to say about it, firstly, the open world. I dont think this aspect is that good ngl, while it has some locations to explore and a few facilities which you might want to go to, the main fun you have is the linear ""levels"" where you go and do puzzles, fight, and just have regular fun. The open world is just annoying, everytime you kill enemies there comes more enemies to repair the robots you just killed, and said mechanic robots reach the fight zone very quickly since there are spawn bases so close to each other, also to note that said mechanic robots are infinite and never stop spawning so exploring the open world just feels annoying and u kinda stop having the desire to explore anymore, in the beggining you may be inclined to fight every robot.. but in the mid to end game u just skip and run/drive thru them and dont even bother with it. The Boss fights while some being great, there are some ones (im looking at you Plyusch) which are cool and fun at first but then it just gets annoying, a bit disapointing killing a miniboss/boss and then having to deal with it again and again in the next location. the enemies while varied in the begining stop being so in mid/late game, its just the same enemies a lot of the time. 

Still, overall i had fun with the game, i did 2 runs while the latter was while doing  New game+ which introduces new habilites to some robots. I think there were aspects which could be improved upon, hopefully in the sequel, but i think its worth buying.",1701876660,1701876660,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- excellent music
- excellent comics in the ""break rooms""
- excellent visual and world design
- good level design
- good, satisfying melee and gun fight mechanics
- interesting plot with good story-telling
- good powers and progression tree
- good weapons
- addictive, ""just to the next save point"" gameplay

Cons:
- crash bugs - your game WILL crash every now and then (there is a crash reporter built-in, but it appears that the devs are not utilizing it - 10 months after launch the crashes still persist).
- ""stuck in environment"" bugs. Long time since I ever had these in another game. With this game, 90% are recoverable with patience and button mashing - but woe if this happens during combat - you are dead. The other 10% can only be solvbed with a reload.

1) The traversal in this game is horrid. He jumps maybe 3 inches high, and jumping and hanging onto ledges is so stiff and rigid-feeling compared to other games that do parkour mechanics right, like Dying Light. I constantly fall due to the jumping mechanic sucking so bad.
2) Getting stuck, a lot. I mean, a lot. While you're looting, get stuck. While I'm in combat, I get stuck and die from not being able to move. Really pisses me off when that happens.
3) The game doesn't explain shit to you. Status effects? Can't look them up anywhere, had to go to Google. The ""surveillance camera"" system? Nope, had to go to Google for that too. And confusing objectives without explanation galore, too; my objective marker floating in the middle of the ocean saying ""Go here"" when I clearly can't is really annoying.
4) The main character is just a complete douche for no reason all the time, under the guise of ""humor"". But he just is a complete asshole all the time to everybody for no reason and it's just annoying, he sounds like a try-hard teenager with no life experience trying to tell jokes. There's never any backstory or explanation for it either, nothing compelling to explain his behavior; so, he's just a dick for no reason.
5) Weapons. You have very limited choice in weapons. And if you wanna customize those limited weapons at all, you gotta go do these extremely repetitive and dull underground labs, each one is just a copy of eachother. 
6) Crashing, crashing, crashing. I'm running an Alienware M18 with no issues with any other game at all; and I'm not even running at full graphics, but this game crashes so damn much and because the save system sucks, I lose huge chunks of progress every single time. It's incredibly lame and time consuming.

Atomic Heart overall is a really enjoyable game, with fluid combat, a fairly good variety of weapons and modifications, and an incredible art style and setting.

When it comes to its pros, the style and setting of the game shine first and foremost. Mundfish's imagining of Soviet science fiction is really well done. I'm really pleased to see more Eastern European developers exploring their own cultural themes through forms like video games, and hope it continues. 

Furthermore, the games combat, while a bit difficult, feels overall pretty good. Lastly, there are 4 post-launch DLCs (one of which has since been released) so it comes with a good amount of post-campaign content for people who are wanting more.

When it comes to its drawbacks, first is the lack of exploration. While sections of the game are open world, the constant presence of enemies (that instantly respawn even after you kill them) makes exploration a chore, and I wasn't really able to enjoy exploring the full map until after I had unlocked New Game+

Finally the biggest drawback of all, is the English voice acting. It really is nowhere near where a AAA game title like Atomic Heart should be, but, if one can stomach reading subtitles, this drawback is easily fixed by enabling the native Russian voice acting in the games settings. As someone who often watches anime and foreign films, I don't find subtitles to be an issue, and I find the Russian voice acting is not only better, but also fits the game's setting, taking the immersion factor up a notch.

Overall, I think Atomic Heart is a solid FPS, with a great art style and concept. While there are some rough edges - bad English voice acting, constant enemy respawns, lack of explorability, I think this can be overlooked if one is willing to take a more story-centered approach - which is what I did, mostly sticking to the waypoints the whole playthrough.

While I can't say the game is deserving of it's whopping $133 CAD premium tier (which is what I sadly paid for it), let alone it's standard price of $80 CAD, I would say if one can get the base game for $60 CAD (~$40 USD) on a sale, it would be worth it.

Lastly, I should mention that at the time of this review, there are currently 3 more planned DLCs that developer Mundfish are currently working on, so I cannot speak for the qualities of those at the time.",1701094192,1701094449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, there are too many mobs in the open world, which makes it less appealing to travel around.

1: It does not display controller bindings. Anywhere. This is a very basic oversight. It borders on incompetence
2: The game cloud saves the graphics settings, which is a tad annoying when switching between devices. This is idiotic and IS incompetent. It doesn't border on it, it lies squarely in it.
3: The game has serious design problems, like spawning enemies from a monster closet, tiggered by interacting with a mini game. This is a SERIOUS design faux pas
4: I have had the game silently close a door behind me when entering a room, which lead to me getting boxed into a corner behind me that I didn't know was there--because the door closed silently.

It could use some more polish on the technical side but it doesn't crash or perform so badly that it harms the experience.

Launch of the Kollektiv 2.0 is near, everything is ready, what could go wrong? Everything as it turns out! You peacefully explore an island in the air called ""Some Russian stuff"", go down do some stuff on the ground and are smothered by Communist Robots. But then Babushka saves your bacon and you go save everybody, or sumthing i don't know i can't understand any of this with all the plot twists and 15 different Complexes of Facility 3826 which are all for some reason important. And this happens in an alternative timeline in 1960's Russia with robots and moon cities so good luck understanding ANYTHING without reading through literally like 150 documents.

Gameplay wise, its the best game i played all year, Its simple and complicated at the same time, just a ""Punch that robot in the face"" If that don't work, shoot him in the face, if that don't work, shoot him with something different. The puzzles were never a problem for me, i got stuck maybe 5 times in 36 hours of playtime on 2 different saves. And i absolutely love the Testing Grounds and boss fights, they are an actual challenge but aren't annoying.

I bought the most expensive version on game release, kind of a bad decision, digital artbook didn't really matter, The skins are okay, but they are skins, nothing special though i really liked having weapons not look like they are from the garbage. The Atomic Pass grants you access to 4 Story DLC's after they are released, at this time we have one, but i didn't get into it yet.

The Graphics are Good, on Medium settings. My Mid-Range PC couldn't handle high settings smoothly, and 16 gb of RAM are gone the second you start the game. But i am pretty sure its really good on the highest settings, you just need to have a better machine than this: 
Radeon RX570
Intel Core i5-9400F 2.90 GHz
16gb RAM

All in all! This game is a once in a life time experience with ""communist lewd ballerina murdering robots"". That phrase is the most universal thing to say when someone asks what this game is about.

And it certainly lived up to expectations, the game's got a good story that isn't that hard to follow. It's also got a great combat system that offers a variety of different kinds of weapons. This ranges from melee to guns and others.

The game also offers a skill-tree system which allows you to upgrade your character and certain abilities, which I won't spoil for you. However these abilities do allow you to play differently if you wish, so you'll be able to switch your combat style up whenever you want.

Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new modern shooter.

Not hiding my joy that a game inspired by BioShock and Fallout is being created, I started to follow every possible news dedicated to this title. The waiting time for a full-fledged game has finally come to an end, so that at the end of February I was able to sit in front of the PC and immerse myself in the Soviet alternative reality. The question is, was it worth it? 

[h1] The New USSR [/h1]

The alternative reality in which we will fight refers to the 50s of the XX century.  We’ll play as Sergei Nechaev, a KGB agent for special tasks, whose objective will be to explore the territory of Complex 3826 in order to determine why all robots suddenly began to attack defenseless people. At the very beginning, of course, we get acquainted with the new reality that surrounds us, which significantly differs from what we know from history books. First of all, World War II ends completely different, and the development of technology occurs much faster than in our reality. In the Soviet Union, the Internet, voice messages, the aforementioned robots and modernized weapons have already appeared, which significantly beats the quality of what other countries in the world have. The world in ""Atomic Heart"" is very fabulous and certainly the style of the whole environment deserves praise, because thanks to it the reviewed title is so unique.

[h1] The Unique World of 3826 [/h1] 

In the Complex 3826 we will come across many abstract things that will cause surprise, shock, confusion, and sometimes even will make us laugh (I’m looking at you Nora). The most important raw material in the complex is the polymer, thanks to which various models of civilian or combat robots could be created, and the communication system that will be the main plot motif in the game, Kollektiv 2.0. This polymer is also responsible for creating very strange elements of the environment, which during combat or further sightseeing can be useful and help in achieving the objectives. Thanks to these elements the world seems to be taken out of some fever dream, especially the Limbo reality. However, despite the innovative style, the world seems to be empty, because many locations will simply be filled with robots with which we will simply have to fight against... 

[h1] Soviet Doom/Wolfenstein? [/h1]

I have the impression that most of the attractions of the open world have been removed at the expense of fighting opponents. Although my appetite for searching every nook and cranny has not been saturated, fighting the enemy is a masterpiece. The game resembles the Russian version of “Doom” in this respect. The range of various weapons, from melee weapons to firearms, through the use of various techniques of fighting with various opponents forces us to frequently change tactics. The fight with the most standard robots, i.e. WOWAs, will look completely different in narrow corridors and in open space. The fight with flying robots, known as “bees”, also gives satisfaction when, after an intense fight with a horde of mustachioed machines, the “bee” squadron will be halted, and repairing the fallen mechanical companions will be impossible. There are of course more types of robots, not to mention very demanding BOSSES, which will require a completely different, more thoughtful approach. And the fight is not only about robots, but also mutated plants or polymer mutants that can terrify.

[h1] Hey, you promised me something! [/h1]

The game in its specificity is very good, but before the premiere, the devs from Mundfish Studio swore that in ""Atomic Heart"" there will be things that will seem controversial to some fans, while for others attractive. Of course, we are talking about erotic elements, because ""Atomic Heart"" is filled to the brim with them. From the famous ballerinas, to the notoriously appearing poses of various robots, through even installations that insinuate sexual intercourse. Not to mention... perverted fridge, the mentioned Nora. For me, as a person with a distance, this type of thing is funny and sometimes it really built a pretty cool aura, but building marketing on primitive desires will not necessarily have a positive effect on the reception of the game. Especially the promises of a six-hour cutscene with ballerinas, one-on-one. 

[h1] Summary: [/h1]

All in all, the game is astonishing. Graphics, audio (Mick Gordon), musica (На недельку, до второго, Я уеду в Комарово) and gameplay. Mundfish did a great job and for its debut, the game is a huge success. I hope that the upcoming DLC will enrich the open world with a much larger number of things to discover, and the studio itself will make many more games as good as Agent Nechaev's campaign.

[list]
[*]horny robots go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[*]goofy cartoons playing on TV's all over the place
[*]Combat is slower than most FPS's, but still feels solid and chunky.
[*]weapons and upgrades are rewarding, and you can un-purchase anything to gain back the items it took to craft with
[*]graphics are superb - environments are incredible and fun to look at, always something new to inspect, and easy to get side-tracked looking around at everything
[*]plenty of lore - i haven't completed the game yet, but the story feels very real with cool character development, drama, and mystery
[*]the soundtrack is BOSS - so many kick ass songs that I'd never heard before. 10/10 would pay for soundtrack
[*]honestly, a lot more. this game is awesome. the dystopian world of robots, AI, and capitalistic treachery paint one that a lot of us may already be somewhat familiar with...
[*]feels worth a second play-through - achievement gathering, harder difficulty, and pick up on more of the story
[/list]
[b] Bads: [/b]
[list]
[*]game was showcased with ray tracing - none still available and the Dev Team has not released anything on it. quite unfortunate
[*]not really a Bad, but the game is difficult. As you power up and unlock new skills/weapons, you start to feel a lot stronger
[*]protagonist does have weak dialogue a lot of the time. i'm a little burned on games not making their characters stand out, and instead resort to a mid-western vocabulary from someone who barely passed 11th grade

Overall 9/10, would happily purchase at full price, luckily grabbed it at 20% off, still loving it after 15 hours

Ever since I saw the early trailers of this game FIVE years ago, I knew I had to empty my wallet, and now, my balls. Given that there were several disastrous game launches from well-known companies recently, this release was great in comparison and taking into account the Ukranian war controversy. People complain for everything, from DPI settings to actual game breaking issues, which by the way, Mundfish has been addressing. Remember, even the Witcher 3 had a rough start and it became a staple.

This game was as crazy as the trailers hinted it to be, even with the changes over time. Some call the plot predictable, but what plot isn't? Well this one, at least for me, because it is the most diverse game out there in terms of story, music, gameplay, and art. Some revel in calling the game a clone of other games mixed together, but I think that constant comparison is proof of how originally inspired title is. We need more retro-futuristic games!

I was greatly surprised and had the most amazing time listening to the music! But I wish it had better triggers when fighting.
Few more things I wish would change/add:
- The dialogs stop as soon as you trigger another dialog or enter another place. they are really interesting but too many times you miss part of them if you dont stop and just listen.
- More cars maybe?
- Russian filthy language is sometimes not in place, feels forced and unnatural
- I was stuck between textures too many time while exploring the game and jumping around and had to reload last saving
-Map navigation!

The uniqueness of the game is what drew me to buy it. Everything about the game was very well thought out and original.


Pros: 
- The story gets better and better the further you get into the game
- Great graphics
- Upgrading your character and weapons was easy and not boring to do 
- and of course..... the Twin's ;D
Cons:
- While playing on Armageddon Mode, the bosses were actually very annoying trying to fight rather than being a fun experience. Otherwise, the other enemies were okay.
- The ending definitely needs more explanation 
- There were 2 missions where it was a ""Find and bring back item"" type mission. They got boring while trying to find more than 2 items. The reason I am adding this is because those 2 missions took quite a long time to complete. 
- There were times when the dialogue could have been better.

PROs: 
 Boasting breathtaking graphics and a unique art style that immerses players in a surreal and haunting world. The attention to detail in the environments and character design is truly remarkable. The game successfully creates a tense and mysterious atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The combination of eerie sound design and ambient music enhances the overall experience, making every moment feel intense and unpredictable.

Atomic Heart introduces a variety of bizarre and grotesque enemies, each with its own set of behaviors and challenges. The creativity in enemy design adds an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay, as players never know what monstrous creature they'll encounter next.

The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, offering a mix of both melee and ranged options. The diverse arsenal of weapons and gadgets allows for strategic approaches to different encounters, keeping the combat fresh and exciting. The game's story is both intriguing and mysterious, encouraging players to explore and uncover the secrets of the strange world they find themselves in.

CONS: 
Like many games, Atomic Heart isn't without its share of bugs. While most are minor and don't significantly impact gameplay, occasional glitches may break immersion. However, the developers have been actively addressing issues through patches. Despite the intriguing world, some players may feel that the game restricts exploration in certain areas. More open-world elements could enhance the sense of freedom and discovery within the game.

In conclusion Atomic heart is a visually stunning and atmospheric experience that stands out in the gaming landscape. Its innovative design, engaging combat, and rich narrative contribute to a game that is both challenging and rewarding.

If you're a fan of immersive worlds and enjoy a good mystery, Atomic Heart is definitely worth diving into.",1700703183,1700703183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me it's 7/10. Absolutely must buy if you like FPS and game is on discount. Wouldn't recommend 1st DLC, so my pros n cons will be about main game. 
Weapon fell cool, beating crap out of robots feels pretty nice, however let me try to share pros and cons from my side 
0) It feels like the guys were inspired by the new Wolfenstein, Bioshock, a little bit out of Fallout and new 2016 Doom which is not bad actually
1) Hilarious ambiance and location design, is it what USSR should be look like
2) Crazy music, but in my case for some reason there was no music in like most of the fights, but when the music kicks in you're feeling like superman
3) Some characters are quite colorful, but there's not too many unfortunately
4) A lot of humor and main protagonist also like to make dad jokes
5) Each bossfight, feels different, however again not too many of them
6) There is a little customisation for your weapons so it's cool that you can somehow make your comfortable build (however still not too many staff to choose from)
7) normal difficulty is quite ok without any special challenges, so if you like me like to loot everything in every available place, probably you should choose hard
8) part of the plot is quite normal, though not very intriguing 

ahhh now the cons
1) poor direction of many cutscenes,
2) the motivation of the villains is sucked out from air, and there’s also a plottwist on a plottiws, which seems to be cool but kind of boring
3) regarding weapons, ememies are more like a sponge for bullets, so in some cases melee could be funnier combined with you lets call it magic 
4) the puzzles are starting to feel similar because mainly they're happening in secret labs, which kinda looks like the same.",1700681080,1700681080,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I personally enjoyed the combination of melee and gun based combat and the upgrades associated with them. The glove abilities were definitely very helpful, although less so during boss fights.

Story:
While the story may be a little convoluted, it is definitely deals with several interesting themes and gives you something to think about. Hints to the towards deeper story and possible endings are able to be discovered via optional dialogues and messages on computers throughout the game.

Environment:
The environment and art style is very beautiful and there is loads to explore. There is a lot of environmental story telling as well.

Soundtrack:
Awesome soviet song remixes and kickass metal.

Bugs:
Although there are several bugs, they do not detract significantly from the gaming experience in my opinion.

Difficulty:
The difficulty is manageable, and I was able to complete my first run on Armageddon difficulty without it being too frustrating.

Open world:
The first open world section is very difficult, especially when you are not used to the mechanics, but for the rest of the game it is not too bad. There are several hidden areas to discover and use certain mechanics to unlock, which makes the open world an interesting experience.

Dialogue/characters:
The main character may sometimes seem a bit coarse, however, as the game progresses you may choose dialogue options to discuss meaningful themes and ideas. The main character begins to increasingly question what he is being told as the game progresses. Play the game in Russian with English subtitles for better voice acting.

I would definitely recommend this game and it was a lot of fun for me, though I appreciate that it may not be for everyone. The best aspects of the game would be the environment/art style and the soundtrack.",1700679319,1700679319,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Cool concept, almost ruined by cheesy dialog and decent gameplay. Saved by amazing music and art direction. 

Art Direction - 9\10 
Graphics - 7\10 = Ran game on Ultra everything, some things look great most look ""Unreal Engine"" 
Gameplay - 7\10 = meh, shooting was fun, powers I used only 1 type and melee...I hate melee in games so avoided it.
Story - 6.5\10 = Ruined by terrible dialog and to much cheese. Idea for a great story was there but it just missed.
Music - 9\10 = Best part of the game for sure.

Difficulty - Armageddon \ After first 5 hours its super easy, quicktime events killed me more times then actual battles.

Other few negative things I can say about the game are:
The number of enemies in the open world is extremely high which makes exploring sometimes very painful and I have to admit that I really dislike the red fences everywhere, I think some map boundries coud have been solved otherwise in a less ugly way. (And somebody please fix that damn whale carcass...)

But I basically love everything else about the game:
The boss fights are all pretty cool and unique, the combat (if somsetimes a bit janky) is fun, the story is well written and extremly interesting with memorable characters and their funny interactions, saying that I also love the games humor, the soundtrack is an absolut banger, I really like the skill and weapon upgrade systems, the style of the game is amazing, including the robot and character designs, architecture, weapons, all of the different beautiful enviroments and also the level designs.",1694287340,1700671713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
-Nice graphics
-Fridge
-Funny mods on the nexus (not talking about the NSFW ones)
-Easy access to mod
-Devs communicate with fans

Cons:
-Tedious storytelling
-No side quests, just purely focusses on ""treasure"" hunting and main story.
-Main marketting focusses on the NSFW aspect, which makes it look scummy
-Lack of repetitive aspect, like a lot of open world games have like Witcher 3

Now that I've completed the main story i can say it was totally worth it. But there are some flaws, nothing to regret me buying the max edition of the game but definitely there is room for improvement.

Pros:

- Awesome art style, love the USSR theme (however there is not too much of it later in the game and really hits you in the face mainly in the beginning of the game)
- I like the main story and the characters. It seemed like the main plot was obvious but turned out it wasn't.
- Great performance on my PC (3080, 11700kf, 32gb ram, fullhd capped at 120fps)
- It seemed short to me but it actually took 45 hours so i just dint notice how time flew by

Cons:

- Needs more polishing. I had some bugs like falling under the map, alarm not going off. Nothing major but bugs definitely are present.

My personal rating 9/10.

There is not enough dynamics at the beginning of the game. Most of the time you just walk.
Puzzles and lock picking get boring and annoying almost immediately.
The ""open world"" is empty and dead.
Driving is terrible. The car may explode from the fact that you ran over a cardboard box.
Beautiful visual. Atmosphere.
The action becomes more as you progress and it pleases. There aren't too many weapons. The plot is not bad.
Achievements don't work, some are impossible to get. If you have a lot of fps, then the game will be ""accelerated"".
There are a lot of bugs that are still not fixed.
In general, the game is not bad, but bugs and broken achievements spoil the experience. The puzzles are super boring and annoying.",1694303013,1700603633,False,40,0,0.583384394645690918,0,True,False,False

It's no AAA seamless masterpiece, but what it set out to accomplish it did with flying colors. It has great atmosphere, an authentic Russian aesthetic, and solid action with creative weapons.

Overall the game is solid and performs well, it gives you a good variety of parkour/platforming, puzzles, crafting and resource management, action, and story to experience in one stylistic package.

However, the game was broken and impossible the first 5 days since launch.
Do not pre-order from Mundfish.

Story 9/10 (the endings feel a bit odd).

Gameplay 9/10 :
Some portions of the map are locked at certain times which means you have to wait until you finish the story.
After the end of the story, you can go back to the open world but saves aren't working at that point.
The gunplay is incredibly fun, crafting is pretty good and the character skills are very satisfying.

Graphics : 10/10

Performance 10/10 : runs perfectly fine now.

Global rating : 9.5/10

Edit :

Despite being broken at launch, i think it's due for an update on my review.
Nearly all negatives have been fixed (not sure about ones in the DLC as i only played it once).

It's now worth it...
So much so that i am glad to vote for it not for one category, not two but THREE !

Outstanding visual style because it's really polished to the point i couldn't help but be completely immersed to the point of gaving that mmoment where i think 5 minutes passed since i wanted coffee but in all actuality it was 5 hours.

Best game you suck at because it can be really challenging at times, especially for people whom, like me, are dogshit at FPS. It's still doable but that easy.

Last category is best sountrack. It complements the visuals, story, overall vibe and makes the game incredibly immersive.",1677078672,1700599663,True,0,0,0.438183516263961792,0,True,False,False

I can say with certainty that even though I might have played games where some of the features Atomic heart includes are present, nowhere were they implemented in a way that Atomic Heart has done so. That's not to say that the game is perfect, far from it in fact, but in this case I think saying ""imperfection has a beauty of its own"" is the right way to describe how I felt after finishing it.

At first I'd like to say that the story is a complete fustercluck. There is no other way of putting it. The characters all sound a bit off (especially the player character) and the dialogue simply isn't the best. Even though I don't think many would aproach Atomic Heart and expect it to be a storytelling masterpiece, it's still an important fact to be made aware of. 

Even though the game has been advertised as an open world game, I don't really think of it as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing per se. The way I would describe this world is that it's a one giant linear level with optional detours with certain stages where after a certain point the player gets locked out of the place where he can't go back to anymore. At the start I was very confused by this progression but with a little bit of hindsight I appreciate it for what it is. It's just that the advertised description didn't really do this game justice. It's not necessary to make every game into an open world and I think the way Atomic Heart's world has been handled is both unique and effective.

Now to the combat. I cannot describe in words how good, polished, satisfying and rewarding it feels. Even though a lot of the enemies are what could be considered a bullet sponge at first, it all comes together near the end of the game when you have your entire arsenal and are let loose to cause as much havoc and carnage as possible. The way the robots react, the way your special abilities and weapons work together to slowly tear those robots apart, especially when upgraded, it's simply majestic (that also applies to the bossfigths which are also really great even if a little on the simple side in some cases). And all of that is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. All the people who worked on it have done an amazing job creating something unique, fitting to the aesthetic of Atomic Heart and also sometimes nostalgic for those that remember some of the original classics that were remixed (I'm not one of those people, but I can only imagine what it must feel like to hear a song you've been listening to as a kid on a radio in this game completely remixed while ripping your enemies to pieces).

Let's talk about the visuals. Atomic heart looks pretty good grapics-wise, but the art style completely surpases the level of detail in my opinion. Sure, it might feel a bit schizophrenic the way it shifts constantly to a new theme and visual style all the time, but I found it actually quite fitting for the setting - the utopian Soviet Union. It's simply something that hasn't been done before and we don't really have anything to compare it to other than the real world history of the USSR, where, funnily enough, megalomania, utopian visions and plans for the future were quite common among the elite, not unlike those found in Atomic Heart (albeit with a more realistic visual style). I simply found it incredibly interesting to be interpreted in this way and thorouhgly enjoyed the art style/styles. Oh and let me just mention that the game runs like a dream so you can enjoy all of what is throws at you without worrying about awful fps drops, stutters or crashes (unlike many Unreal engine releases lately).

The final verdict is incredibly straight forward. If you'd like to play a game with great combat, great graphics and awesome soundtrack and you don't care as much about the story, Atomic Heart is a no-brainer. The best way to apporach it is to not compare it to what's already out there. It's not a ""Russian Bioshock"", or ""Russian Fallout"" like many would describe it, it's not even an open world game or an RPG in my humble opinion, it's its own thing and I love it for that.

Excellent artstyle, great sound design and graphics and cool weapons and powers. (I must add, the russian voice acting is great and very inmersive). Animations are a bit janky, and I've encountered a few bugs here and there. Also the exploration on the ""open world"" parts are too chaotic, with infinitely spawning enemies and annoying alarms everywhere. Cars control like shit tho, which doesn't add a lot to the ""open world"" part.

The protagonist starts being a rude little shit since the beggining, but he grew on me quickly with some good dialogue with his glove and other characters. The story is also quite interesting, with great concepts and excellent world building in my opinion.

Soundtrack wise, this has bangers all along, with some great old russian music and cool remixes everywhere, feels very authentic and adds a lot to the experience.

At first sight there's the hyperorganized and roboticized communism 2.0 arc  in an alternate universe Russia that won WW2. Wacky oversexualized crafting machines, talking gloves, a passive agressive protagonist and strange bedfellows and a GrandMother-I-DONT-Want-To-Fuck-With. 

But underneath lies a more sinister and esoterical narrative of experimental scientific breakthroughs that grew over the creators's heads and became transcendent, leading to a quite stimulating open end ripe for many theories of how our main protagonist will deal with his own afflictions vs the interests of 'the motherland'.

The gameplay versatility in this game is astounding. Not only does it provide gameplay elements ranging from frantic Doom--like action mixed with beefed-up BioShock abilities, to portal-style puzzle solving and ""watch dogs"" hacking and scanning, the game also allows you to prepare yourself for big bos fights on a semi open world big floating island with aperture-science-style puzzle centres that provide breaks from the fast paced action. There you'll be able to acquire enough ""lustful abandon"" to upgrade many aspects of your character skills and passive abilities.

The protagonist will also slowly discover how kollektiv created a tragic outcome in his personal life, and allegiences will change depending some choices he made.

The soundtrack treats you to a goofy Russian schlager and contemporary music remixfest in dubstep / progressive house / metal and more.

There are about 5 main bosses, each of which are dope and very fun to fight. The story is decent and did a great job of being unpredictable. At least it was for me. I definitely didnt see the plot twist at the end coming so props to the writing team. 

Did not enjoy all the puzzles and locks I was forced to deal with in the game. I know some people enjoy puzzles but I do not and boy does Atomic Heart have alot of them. If you love puzzles then this is the game for you lol.

I recommend this game if you are into shooters and want a new shooter to play with a different take on shooters... sort of. It's made by a different country, so that is your different take.

If you have played Bioshock, this game is much like that kind of style. However, it is clearly not Bioshock. Also, it definitely is not as polished and finished as Bioshock. The trend of unfinished games continues with this one.

At the time of this review, only the 1st DLC is available.

I have access to all of them with a premium purchase and thus far have obtained all of the achievements for this game.

Most definitely buy on sale if you are considering it. I recommend this as something new to try, but not as one of those ""WOW, you've GOT to get this"" type of games.

Pros

-The game is mostly good looking visually for what it is.
-Cinematics have a deal of care to them, particularly in facial expressions.
-Upgrade system is not overly complicated and easier to figure out than other games.
-Russian soundtracks are pretty catchy. You may get them stuck in your head for a while.
-Cartoons in the save rooms are a nice extra. Also in Russian, but still nice.
-Nora The weapon vendor is just the best (NSFW warning for when you encounter the red fridge)
-The twins (left and right) I just like seeing them to be honest.
-Parkour and platforming controls are decent (For the record I loath parkour and platforming in shooters)
-Pears (computers in game) have a nice background music to them
-Some of the voice acting is actually not so bad (SOME, definitely not all)
-Goose in 1st DLC says some funny stuff (Just hate that it knocks you down all the time)
-Single player story is shorter than most story based shooters (some of you may not like this) I like it because too many of these games drag on for way too long.
-Dead bodies can be chopped up to bits. But then some are just deco so that is a con.

Cons

-Difficulty is badly balanced
-Combat mechanics in this game are just awful.
-Although the game looks good, much of it is repetitive gore decorations and gets boring to look at. 
-All the dead soldiers seem to have the same face.
-After the intro it is just you. No NPCs, just you for the whole game. A very empty feel for the world.
-Some of the weapons just don't need to be in the game. 
-Open world does not need to exist for this game and doesn't work very well for what is essentially a linear path.
-Upgrades for some weapons are so late in the game that it makes them useless for the most part.
-Security system for the open world is just bad and not very well explained.
-Getting knocked down in this game happens a lot and is possibly the worst part about it.
-Getting knocked down during reload resets your ammo back to zero, even if you had rounds loaded.
-Story is hard to get into and care about.
-Achievements are bugged. (Have been patched, but counters still behave weird)
-Game has an overall unfinished feel to it. Like it started well and was suddenly rushed at the end.
-The game will eventually crash or freeze. It's done it several times to me.
-Many collectibles are bugged. Highlighted for interaction but nothing can be done. One chirper by a rail and under a tree just doesn't show up at all, but its description shows when you get near it.
-UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES EVEN AFTER YOU'VE PLAYED AND BEATEN THE GAME
-Lock picking in this game does not need to exist at all, but it does.
-1st DLC is pretty weak, but you might like it. At least we get more Nora for a bit.
-Weapon Skins with premium are just gold skins for roughly three weapons... pretty weak
-There are a lot of items that look like they should explode or break when shot, but are just solid objects.
-Those bodies that can't be chopped up even though others can be.
-No controls to choose  what to listen to music wise. Some of those tracks are really good, I'd like control of them if possible.
-The game feels like it takes a ton of ideas from other games all over the board and just does really poorly in that aspect.
-For the style of game that it is, it feels outdated. As in they should've improved on what they were imitating.
-Another shooter where it is frustratingly hard to shoot stuff or even melee anything.
-In contrast to above, the enemies move too fast many times.
-Lack of enemy types. It's mostly robots and a few mutants... that's it. Feels like it needs more variety.
-Driving kind of sucks in this game and all the cars are the same.
-Two endings, and both are pretty weak. Especially since they copied the fallout slide show style.
-The communist undertones in the game erk me here and there. It's a Russian game, so I don't know how to feel about it.
-Controller layout could have been done much better.
Weapon wheel is poorly done. Customizing where weapons go on the tree is just dumb.

There is plenty more that can be said about this game both good and bad. In the end, it's just another rush job to add to the list of games that do this now a days. It's not the worst thing you can buy on steam, but at the same time it is not the worst either.

Again, if you like shooters and enjoyed Bioshock; you may find yourself liking this game. Just be sure to get it on a decent sale if you are considering it. Maybe even wait until the rest of the DLCs are out and see what people say about those.

Personally, I don't like this game all that much at all. I found myself achievement hunting and just wishing the game was over in many situations. This game feels like it could have done much more. Maybe in the future, the makers  will improve and release something much better than this and actually finish it.",1699965638,1699965638,True,0,0,0.472102999687194824,0,True,False,False

The graphics, art and aesthetics are phenomenal.  And unlike every virtually every other aaa game released this year, it runs really well too.  I mean it runs shockingly well for how good it looks.  When I saw the trailers, I thought this game is either going to get downgraded graphically, or it's going to run like hot garbage but somehow they pulled it off.  My pc with an aging 7700k and rtx 3070 was running at over 100 fps in the open world parts, and around 160 in the bunkers at 1440p/dlss quality.  

I really liked the level design of the bunkers and the overall gameplay loop.  A good mix of combat, puzzles and platforming.  The open world part did seem a little half baked.  I felt like it either should have been expanded with more optional content/side quests etc. or just omitted entirely.  The constantly respawning enemies make it difficult to really enjoy.  You can down something called a hawk to disable them temporarily, but it was really inconsistent as to how long it would stay down.  Sometimes it seemed to be back up within a couple minutes, other times it would stay down for a long time which could be equally annoying because it has to be up to do certain things.  I think the constant respawning enemies in the open world section mainly serve to distract you from noticing that there really isn't that much stuff to see up there if you aren't busy avoiding cameras and fighting drones.

The story:  Well, it has one!  The premise is solid. The execution leaves a bit to be desired.  You mainly learn the story through conversations with your sentient glove.  Rather long conversations that serve as large exposition dumps.  He constantly refers to characters you've maybe met once, or haven't met at all and it was difficult for me to keep track of who he's talking about or to particularly care.  The story seemed overly convoluted and muddled to me at least.  The world building to support this overdone story was done pretty well though.  Lots of computer logs to read and stuff like that if you are into that kinda thing.  As many have noted, the protagonist is rather obnoxious, aggro for no reason, and unlikable.  The story eventually kind of explains why, but it's a small payoff for putting up with him the whole game.

Overall though, I had a lot of fun with this game.  It has a very cool setting and environment.  The game certainly has its flaws, but I feel like the things they did well are enough to make up for them.",1699924376,1699924376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This combined with the fact that the game frequently crashes to the desktop, it is not really fun to play at this time.

The game needs the crashes fixed. Additionally it desperately needs a savegame system which reflects the storage abilities of contemporary computers instead of this highly user-unfriendly ""safe room"" concept from 30 years ago (with the all too obvious reason of increasing the logged game time by forced replays, thusly increasing the games Steam statistics).

As you may know, I often dislike games, but I get disappointed by them very rarely, since I have low expectations most of the time. But to be frank, Atomic Heart looked absolutely insanely good in the trailers, so I have been waiting for it to come out for years. In the end, you can all guess that Atomic Heart was unfortunately a huge letdown. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2936873254
Poor me, he had no idea what was coming in the next 20 hours. 

The first hour of the game was amazing. I thought I was playing a Game of the Year contender; the atmosphere, reminiscent of Bioshock Infinite's Columbia, was even better in Atomic Heart's prologue. The art direction and attention to detail were all top-notch and I really enjoyed it.

This is the part where things start going downhill. After that impressive 1 hour introductory section, we are sent to an underground bunker. In this bunker, we are given 4 hours of fetch quest style missions. We are asked to collect 4 canisters each from the far side of this bunker. Throughout this mission, we are sent to 4 distinct lab-style places which have great art direction, but they are so drastically different from each other that it is a little bit immersion-breaking. This also applies to the enemy visual design, tons of robots everywhere, and 2 minutes later, clickers from The Last of Us. What? This part of the game also has ridiculously terrible pacing and level design. You fight the same 2 enemies all the time. There are tons of mandatory badly placed and designed puzzles. It all feels so weird, I can't explain it any further, you have to experience it for yourselves. These ""puzzles"" are only put there to take your time and are so tedious that even the developer team acknowledges it and thus the character complains about these puzzles several times. Dear Mundfish, just so you know, accepting your poor level design does not let you get away with it. I will criticize it nevertheless. 

After that, the player is given access to the open world, where you are expected to travel through point A to point B up until the finale. There are some dungeons to explore but they are not even comparable to the well designed ones in Botw or Elden Ring either. So, to get to point B, you can hop into a car. This car explodes after 1 minor hit, so the most convenient way to travel is to walk. Wait until you get spotted by one of the many cameras. To shut down the cameras, you have to climb these Far Cry style towers and turn them off. Even If you don't get spotted by a camera, there are so many robots patrolling around, one of them surely will see you. These enemies have terrible AI. Sometimes they will notice you from miles away, and sometimes they won't see you when you are just in front of them. Stealth system also does not work because of this AI issue. Regardless of how, you will get noticed, and then they will send endless waves of the same group of enemies rushing at you to deplete all your inventory. Which makes engaging them pointless. Their behavior during combat is also strangely stupid. Sometimes they won't telegraph their attacks but just rush on you in a second. You don't get accurate feedback on when you are hit and from where you got the hit. All of these issues with the open world combat balance and enemy placement issues and simply the fact that it is not fun to play, led me to do something I have never done in an open-world game before. Skip the fights and rush to the next mission. It's truly saddening that they have forced me to do that. 

The map system is horrendous. There are no minimap markers, so you can't mark the next mission and follow a trail, or place a marker and expect it to appear on your compass. This will result in you having to view the minimap every 30 seconds to check if you are on the right track. Another horrible design choice. 

The enemy variety is also extremely low. They literally showed us all enemy types and almost all bosses in the trailers (even though I only watched one or two trailers on purpose to not spoil it). So do not expect to be shocked by anything in this game. The boss fights themselves are mediocre (by FPS standards maybe a bit better). Still very similar bosses with their attack patterns and how they feel in terms of encouraging you to change your playstyle.

Do you remember when I praised the huge art effort inside dungeons, in the overworld it is the opposite. The outdoors have little character and are full of reused assets. You are not motivated by the game to explore because there are no points of interest in the map, also exploring the map does not fit within the narrative, because each minute you spend exploring the map, people will continue to be murdered by the attack. For example in Hogwarts Legacy, they handled this situation way better. In that game, lets say you went on a main mission with Professor Fig. After that, he says that he needs time to investigate on what you had just found about, then, he advices you to focus on your classes and spend time around until he has come back. Things should have been similar here in Atomic Heart. 

Terrible storytelling with a pretty easy to guess scenario, combined with cliche characters and cringe dialogue full of Marvel jokes. Everything is overly sexualized. It becomes annoying at some point. I can honestly say that I hated the narrative.

I think the gameplay mechanics are bland and generic. Who thought that it would be fun to play with standard World War II weapons in a futuristic technological utopia? The only weapon that differs slightly is the energy weapon, which feels like a water gun. The hit reaction of the weapons is okay, but the enemies are too bullet spongy, it is not fun after some time. Melee combat works better since there are some aesthetically pleasing dismemberment physics and animations. The abilites feel okay, but all these mechanics combined do not result into a good game feel due to the many issues I have explained earlier.

There are issues with sound design as well. Too many sound effects are missing. I feel like the game is lacking a layer of sound. The music in Atomic Heart is just okay. I liked one or two Russian songs, but the rest are meh. They fall far below Mick Gordon's DOOM music, even though he is the composer for Atomic Heart as well. 

Atomic Heart was a game that had infinite potential, but was ruined by extremely flawed execution in level design, pacing, writing, balance, open world design, repetitive and simply not fun gameplay and almost in every other category that I mentioned above. It will remain as my greatest disappointment for some time.

I feel like the game is honestly a bit long, like it overstayed its welcome for a few hours. But that's fine.
The core game is fine, and combat loop is fine, the weapons are fun enough.
3.5/5
Only a few things bothered me.
The game is definitely sexual though, but not just in the robot design. It is the architecture and whatnot. Like some machines looks like dicks being stroked and some doorways look like vulva's. The architecture is not overt, but it is very very easy to see if you look at it for longer than a minute. This may be a positive for some people, and it is not necessarily a negative for me. I just think about buildings in that way, and it felt unnecessary, like that specific part was a joke. The sexualized robots at least had a lore reason, the actual architecture didn't.

I did not actually like the specifics to combat though. You don't really specialize to a specific play style, you just swap between them depending on circumstance. For example, one specific enemy is weak to melee and resistant to guns, but I only ever upgraded my guns to that point because I like guns. In response to this, I had to hastily craft a melee weapon and swap to it. And that worked, but felt weird. 

I felt like a combat system where you are forced to use a class you don't like isn't great. Luckily this enemy is not super common, but it popped up often enough that it was annoying. I only ever used my melee weapon for this specific enemy. 
I felt like making this enemy resistant to both types of ranged weapons railroaded me into using melee. If the resistances were just re-balanced, say it was resistant to most ranged and melee weapons, but specific ranged and melee weapons worked well, I would have enjoyed it more. Then I could continue playing how I want to play, instead of being forced to play how I do not want to play. 
The skill trees at least don't harm you in this regard, as thankfully you can't buff or nerf aspects of your arsenal. Everything can be used if you want to use it. I remember trying to swap out of a stealth archer play-style after committing to it in Skyrim, only to be unable to leave it because every other skill I had was too low to utilize. This game does not have that issue, thankfully.

Overall the game is fine. The guns are fun, the music is catchy, the story is fine. Some small hiccups happened along the way but overall its an entertaining way to spend two weekends.",1699332782,1699332782,True,45,6,0.713248789310455322,0,True,False,False

Cons:
The most glaring is - game feel like a CHORE! A lot of aspect needlessly consume a lot your time. This is a design issue and cannot be fixed after release though..
Movement with KBnM is difficult and not smooth enough. A lot of times I couldn't jump out of shallow holes
Jumping to ledges was badly done. Constantly losing grip. And too much climbing anyway..
Overall WAY TOO MANY puzzles. After several hours all these damn locks feel like a chore
Way to many mobs! The world is nice, but I can't walk around and enjoy the view. 
Weapons are extremely unbalanced. I finished everything with zvezdochka upgraded with flying chainsaw. Not needing anything else
Dialogues are mostly cringe worthy. Too aggressive and emotional. Not really explaining anything
Animation (Filatova and other minor NPCs) are really basic
Story is too political and hard to follow. I felt absolutely no emotional attachment to the protagonist. Like he just an empty shell of a man (which is kinda true, but still..)

its a beautiful game with a very interesting world to look around and unique and creative enemy designs. from an art perspective, it's a personal favorite of mine, at least in recent memory.
but, aside from a stellar ost, thats all i can praise of it sadly- the gameplay is passable, melee is fun but it nor the gunplay is super in-depth. movement's whatever, abilities are whatever, but GOD the story. i was not surprised the art director is the co-founder of mundfish because art is definitely this game's legs, and story is the unwiped chocolate starfish of this sexbait ballerina. anything interesting it does is wiped out by a horrendous ending. i avoided voiceover problems by playing with rus va and eng subs, but subtitles can bug out sometimes and stop appearing, which is obnoxious. ive been excited for this game since it was first teased, and everything i wanted from atomic heart is there, but a so-so gameplay experience and a crapshoot of a story weigh down the visuals far too much for me to ignore.",1679093000,1699234926,False,2,0,0.515349149703979492,0,True,False,False

With a loot of communist propaganda left, right and centre until something goes wrong with glorious never failing communist robots. The game is filled with a loot of refrencess to questionable soviets experiments and various propaganda, for my taste it may have been better if game was set in late 60s or very early 70s than in the 50s, but I digress.
Do not let your self fooled like some journalists, this game is told from perspective of more believing in communism individual in alternative timeline (altho judging by amount of attempted coverup of game events its possible that WW2 did not played out as it was described in the game), but you can frequently find various criticsm of communism and 'emails' with various ideological nonsenses. My personal favourite was reference to Trofim Lysenko's concept of making plants socialistic where farmer wrote a message that you cannot change nature with a commissar comment attached underneath to delete this message.
I found it especially entertaining to see Soviet propaganda cartoon 'Nu, pogodi!' which I watched as a kid in post commie Poland or glove upgrade's anti capitalistic presentations, brings a bit of Bioshock vibes, but commie utopia instead of capitalistic utopia of Rapture.

Now from good to bad:
The begging of the game is quite tiedious in fact Charls and MC do have a conversation about, which i guess suggesnts this part of the game was noted even by devs as not the best idea. The performance I am not convinced as well, in fact my old PC would never run it and my current PC is a bit shy of the recommended and it a bit strugless to run mix of medium and low settings, but my PC have some +5 years old prototype parts which are not the most optimized...
Gameplay experience is a bit of a roller coster and difficulty level feels very inconsistent.

As for final judgment this is not a bad shooter or an eye candy, but its more for people who are interested in ideological references than most story shooter, it does not mean you cannot enjoy it, just keep that in mind. Definitly a good jump out from constant 'America F Yea! why? because... er... America!' - no seriously just play older western shooters than most modern ones for the story before they bastardise them, or play this game.

PROS:
-Combat is very fun; melee feels good, guns feel good, powers feel good. Enemy variety is adequate, and all enemies actually feel different, with unique movement patterns. Localized destruction of enemies helps you feel the impact of where you're hitting them.

-The world building is incredible. I came into this expecting poorly translated dialogue and cliches; the game actually has an interesting story and manages to take itself seriously within the world, which really sells the feeling of being in an alternate-history Soviet dystopia. I found myself stopping to actually read the terminals and lore within the world.

-The upgrade system is easily understood, and balances ease of getting upgrades with the ability to still have lasting progression throughout the game. Most upgrades feel immediately impactful; very few niche ones.  Every kind of upgrade can be refunded for the full value and swapped with another at any time, so there's no penalty for trying new powers or weapon loadouts.

-Performance is far better than most AAA launches this year while having visuals that rival, if not exceed, most of those same launches. Using a 4080, DLSS Quality in 4k (no frame gen and every other setting on max), I stay around my display's 120Hz cap with very few drops and no stutter.

CONS:
-A couple upgrades have the wrong description or a misleading description (extra energy bars/regeneration). This has caused enough confusion in online forums about the game, that it should likely have been addressed by now.

-Elevator rides to hide loading screens. While these are almost exclusive to the training grounds and thus not a huge issue, the elevator rides can last up to a full minute when playing the game with an SSD. That's an exceptionally long loading screen; if the loading can't be optimized, there should be either unique dialogue or some kind of Soviet propaganda playing in the elevator to keep the player immersed. As of now, they're an immediate ""go on your phone"" moment.

-Repeating ""Crispy Critters"" in the wrong context (bad translation)

-Some funkiness navigating menus with a controller on PC

EXTRA THOUGHTS:
-As someone in the U.S. who works collaboratively with Russians and speaks to them through translators daily, I didn't think the English dialogue was bad outside of the previously mentioned ""crispy critters."" The protagonist himself is like a more asshole-ish Crane from Dying Light 1. I found most of the dialogue believable and while there are some lines that make your character unlikable, I never found myself disliking the character I'm playing (which would be a cardinal sin).

-If the feeling of progression and a strong upgrade system is something you hunt for in games, this will scratch that itch. You won't develop an emotional connection with the characters like the way you do in TLOU, GOW, or story-centered franchises, but the worldbuilding is very good. My only regret was not giving it a chance sooner.",1699082685,1699082685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, the game isn't Open World, so much as it is Open World Adjacent. In other words, it is a linear shooter with extremely large and sprawling maps to produce the illusion of being Open World.

The story is quite small, alongside with the dlc content, you could finish both in one sitting really, that's one of the two negatives i have to say about this game. Quite a decent story, you do get invested a lot.
The second negative is mostly the, quite tiring after a while, puzzles, I do think they are cool, specially some unique ones, but some areas are a bit tedious.
With that said, the game encourages you explore a lot. Combat starts out a bit rough but becomes insanely fun once you get a few upgrades here and there, it's a really nice mix of fun, challenge, and balance.
What really compliments the combat is the soundtrack, it's really amazing and you'll find yourself wanting more and more just for it.
The sceneries are amazing and most areas clearly show there has been a lot effort designing them.
I've been hyped for this game ever since the first trailers dropped around 2017, and despite the relatively small story, i think it lived up to my expectations
It's crazy, it's silly at times, it's a blast to play and if you're thinking of buying it on sale, do so, with more dlc to come i would recommend it as a solid buy, it's fun.",1698928287,1698928287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DLC finished: Unintentionally broke the game in 2 places - needed to reload a previous game save to continue. 

1st game:  Railgun missing. MoonFace puzzle broken, Railgun and weapon Achievements unattainable. Underground in Area 2 unpassable due to 'electric door' closed after opening during 1st pass through (half of underground in area 2 blocked ) ---- I enjoy this game, but it's broken. If you are a "" completionist "" you need to wait for a gamplay patch. ( Like me ) before starting the DLC. ( who wants to play a game without all weapons or achievements that can't be attained ? )

Stuff I like: 
Photo Mode - One of the best ideas for game tool
Graphics - My graphics are beautiful ( Radeon ) 
Environment - The sandbox is fun. Only stuck 2 times
                        and fell thru ' floor' of map 1 time.  Interesting ""Easter eggs""

Now, not only did i not get the 4 DLC (I'm assuming they don't exist yet but that i will be receiving them later on, once developed) But also WOW my computer can NOT run this game, at least not past the Vassilov Centre Offices, when you first start fighting the robo-janitors. AND I'M USING THE LOWEST GRAPHICS SETTING, I'M TALKING POTATO QUALITY! (Which TBF the low quality graphics in this game look pretty good) But the game should run fine! I've been playing Battlefield 1 which has great graphics and massive maps, huge explosions and all sorts of crazy stuff and that game runs fine 97% of the time, but this game? One over-the top cut-scene with a terribly rendered burning robot can only provide me freeze-frames and audio cutting in and out. :( I'm VERY sad, as i might have to buy a NEW COMPUTER to play this game if the devs cant fix it.

Edit: Several Months and Patches later, i can finnally play! It barely ever lags, and the only issue now is i can already see how repetitive its going to get, and im stuck on the birch tree mission cuz the waypoints are just around the birch tree lol.

Pros: It's got a rather good balance overall even with someone like me who doesnt have good reflexes Ive been able to play the game well on normal difficulty and still do well. The customization of your weapons and powering up is skills I really like in a lot of ways it feels a bit like bioshock in some ways. With the steam overlay it actively keeps tracks of your acheivement progress and notifies you which I think needs to be seen in more games. Overall stablity. It's only crashed once. The difficulty scale up is also good unless you go out of your way to do some of the other side areas first. Then it can be a bit hard. Puzzles are solvable but challenging. The Ballerina Twins enough said there

Cons: I noticed in the Testing Ground 8 there is one section of the puzzle at the end over the ravine that at the beginning is VERY hard to do since there is no platform below it close enough to drop down and nothing across to grab.  I also noticed if you are pursuing a guy later on in the story and go to other areas before going after him he gives future dialog that you shouldnt hear or no which made no real sense part of it till i did that part of the main story. Ive had the game crash on me once which wasnt bad so far.

I will always appreciate this game being released with pretty damn near flawless optimization and I think I encountered like... 2 bugs throughout my entire play-through (which sucks to even be an aspect of enjoying games nowadays). The gun-play feels crisp and fluid. The powers, while cool, do limit you to only using 2 (technically 3) at a time which I would've preferred having an easier way of swapping them out of my toolbar or whatever. The enemy AI is pretty souls-like in which it's the ""enemy glow red? dodge"" type of programming, which isn't bad by any means, it surprisingly felt good as a FPS involving dodging. The world is beautiful and I can tell it's all handcrafted AND they genuinely cared. 

The weakest part, however, is definitely the story. While the concept itself is pretty great, the execution in the third act feels really weak with no necessarily ""good"" endings. It almost felt like it was banking on the fact that there was is DLC coming out in the future, which kinda blows, but I don't mind helping a first time video game company that feels like a AAA release.

Story line is a bit confused but let's talk about post patch game play: 

1. The skills and weapons upgrade tree's remain mostly undefined and figure it out yourself. 

2. Movement/jumping puzzles - these are a huge pain in the %^&*. For example, I am currently on a chapter that requires a time limited precision jumping thing (""As you sow, so shall you reap, deliver the canister"") .  I have spent 4 hours trying to complete this and have watched at least 10 walk through videos. It continues....

3. The sexy stuff. Like Mass Effect, apart from a few seconds of cut scenes, this is confined to 'benny hill' lame innuendo interacting with your local upgrade machine - a red post box - as in ""fill me with your plasma"" dialogues. 

4. Ammo: This is worse than borderlands type loot every single box to get 1 shotgun shell, 2 pieces of wire etc.

Obviously the propaganda is all ""Soviet Russia good"" (which bothers some, even though they don't exist as a country anymore), but the main character is much more complex. I mean, look at him all foreboding and brooding in the main menu--does that look like a simple character to you? I mean, if anything, the multiple endings in the main campaign show you how regular people are manipulated by those in power.

Cons:
- Much of the content feels unfinished, poorly designed, thoughtless, or that many features were put on the chopping block to release this on time. Poor game design.
- I shouldn’t be able to thwart the AI/camera GTA threat level by walking in the bushes, off the paved roads, out of the limited LOS of petel-cams.
- The story is unfulfilling and lacking detail, containing numerous plot-holes, and lacks depth past the initial tutorial island.
- The AI is underdeveloped, oftentimes not entering buildings to attack the player if the original fight occurred outside the building.
- There was no emphasis, or reason to explore the ""open world"" setting. You could play Atomic Heart without ever exploring the extra-regions.
- This game is not really open-world, all missions are contained within linear levels.
- No FOV slider. Motion sickness, color blindness, deafness, Etc. are accessibility issues and in good game design, you’re taking this into account, even if “yOur gaMe has HighEr FoV ThAN mOST ShoOters”. 
- Obnoxious, directionless dialogue between the protagonist(?) and their glove.
- DLC is also a let down and brings nothing of nuance to the title, except copy-paste content, and short, linear levels.

As per usual, the controversy from the whiners and crybabies really only attracts attention to the game and helps with its overall sales. The same thing happened with Hogwarts Legacy. 

Coupled with the fact that this game is set in an alternative universe where the USSR basically saved humanity after Nazi Germany manufactured a plague that wiped out a large swath of the world's population, its research in advanced robotics ushered in a world of similarly advanced technology, from housekeeper robots and a dominatrix vending machine that would definitely switch for your manly masculine character, to gravity-defying floating islands in the sky with flying cars to shuttle you from each destination, it only added to that intense hatred because how dare a video game take place in Russia other than to depict it as seen through the lenses of the otherwise bigoted. 

Playing through the game, it's obviously inspired by the likes of other popular shooters such as Bioshock and Prey to name two of them. The gameplay and gunplay itself was very reminiscent of those two games in particular. And I felt like it more so satirized communist regimes rather than advocated for it or supported it, as everything inevitably goes wrong in order for there to even be a video game in the first place. It's very much critical of the Soviet Union throughout and while it might not outright condemn it, it really doesn't need to. 

It has the typical amnesia character that we've seen portrayed many times in other video games by now, and you'll piece together the clues or figure out who the main character is and what their role was by the end of the game. There's a few interesting twists and two different endings depending on a final choice you make, although the one is obviously canonical. 

You get to use a glove which allows you to access the elements, adding a unique perspective to the FPS gameplay. You'll collect a resource throughout your playthrough which will also allow you to upgrade this glove through an RPG system with a skill tree, and you'll also be able to craft and upgrade weaponry. Explorers can even find some of those guns laying around the large map as you run or drive to your different destinations, which would save you some components when just crafting them instead. 

There are a few boss fights, which were easily my favorite parts of the game, and the soundtrack is from the talented Mick Gordon, where the music will pump you up and help unleash your hidden gamer potential that you might not usually have when shooting hordes of robots or monsters.",1697592716,1697593699,True,2,1,0.513960719108581543,0,True,False,False

Well, I definitely recommend this game. It's a good, fun game. As close to being the spiritual successor to Bioshock as it can get. However, it's not perfect. But a good game. I think their next game will be the masterpiece. This was an appropriate milestone for the next game.

GOODS:
-The game has a soul. You can feel it all along the game. It has a somewhat unique world. Really interesting concepts. It has been thought out thoroughly and you can experience it in each step.
-The graphics are gorgeous. Both in terms of fidelity and design. The environments, robots, characters, weapons, effects, especially textures are top notch. I love it.
-Core gameplay is fun. Combat is fun. A lot of Bioshock-like elements. Weapons feel like they actually hit, especially melee weapons.
-Enemy variety is good. Lots of enemies.
-Story is above average. The concept of Kollektive is nice and is consistent with the in-game world. 

BADS:
-The platforming... The WORST platforming I've ever played in a game. I hated every second of it. I hated every section that had platforming. I wanted to kill myself that's what it was... Terrible, horrible, worst of the worst platforming... It totally kills the vibe and retention.
-Environment collisions... I don't know why, but I always kept stucking in colliders and die. Most of the time I didn't even knew what I was getting stuck at. It was frustrating.
-The game was, IMO, way too long. It outstayed it's welcome a bit. I'm an above average player and it took me 30 hours to finish. I think 16-18 hours should be top for this kinda game.",1697404766,1697404766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to admit after reading other reviews I wasn’t sure if I’d like this game. However, because most modern FPSes are multiplayer focused Call of Duty or Fortnite clones, there aren’t many alternatives for a singleplayer FPS fan like myself, so I felt like I had to give Atomic Heart a chance.

Unfortunately that was a mistake, because I really didn’t like this game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Enemies include several different types of robots, and some mutants. Some enemies are focused on melee attacks, while others can fire lasers or missiles. There are also huge bosses who move quickly and have powerful attacks at close and long range.

•	The player can use a pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, laser rifle, and a few different melee weapons.

•	You can also use Bioshock style special powers such as electric shock, freeze, and a shield to protect against enemy attacks.

•	I didn’t really enjoy the combat. I played on medium difficulty, and most of the guns felt quite weak. Many enemies, and especially the bosses with their mile long health bars, are bullet sponges.

•	It doesn’t help that you’re frequently trapped in a small room or arena with no cover, so to avoid taking damage you have to spam the dodge button or run around in a circle to confuse the AI.

•	One boss has an attack which requires you to succeed a multiple step QTE to avoid instant death. You’ll meet this boss a couple more times later in the game supported by groups of regular enemies, and yes it still has the QTE attack.

•	While most of the main quest takes place inside buildings or underground facilities, there are times where you’ll need to progress through a small open world area. Killing enemies in the open world is a waste of time, because there are security cameras which can summon infinite reinforcements. If you destroy the cameras, flying drones will come to repair them. The best solution is to just ignore the enemies and head to the next quest marker.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Terrible. Full of fake scientific nonsense and “jokes” that aren’t funny. Half the time I didn’t understand what was happening, and the other half I simply didn’t care.

•	Dialogue was written by a 12 year old who thinks the best way to portray a character as a badass is to have them drop an F-bomb in every sentence.

•	Also uses that trope where the developers include lots of annoying puzzles in their game, and then script the player character to complain every time they have to solve an annoying puzzle.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	Took me 17 hours to finish, although this might be considered a speed run, because I didn’t explore the open world.

•	Graphics look great and I didn’t have any problems with framerate, stuttering, bugs or crashes. (Possibly the only game released in 2023 that just works?)

•	Even though this is singleplayer, if your internet connection drops for a moment, the game will pause and throw up an error message on your screen.

But it dulls down rather fast as you are fighting just one type of enemy for the first chapter and about four to six in the rest of the game. Either you overpower your enemies quickly or it's just useless to fight, as they can respawn infinite. There are a very few boss fights or situations in which you encounter stronger unique enemies, most of them aren’t that hard to beat also (at least on the standard difficulty). Don’t want to spoiler much, but I was really, really disappointed that a fight against a boss was teased several times, just to have them to be blown up in a cinematic.

-If you are here for awesome looking robots…you might be a disappointed.

-Gameplay is kind of Bioshock-ish. Wielding guns and melee-weapons in combination with a some “superpowers” e.g. freeze-blast, a force-shield or telekinesis. It’s okay but I didn’t find it to have much impact on my playstyle, which weapons and skills I combined. 

-The skill tree and weapon-upgrade/crafting are nice, as you can get a full refund on everything you spend. So, you can test all variations without having to worry about missing something. 

-On the environment I’m a bit unsure how to decide, on the one hand you have great looking indoor-areas that feel unique with a great 50s/60s soviet-flair, on the other hand you have an open world that feels super repetitive after the first few hours.

-The test facilities can be short distractions of the main-story as they offer some logic and physics puzzles to grant you weapon upgrades. (Like a very light version of Portal)

-The story is medium, it’s not a revolutionary new one, but not the worst I know. Most people will probably get what’s going on pretty early into it. The storytelling itself is okay, even though sometimes dialogs, decisions or just the emotions of a dialog are strange and feels out of place. The last point might be due to the localization. (Played with german audio)

-You can find a lot of background information of the world of Atomic heart scattered around the places, mostly audio-files or mails. Helps a bit with the emersion if you are into this.

-A big minus, Quicktime-Events, some of them leading to an instant death without much of a warning or being part of a boss fight including an unskippable entry scene.

-The grand finale was underwhelming, two alternative endings, one including two boss-fights. Yet none of them felt like a proper ending, I kind of see what they were aiming for but it didn’t satisfy me. I have the season pass (bought the gold edition on sale) and I’m hoping that the DLCs maybe will give the story some more flavour (see review down below), as now I don’t see a point in replaying the game.
Neither for the story nor for the gameplay.

DLC A.I. (or ""Fetch the balls"")
 - In short..not worth it. 

Longer Version: 
 -Story is very thin revolving around the annoyingly sexualized Nora, Poorly told with lots of strange 
jumps. Not adding anything new to the Main-story
-You start with a half upgraded char, don't worry you will get the rest of your skills very soon as half
of the skills and weapons are missing (can't even use the element-upgrade on weapons, eventhough 
 you can spend materials on upgrading it...nice.
 -two new weapons, one melee double-bladed-staff and a combination of a mg and a chargable 
lasergun. Both kind of okay.
-The new levels are rather compact, no physics-puzzle or new test-facilities. The familiar look of 
the maingame. oh and in almost every second room Nora is having a Hardstyle party...for 
whatever reason.
-Two new types of enemies, one is an advanced version of the crashtest-dummy (partly 
selfhealing, but atleast killable) and some agile ball-bots, wannabe transformers.
-Two ""boss-fights"" .... both are literaly the same fight...
-The infamous twins make an appearance, just to show of there bums and ""assist"" you in the 
final. (Not really though, just some low effort cut scene dance twirl stuff)
-Took me 5h to complete....I'm glad it's over

PS: The most, absoltutly most annoying thing in this dlc (and probably in alls other games I 
played) is this stupid goose, that pops up out of nowhere. Cursing and referencing mostly russian- 
memes/movies (as far as i could find out on reddit), attacking and knocking you down, while being 
unkillable. WTF is this about???

The beginning of the game was fantastic. The atmosphere felt genuine. I have lived through the 90-s in a country that was part of the soviet union as a kid so the music, the cartoons made me almost nostalgic. The combat was also not bad. Many different puzzle type door lock systems was a bit much and unnecessary, something the protagonist also mentsions, but tolerable.
Then you go otside, in to the open world area and shit starts hitting the fan. 
BTW i am a ""easy"" player, so i played on easy dificulty, which said that it should be a ""focus on the story, dont worry about combat"" experience. 
So once outside you will find out that the robots are everywhere, and if you attack them, they will call some friends, including some flying ""Pchelas"" that will resurect dead robots...infinately. If you will kill the resurectors, more will just fly in and resurect everything you killed. So the only smart thing is to just run towards the next mission marker. No exploring, no fighting, because you will be quickly overrun. Later in the game you will get an option to disable everything in an area for like 2-3min, so there´s that i guess.
At some point even the not open world areas become just rediculous with multiple difficult enemies at a time in a small room filled with all kinds of obsticles to get stuck on. Worst of all, the game tries to focus about 50/50 on melee combat and it has this dark souls type of ""dodge the enemy atacks"" thing going, exept this is a first person shooter, and the enemies have this thing where they start the attack animation in one direction and after you dodge, they will just refocus on you to still get a hit. So melee combat is long and tidious, 
The ending is a bit disapointing. Some might not like it because there is no ""happy"" ending, but i thnk it is just...meh.
Then i tried the New Game+ and that is what did it. To get to all your stuff from the previous game, you need to get to NORA, the vending machine. The enemies have been buffed, including some that explode on death, so melee is not an option on them. You will die from like two hits from any of the robots and to get to NORA you will need to kill if i remember correctly at least 4 of them. The weapons you get, are an axe (cant use against exploding ones) and a shotgun with one shell. The robots take at least two headshots to kill and i looted 3 more shells from somwhere. AND one of the bots is a laserface robot that takes 3 or 4  shotgun shells to kill.
Long story short, i am sure it is possible, but as an ""easy"" player i had almos no fun with combat, regular game is done and finished and new game+ is pure pain and not in a good way.
So in conclusion, for someone who likes a challange the game should be great, but the easy difficulty is a lie.",1696445545,1696445545,False,6,0,0.515262365341186523,0,True,False,False

The game throws you in a world where they really focused on creating and it definitely shows, it's loaded with voice recordings and computer messages that provides a lot of depth to the world it tries to build. Aesthetics wise, I would give it a ten, everything suits my personal taste on that aspect.

Main character is an asshole and not a funny one. Voice acting is good but he acts like a edgy teenager most of the time. Game doesn't have a huge cast of side characters but overally they're decent.

Looking at gameplay, it's somewhat repetitive and lackluster and it's easy to be OP very early on as the game itself gives you lots of resources for you to upgrade. Most of the consumables are not worth it and frankly being able to use health packs during combat makes the difficulty redundant. Even with armageddon (hardest) settings, game becomes tedious with lots of bullet sponge enemies and bosses and not feeling like there is a real difficulty change. Though I havent tried new game plus features yet but I don't really think it affects it much. Good thing is whether with polymer skills or weapons, you really feel the weight of every attack during combat so it's somewhat satisfying to try different weapons and skills although some of the are obviously OP. All in all, would give combat a 7 out of 10.

Music and sound design is incredible, nothing much to say. Most of the tracks are on repeat both the Mick Gordon and the original versions.

Haven't encountered any major bugs both during main game and first DLC. Optimization is pretty good, maxed all the settings in 2k and never dropped below 120FPS even with screen is cluttered with tons of effects.

Overall, would give the game a 7/10 but considering this is the first game of Mundfish, would give an 8/10. It's rare to see an indie studio making such a great game on their first try. Much props to them. Would support the developer if they release more fleshed out dlcs and continue the work and build up upon the world. It has huge potential in my opinion.

It seemed like another scam project that would be done half-heartedly just to make money. I'm very glad that I was very wrong about that.

There aren't too many AAA projects from the CIS [i](Commonwealth of Independent States)[/i] segment, unfortunately [i](free-to-play trash doesn't count)[/i], so I'm genuinely happy that the game has been successful.

It's truly a high-tech project, with no loading screens between locations, fantastic visuals, beautiful animations, and functional interactivity. It's not without its quirks, but overall, it didn't strain my eyes too much.

I thougth I never felt nostalgic for the USSR and Soviet romanticism, but the opening scene drew me in for two hours. I was captivated by the posters, engaged in conversations, listened to dialogues, and admired the visuals and set design. I experienced familiar yet simultaneously new emotions.

Throughout the entire game, it's fascinating to observe the evolution of the main character and relationship with ""AI"" companion. The humor, comments, and their interactions with each other were enjoyable and conducive to empathy. Almost every event comes with a corresponding comment and assessment.

In terms of gameplay, the game strongly resembles the first BioShock. Melee attacks, shooting, and [strike]plasmids[/strike]abilities are okay, but sometimes, there's a sense of ""roughness."" However, over 32 hours in the main game, I never felt that shooting became boring. The weapon arsenal may not be extensive, but it was more than sufficient for me, plus the upgrades.

However, toward the end of the game, I realized I didn't want to use weapons again just to trigger another wave of enemies in the open world, which is probably the biggest and most annoying downside. You simply can't explore all the areas and collect materials because enemies start swarming you. Greetings to the rooftop at Testing Ground 6, where I had to destroy enemies whose respawn point got stuck next to a computer for cameras. I spent 20 minutes trying to open that damned door [i](by the way, the marker for the camera also glitched, and I couldn't get to it on the map)[/i], and in the end, I gave up and reloaded to carefully replay that part.

Since I started talking about the downsides, the open world lacks content. The beginning is very solid and rich with diaries and content. But once you get into the open world, there's not much except beautifully designed locations [i](the aesthetics of Soviet ""retro-futurism"" are outstanding)[/i]. There are Testing Ground challenges that you have to complete to unlock upgrades, and that's all. Maybe there are some interesting locations, but because of the respawning enemies, I didn't want to roam in circles to check that. Most of the time, I found just resources. That moment when you break into yet another cabin to find diaries, but all you find is another pile of resources.

Did anyone even understand the map? I didn't. It's just functional.

But again, I never believed that this game would work. The open world and the game world, in general, function as they should, even though it really annoyed me at times. Points of interest are always well-furnished, and there's always something interesting to explore. Story-related locations, in particular, earned my respect.

I also liked that spent resources and development points can always be retrieved without any additional actions. So, closer to the 2/3 mark of the game, I didn't have to loot crates anymore (on medium difficulty). I could experiment and play as much as I wanted.

The story turned out to be far less straightforward than I thought based on the trailers. That's undoubtedly a plus. In some moments, it may seem somewhat naive, but by the end of the game, you're the only one who feels naive [i](well, at least me)[/i].

For me, Atomic Heart was a pleasant surprise in 2023. Perhaps my zero expectations for the game contributed to that. But I was impressed. So, thumbs up.",1696095936,1696095936,True,74,1,0.816130101680755615,0,True,False,False

If you plan to give the game a shot then please do buy the base version as the premiums are not worth it in my opinion, or see if it goes on sale. ---

If I could give this review a mixed yes/no I would, but sadly there isn't an option for that. 

This game can be beaten in the story very quickly if you do not spend time with the little things or stop to read information. The design of the robots and the level of detail graphically are amazing, the scenery, the locations are as well. Story wise is where things get complicated. I see the dream they wished to achieve, I just wish they would have played more into their story.

--- Spoiler warning!!! If you do not care about spoilers read on ahead! ---

I am very disappointed with the story when it comes to choice. There were only two times ""choice"" really ""mattered"" in this game or even appeared. Honestly the ""choices"" didn't even let you choose. The story starts to fall into place as the option of choice and free will are now under control of another and no longer your own later in the game. It is a nice story that can portray a villain who thinks they see the greater good and are doing good for everyone around them. And although some of the plot twists in the ending were nice, I felt the lack of ""choice"" to be out of place. With a game that claims there are two endings, there is sadly only one. And while I appreciate playing on the illusion of ""choice"", if they could have portrayed that more and played more into the illusion of it instead of just at the end, I would be ok with the game's endings, or I should say, ending. 

In the morality of the choices, there is a spot for your own sake if what you did was right, but it doesn't matter. I would have rather played a linear story than giving the option of the two choice that play to the same one. If you were curious if there is a good ending, there isn't. It's bad or bad, which in turn story wise, become the same ending regardless. Either let the villain get the desired goal sooner, or delay it a short while till he get's it. All the same, he gets it regardless. While I do like the typical twist of the hero losing and the villain wins as our ending, please don't claim there is a choice or make one if you aren't going to play into it more. One choice at the end that lead to the same linear one feels like all my previous game play didn't matter. 

If you cut the price in half for this game, as well as just making it all facilities and none of the open world exploration, then made the gameplay even shorter, it would have had a better taste in everyone's mouth in my opinion. Please don't get me wrong, the amazing battle music, the robots in size, the puzzles were all in great fun. I would just have rather cut out most if not all the walking nonsense and surface exploration for more facilities, harder puzzles, and a richer story. 

Still an experience of a game that I partially enjoyed none the less, just see some wasted potential in a game that could have been even more amazing.",1677407104,1696013704,False,7,0,0.57437664270401001,0,True,False,False

Overall, the game is an incredibly enjoyable experience. Graphically the game looks great, the combat is fun and the open-world aspect that bleeds into the midgame is pretty neat. Complaints that the game is a run-n-gun are largely inaccurate and is comparable to Bioshock in its level and combat fluidity. 

With that being said, the only thing that does take me out of the game slightly is the dialogue. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty common complaint. I don't necessarily care about foul language at all, and frankly, I think it can add to a game's overall charm. However, it is *very* frequent in a way that kinda doesn't make sense.

🎀Contrary to what the vain and convoluted chatter of the internet wanted to make believe, Atomic Heart carries a diametrically opposed science-political message compared to what was hastily assumed. It initially showcases the shining facade of technological progress and the clean flags of egalitarianism, only to dig deep and bring to the surface all the rot that has always enveloped humanity and its most selfish intentions.
Drawing an alternate history where dangerous scientific advancements and political shifts have taken over, Mundfish looks at the present, past, and future of left wing extremism and renders them miserable, dismantling theories they consider dangerous and born from currents of thought that never consider the reality of facts, the feasibility of those ideas, and the deleterious implications they carry.

🎀Enter an alternate history where the Soviet Union emerged victorious in the race for technology, becoming the epicenter of the scientific revolution that forever changed the way of life for its citizens and the nation. In a setting where humans seemingly live in harmony with their loyal and servile robots, making the myths propagated by the USSR a reality.
Despite the advantages of polymer-based technology having been crucial to the fate of the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the Communist Party initially opposed the pervasive use of what was actually a unique breakthrough in the scientific field. After the initial political resistance, the benefits of progress and the potential for unprecedented expansionist subterfuge led to universal polymerization in 1955, with consequences that were only seemingly benevolent.
Atomic Heart presents themes and characters that are devoid of clear-cut simplifications and polarization. The moments in which morality, convenience, justice, common sense, and balances converge are truly abundant, and even when we reach the crucial moment, there will be narrative twists where taking a clear stance will be difficult, without it having potential moral deception.

🎀The combat system includes the use of melee and ranged weapons, along with powers such as an upgradeable electric shock with various effects on robotic enemies and machines within the areas. The weapons are mostly the classic ones, such as pistols, rifles, machine guns, and rocket launchers, but there are also some technologically advanced weapons. Of greater interest are the passive and usable abilities, which include freezing, the production of polymer clusters, a kind of shield, and various enhancements related to movement capabilities.
The game features various puzzles and a skill tree.

🎀There's also the option to disassemble weapons and their upgrade parts to reclaim resources, allowing you to reuse them for other purposes and change your approach to battles as desired. Even at the basic level, experimenting becomes necessary without relying too much on routines.
Additionally, the game features a dynamic structure, ranging from indoor areas to open worlds that serve as vast intersections. In these open areas, you can carefully explore houses, old buildings, and optional zones to unlock special projects. The high level of security and the presence of guard machines and robots restrict free exploration, although I appreciated the freedom offered in managing outdoor sessions without restrictions.

🎀If you enjoyed the Bioshock series, this is something similar but with a lot more to offer. The hardware requirements are clearly low, and the game runs very smoothly. The absence of ray tracing, which players lament on the game forum and in every thread, was initially supposed to be implemented, and it's the only thing missing. However, I personally avoid using ray tracing in games as it's just a resource drain for a few extra effects.

Ray tracing question.....

Why did Atomic Heart remove ray tracing?
The game has gone through a pretty twisted development pattern, in the sense that there were a lot of changes and scenes or maps that were added and removed for various reasons, which resulted in them dropping raytracing altogether to speed up the development.

Besides, regarding ray tracing, who's crying, I don't buy the game because it doesn't have ray tracing calling the devs liars. If you buy a certain game, just for the ray tracing, you still have a lot to learn and little to criticize. In gaming, there are much worse liars and that didn't compromise ANYTHING in this game........If not a few more infantile whinings.",1689007471,1695579493,True,4,0,0.506138861179351807,2,True,False,False

Waited for a sale, picked up, and now beat it. So what do I think? I think this game sets the standard for what games with this price tag should feel, look and sound like. This is the level of quality that we all should expect from a gaming industry that often cuts corners, realizes on name recognition and then blames its own players when they point out the lack of quality. 

To keep this review spoiler free, you are essentially throw into a robot-gone mad type scenario and you have to fix it. Its an FPS shooter with light RPG elements, very similar to something like the original Bioshock. In this capacity, Atomic Heart succeeds for the most part, with solid gunplay, good powers, fun side dungeons and solid boss encounters. What really sells this game however, is its setting. The music, the comedy (bouncing from high to low brow with seamless effort), the aesthetics, its all fantastic, and lifts the game into excellent territory. The story, while somewhat predictable, is also entertaining, and has some great VA (who in the  English version sometimes gets the Russian pronunciations correct). 

Now, this game is not flawless, I sometimes found it could be abit buggy, the puzzle dungeons won’t be everyone cup of tea and I found that dodging in combat could get you stuck then quickly pummeled to death. The open world was also, frankly, a litte pointless, since I never felt the need to go anywhere besides the aforementioned puzzle dungeons. 

One more thing, this game made by Russians and has a distinct Russian ascetics. In our current world, of 2023, it is very much not in fashion to talk about, consume Russian products or even humanize the Russian people because of the actions of their government. I for my part, did not find this to be a problem, and neither should you, if you are a healthy and functioning adult.

Treat it as a mostly linear first person shooter, despite what some of the tags say. I'll come to this.

Before I begin, so it's visible: If you get it.. Hold jump to get him to grab ledges. That frustrated me plenty

Atomic Heart plays in the 50s in a world where the Sovjets had scientific breakthroughs unheard of even now. Frankly, with knowing of he reality of technological inventions and with some of the logs mentioning kinda same-ish development as in reality until like the 40s or so, I think it would have worked better set in at least the year 2000, but the year is mostly inconsequential anyway.
This game is not communist propaganda, neither is it capitalist propaganda. Kinda surprising it managed to get around both when communism is such a big topic in it. Mind you, there is some ""communism is great"" strewn in, but in a way that it looks kinda like in-game propaganda, not the game preaching to you.
The story starts with you exploring an area on behest of the lead scientist, because robots there had a malfunction and started attacking people. Where it goes from there I leave unsaid because spoilers.
Just saying so much: The ending of the game is horse feces. It seems pretty clear to me that at one point where you visit a light house, they had hours more planned but ran out of money or time and just brought anything to a quick end.

I liked the aesthetics. For some reason, I especially liked that all normal rotors were replaces with archimedes screws. I dunno, they just look great.

As an FPS, it works well. The weapon selection is pretty limited but most guns have their purpose and even the starter weapon stays viable hrough the game thanks to upgrades.
The enemies are a bit too bullet-spongy for my taste. Even with a fully upgraded pistol, even basic bitc* bots take several headshots to down. Seeing as ammo is scarce and needs resources to create yourself, it means the most of the game you run around with your trusty bladed baseball bat or energy pistol (which needs about twice as many shots, but ammo recharges). If you make ammo so valuable, you could at least have had the weapons pack more of a punch.
You also have abilities that remind me of bioshock, but frankly, they're all so useless (freeze an enemy, but it takes so long that you would have killed him anyway, shock an enemy but you have weapons that can do this anyway and so on) I hardly ever used them.

The level design is, as said, mostly linear, but some times you have more open areas and can unlock shortcuts to where you were before.
A breath of fresh air nowadays where every game must be open world. Don't get me wrong, I like open world, but some times simple is better.

Now, wait a second, I hear you say, isn't this tagged open world? Why would you say it isn't?
Yes, yes it is. And it does have an open world in between levels (installations you go to). And that open world is a letdown of collossal magnitude and one of the worst points of the game.
You see, the open world would have been pretty good actually. Farms, houses, many things to explore, an area that is large enough, even cars to drive to get around it. But if the only problems were that the cars have no weight so any bump and you roll 10 times, that would be great. The problem is that this open world has infinite respawning enemies. And they respawn fast. So fast in fact, if you even wanted to clear a small area, by the time you killed the last bot the first one will be back. And the cameras, which will sound an alarm and summon more bots. You can, through some special actions, make all enemies turn offline in an area, but only for a rather short while. It would have been better if the default respawning would have been set to 5 minutes and the aforementioned method would not deactivate all bots but just disable respawning - indefinitely, but reversably.
Why? Because as the open world is, you will try to strategically move in the beginning, but pretty soon you realize it's just not worth it, you won't get through without level 2 alarm which means you can only flee - so you just don't bother any more, sprint/drive past all bots, not caring if a camera sees you, and go to the entry door of the next level. Essentially reducting the open world into just a traversal zone where you won't bother exploring anything - which is why I wouldn't call this an open world game. The open world is not open when you just go in a straight line from point A to point B, and, sure, you don't have to, but anything else is extremely frustrating by design. It's like a roadblock out of lego and you're bare footed. Sure, you can go through it, but why the heck would you?

There's also the bugs. I didn't have that many, only one CTD (then I upgraded my drivers and didn't have any no more) but some jankiness best described as bethesdaesque. Cars that fly through the air if they're on their head and you run into them, rebuilding effects that never go away, random slowdowns with certain item interactions, stuff like this.

It had a mediocre story, shallow characters, cartoon critic of capitalism and soviet communism. The glove script is the least boring of them all. Some plot twists in the end were interesting, but without depth of characters and critics, and without the ability to make choices from it, it's of no consequence. Basically a segue of the next iteration, which I'll not be buying anyway.

Some interesting fight mechanics, but the weapon/glove combos don't have synergy. Weapon upgrades don't seem to do anything, very few change how you use the weapon. Upgrades to the glove are basic linear progression of stats/reach. The only good part of the crafting system is that you recover 100% of the materials on re-spec at no cost, so you can experiment.

Traversing the world is either boring (hiding and collecting crap) or intense respawn (ridiculous boss fights) which reminds me of Mega Drive games. There's a hint of Borderlands on the boss fights, gates lock behind you for no reason, but it's less funny. 

Picking enemies one by one in remote areas is easy and boring. Skipping areas (""stealth"") means you don't get the materials you need to upgrade stuff, so there's no upside. 

Enemies either see you and don't stop, or they don't see you at all, there's no search, no hiding, no luring. But if the alarm level raises too much, you're practically dead, respawn, start again.",1694877632,1694877632,False,6,0,0.52822577953338623,0,True,False,False

- No fast travel, not overly annoying walking/driving but pointless for sure

- occasional bugs glitches (nothing really game breaking)

[/list]

The game splits your time between inside and outside areas, with inside being story driven and the outside being an open playground for you to fight indefinitely and explore. This is one of my main complaints about the game, as the outside is rather obnoxious early in the game because you are too weak to fight and the game demands that you stealth around, which is tedious. Enemies are infinite on the outside and it can border on tiresome. 

It takes about 6-8 hours before you feel like you are fully engaged with the game and its mechanics, but it only takes 20-22 hours to complete the main story; so in effect almost half of the game is spent in a bit of tedium in the beginning stages. Also the first couple of hours your character is on rails with every vehicle they touch getting destroyed. You lack agency in the beginning and you're sort of just on a ride. If you can get past that, however, there is fun ahead. 

There's some side content that is accessible only from the open-worldish outside area, however, the game does nothing to tell you about these areas? Making it extremely easy to skip over content. I wish they had forced the player to engage with one of the ""polygons"" as they are called, to inform the player that there is content beyond the main story mission. 

Despite its small shortcomings, Atomic Heart is a good shooter with a unique and believable artistic core. If you liked BioShock or even DOOM, there's something here for you.",1694370064,1694370064,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story might be possible to predict at some points, maybe it is also short... That's my opinion though.
Anyways, I have played the game before on Xbox Game Pass and yesterday I have decided to buy it here on Steam. 

Last time I played this game I have encountered a few bugs, but now, after all the patches. Still waiting to find anything.
The game has a hot soundtrack, had to set one of them as my wake up alarm :D

I am on my second playthrough and it feels like I am playing it for the first time again.

Also, don't let any stupid thing ruin the game for you, do not be one of the ""Nah, Russian game, definitely pro-war.""  people.

I want to like this game, I love the art direction and setting. The world does feel as lived in as a game world can
Though once you push past the first tutorial area you're left with a game that feels massively under baked for  something also trying at the ""open world"" exploration, the only waypoints are the story beats(which wouldn't be bad if you could *also* pin your own like most other generic open world games) 
It honestly feels at ends with itself. 

And like I mentioned earlier the story falls off so quick, and no amount of self referential character dialogue and Easter eggs hides the large failings going on. I won't go into spoilers for those still wishing to play but I honestly can't suggest it on anything but for sale at whatever half or more the retail price in your area
At the time of writing I beat this in about 7-8 hours which I wouldn't mind if it felt more complete or at least more gripping in story. I'm sure more folks who get to the end will have complaints on the expected ""canon"" ending. which again I wouldn't mind if it felt more complete

It truthfully feels like that rising trend in movies where they leave everything to the next one in hope you'll blindly take it in because of the pomp and flash

TLDR; robot game has no real choices for you to make and is a 50% finished game, though Gamers™️ will say its 11/10 because of robot twin wife. So get it on sale or go image search the twins for the same effect.

DLC update:

I have not bought the dlc but have watched a friend play through it, start to finish. and to cut to the chase if you want a ending that is ""considered"" cannon you will have to pay $10(or equivalent from usd) for that ending and a section of the map to be added.

Scummy nickel & diming of the fanbase the company is trying to build. This could have been a free addon to help for the game's halfbaked state at launch.

The art and graphics in Atomic Heart are truly outstanding, immersing me in a vivid atmosphere right from the Prologue. From time to time, I can't help but pause and marvel at the intricate details that bring the game's world to life. Every corner of the environment exudes quality, making it a visual treat for me.

Despite an impressive introduction, the gameplay doesn't quite meet my expectations. One notable issue is the difficulty settings, which seem unbalanced. The ""Peaceful Atom"" setting is excessively easy, while ""Local Failure"" proves to be surprisingly challenging. Adding a couple of intermediate difficulty options could help bridge this gap and cater to players with varying skill levels.

Although marketed as an action game, adrenaline-fueled moments are few and far between. I've found myself spending most of their time exploring facilities, solving puzzles, and scavenging for materials. The prominence of puzzles detracts from the action, which is quite disappointing for me to seeking a more action-heavy experience.

As an open-world game, Atomic Heart also falls short for avid explorers. There are no side quests or living NPCs to interact with, and random events are nonexistent. Apart from the main quest, the only objectives are the Polygon underground facilities. The absence of NPCs and random events renders the game world lifeless and uninteresting. Moreover, the infinitely spawning repair drones in the open world are irksome, making exploration a frustrating endeavor.

Although Atomic Heart introduces stealth early on, it is poorly executed. The level design often hinders the stealthy playstyle, and the enemies' heightened mobility and awareness render stealth kills near impossible. The lack of auto-lock on enemies is another source of frustration, particularly for me using only controller. [strike]Coupled with an unchangeable FOV, combat can feel sluggish and clunky[/strike]. I highly recommended to use a mouse and keyboard for a smoother combat experience, especially when wielding rifles.

If you're seeking an open-world game with a plethora of activities, side quests, and thrilling moments, Atomic Heart may not be the ideal choice. In conclusion, Atomic Heart earns a respectable 7.5/10 rating from me. However, considering its current state and the standard set by other games in the market, it is difficult to recommend it wholeheartedly.",1676992603,1694104640,False,15,6,0.52918773889541626,0,True,False,False

  It has moments where it is super fun. Unfortunately it seems to me that at some point during the development of this game they decided to do a massive overhaul and it just feels like at least 50% of the game got cut out. 

  Some enemy types and weapons from the older trailers only make appearances as background pieces and you can complete the game without using a single shotgun shell, pistol bullet, or rifle ammo with enough patience and management of the energy weapons and melee combat.
  They should have done the main game the same way they did the DLC. Rather then make energy weapons a primary weapon of their own, they should have placed an energy secondary fire on some weapons, which consumes more energy for less DPS or increases the DPS with the ammo you are already shooting.

  In many moments the game feels super easy and some of the bosses are barely a challenge on the hardest difficulty and I even had my Belyash boss fight glitch out and they kept trying to run into a pillar in the back. 
  Another problem with bosses, is this game recycles them WAY too often, they reuse that dumb red plant Plyusch boss at least 5 times and the Annihilation instinct DLC re-uses the ""Colossus BEA-D"" boss twice, which is a shame because it was a fun boss fight the first time but not so much the second.

_____SPOILERS______

  Without the Annihilation instinct DLC, the story just abruptly ends with you either choosing to attack Dr. Sechenov. Which then leads to CHARLES tricking you and taking over the Kollectiv project to eliminate humanity, which we never get to take part in. Or you decide to ignore the entire situation with Granny Zina, CHARLES, and Dr. Sechenov, In which your character rips CHARLES out of the Glove and storms off.
  
  The Annihilation instinct DLC takes place in the timeline where P-3 decides to storm away from the situation with Zina, CHARLES, and Sechenov, and it makes it lot less of an engaging story-line then a follow up on the ending where P-3 attacks Sechenov. 
  The DLC also ends with some loose threads as once P-3 Reprograms NORA, he asks Sechenov for a permanent vacation and all the Data on P-3's past. He then flies off into the sunset with an angry and murderous Granny Zina chasing after him.",1694039219,1694039219,False,9,0,0.559668421745300293,0,True,False,False

I took a year off from gaming to do some life stuff, and I was excited to come back and play this game. In the time between my following and buying the game, it seems like they got a publisher who made a lot of decisions for them…

To say that the publisher “screwed the pooch” would be a little too nice when they really just butt-raped the poodle. 

It’s SO BORING. The game knows it’s a boring game. It’s interesting for just. A little over two hours: enough time to revoke your refund options. 

 The art is nice, the concepts are kind of cool. The setting and the ideas all behind it should be more interesting…. But the whole game follows this formula over and over again: 
>go in room:
 protagonist “woooaaahhhhh robots doing things they shouldn’t!”

>puzzle: 
Protagonist: “wow these puzzles sure are fucking boring. Can’t we just skip them?”
Glove: “sorry, but the higher ups said we gotta put stupid fucking puzzles in the game. It’s a tradition”

>walk into a convenient cubicle with a few dead bodies, maybe a talking corps or audio-recording, and 5 minutes worth of time wasting to suck up all the junk you might need to upgrade weapons. Also has a lore-computer half the time. 

>save game
Upgrade bot: “hey sugar, I’m horny!”

Repeat a few times and then give you a teaspoon of plot relevance.


I will say that the lore (which you need to go out of your way to read, which is good or bad depending on your attention span) is deep, interesting, kind of nice but totally optional.  

The game you should buy instead of this one is the SystemShock 2 reboot. It does everything this game does, except good.

Positives:
+ Great concept
+ Great atmosphere
+ Interesting story
+ Variety of enemies - awesome boss fights
+ Variety of weapons
+ Some interesting mechanics I haven't come across yet - E.g. you can transfer your items into your stash whenever you want (but not the other way around). This happens automatically when your inventory is full so you don't have to worry about it that much.

Negatives:
- Too many riddles - You need to solve riddles to get weapons upgrades and like that wasn't enough, there are tons of them in the main story.
- Unclear tutorials - I've had some issues with upgrading weapons. You need to find the upgrades first. There are more possibilities and whenever you install new one or just scrap the weapon, your resources are 100% refunded. Oh and you can drive a car...I realised that almost at the end. 
- Bad voice acting of the main character - You can't feel the emotion most of the time.

And I was absolutely blown away. I didn't put it down til I beat it. It is a phenomenal game. After I finished it on the subscription service, I went and bought it here. It's so incredibly fun, it's like a prettier, more action-ey less ""horror""-ey bioshock with very fun engaging combat. The story is a tad predictable, but what matters is that the game is *fun*. Beyond the game being fun, the soundtrack is an absolute BANGER. The heavier tracks that seamlessly blend in from softer versions of themselves make you feel like an absolute badass while you're swinging your melee weapon at creepy expressionless mustachioed robots or headless bleeding zombies. I honestly can't get enough. 

I'm a sucker for a few genres, so really the only thing I think would make this game better is being more RPG and adding co-op. If I remember correctly, early on, co-op was talked about, but didn't make it in. Here's hoping for Atomic Heart 2!",1693275518,1693275518,True,1,0,0.442028999328613281,0,True,False,False

I don't spend what little free time I have with them so that I can dwell on real world events - so let me start by saying my review is apolitical. It's my take on Atomic Heart for its merits and faults as a videogame, and ONLY as a videogame.

With that out of the way, let me tell you - this game is an absolute blast, especially considering it was Mundfish's first attempt at a game.

In no particular order, some good things about Atomic Heart:
- Graphically, the game is stunning and quite well optimized for PC;
- World building is very detailed and really paints a picture of how a retro-futuristic soviet union might be like;
- Sound design really meshes with the world it was built for;
- The soundtrack in particular is a banger and had me listening to several songs for days;
- Gameplay is tight - perhaps a bit simple once you figure out the mechanics, but there are enough weapons and powers to keep things fresh and interesting; 
- Bosses are all fun to do combat with and well put together;
- The main character is a douche, yes - but he owns it and by the end of the story you can mostly empathize with why he acts the way he acts. He has a very stupid catch phrase, but even that is explained in-game if you pay attention;
- Exploration is more often than not rewarded.

Some less positive things:
- Enemy variety is limited - you'll have seen most of the fodder-type enemies by about one third of your adventure;
- The story skips a few beats and feels a bit disjointed sometimes - but most main characters (and a few secondary ones like NORA) are memorable and interesting;
- The DLC story in particular felt a bit rushed, and the DLC as a whole is quite short;
- The open world can be scary at first due to the infinitely respawnable bots - but it takes like 20 minutes to figure out the rules of the game and how to circumvent this.

In the end it took me 28h to finish a run, 6 more to do a New Game Plus and wrap up achievements, and 4 more for the DLC. I had fun the entire time, and there were sexy robot twins - can I really ask more of a videogame?",1693265685,1693265685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amazing game with an amazing story, which I got caught up to really quick.
With downsides but the story(telling), the music and the design are monolits in this comparsion.

Positives:
- Graphics, STUNNING this game looks SO good
- Story, very catching and exiting
- Design overall, brings very fresh ideas into the gaming industry i rly enjoyed that
- Enemys are rly scary
- Setting, rly dystopian and scary, I love it
- Most puzzles bring in some new ideas but they CAN get annyoing sometimes
- This game will supprize you quite a lot
- I love the overwhelming flood of new ideas this game brings, with its own universe
- A lot of citique for communism and capitalism
- I love the hidden conversations within the computers + bonus lore, they made what Fallout wanted just a lot better
- The soundtrack is amazing, fits very good in all scenes
- You can reskill and rebuild every weapon for free, the game even motivates you to try everything 
- I´ve never got hardstuck even if I got stuck in the tinyest corner, I could always escape

Neggis:
- Gameplay can get quite repetetive
- Testing grounds don´t tell too much of an story, lost potential
- Holosights a quite useless, they lower your visibilty quite a bit
- Thermals are just a bit better, ironsights whould be probably your way to go
- Recycled doll models and dead russians everywhere, sadly
- You can´t get back in the first village
- Potentially a lot to explore but respawning robots make this rly annoying
- Some bugs here and there which get you out of the immersion sometimes and even can be gamebreaking sometimes like if you destroy a ballon it can happen, that the robots won´t repair it, so you cannot enter the facility anymore (dunno if they fixed it yet)
- There is an option missing to rehear the audio records, which is rly annyoing, because sometimes conversations overlayer the audio of them + it whould be nice if there was an overview how many you´ve collected and missed
- Fix points on which conversations start exist, which end the previos conversation immidiatly, forcing you to stand around listening to those instead of playing the game, very annoying
- Ressources are quite grindy to get and if you´ve grinded all testing grounds and a lot of hidden stuff it whould barely be enough to upgrade the equipment you´re usually using
- DO NOT DISASSAMBLE YOUR SHOTGUN, you won´t be able to craft it at all
- The bagpack feels too small, atleast to me but i guess this is for balancing reasons
- There is an hidden weapon limit, you can carry as many weapons as your backpack can handle but if all quickslots are aquired you can´t swap the quickslot to an other weapon in your backpack for some reason, maybe I was lost idk
- A lot of things from the old trailers got left behind, which i rly miss here and there
- You won´t be able to fight ALL the robo-types you´ll see

Over all:
I love this game. I´ve spend a lot of time in it trying to explore every bit of it. I´m looking forward for more such games.
If mundfish continues the good work and get rid of some of the annyoing neggis, they could be an amazing dev studio.",1693241195,1693244992,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good Stuff:
-Game Gave me lots of Half life 1 vibes because of the way the story slowly unfolds + the mutant enemies
-same for Bioshock vibes for the story + gameplay : Mudfish is obviously inspired by it
-Great Universe
-right amount of challenge difficulty for the ""normal"" mode , you will struggle in the beginning but you will slowly ""get it"" and play better and better thanks to getting some muscle memory + upgrades you get in game : satisfying
-took me 25h to finish the game: this includes a lot of deaths in the beginning, a good part of exploring and lots of looting. i only ""rushed"" towards the next ""checkpoint"" a couple times because i knew id be overwhelmed by the amount of enemies ill have to fight.
-took me an extra 30 hours to polish the test zones to have a better set of weapons for the New Game + and finish it also (armageddon difficulty)

Playing in the original Russian audio With subtitles is great, however i suggest you to complete the plot a first time in your native language because a lot of the plot is delivered while in combat, it gets pretty difficult to follow subtitles/plot and stay focused in combat

Disliked (nitpicks):
-when you try to be adventurous and go ""away""from the path the game tries hard to make you return to the story
-if you encounter a boss fight (usually a Pluysh) in the open world mode, if you manage to flee, the boss music and it's health bar will remain until you reload the game.
-the game completely omits explaining you some game mechanics such as the gun special cartridges
-fighting mutants can sometimes be very grinding until you get rid of all ""mothers"" while fully in action.
-last part of the story (even if satisfying) feels a bit rushed 

DLC:
I played the 1.9Version:
the dlc was very fun to play, the new two weapons are awesome
however the normal mode felt like Armageddon mode at some moments of the game, specially when you are still using a very very basic weapon and crowds of robots hitting you.
one glitch during a puzzle, and to not spoil and no pun intended, one of the blue balls just disappeared/fell through the map, so i only had 3/4 blue balls, and the puzzle was not solvable, i had to reload the game to have it back.",1678711185,1693240890,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The story is excellent, well written and the voice acting is well done. The game is also visually stunning and has a definite style about it. The story and gameplay borrows heavily from the Bioshock series and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The combat is fluid, albeit slow (more on that later) and the guns are great to shoot. 
The Bad:
The game is absolutely ruined by the looting mechanic. You are ENDLESSLY looting for items and blueprints to make weapons, to craft ammunition and to upgrade your health and abilities. This turned a fast paced scifi horror shooter, with great visuals and story into a tedious chore. As for the combat, the character moves like he's a 500lb gorilla and the robots can be easily dodged in most instances making combat another annoying thing you have to put up with rather than enjoying the character and his abilities you've gained.

The gameplay is decent, it’s a solid FPS with good mechanics…no more, no less. The music and sound tracking work is also very good. The fridge thing was also kind of funny.

While I’m not really privy to the ongoing discussion as to what this game is or isn’t- at least where art style and synthesis is concerned I’d classify it as “beautiful"".

It’s far more a deconstruction of nationalistic propaganda (and yeah, every nation does it) than a propaganda piece. While humorous in it’s own right, it doesn’t have near the teeth as something like say “Wag the Dogs” or...well, I’m loathe to bring the British up at all- but they too excel at bleak humor.

So I mean, Maxim Gorky’s relationship with Lenin might be considered controversial in the context of subduing the nation's Intelligentsia during the time period...this game really isn’t. Just avoid the pious, misinformed mob at all costs if possible. 

It’s like a kaleidoscope of old school world fair style art and future tech combined with a bunch of 50-70s soviet movie art poster styles (which are excellent in their own right).",1692813167,1692813394,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

1. Длинные разговоры, но маленькие зоны диалога. ( То есть, есть комната маленькая, и начинается разговор, которая идет 5 мин, выходишь за рамки комнаты, и начинается катсцена или другой диалог. Из-за этого пропускаешь сюжетные вещи, которые могут быть важны.)
2. Слишком много чтива. ( Проще рассказать, как я проходил игру. Сначала, где-то до 3 часа игры я все читал, но потом понял, что что-то скучненько и потом просто скипал, если нет чего-то интересного.) [По моей тупости, думая, что придется выходить на другой экран слушать шкатулки, их скипнул, хотя их можно слушать во время ходьбы.]

Ну а теперь плюсы:
1. Близняшки!  (Как тут не сказать про них.  Когда Запад боится XXXXуализировать девушек, разрабы наоборот все сделали правильно. Даже катсцены, где показывали их, были восхитительны.)
2. Боевка. (Сначала мне казалось, что она какая-то медленная что-ли, а, когда потом на нас скинули кучу врагов, она стала интереснее из-за Оружия, которая могут быть разным в исполнении, Способностей, которые спасают или обезвреживают врагов на время.)
3. Диалоги. ( Интересно было слушать диалоги Нечаева с ХРАЗом, как [spoiler] даже он своими словами отводил от себя глаза гг на его дальнейшее предательство [/spoiler], так и наверно всем знакомой Элеонорой и её похотливыми тентаклями. Ах, полюбилась же мне эта Госпожа. Ну и как тут еще не вспомнить про Бабку Зину и ее чудесную избушку. Если кратко рассказывать, я так давно не ржал в игре, да и уют чувствовал, вспоминая свою Бабушку. Эх... Скучаю по тем временам...)
Если не проходили первое ДЛС , то не читать.
4. [spoiler] Гусь. ( Бл*** Гусь говорящий со сборником мемов. Я в эти моменты просто зауважал разрабов так, что... Так-с продолжение додумывайте сами.  )[/spoiler]

Ну итог: если мы ставим по 10 бальной шкале, то я поставил бы 9/10. Единицу снял из-за минусов. Ну а так, то Спасибо разрабом за великолепное времяпровождения в этой игре. Жду Следующего DLC :D

Один момент по сюжету, который можете подправить в комментах.
[spoiler] Как я понял сюжет ДЛС будет проходить после не той плохой концовки, где ХРАЗ убивает Сеченова, а где Нечаев рассекретил ХРАЗ? Просто я не понял, а что истинный канон. [/spoiler]

The only actual complaint is that the way character momentum and air strafing work doesn't mesh well with the amount of platforming puzzles there are, which caused more frustration than difficulty after missing platforms by a hairs breadth because I misjudged something or another.

The gameplay is fast paced and hectic (not in a weird glitchy, buggy way) at times, which can be very fun and engaging. Switching up your powers to figure out how you want to combo them and your weapons together can be pretty fun, and you don't have to worry about a level cap either. You keep earning the materials and whatnot that you need to unlock your abilities constantly, so long as you're putting down enemies. The only time that the gameplay gets frustrating and pisses people off is when you get to the outside area and have to constantly fight enemies that you just beat a moment ago (and that those same enemies you just beat and got repaired don't give you anymore loot). Its not really that big of a deal though, and there are ways you can stop them from respawning, but you won't figure that out without looking them up most likely. The theme is awesome, I love the fallout/bioshock vibes I get from the game, the atmosphere and graphical representations are phenomenal. I only have one graphical gripe, and that has to do with the Jelly man looking like some weird CGI from the late 1990's to early 2000's. Well that and that we were told via P-3's dialogue that Larisa was rather pretty, and I gotta disagree. Above all though, I'm in love with the music. Right after I get done with this review, I'm buying the soundtrack, which is something I never do no matter how much I love a game. I love how the combat music actually sounds like it's trying to get your adrenaline pumping and pairs with the more difficult encounters perfectly. They really knew what they were doing when it came to music, even more so than gameplay, honest opinion. The story was also pretty sweet. I had a general idea where it was going, and then every once in awhile it'd throw a curve ball. Final gripe though, I didn't really care for the ending. I get that they were probably setting up for Atomic Heart 2, but the fact that there are two endings that pretty much result in the same thing with slight differences, and that thing is kinda shitty... Did not like that. All in all though, really solid game. I just wish I had known that I can play the game in the Russian language with English subtitles before I beat the whole damn thing.

This game is definitely not a traditional open world game and really strives when you play it linearly, however if you do go around and complete all of the polygons or more traditionally known as dungeons where you can find weapon upgrades, you might start to hate the game as they are very repetitive. When this game is played in a normal linear format along with the story it really shines and the story is just amazing with so many twists and turns that will leave you baffled.

There's also plenty to explore and lots of messages/lore to discover and help you uncover more about the world.

It would be probably better if player upgraded just the golve and kept all the weapons and weapon parts as things to find and pickup, without needing to vacuum everything everywhere.

 If it was more linear, kept more within the interesting industrial labs and locations, keeping those more handcrafted sections more together and consistent, it would be a lot better experience. But like this it looks very patted out - made to waste players time and I hate that.

I liked Bioshock series itself, but completely dodged Dishonored. And if the first one was intriguing enough for me to accept the inconveniently slow pace of the beginning, the second one’s story was just not for me. This recipe applies to The Atomic Heart as well.

[b]The Story:[/b] Retro futuristic Soviet entourage is something fresh and creators did a good job to make it up with posters, music, and lore writing. You are actually buying this.

And if the story itself you saw millions of times before - father-son dilemma [Fallout 4], ""would you kindly"" moments [BioShock], and accident caused by an idiot [Half-Life] – the entourage is making it fun and smooths sharp edges.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Usually a very slow pace in the beginning of the game and I like that they didn’t try to entertain too much with stealth. “Magic” hand works nicely, but actual shooting and situations around it could designed better.

[b]Meh Point #1:[/b] Open areas and resurrection of enemies there. Kill the enemy, caught by camera, the enemy will be there in 10 seconds again. This is the most stupid idea I saw.

[b]Meh Point #2:[/b] Puzzles, all sorts of. If you are old enough, you will remember Bioshock was full of it. But these games were made 10-15 years ago, this approach doesn’t fit properly these days.

[b]Meh Point #3:[/b]  Fighting mostly robots and not humans. I think many people will find it more fun dealing with humans-like. [spoiler]Or maybe I am just a sick bastard.[/spoiler]

But all these things I made myself accept to finish the story and I really loved its canonical version. It outlines a nice thought: [spoiler]you may think there are two sides trying to screw each other, but in reality, there is third one, which will screw everyone, and perhaps you are not the smartest person in the room to make a choice.[/spoiler] Loved it.

Atomic Heart is a mashup blast from the alternate future past that will get you hooked once you get the main story rolling along.

[h1] The Good :[/h1]
1. Marvelous Art design and Style.
2. Excellent soundtrack and sound design.(From Mick Gordon composition to 80's soviet 
   songs, all bangers!)
3. Beautiful animations both 3D and 2D.
4. Heart pounding gameplay consist of Doom(2016) combat and Bioshock, Prey RPG-lite 
   elements.
5. Open world design like Far Cry+Far Cry 2.
6. Story inspired by Bioshock and Half-Life.
7. There's dungeons to explore.
8. Great overall pacing, not really any fillers.
9. Great overall length. (approximate 14-16 hours.)
10. Three endings.
11. A clever and thoughtful NEW GAME PLUS mode makes you want to revisit the place.
12. Great PC optimization.
13. Multi language voice overs, including Chinese!
14. Voice overs and subtitle language can be adjust individually. (I play with Chinese VO and 
      English sub)
15. Clever lines and scenario that makes you laugh out loud. (Kudos to the Chinese voice
      actors :D)
16. You can watch whole episode of 80s soviet cartoon ""Nu Pogadi"" inside the game. :D
17. High production values.
18. Sexy and horny robots. 
19. Do I mention the sexy and horny robots?

[h1] The Bad :[/h1]
1. Unlikable protagonist. (Grumpy all the time and really lack any redeemable personality.)
2. Convoluting plot that feels too try-hard and has some plot hole. 
3. Some enemy design are kind of annoying. 
4. Open world feels life-less like in Far Cry 2.
5. Stealth mechanism is useless to near non existence.
6. Enemy respawn way too fast. (Even Far Cry 2 blush it face.)

[h1] The ""so-so"" :[/h1]
1. Some characters are not likable for me, like the female doctor with purple hair.
2. No environment kills like in Bioshcok. (ie. No electrify waters, set fire on old puddles...etc)
2. Could add more depths to the polymer abilities not making it a simple cooldown skill.
3. Could add some deadly physic objects. (Why there's no explosion barrels when you 
    have a gravity-gunish glove, come on Mundfish!)
4. Could add some physic base puzzles. (Hello, you have a gravity-gunish glove, Mundfish!)
5. Too many puzzle-base door locks that could piss off some players.
6. No Ray-Tracing graphic option at this moment.
7. Some voice over could be less convicing and somewhat annoying. (Like the English VO)

[h1]Final Verdict :

 [b] 8/10. ( 9/10 if you are Bioshock or Prey fans.)

A flawed but marvelous work with a lot of potential. Bravo and keep up the good work, Mundfish! [/b] [/h1]

2. 情節錯綜複雜，感覺太費力，有一些情節漏洞。

[h1]“馬馬虎虎”：[/h1]
1. 有些角色我不太喜歡，比如紫髮女醫生。
2. 沒有像《生化奇兵》這樣的環境擊殺。 （像: 使水域通電，使油漬燃燒起來...等。）
2. 可以為聚合物能力添加更多深度, 不要只像簡單的冷卻技能。
3. 可以添加一些致命環境物體。 （為什麼當你戴著重力槍手套時卻沒有爆炸桶可用，搞甚麼 Mundfish！）
4. 可以添加一些物理類型謎題。 （靠北，你有重力槍手套耶，Mundfish！）
5. 太多的謎題門鎖可能會激怒一些玩家。
6. 目前沒有光線追踪圖形選項。
7. 有些配音可能不太令人信服，而且有些煩人。 （如英文配音）

[h1]最終分數：

 [b] 8/10。 （9/10 如果你是《生化奇兵》或《獵魂》粉絲。）

一部有缺陷但精彩的作品，具有很大的潛力。再接再厲，Mundfish！ [/b][/h1]",1691665232,1691777258,True,1,0,0.481481492519378662,0,True,False,False

As a big corpo developer myself I know how the roadmap can change throughout the dev cycle(s), but what this game lacked was the feeling. It was just boring.
I tried to go exploring and not just do the main quest line but everything between the testing grounds were just empty.
I've finished the game once and gone back to mop up most of the update chests in ~27 hours. I expected more to be honest.
Oh well, perhaps I'll come back to the game at some point in the future but after posting this I'm uninstalling the game hoping Stalker 2 (if and when it'll eventually release? I remember how long time we waited for the first Stalker game...) can fill the void of exciting post Soviet Union area games that often feels so different from the usual western style games, like the Metro games! Atomic Heart should've been one of the best and coolest ones in that bunch but it failed IMHO to deliver on almost every front. Such a shame.
Many seems to like the game though so take my review for what it is. Everyone is different but I was disappointed and this is my honest, and short, review without spoiling any of its contents.

Beautiful graphics with seemingly impossible optimization, getting upwards of 120 fps on an RX 580.

Melee is impactful and fun, you might think the amount of melee weapons is just fluff but they all feel fairly distinct and have unique alt-attacks.

Guns have satisfying animations and can be very powerful when used properly, such as specializing the AK into organic damage and popping heads with it.

TLDR: Get the game on a discount, and if you have any sort of experience in FPS/action games, the highest difficulty will likely be a walk in the park. Play it all through over a long weekend, then move onto another game

So, I finished the main game today, and I had no spoilers coming into it expect big booba robots. Honestly, I felt very underwhelmed at points of the story. There was times where you were just walking around, picking stuff up, doing what feels like chores to go further in the game with little to no story progress (minor spoiler, but you have to go around a facility and put together a robot. It take an hour or two, you get introduced to a couple new enemies, but it felt pointless by the time you finished everything).

At the beginning, it took a while to get used to the mechanics, but after about 30 mins you understand to just dodge and hit, then repeat that process. I got to a point where I got one melee (Pashtet) semi early on and you can use it pretty much till the end of the game with ease.

SPOILERS: The final battle with the Twins was a joke. I died one time, one of the deaths that I could count on my two hands during the entire playthrough. Using the Pashtet, shield, and frost, you can walk through this battle with ease on the hardest difficulty. I'm ultimately very disappointed that the lead up to this battle which is expected to be a complete beatdown was, well, boring. Same attack which were easy to learn to dodge, and was basically an endurance test oif how well you managed health and how quickly you pressed the shift key.

All in all, wait for the game to go on sale then pick it up. Play it over a free weekend and maybe the next, enjoy the short parts of the story while it's there, and play the DLCs if you really fancy but they're optional.

It takes puzzles from other games to add to it's runtime, including Snake, Labyrinth, Color-Matching Lasers, and the worst version of the Skyrim lock-picking mechanic I've seen yet.

Mundfish has crafted a breathtakingly immersive experience that seamlessly blends Soviet-era aesthetics with science fiction and horror elements. From the moment players step foot into this mysterious alternate reality, they are captivated by its hauntingly beautiful and deeply atmospheric setting.

The game's visual design is nothing short of awe-inspiring. The attention to detail in recreating the retro-futuristic landscapes is breathtaking, with vibrant colors contrasting against the eerie and desolate surroundings. Every corner of this dystopian realm holds secrets and hidden passages, beckoning players to explore further and uncover its enigmatic lore.

The gameplay mechanics in Atomic Heart are equally impressive. The protagonist's arsenal of unconventional weapons and ingenious gadgets deliver a refreshing and diverse combat experience. Each encounter is both thrilling and challenging, requiring strategic thinking and precision. From intense battles against terrifying enemies to confronting formidable bosses, the combat keeps players on the edge of their seats throughout the game.

One of the standout aspects of Atomic Heart is its compelling narrative. The story unfolds in a complex and mysterious manner, taking unexpected twists and turns that keep players guessing. The protagonist's journey through the strange and surreal world is accompanied by well-crafted dialogues and memorable characters that add depth and emotion to the unfolding tale. However, at times, the narrative can be slightly convoluted, leaving players longing for more clarity and cohesion.

Atomic Heart's atmospheric sound design further enhances the immersive experience. From hauntingly beautiful melodies to bone-chilling sound effects, the audio complements the visual splendor, making for an unforgettable journey through this enigmatic abyss.

Although a few minor technical issues and optimization glitches exist, they are easily overshadowed by the game's overall brilliance. Mundfish's dedication to constant updates and improvements demonstrates their commitment to delivering a top-tier gaming experience.

In conclusion, Atomic Heart is an unparalleled gem in the gaming landscape. Its unique setting, impressive visuals, and engaging gameplay mechanics offer a mesmerizing journey that will linger in players' minds long after the credits roll. While a more coherent narrative and some technical refinements could elevate it even further, Atomic Heart is an absolute must-play for anyone seeking an unforgettable adventure through the surreal and enigmatic depths of an alternate universe.

You can tell it was a labor of love and not a mindless cash-grab like many other games getting released nowadays. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for a game unlike any other.

The good:
- The visuals are insane. I found myself many times stopping to just admire the world around me. The scenery, architecture, art, and world building are some of the most passionate and unique I have ever seen in a video game. You can tell they had a clear vision in mind when developing this game and absolutely nailed it
- The gun play feels (and looks) great. Melee hits are extremely satisfying and create a ""song-and-dance"" feel when mixed with the dodge/dash mechanic. Guns have good weight to them. Similar to the original Bioshock, upgrading a weapon's statistics/abilities correspond to actual components and parts on the weapons physically changing.
- Music is great. You'll come across music that naturally occurs in the world (i.e. a radio) and be treated to some absolute bangers when entering combat. Some combat encounters even have their own unique soundtracks.
- Graphics are great. Even on the lower end of the graphics settings, the fidelity is still pretty high
- The twins will give you a warm, fuzzy feeling below the waist. My friend compass was pointing up the whole time!

The bad:
- Story is meh. The themes it wishes to address are topical and interesting, but the way in which those themes are explored sometimes falls short
- None of the [u] human[/u] characters were all that interesting or memorable
- Not much build diversity. While there are different weapons and abilities you can use, they don't really change the game play all that much.
- Late game encounters get a little too easy and repetitive once you're all maxed out

I want my time back because:
-quick time events, lots and lots of them
-shit story
-shit voice acting and unbelievable dialogue. People dont talk like this except in russian violence fantasy 
-shit gunplay
-clunky melee & evasion
-way too much inane talking that leads nowhere and gives no real information or immersion
-whiney, thick and idiotic protagonsit that talks smack in a very immature and cringey way
-open world is ugly and horribly implemented, what were they thinking? It really should be taken out of the game. Dont get me started on the repairing enemies in the districts...
-antagonists are uninteresting and very over the top, same for basically everyone you interact with.

The atmosphere and graphics are the best I have seen in a long LONG time.  It is kind of like the product of bioshock and dead space in terms of gameplay, while it is basically the result of alien isolation and fallout as far as environment goes.  The soundtrack is great thanks to Mick Gordon.  I personally recommend this to anybody who likes any of the aforementioned titles, but beware it can get sexual with a minifridge and ballerinas VERY fast.

Pros
It has some good ideas. 
Voice acting is top notch, really some of the best for a shooter.

Cons
Combat feels a little unrewarding as most of the enemies feel like they don't suffer any damage when you hit/shoot them until they die. 
The looting mechanic sounds good but it also leaves a very unsatisfying feeling, a lot of the times I was left wondering if I got everything from the drawers and spent way too much time making sure all drawers were fully opened.
And of course my main gripe with the game. The protagonist and the ""helper"" character. They are both unrelatable assholes. The main guy comes as an arrogant toddler that no need no robot and then at the end it always ends up asking for help.

The second thing is to remove any trailer and showcase of nvidia raytracing this game has been used to promote since its announcement. The game is good looking but you've seen better. Lower your expectations.

Thirdly this game is very fragmented. For example after the first zone I was prepared to quit cause I was mostly fighting melee, and melee is garbage. Then the focus shifts on ranged weapons cause you get more blueprints and more ammo. Open world is a separate game and I suggest you don't bother with it or else it will drag your whole experience down. 

Sadly one thing you cannot escape is the protagonist. Not only is he an idiot and he talks like he's from 2023, but he is CONSTANTLY TALKING. I don't want a silent protagonist but we've had middle ground before. I want him only to observe some stuff and make some remarks, succinctly and when required. As it is now, he talks for an audience, like he wants to brag to us on how cool he is in the face of basically an apocalypse.  This is neither funny nor sincere. I saw bad dialogue in Midnight suns recently but at least they don't try to seem cool.

There are things to praise. The world looks good, The enemies and ""dungeons"" are good, The combat is hit and miss but your millage may vary. Ah, the weapons are a bit too standard for this setting. The music is fine, i mean it's by composer of DOOM but the music here is not as good as the DOOM music, IT IS THE DOOM MUSIC. It's the same kind of soundtrack and as good as it might be in DOOM, here its just not matching the general vibe of the game. It's not off-putting but it's just another missed opportunity. Most of the players may not even remark half the things that are wrong in this game. That's partly why I recommend it. Most of the people will enjoy it. That and because it's basically their debut game. Now they proven they can be trusted with AAA projects so I hope they get a bigger budget and a bigger team and they can do even better the next time.

This is my general opinion, take from it what you will. my overall opinion is at the bottom of the Review

(Edited parts has been edited after DLC-1)

Review:

Combat: [Edited]
Ill say that the combat has been improved since launch, tho still with some hiccups here and there. its begun to feel alot like a Hack-n-Slash game that has guns added for flavor. the combat isnt as bad anymore so, id say its been improved a bit.

Weapons:
as stated above the weapons gets stale after a while, as there aint a ""great"" quantity of weapons to choose from, and most are OK to good at most stuff, but nothing amazing. most require a lot of resources to compete with the others, which i can understand from a RPG perspective, but the amount of resources needed is a bit over the top from what you acquire from playing the game. i see my self as a loot-goblin and tend to search every nook and cranny for loot (which is y it took me nearly 25 hours to complete the game).

Story: [Edited]
The story is relatively well written, with a few hick-ups here and there, but that's to be expected. the dialogue is a bit... dry to say at best, some stuff ain't really explained properly most of the time and doesn't give the fulfilment of completing something
!!SPOILER AHEAD!!
 Now that the first DLC has launched, the second ending makes a lot more sense now, tho not fully explained it has given some insight as to what our dear Comrade Major has been doing after ""excommunicating"" Charles. the other Ending is still as it was, im not overly mad about that one im particular. as it fits into the story very well.
!!END OF SPOILER!!

Upgrades: [Edited]
You can upgrade both your melee weapons, Guns as well as your character. the upgrades for Guns and Melee are much the same, damage, Heavy Attacks, speed as well as some capsule upgrades allowing you to infuse your current attacks with attributes like fire, ice, electric etc.
in terms of Self upgrades, there exists a larger variety than the weapons. you can upgrade your own abilities to match your play-style to a degree. there are the general HP, armour as well as some minor ones like ""laser immunity"" or ""more dodge charges"", your abilities also gets a few upgrades, but ill talk about that in the ""Ability"" section.

Abilities: [Edited]
The games Ability system leave a lot to be desired, even though it has a ""Bioshock/Systemshock"" vibe to its abilities, they feel just like that: ""Bioshock"". this is by no means a negative, as Bioshock is and will always be on my list of favourite games of all time, however that just means that this did nothing new, and just tired to reinvent the wheel, which did not need ""Reinventing""

Map and ascetics: [Edited]
In my opinion the game looks Pretty good, all things considered. The enemies are well designed with attention to detail (in most areas. there are cars in the game, but only 1 red car is actually drive-able, which is a little sad. the Map layout also makes good sense and leads you in a straight path to follow if your B-lining it for the story. the map is not overly big, but has lots of areas to explore and Enemies to slay. there isnt any large scale areas thats ""off limits
 until later"", most is exploitable pretty much the second you reach the ""open-world"" (with a few Story related Dungeons being the only exception)

Enemies: [Edited]
There isnt a vast range of enemies in the game (as of yet). however that does not mean that the enemies arent well designed and thought about. after a few hotfixes for the AIs and the likes, its rather well made and immersive. and do to the resent DLC (DLC-1) a few new enemies has been added, they arent nothing big, but still quite cool.

Opinion: [Added]
I have had to change my Conclusion a bit, as after a few more hours (and alot of Bugfixes) the game has become alot more enjoyable. i will however still say its not worth the Price still (so just wait for it to go on sale). but even now, after completing it a second time (DLC included) i still find myself wondering if a different method could have been used. and heck, its REALLY Immersive when you just run about, smashing bots, freezing goop and just doing general exploration.
i still wish the map was bigger, as it does give a good atmosphere, but also leaves alot to be desired.

Conclusion: [Edited]
Do i suggest buying the game? no, no i dont.
however, if it ever goes on sale, grab it and savor it, as its a great game for ppl like me who loves Bioshock.

Hitboxes, platforming, movement, combat as a whole from animations, hitboxes, QTE strings and animations taking WAY TOO FRIGGING LONG with certain enemies that go from being boss fights to mini boss mobs where you fight multiple of them or run away. But you don't want to run away because killing them nets you massive rare rewards constantly. (you'll know which ones I'm talking about if you played enough of the game and got far enough), mechanics, every enemy in the game being massively spongy even with all of the abilities and weapons and their upgrades, getting caught on literally everything in an room that has a lot of obstacles around while I'm trying not to die in combat, etc. Just getting around the myriad of puzzles, mazes, puzzle mazes feel entirely unintuitive. The bosses had tendencies to just break entirely and loop around in a circle or in place or just stand there until they die. The game as a whole feels relatively unresponsive. 

The open world is an absolute nightmare. The game - upon reaching the start of the open world portion - intends to imply the players to stealth around everywhere and fails miserably at it. Instead it demands it due to how if you get into a fight in the open world, you're fighting an army that never dies due to health inflation and body numbers while getting sniped by radar alarms everywhere. The problem with this is, it's impossible to stealth because of how literally anything that you can see from most ranges can see you and YOU WILL BE SEEN and your only choices are to fight or run from every little thing possible. If only running away didn't cause more problems than it solves.

The whole Bioshock and Prey/whatever you want to compare this to that clearly took heavy inspiration from started off very strong and then you can tell the overall quality of the world around you and the views you see gradually deteriorates. Conversational cutscenes bug out and either certain audio actions in the cutscenes will desync or conversations between characters mid cutscene will desync and give you awkward back and forths. 

It feels as though they ran out of budget the moment they reached the open world portion and then everything else after it feels VERY amateur indie with more resources than they know what to do with and less of a deadline. Considering the utter state of the game being a relatively unplayable disaster that was too busted in general gameplay to actually play, this doesn't surprise me. Especially the current random Unreal Engine crashes mid fight with a lot of enemies at the same time. This is prone to happen on the bridge when finishing up the open world portion. 

This game is filled with ""good on paper, horrible execution"". It's practically the entire game. There are so many little, mildly frustrating to infuriating issues the game has that they all pile up so much that they collectively become a big problem everywhere in the game and at all times. A lot of great or interesting ideas that were just flat out poorly executed and designed. Almost feels Monkey Pawed because they don't commit to idea concepts and improve upon them and instead, will make them more tedious, annoying and more of a thing to waste the player's time. The biggest insult is giving us timed dialogue choices that don't actually matter except for the very last choice in the game and even then, the outcome of those choices both suck. So it doesn't even feel like you your choice mattered, despite the two different results you get.

I wanted to like this game, but the more I played and the further I got made me less interested, less patient and more frustrated and annoyed. The moment I saw the open world and how it actually behaves, my dread tripled and the game turned into a massive slog and annoyance. 

The reason I stuck around until the end was because I love the concept. I love the theme. I loved some of the interactions between characters and I actually enjoyed P3 and Charles' conversations and spats. It wasn't worth it and I felt myself just rushing and forcing myself to finish the game. 

I'd recommend this game if they tweaked, optimized, cleaned up, got rid of the spongy health and improved upon many of the facets of this game. But as of right now, I'm just glad I finished it and I can't wait to uninstall it.",1691026775,1691026775,False,11,0,0.557172060012817383,0,True,False,False

I have the same feelings about Atomic Heart that I had when I first finished Resident Evil 4 all these years back. I know it's sacrilege to even suggest that the latter might be a good fun reasonably above average 7/10 game, but believe you me that I mean no disrespect by this what so ever. Both games were a good time and both of them are somewhat of a conundrum when reflected against the public perception of. RE4 being what one might call ""overrated"" and Atomic Heart then being seen as divisive as to its quality, some might call it ""underrated"" for that reason.

Granted it's a much more flawed game due to a mishmash of game systems that seem to exist in isolation from one another. I honestly wish they would just focus on one thing and one thing only. Instead we get a very brutal melee combat with a lot of impact and weight to it. The highlight of the game no doubt.

Next to that we have a very shoddy FPS mechanic that never quite seems right for most weapons aside perhaps for the iconic railgun (trust me, Russians love their railguns), and the magnum upgraded pistol. Everything else feels weak by comparison, even the rocket launcher once you realize it only chips away a silly fraction of a boss' health on Armageddon.

One might think that ranged combat compliments melee combat, but nope, you can VERY easily beat the game with just the morning star (Zvezdochka), the full energy upgrades and if you want to break the game completely the electric/fire cartridges. This setup annihilates EVERYTHING. It's so OP it hurts. Get the flying blades upgrade and see your foes ground to dust. You don't even need to dodge if invest into the polymer shield upgrade (which heals you too!). Slot in the telekinesis upgrade (it restores your energy also!) and the game becomes a walking simulator.

Then we have the many, many spatial puzzles that are not difficult by any stretch of the imagination. They're just chores, busy work. You don't feel clever solving them like you do in Portal, you're just glad they're done so that you can move on. There's two types of them. The gravity manipulation which never even once gave me a single trouble. And the rotating rooms puzzles which are a bit more difficult, but still boil down to rotating things until you can fit through/jump higher.

Of course there's also ""parkour"" which doesn't interact with the rest of the game at all. It's just that at one point the game decides you gotta do parkour and you do parkour. There's no combat during the parkour sections, and these same sections only exist in very specifically designated locations. Don't expect Mirror's Edge, The Dying Light or god forbid Assassin's Creed. In Atomic Heart parkour is nothing but a distraction, and not the core part of the gameplay as it is in the aforementioned games.

I saved the worst for last. The so-called open world segments are simply atrocious. Remember the hype Mundfish made around how the world will be alive with all these crazy systems that had sectors which would move robots around depending on the alert levels? None of it is in the finished game. Not a single thing. You basically just have the indestructible hives that can be disabled temporarily with a ""security hack"". Once you destroy a single thing 50 bees descend upon that single thing and restore it in seconds. It's ludicrous. There is absolutely no room to breathe. They just keep coming. And the worst part is that you can't even grind resources like that, because you can only kill the same robot once to get resources. You can technically grind in this game, but only from the reinforcements containers which don't spawn that often, and every single time they do they land on your car and you die instantly. So avoid cars like the plague, and just avoid everything else too, max out the mobility upgrades and just run past everything.

By now you must have an idea of what I'm talking about. I sincerely think that the game would be better off had they focused on a couple of things instead of a dozen different ones that exist apart from each other. Ditch ranged weapons, focus on the excellent melee and polish the glove's abilities to their full potential. Cut the open world and just have a map that lets the player choose to visit the dungeons or follow the main story. Feed the dungeons piece meal to us, don't let us do them all at once to break the game too early, which is yes, exactly what I did. The last dungeon which is the only one locked out until the end game wasn't really that big a deal by comparison. The energy vampire upgrade would be nice to have at the beginning. At the end of the game it just feels kinda silly because there's much better ways to restore energy. And if you must have puzzles in your game, make them much more involved and interesting. I know it's not a simple task at all, but you seem to want to have them in your game. Do them justice. Have an optional way to skip them for people of little patience, like having to ask CHRAZ or something to that effect. Or maybe have the solutions be stored on terminals to turn it into a bit of a scavenger hunt for people who like to explore.

In the end the gameplay is satisfying enough as to not outstay its welcome and want me come back for more even, with a caveat that one primarily uses melee. I will definitely be checking out the DLCs as they come and writing reviews for them as well. I just wish they could focus more on the things that they nailed instead of spreading themselves so thin. Let's get one thing straight however, Atomic Heart is NOT AN IMMERSIVE SIM. Not even a little. Shame that it was advertised as such. Just like the ads for Prey beat it in the butt, because it wasn't an FPS. Atomic Heart is a first-person melee game with cool abilities and upgrades, and unfortunately a crappy shooter, that's all it is.

As for the story. It's alright. I played the original version in which the protagonist is actually much more likable than in the ""dubbed"" version. He's definitely not even close as much of a whiny dudebro prick larping as an alpha male. His exchanges with CHRAZ are very reminiscent of the movie Upgrade and that's a good thing, because Upgrade is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. I will die on that hill.

The Soviet aesthetic is of course very welcome and to those of us that still remember it, nostalgic. The whole high-tech stuff with the wooden izbushkas and kickass babushkas is not really anything strange if you understand the cultural context. Of course it will be lost upon most Westerners. But to me it screams Russian culture going on for over a century. The whole wooden house on rocket boosters thing is a clear nod towards the Russian folklore and the works of the Strugatsky brothers. In particular their Monday Begins on Saturday novel. I mean it's no coincidence that Sechenov has been dubbed the wizard.

Graphically I can't really complain about it at all. The music is a different story entirely however. Whilst I cannot deny the nostalgic factor here, I also don't understand this absolute fruit salad of different genres. Just atop of my head you have: soviet songs both remixed and OG; soviet and western techno; chiptunes; russian pop songs from the 90s; post-punk as performed by the always alive Viktor Tsoi, arguably the father of russian doomer post-punk; the damn synth remixes of soviet songs for children (Kuznechik); heavy damn metal of unspecified flavor; orchestral ambiance; western pop and I'm sure I'm missing something here. There's absolutely no thematic consistency across the entire soundtrack. It's like Sergei was switching radio stations every five seconds whilst battling robots and mutants. It's really jarring.

Don't let me discourage you from playing Atomic Heart. I know I focused on the negatives, but I like the game quite a bit and would like to see it improve in the future.",1690734983,1690734983,True,3,0,0.504915475845336914,0,True,False,False

But with this massive flaw i would say it falls to 6/10 with the first few hours introduced above ground being especially tough to get through. I will say it is very enjoyable underground where there isn't this repair drone feature, but above ground, even when you get more powerful, it always annoyed me.

It is not worth full price so i'd wait for a sale or use game pass. 

The Good

The setting, music, atmosphere, art, and graphics are truly phenomenal. The start of the game shows you a post World War 2 uptopia of the optimism of scientific advancement to elevate humanity. I truly felt like i was at that time period. The music of the game is great using classical music and heavy metal remixes. The art in terms of actual art and the design of characters and robots was great except for the refrigerator which is questionable. The ending of the game felt rewarding both from a story perspective and from the weapons and skills you unlock. 

The Bad

You've probably seen post or comments about the whack gameplay like being swarmed by infinite spawning robots in the open world area which ruins the exploration part, inconsistent objective conveyance, and getting ambushed because the game auto saved in the middle of combat or you leave an area of robots only to go to another area full of robots. 

Addition to the complaints I've seen other people have, the game has a lot of puzzles for the sake of it There are points are time consuming puzzles that have nothing to do with the story but you're forced to complete. For example, the player will go to a facility to capture a person of interest. After that core part of the story is done, you are forced to do a 2-3 hour puzzle to LEAVE the facility which has no bearing on the story. Its like the weaned to pad out the play time by adding puzzles in an illogical order. Every room you walk into feels like there is either a puzzle or robots or sometimes both which sucks because the game tries to give you hints but sometimes you're focused on fighting. 

Finally the character starts the game being a jerk to everyone which I found annoying. There are no cut-scenes or pretext as to why hes a jerk, he just is even when people are nice to him. Interestingly, due to the awful game play experiences,  its feels like the main character empathizes with you when hes a jerk or makes negative comments about the situation.

First the good things:

- Being able to hold down the pickup button and run your cursor over the scenery to pick things up is useful and feels great.

- You upgrade your character's core abilities and passive boosts through a currency called neuropolymers that you get from basically everything.  Having every enemy you kill drop a small amount of neuropolymer is an absolutely great design decision - it makes you want to engage enemies and kill them all to loot them and grow stronger.  It's almost like experience points in a fashion.

- Having your ""magic"" abilities like lightning, ice, shield, telekinesis and so on be cooldown based and NOT reliant on some secondary MP bar you need to chug potions to restore was another fantastic decision.  There is zero hesitancy to use them.  The game limits you to three abilities equipped at once out of like 5-6 so this is fine.

- The regenerating energy bar (which is sort of your MP bar) that powers other weapon subsystems also feels good.  Since it regens on its own you again don't feel bad using it up.

- The Russian ""Wolf and Bunny"" cartoons in every save room are a very nice touch.

- Some of the music is really catchy.  Unfortunately there is some audio balancing issues where you will snipe a single robot from far away, killing them, and the game concludes ""Oh you must be in a big combat encounter now!"" and the music volume ramps up to max while you're standing awkwardly in an empty field.

- The lockpicking minigame is fast and simple, but not so fast that you can pick locks in the middle of combat.  No lockpicking skill tree or consumables needed.  Perfectly done.

- Being able to fully respec by getting 100% refunds for skills and weapon upgrades at any crafting station is much appreciated and should be the standard in any game with these systems.

But what are the big problems that bring the game down?

- The game is separated into an open world, story ""dungeons"" of sorts, and optional testing ground dungeons where you get weapon upgrade blueprints.  The dungeons are well done for the most part, but the open world is just awful.  See, after the opener dungeon which is well done, you get put out into the open world where the game falls apart, and it's all based on one bone headed design decision - that enemies respawn nearly immediately.  

See, when you kill a robot in the open world - repair drones are IMMEDIATELY deployed, swoop down, and repair the enemy you just killed.  Shoot down the drones, and more come.  Literally they are infinite.  And the enemy you just destroyed?  Back at full health - and if you kill it again, it doesn't drop any loot.  This turns the game experience to ash.  Where before you wanted to hunt down and kill every enemy - now you avoid combat as much as possible because there's no point - the enemy will just immediately respawn and you will have wasted ammo in a game where while ammo is not super scarce it is limited.  You NEVER want the player avoiding combat like this because it also discourages you from exploring the areas in search of ammo and parts.  The game has some paltry system where you can assault the local control room controlling the repair drones and disable them - but even this is temporary!  They repair the control center and you can't stop them!  This stupid system even leaks into some of the story dungeons where repair drones can appear from dispensers on the walls and repair enemies.  Thankfully, you can run these particular dispensers out of repair drones by continuously killing them, but it still feels awful.

The correct design would have been you being able to permanently disable the robots in an area as you expand your control of the regions.  Disable the repair systems, then take out every enemy if you wanted to.  Or better yet, throw this repairing enemy system into the trash where it belonged, because it almost single handedly ruins the experience.

- Inventory management SUCKS.  They clearly wanted to limit your ability to carry every weapon and make ""choices"" but their implementation is just bad.  Guns/weapons?  Take up several slots.  Ammo?  Takes up a slot, and has a max stack size, so ammo might take up 5-10 slots!  Healing potions?  Take up one slot each and don't stack!  This feels absolutely awful.  You are punished for carrying ammo.  You are punished for not using your healing items by having them bloat up your inventory.  Most games like this game has the guns be the biggest items you have to play tetris with, and ammo takes up either one slot each or no slots, and consumables always stack.  Bad bad bad design here because it does not feel rewarding in the slightest to fight your inventory.

- The weapons are not particularly exciting.  You have really basic options - the shotgun, the pistol, the AK type rifle, the rocket launcher (with very expensive ammo).  There's a curiously large amount of melee weapon options though, which doesn't make much sense - these types of games almost always have either a single signature melee weapon you use the entire game (crowbar anyone) or you get upgraded melee options as you go through (like, say, Deus Ex).  But you start with an axe, and then you can choose to craft one of several other options almost right from the beginning, and it's very unclear if any are really better than each other.  

One of the big problems is there's no ability to see how effective weapons are in general.  This game really needed the option to turn on pop up damage numbers when there is such a huge focus on weapon upgrades, special weapon attacks, charge skills, elemental augments, and whatnot.  Oh I upgraded my freeze skill so it does damage over time?  How much is it doing?  Scanning enemies let you see that they resist things, but how big is the reduction?  20%?  80%?  Several descriptions in the game allude to ""weak points"" of enemies but you have no idea if you're hitting one.  Is it the head?  But it's a robot, they shouldn't care if you shoot them in the head.  The game absolutely needed more feedback on how effective your different options in combat are.

- The main character drags down almost every scene that he's in, which is the entire game.  He's arrogant and rude, and not at all in a cool way.  The voice acting is quite good overall, but it's the script that is awful.    At first you think - ""Oh he hates robots, and ha ha now he's stuck with all these rampaging robots"" but no - he hates everyone and everything.  And you find out he also has amnesia, so there's no reason for this!  He's randomly crass for no reason and rude to everyone you meet, and it doesn't feel very good to play as him.  He's also really, really stupid.  From the very beginning of the game the story is all but screaming ""You are being manipulated!"" but this guy is dense as a brick, even through to the very end of the game where he still refuses to believe it.  The story itself is moderately interesting, especially in the second half of the game, but the ending is absolutely terrible.  The dialogue written for the sexual harassing upgrade robot appears to have been made by a teenager.  It's almost like the devs were also embarrassed by it because at some point it gets replaced by a much more generic robot VA and no one mentions this again.

I don't want to be too hard on the game because it was overall an enjoyable experience and again, they did a lot of things right.  It's just the problems are so big they detract hugely from the proceedings.  If they hadn't made these missteps the game would have been great.  Fix them the next time around.

Thought the jumping puzzles were poorly implemented, and a time waster in the first place? You'll love what they've done with the surface. Ten cameras you don't have a clear line of sight on, but they can sure see you. Infinite spawns, infinite repairs to cams, and your stealth feature doesn't seem to do much for concealment.

Get good, sure. Still bad choices that come out of left field, after you are outside of the return window.

I really wanted to like this game but honestly, it's not worth getting. I got about 18 hours in with no issues. After that, I started running into bugs that ultimately prevented me from progressing through the game. 

The first bug that I ran into was that i couldn't pick up ""candles"". I played through that because after 10 minutes of trying, it would eventually work. After that, enemies started glitching out and would just get stuck in place. The last bug that ruined the game for me was that I could no longer interact with door locks/puzzles. There's just no way to continue after that.

Other than that, the combat is average. Weapons and upgrades are actually pretty cool. The upgrades are useful and really change how you fight. I really didn't like how often enemies respawn though. You can spend 10 minutes just running through bots, only to turn around and see that they've all been respawned by the NEVERENDING repair bots.

Bioshock is one of my favorite games and this game hits a lot of the same notes. If you're thinking about getting this but haven't played Bioshock, just play through the Bioshock series instead.

Abilities are also upgradable for your glove. Weapons can be ferociously upgraded by scrounging the VDNH's military testing grounds.

Gameplay- guns had great visual and sound design but they feel mostly like a last resort, melee combat is where its at. map was pretty but not super great to explore, great design, mid exploration.

Audio- the soundtrack is just... indescribably amazing, every time a song comes on its an absolute banger, even the music in the upgrade menu is a banger.

Audience- teens and adults. kinda graphic and the robots have boobs, not recommended for small kids and grandma

Story- great start, decent middle, great climax [spoiler] ending is kinda bummer though [/spoiler]

Difficult- mostly balanced, [spoiler] the weird tentacle monster robot boss battle is unironically harder than the actual final boss [/spoiler]

Grind- nonexistent as most of the materials needed to upgrade weapons are found through standard progression

Set in a parallel soviet timeline, its steampunk world looks amazing combining vintage and futuristic elements. The characters and the robots are unique with vivid personalities, well written dialogues and inspiring humor. Also, it has some interesting mechanics with cool fast paced battles, nice puzzles and a decent amount of skills. Yet, the gameplay remains shallow. It never really evolves and soon it becomes repetitive with too much annoying looting. The story is interesting, but falls into clichés and exaggerations. Its political message is questionable too. A good looking, entertaining game that needed fresher ideas and more work to reach higher levels. 


Manometer: 7/10[/b]


The good
- Awesome aesthetics. Great 3d graphics with lots of details, nice chromatic palette and atmospheric lighting conditions.
- Fantastic steampunk world in a parallel timeline of Soviet Union that combines perfectly both vintage and futuristic elements. There are many different facilities to explore and the contrast between sunny exteriors and dark interiors works great. Some sceneries are really imposing.
- Amazing animations both at P-3's hands and enemies' attacks. Especially robots, mechanical parts, mechanisms and levers have such satisfying movements.
- Well designed characters. People and mainly robots look very interesting visually with lots of details and some crazy personalities. Interacting with Charles and Nora, your companions, is hilarious and you'll love them for sure.
- Great direction and photography with good pace, wonderful framing/cameras' movement and top notch cut scenes.
- There is a good amount of skills to acquire, weapons to craft and potential upgrades to apply on them. Gameplay is not very deep, but it gives you some options and you can try different builds.
- Exciting battles with awesome rhythm and satisfying explosions/kills. There are some interesting mechanics and you can choose between melee or shooting attacks. Although battles are fulfilling, they get repetitive after a while.
- There are lots of puzzles with some nice mechanics, although they don't really evolve and eventually get repetitive. They are pretty easy, but give a nice tone to the gameplay by adding more exploration and platforming sequences. Especially those dungeons (testing grounds) are focused mainly on puzzles instead of fighting.
- Jumping between linear, story based events and open world action is well balanced. It combines nicely scripted parts with free exploration and random battles.
- Outstanding music that combines nicely atmospheric songs on calm parts with fast songs during battles. Russian music is also fantastic.
- Great sound design with lots of amazing mechanical/electronical sounds and impacts/explosions during battles. The voices of robots and dead people are well processed and there are some really atmospheric mixes. Voice acting performances are convincing too.
- Interesting story with lots of mystery, intrigues and twists. It manages to maintain your curiosity despite falling into clichés and some extravagant parts towards the ending.
- Well written dialogues and lots of logs manage to get you immersed and help you understand its world and the political situation. Speaking with corpses is creepy but very interesting. It's humor is also great with some really inspiring and hilarious moments.
- There is a stealth part of the gameplay that is pretty weak, but it gives you the option to sneak behind enemies or try to silently avoid cameras.
- All these cartoon animations on TVs, on deaths and in the skill tree are gorgeous.
- Saving is manual, but there are save points everywhere. It doesn't want to mess with your nerves or force you replay long sessions.

The bad
- Although there are a lot skills and upgrade options, the gameplay is shallower than it initially seems. It gives you the basic skills right from the beginning and the upgrades are just small improvements that don't alter much things. Also the gameplay never really evolves. All the puzzles are small variations of the same three different formats. You face the same enemies over and over again so after learning their vulnerabilities you perform the same actions everywhere. Battles get repetitive and after the midgame only few things manage to impress you.
- Too focused on looting. Collecting spare parts and materials consumes a big part of your playtime and often ruins the pace and the vibe you're into. It's super annoying to search the scattered robots' debris after each battles in order to find loots. Unfortunately you cannot avoid it, because it's necessary for crafting and upgrading.
- The story is well built, but there are some cliché parts (the evil guy that wants to conquer the world) and towards the end it gets too excessive and pretentious for my taste.
- There are some issues in movement and collisions. You'll often get stuck on small objects ruining sometimes the fluidity of battles. Also parkouring is imprecise and sometimes you'll fail to grab ledges and objects.
- After a certain point you may start feel too powerful with a result of loosing the initial agony of survival. It just gets too easy as you have tons of resources, med kits and powerful weapons. Killing almost every boss in the first try was a big disappointment.
- The last part of the game lacks rhythm and balance. It's a couple of hours filled with explanations, twists, dialogues and reading. Half of the story gets revealed there and there is no gradual escalation. They could have spread it into earlier parts.
- Facial expressions are stiff and fail to reveal characters' phycological state and emotions.
- Playing with mouse and keyboard can be annoying. Key bindings aren't very convenient and you won't avoid mistakes. Using controller may be better.
- Politically it often looks like a western world propaganda. It clearly tries to compare communist societies to ""Kollekitv 2.0"" implying that their purpose is to control the masses and make people mindless puppets. Showing all the communist politicians as corrupted maniacs that want to conquer the world creates a false image of an evil Soviet Union against the good west political systems.",1690141070,1690141378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Open world mechanics are bad, keep that in mind, it's not that you don't understand how to make it work, it's just that it's bad design, don't try into stealth, just run around from waypoint to waypoint in straight lines, robots won't hit you fast enough and cameras won't have enough time to raise an alarm.

Still, I urge you to give this game a chance; once you get into VDNH, consider the core gameplay to have started and then make your judgement call.

I love the setting, the characters and the story. I despise the ultimate plot twist because it comes almost out of nowhere and has the same bad taste as a ""Now you see me"" movie plot twist. But the main gameplay cycle gets addictive once you get all the basic mechanics, including souls-like inconvinient placement of save points.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

Atomic Heart, an ambitious first-person action-adventure game, had the potential to offer players a unique and captivating gaming experience. However, after spending hours immersed in its world, I found myself sorely disappointed by what can only be described as a lackluster and uninteresting journey.

One of the main issues that plagued Atomic Heart was its lack of engaging gameplay mechanics. While the initial premise of battling through a surreal and alternate reality filled with bizarre creatures and high-tech weaponry seemed promising, the execution fell short. The combat felt repetitive and lacked depth, leading to a monotonous and unchallenging experience. I had hoped for exciting and innovative gameplay elements, but Atomic Heart failed to deliver on this front.

Moreover, the game's pacing was inconsistent, further contributing to its boredom factor. There were moments of slow exploration and world-building that could have been immersive if adequately developed. However, these promising elements were often overshadowed by long periods of aimless wandering or tedious backtracking. The lack of a cohesive and engaging narrative progression left me feeling disconnected from the game's world and story.

Additionally, the characters and their interactions were forgettable and unremarkable. The protagonist's development felt stagnant, and the supporting cast failed to leave a lasting impact. Without well-crafted and relatable characters to drive the story forward, the game lost an essential element that could have kept players invested in the outcome.

The visuals and art design in Atomic Heart were undoubtedly intriguing, but they alone were not enough to carry the game. While the surreal and nightmarish landscapes were visually impressive, they couldn't compensate for the lack of substantial gameplay and storytelling. The potential for a captivating and immersive experience was present, but it remained largely untapped.

Furthermore, technical issues and bugs detracted from the overall enjoyment of the game. Frequent glitches and performance problems disrupted the flow and immersion, leading to frustration and a sense of disconnect from the game world.

In conclusion, Atomic Heart promised a unique and thrilling gaming adventure but fell short of expectations. With its lackluster gameplay, unremarkable characters, inconsistent pacing, and technical issues, the game failed to deliver on its potential. While the art design and visuals are commendable, they couldn't salvage an otherwise dull and uninteresting experience. Unless significant improvements are made, Atomic Heart is best approached with caution by gamers seeking an immersive and exciting journey.

Story wise...You don't play this for the story sadly, no spoilers ofc here 

but it really is not satisfying the writing could be better, they had a solid base but needed to take it further on many levels, should have used a Russian accent speaking person and made the character more interesting with his dialogue, with what you learn about him later they had a real chance to make him a character you actually not just liked but could have been iconic IF the script and voice acting was there. 

The ending feels VERY rushed unsatisfying if you were keeping up with the story. I didn't feel closure at all and was looking at the main menu after credits alittle disappointed. 

The game is a visual masterpiece, if you want to see a beautiful game with good game-play you will be pleased. If you want Bio-shock beautiful story, your not getting that. Sadly.

Right from the start, I really, really enjoyed this game world. It has an awe factor very akin to Cyberpunk 2077 in its architectural creativity and grandness. I also dig the idea of an alternate reality where the Soviet Union is fully realized. Most people think this game is Russian or Soviet propaganda, which is very fair at first glance, but in my play time it takes the piss out of the Soviet Union as much as the game is an ode to it. This is made clear by many of the notes you'll pick up, dead bodies you'll speak to, and how the main story unfolds (which is the absolute worst part of the game, but we'll get there). Overall I would say this game doesn't have much good to say about American capitalism or Soviet communism. 

You shouldn't care either way. The lore at its core is dumber than dogshit. Reminds me strangely of Fallout the Frontier in how weirdly horny everything is and the sheer number of tropes they pull from different games. The game also makes it painstakingly clear from the get-go that it's owning up to being a ""Soviet Bioshock"", which would be neat if it were executed gracefully. Instead, it rips every scene and theme imaginable from that series without any afterthought. This was made evident to me at the part of the game where you go down a lighthouse elevator and come across an underwater scientific complex. Your character spouts something like ""I seem to have found a RAPTURE"".  I wanted to keel over after that. The worst part is you barely even explore this 'rapture'. They just included it because of the epic Bioshock reference. 

There is such a thing as paying too much homage to a game series, and this game sacrifices identity and creativity for just that. I'm not sure what this game wants to be because of how many things it sacrifices to be something else. 

For example, why does there have to be floating cities? You barely explore them except for at the beginning of the game. It would have been cool to go back every now and then and see this Utopian world juxtaposed to the underworld which is in total chaos. Instead, it felt like a wasted concept for the clickbait scene of leaving the floating facility in your car (which I admit was FUCKING jaw-dropping). I don't see the point in including a floating city and essentially owning up to being a modern adaptation of Bioshock if that is only a tiny, tiny portion of the game. 

It's very sad that I have to emphasize this because otherwise the game reeks of its own weird and fantastic identity. It is soaked in what I can only describe as ""optimistically forward nostalgia"". Atomic Heart is coming across stagnant technical projects and the dusty shein of abandoned Soviet architecture and hearing the echos of dead scientific optimism. It is coming across the save room and peering at the illusory countryside luminating from the window, and just vibing to the killer ambient soundtrack (not to mention the banger when you're at the NORA station). This unique feeling almost saved the game for me despite all the issues I've mentioned. 

That would be the case, if the main story weren't dying light levels of stinky turd. Actually, it's worse, because this game leans way heavier into trying to be deep, philosophical, and cryptic, but in reality it's done just to confuse you enough to not focus on how contrived and horny everything is. 

Another review described it in much better detail, but there is a scene in the game that takes about 20 minutes to unfold (unskippable) where the twins do a really complex ritual of immortalizing a man who was beheaded. Nothing in this scene makes any kind of philosophical statement or adds to the game world in any tangible way. It's done in a very adolescent attempt to be artsy, and it fails. 

Judging from the reviews, however, the twins are just hot enough to ignore the fact that this game fails at making an artistic statement. Also, the only prominent female character in the game has an absolute dumptruck of an ass. Someone spent hours modeling these things. It's just evident that this game was made by its developers, a bunch of Russian chuds who have no real experience with women outside of porn and seem to subconsciously inject their hornyness into the game thinking it's deep. 

That's why I would highly recommend turning off any and all subtitles for the game (and change the voice actor to Russian). It's better to make vague conjectures about what might be going on than understand that this game makes no real statement and is essentially just fools gold in that regard. 

Read all the notes, however. Lots of really cool lore can be understood through both the set pieces (lots of going through Soviet museums) and all the information left by the scientists killed by the bots. There's also a directory of all the scientists working at the facility and it's a neat bit of info to read through.

But other than the stinky main plot, cool setting and art design, and fairly engaging lore if you're into extensive reading, it's just a whole lot of killing bots and using your glove to telekinetically rip loot from your enemies in a very satisfying way. This is where I give the game a rest because it's honestly a very simple yet elegant system and this aspect of the game almost looks back at me with an innocent smile when I jab at the supposed ""deep"" elements of the game, reminding me it is just a fucking game. It really is a fantastic game, if a bit rushed and under-conceptualized. The guns feel meaty and weighty and all of the weapon upgrades make a genuine difference. All of the glove upgrades feel powerful in a way that I don't think Bioshock perfected. I also love the idea of being able to redistribute points to test out different play styles.

It should have never been in an open world setting, and I think that was more a business decision than a design decision. It would have saved them the aftermath of everyone's collective hatred of moving through this open world if they just reserved it to scripted sequences. Instead, it is a lot like fishing near a bee hive. I can never get a fuckng moment's rest from getting swarmed by bots, and it kills the mood quick. I want to embrace this optimistic nostalgia you're giving me but I can't get a moment to stop and admire. 

The game would highly benefit from a sprint button. Also, stealth is virtually nonexistent, and there are no cool far-cry style takedown upgrades. Blueprints are a dumb idea. Just make them the weapons themselves and save us from having to rewatch the weapon being made all over again. 

Altogether, I think my feelings for this game have ironically become the vibe I got from it. I went into it blindfolded, got overly optimistic, and now I look back on the game with a kind of nostalgic disappointment. I felt like my 43 hours were wasted because of how stinky everything turned out to be.  But I also wrote this entire review while listening to the ambient save room soundtrack. I wrote all of these paragraphs because this game is that much of a special stinky thing to me. It's a stinky thing that will stick around for sure, but something in the end I would not recommend to buy at full price. It's a dumb game that pretends to be smart. It's not large enough nor feature heavy to warrant a $60 price tag. Buy it on a good sale and go in with zero expectations, other than to vibe to some cool Soviet retrofuturism. It's pretty fucking rad in that regard.

I kept hearing how unlikable the protagonist was but I haven't had a problem with him so far.  The enemy variety so far has been great, all the ways you can modify your gear is great (quite a decent amount of RPG-elements in terms of upgrading your character, abilities, weapons, etc).  There are puzzles but none of them are frustrating, ""Have to look up how to solve them' type puzzles.  Graphics are terrific and so far the storyline is keeping me engaged.

I'll change my review if my opinion changes but so far I've been very happy with my purchase.  I'd perhaps like an extra weapon or two but it seems that the upcoming DLC is adding new goodies.  Your ""Bioshock-type Abilities"" are all very upgradable/customizable and the combat is quite smooth.  For those of you worried it a more linear game- I just hit a point where the game opens up the world quite a bit and gives you more freedom.  Add in the new-game plus and I really think this game is a gem.  

I was worried when I saw the initial gameplay demos and then things went silent for a while (usually a bad sign of a game's dev spiraling out of control) but this has been the most enjoyable game I've played in quite a while.  While nothing will replace New Vegas (TTW Specifically) and Prey in my Best-of List, this game has been a very, very nice surprise.  And I haven't even gotten the really cool upgrades/weapons yet.  And the crafting/upgrade mechanics are very neat.  The VERY beginning starts off a bit slow but it picks up quickly.  One of the better game purchases I've made in a while and apparently it's quite a long game, especially for people like me that take their time and explore everything.

Oh- and you can refund your upgrades if you want to try out new abilities/weapons/etc.  I've stuck with being able to shoot electricity, freeze people/fires, and hitting people with anti-gravity before slamming them into the ground REALLY hard.  But I could refund all that and try out the other abilities.",1689816571,1689816706,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is a solid game and exactly what I have thought it would be and even more.

It is best described as a mashup of Fallout, Bioshock (heck, it even had some obvious references) and Portal - all of which I'd consider to be on the top list of my favorite games. You have a dystopian, alternate reality, interesting weapons, a funny gun / special ability system in general, the opportunity to respec without any loss of materials and to trial and error yourself throughout the levels. So to be clear: I had a blast and it was extremely fun for me to play for ~ 31 hours. 

The only things that I need to mention are that, for me, it is a quite difficult game (combat wise). Mainly because out there in the 'semi open-world' there are respawning robots infinitely. Yes, they urge you to sneak through the world and be aware of the cameras, but to be honest, I'm not much of a stealth gamer myself and it stressed me out that you'll be constantly revealed and dozens of robots will be spawned at you.
ALSO the game won't really explain a lot of things. 

So I'd strongly recommend that if you consider buying this game, make sure to use the 'open world' just to get from Testing Ground to Testing Ground. Sometimes it's harder to open them, sometimes it's easier. But if you prefer straightforward 'tunnel level' games, this is the way to go. Ignore the bots, run from area to area, disable the Hawks and get to the Grounds. They are AWESOME. Yes, sometimes the puzzles are a bit too easy, but I've got some serious Portal vibes in there and I like them the most. So better 'ignore' running around with the urge to explore every bit of the map: it's honestly not worth it. Not because the game doesn't look nice - in fact it looks incredible - but because it is not necessary to get every weapon upgraded and it might just frustrate you.

Anyway: The game was amazing and to be honest, I kind of grown to love the soundtrack aswell. Can't wait for the first DLC.

The story had me hooked right away, the graphics are beautiful. Its a quick game with a lot of optional content and a lot of exploration. The puzzles are very fun and well thought out (for the most part). I absolutely love the combat style, and the fact you can freely change up all your skills whenever you want too without any drawback is a very nice tough. That entire system mimics bioshock so it was really enjoyable for me.

However, the negatives about this game are
Holy freakin bug city bro. 
*Game bugs, frame rates dropping for no reason, broken achievement tracking.
*Cant decide if they wanted to make a linear game or open world game
-Huge world with 0 guidance on how to do the side quests etc, just a bunch of guessing and luck really, I couldn't tell you how many times i accidental did something I was trying to figure out 2 hours ago. 
*Terrible voice acting
*Unskippable forced dialogue that adds 0 value and knowledge to the games world. lasting anywhere from 1-5 minutes long. 
The workbench where you craft ammo and weapons and health kits, sometimes also partakes in these unskippable dialogues but this time its a horn y robot which is really annoying and again, terrible robotics voice acting. 

when you enter the open world area, it starts an infinite spawning of enemies, and new enemies which build and repair enemies youve already defeated. Growing the horde of enemies bigger and bigger and there is nothing you can do about it, Its not fun, its stupid. You basically just have to try and outrun everything and hope to god you don't die in the process. 

All in all its a pretty fun game, I think if your able to push passed all the bugs and terrible voice acting (which does get better later on towards the very ending of the game) it'll be something you can finish.",1689632468,1689684592,True,24,0,0.592543423175811768,6,True,False,False

In my opinion, considering its flaws, I believe Atomic Hearth is priced appropriately at $40 during a Steam sale. At $60, there are better games available on the market that offer a more polished and engaging experience.

It has a unique and honestly delightful aesthetic, the gunplay feels great, the Zelda-esque format of an overworld dotted with separated dungeons is refreshing, puzzles and minigames are a mixed bag but generally solid for the genre. There are clever little mechanics I've never seen before such as consumable canisters you can attach to weapons to add an elemental damage effect - think Witcher 3 blade oils but way, way better. There's no sprinting but the player moves quickly enough that I don't mind, and the DOOM 2016-esque dashing keeps movement from feeling flat. The conversations between the protag and the Navi-analog are interesting and well voice acted.

My only real critique is that the story beats are very ""blink and you'll miss it."" There are times where the pace slows all the way down, such as a sequence where you follow a slow robot receptionist down a museum exhibit hall for actual multiple minutes (the one model of robot that didn't turn evil after the genuinely excellent intro sequence for reasons only explained in the pause menu database). Some objectives can feel like busywork, but I don't even mind fetch quests in AH because the visuals and level design and combat are all round winners.

Hedgie/HOG, the Twins, and the moustached-lab tech terminators are my favorite enemies. Love the speed of the enemies, the particle effects, and how detailed the character models are.

The scanner is the unsung hero of the game. It helps find loot, and seeing all the floors and walls around you filled with enemies also adds to the ambiance. Vacuum-looting.. where have you been all my life. Also love the cryo ability and personal shield. The combat really can't be praised enough.

The Polymer tech and how they explained and justified everything for space exploration made the game very immersive and exciting. It's also very relevant with all the renewed interest in Space exploration from private companies in the real world, and continued existence of USSR-nationalism. The game had a lot of interesting ideas  (also disturbed ideas) and ethical issues: bioengineering animals for underwater, polymer suits for harsh environment, drill-snake for mining asteroids, robotic workforce (would we live lives of leisure? or lose everything?) preserving the mind after death, the red polymer monsters, mind-control, and human experimentation etc. 

Overall, the best game I've played in a long time. Only complaint is Nora, it's too much. Rest is amazing. Especially loved the puzzle mini games, and the puzzle level areas. I pre-ordered the season pass to support the developers. Hoping for a sequel! They've built an exciting world.

It was an alright game for me. I didn't realize I was supposed to grind at first which made every fight very hard for me but as soon as I did, boss battles were a breeze.

It paints a world devastated by the ultimate human conflict, a nuclear war that destroys most of the known world. All that remains are a few humans and traces of the past, everything is changed forever, just a tiny shadow of what it used to be.

Except humans. Humans never change. 

For good and bad. Metro Exodus shows us how humans will always be what they are, even after the world has been left empty. It shows us that there is no excuse for human violence. There is no reason no place for war.

But humans are always going to be humans. 

So… what about robots?

Atomic heart comes from a part of the world close to, but not quite the same as the one that saw the Metro series come to life. 

This comparison may be a little forced on, since this is where similarities end. But since Metro series is no more (for the time being, that could change in the future) And a new STALKER game is in the works (although we fear the worst, as its developers are suffering in the middle of a war, a real one which not only may pause the game development indefinitely, but more importantly, may end the developer’s life) at this moment what we have is… Atomic Heart.

Atomic Heart it’s a very different game in the sense that the center of the experience it’s not the narrative of the characters as it is in the Metro series, but the world where the characters live in, the world design and the lore is the main focus and perhaps where it excels. 

Atomic Heart’s lore it’s a very interesting one, which, if you look deep enough has endless details. It’s an alternative version of XIX century Russia with a lot of science fiction elements.

While the game certainly lacks in having interesting characters and narratives, it excels in presenting the game world and having outstanding and original game design.

The gameplay as a result of all this is somehow caught in the middle of this contradiction. Meaning that at times it is very dynamic and exciting and just simply very well done, but at other times gets lost in the unnecessary intricacies of its own design (some decisions doesn’t make sense, like the endless respawning of enemies on the open world section, something that goes directly in deterrence of the exploration and recollection of all the collectibles and hidden stories that abound in these levels)

Because of that, the experience of playing Atomic Heart is in many ways a bittersweet one. You could almost see some great moments coming in and then get lost in some terrible ones. 

The world design and hypothetical technology are remarkable and how it is all entangled in its own culture is daring and commendable.

In this sense it is always refreshing to see a piece of media, that shows us a culture from other part of the world that is not north America not just in black or white, as it is frequently the case when shown through other person’s point of view; but in a more sensible way, with its share of love and also a really hard critic for all the terrible things that humans are capable of.

Atomic Heart is a brave although flawed effort from Mundfish developers where the game excels in its world design and industrial machinations but gets sloppy with some gameplay choices and its nonexistent narrative. In many ways its like a distant brother from 4a’s Metro Exodus and it only makes us wonder, how could the world would be if we all just work together.

The game it’s fairly abstract in its visuals, world and story, there really isn’t that much sense in how a lot of things work in this universe, which left me feeling with a bit more of a desire of wanting to know how things actually were working or what preceded the creation of such a reality, having said that, the story wasn’t really the main motivator for me to keep playing, as much as it was, the gameplay itself.

The gameplay is a bit more slower paced than more recent -so called-, “Boomer Shooters” is a bit more akin to something like the newer Wolfenstein games, those being “New Order” & “Old Blood”. It’s an strange game that pinches a lot of things from games like Bioshock, Wolfenstein, but it does enough in its gameplay and world to retain an element of individuality, which I really enjoy; overall the gameplay is a blend between bioshock and Wolfenstein, but a lot of the power ups that you obtain are not nearly as interesting as those of Bioshock, nor is the shooting as satisfying as that of Wolfenstein.

For the most part the enemies that you get are robots of different varieties, but if you’ve kept up with the trailers you’ve seen most of them, plus how most of them work, given that about the only variety in their behaviour is whether they’re capable of flying or not; most of them will either shoot at you, or charge at you. There’s also some that are more “organic” (based on the game’s description), they’re more human like enemies and more associated to nature, but again, they’re behaviour is roughly the same, charge or shoot & fly.

Even with all of these issues though, the game managed to kept me engaged for the most part though, the combat dynamic between using the power ups and watching the enemies get progressively more and more damaged was quite satisfying, not only that but the game at harder difficulties is beautifully balanced in my opinion, it’s just something that really highlighted my whole experience because for the most part I really don’t have the patience for such challenge in games, specially nowadays as I’m getting older.

The power ups range from freezing enemies, to shocking them, to using a gravity power to lift them into the air making them vulnerable to getting shot only to then slamming them down into the ground. The game also puts a heavy emphasis in how you upgrade most of these power ups as well as your weapons, most of the power ups that you can get are stat increases like more damage or faster recharge rates for your powers, but for the weapons they can add stuff like different attacks, to completely revamping the way your weapons work. Melee is also a highlight here with most of the firing weapons being relegated to secondary uses, this is not really a shooter where you’re just shooting at enemies all the time, you have to make use of all of your tools in order to get by, is quite satisfying after a while.

The real highlight here though, nonsensical, absurd or not, is the world itself. The world of “Atomic Heart” is a joy to explore and to look at, this is a game where the reality is conceived successfully by how its presented, it’s a believable and yet strange world that consistently left me marvelled at the wonders it was presenting; there is however, a slight issue, and that is with some really odd focus in sexuality when it comes to the game, almost every robot that you encounter and a lot of the times some mannequins, are oddly sexualized in some way, shape or form; this happens with the puzzles as well where almost all of them are about using some sort of phallic tool to insert into some sort of orifice. Is not something that really bothered me, but still, after a while it got old and felt a tad bit juvenile to say the least.

At the end of the day, the game’s real issues, I feel, have to do with how disjointed it is. It’s almost as if you had two people during development, one with really good ideas, another with some really bad ones. There’s one segment, to give you an example, where you’re supposed to survive an encounter that involves a show, you’ve basically have to wait for the show to end until you can eventually move on, so you’re fighting while listening to this beautiful classical music… but right around where the show starts getting old, and my patience is about to run out, the game decides to turn up the music into some weird techno babble that mixes the classical music with some dubstep bullshit that ends up ruining the whole thing; then the segment proceeds to prolong itself to a point where I was just tired of playing it.

Like that segment that I described in the last paragraph, there’s a ton of moments, some puzzles work, others are infuriatingly obtuse and badly designed. Some of the elements in the open world are really cool, others beg for more of an explanation to the player that never really arises at the end of the day. There’s these really cool underground bases that you can explore in the open world but it is a puzzle in itself to figure out how to get to them, once you figure it out though, those bases hold challenges like puzzle rooms, platforming sections, and combat encounters, but equally, they have incredible rewards, such as weapon parts and upgrades that end up being the most significant. The problem is, on one hand, conditioning most of the powerful tools to these side content spaces, and on the other hand, a lot of the challenges, platforming sections, and combat encounters, a lot of the times are badly designed and/or frustrating, so they end up being tedious more than anything else.

Even then though, I would recommend Atomic Heart, simply because what it does well, it does really well; It is a game with a number of issues and design problems, but equally, there are a number of segments in the game that are really good and creative, I personally like some of the later stages in the game where you enter into some sort of dreamlike sequences, but after a while some of them got a bit old, and that’s about how the experience of this game goes, sometimes it will be rewarding, other times really infuriating. But with the addition of NG+ and the fact that the game is -overall-, a good and rewarding experience, and more importantly, a unique one at that, I would definitely recommend you to get this game on sale if you can.

Hopefully in the future the devs will still fix some of the issues present here, like the fact that NG+ mode is locked on the hardest setting, or how the game can be buggy at times, in my playthrough I fell through the map and then the game crashed once in the end. I’ve heard they’re also planning on adding some story DLC, which sounds pretty cool, but I really hope it’s not like those story DLC’s that don’t add anything to the base game, nor do they last more than just a couple of hours… literally.

I'm very mixed on this after completion.

The gameplay just feels kinda, ok. It gives you guns, and you shoot the thing. Also, there's this, attention to stealth, but then the stealth just feels bad. From the get go I just ignored it. The crafting system feels like a nothing but a chore at the same time. Honestly might have been better just giving you the weapons.
As for character skills, there is one that makes this game feel kinda unique, another that feels mandatory, one that is, and the others feel kinda useless.

And the story is, throughout, unsatisfying. And right at the end, when you finally feel like you are starting to understand things, it gets all thrown out. And my first reaction was ""they are setting up for AH2"" but then, I internalized that it doesn't in a good way, instead of feeling like I played a whole story and I want more, the concept of an AH2 feels more like an obligation to understanding the story more than anything. I don't want more of AH and therefor excited for AH2, AH needs AH2 to be complete.
Like, it is so desperate for more story, that I might just look up or create a fanfic just so I can complete the story in my head.

But, honestly, I didn't buy the game for that reason, I bought it for the world. Utopian horny robots is really all a game needed to snag me out of the water. And while it's cool yeah, the story wrapping up how it did just makes everything here feel unsatisfactory.

The music though, my goodness. 10/10, will probably be my GOTY music nomination. 


The DLC might fix my satisfaction problems, but come on, a DLC? I'm not going to bet on it, and I'm not sure i'm willing to invest in it.
Also, I wish there was a mixed option. I want to like the game, but overall I am left with a more negative reaction currently than a positive one.",1689448218,1689448218,False,23,2,0.665561556816101074,0,True,False,False

I feel like if I started the game with an AK, a pistol and a shotgun I would have had more fun in the early levels. Another issue is the main characters dialog. Every interaction he is pissed off at the setting and game. It feels like the person who wrote the character hated everything about the game. He just comes off as an impatient, weak, child. He uses a lot of repetitive negative dialog that sounds like it was written by a toddler.

Atomic Heart has a beautiful world, and more than that, a lived in world. Every area you enter feels inhabited. Here's my shortlist of the important pros and cons of Atomic Heart, though keep in mind we may value different things in our approach to enjoying a title.

Positive:
Difficulty - I've heard a lot of people say Atomic Heart is too difficult. I just played through it on the ""Normal"" difficulty and it certainly has some challenging areas, boss fights, and puzzles. It is not a Souslike game, the difficulty is maneuverable, and when you die in Atomic Heart it is always your fault. Even after getting some of the more ridiculous weapons, the game does not really become easy due to an increase in mob variety, strength, numbers, and resistances. Good change of pace.
Sound design - This blows most games out of the water and makes an impressive strike at even the best games audio design. Weapons sound punchy, but not arcadey. The environmental noises are soft and subtle for the most part. The only thing that hurts the sound design at all for me is the balancing of the camera robot's audio. It is too loud and can interfere with other nearby sounds, especially in areas with multiple cameras. The music is impeccable.
Loop - Game offers 100% refunds on ALL crafting and upgrade trees. It encourages you to try out different solutions to help the Major, recycle early game weapons for late game ones, dismantle everything, and always be on the lookout for that next component.
Story - Without offering spoilers, Atomic Heart sets out to tell a story about transhumanism using the 1950s Soviet Union and generally delivers. There are weak points, such as characters being either too steadfast or too loose with their beliefs, but the story follows a coherent plot and even offers up some subversions for fans of the genre.
Puzzles: There are mandatory puzzles in this game, but if you get frustrated easily fear not because they are not the difficult puzzles. All of the games best loot and upgrades are hidden behind more advanced puzzle systems, making you want to discover the solution to the puzzles to receive the special rewards (if you're into not looking up guides for every puzzle, that is).

Negatives:
Length - I finished the game over 19 hours according to Steam, and some people would find that too short for an adventure romp when games like Cyberpunk can easily double that without feeling like a slog. The story told here does not take an incredible amount of time and can be finished +/- five hours or so from how I finished it. 
Content - Not a personal gripe, but some people will be upset about the lack of weapon options. I found that I was able to upgrade/update/replace at a pace going through the story where nothing felt stale and overused, but ymmv.
Balance - There are clear winners to where you should invest your upgrade points. One skill tree is vastly better than the others, to the point where I eventually respec'd into only that skill tree, my Shok ability, my character, and energy management. Some of the other trees could use some love.
Unsettling Environment - I *love* the first few hours of this game. It is legitimately creepy. It is not a horror game by any stretch of the imagination, but there are quite a few creepy scenes/areas early on. That being said, a lot of the creepy factor of Atomic Heart quickly shifts into unsettling--the way a lot of retrofuturism/cyberpunk properties do, which is fine--and I feel like the game could have been even more enjoyable if it had kept me on the edge of my seat and more tense. For some players, even being creepy/unsettling will be a turn off, so I wanted to include it.

Hope any of that was helpful in determining whether or not Atomic Heart is right for you. Personally, I'm going to give it some time and then enter NG+ which contains harder enemies, and if I enjoy that I will update my review.",1689301450,1689301450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world building the lore, the alternate USSR setting. I liked all that. The demo pulls you in immediately with the lush graphics and sowjet era bombast. Then you're locked into a boring dungeon crawl for hours and it becomes a typical mediocre Focus game..
It looks and acts like slavic robopunk Metro meets Bioshock but lacks the fun in gameplay.

Good:
robot design, USSR alternate history aesthetics and lore, environment graphics esp. outside
picking up mats is fun
character database was done well, I liked examining these with the logs and making theories, should have been done in Prey as well
""slavic"" game-design

Mid:
gunplay, think Bioshock games, minigames and puzzles.

Bad:
plot is kinda stupid and after the first hours you notice the main chracter is too. Not endearingly simple but plain stupid.
constant companion bracelet banter like in Forspoken. I'd rather have the voice over the radio trope.
locked in a dungeon for hours in the beginning with boooring gameplay
close combat isn't great but needed to conserve ammo
tedious crafting system, weapon blueprints should just be the weapon
bad and sluggish platforming- if you want platforming then add better airdash or double jump and better mantling detection, not like this
horny bits are funny every now and then but we're not twelve year old anymore.

Enemies? Uninspiring, there's only like 6 enemies in the whole game and they all feel basic and samey but also take like a trillion hits to kill and sometimes it just feels annoying having to fight a lot of them at the same time, combined by the terribly slow clunky gameplay, it's just not very fun. Protagonist? Unfunny and annoying. Earning a lot of resources just for earning one gun that then feels like complete crap when using it just felt super annoying to me. 

Some parts of the game were more fun than others, I have to appreaciate though that the music is great but should had been used better and more for the combats.

If you have never played Fallout, Stalker, Bioschock, or Prey, hard pass on atomic till you binge those franchises. 

Atomic Heart is at its best before you get into the bunker. With the only highlights after that being the boss fights, most of them, not all. Cool world building and showcasing. After that you spend so much time in the bunker and once you're out the open world is so dam boring.

The map is needlessly large with basically nothing to find out side of the bunkers. The bunkers are like cheap fallout shelters with most of the fun and intresting aspects being ruined by how little there is in comparison to simple and easy yet filler puzzles.

Back to the open world, by the time i started seeing the last half of the enemies they were just clustered fucked near the end. I had thought maybe there would be some cool optional bosses or something but no, you get shitty re-spawn towers where you accidental end up farming farming because there really isn't much fun outside of that.

Everything outside of the bosses are just your average generic enemies, i was hoping some of the larger machines would get sprinkled around but nope.

Do not buy unless its on sale. It's pretty obvious this is just DLC 1 setting the foundation for it's future lazily cut DLC. They're playing the long game of minimal content, filler to the sky, wait for DLC for more short fun.

Now onto the weapons. Basically every gun has a direct upgrade as you unlock them, making the previous weapons pointless to use. They really should've added more elemental damage and need to have certain weapons. All you need is AK and Rail gun. 

The one thing they did right was the got dam twins, i got fucking baited and ill admit it. I'm sitting around for the next Stalker release, i wont be touching this again besides its soundtrack.",1677238954,1689067429,False,6,2,0.440563410520553589,0,True,False,False

and here is why:

1- The game was heavily advertised as the holy grail of Ray Tracing since its early announcement in 2018.
in fact it was on the list of supported RTX games the first time Nvidia announced RTX 2000 series. and the game had even a demo at one point with RTX support and it looked great. so to pull the trigger on that feature silently after marketing it heavily is scam thingy. 

2- in terms of the story (which is decent overall) there is 2 events that make 0 sense and never explained properly by the game (the first is the death of Petrov ""when u find him the first time headless"" and the 2nd point is that Larisa never thought about why the bloody robots been attacking everyone but not her and Petrov until P3 mentioned it to her) and she was like wait a min... that is true...... for fuck sake writer.... come on man what kind of a stupid writing is this?

This game is really not what I was expecting it to be. I came into it with the assumption that it would be quite linear. That type of game similar to Doom(2016). But it surprised me.

[h1] Gameplay - Fast Paced and Frantic [/h1]
This game brings in elements of a semi open world which was quite cool. But I didn't really find myself exploring that much of it to be honest. I didn't feel like there was actually much to do. There are 'Testing grounds' which you can go an complete. But I mostly just stayed on the objectives and didn't really stray far off it. 

When going round each section you're able to find resources and upgrade your skills and current weapons. I like that you can choose and build up to weapons that you want to craft which is nice and lets you explore a lot more with your own combat style. Of course each enemy has its own vulnerabilities and you'll learn to choose which weapons work for you. I found myself using melee a lot apart from when it comes to boss fights.

I do like the amount of mini and main boss fights in this game. It provides you with quite a challenge sometimes. However something that really annoyed me is that before a boss fight the machine is there for you to change your loadout and such. But the thing is you don't know what boss is coming and you don't know vulnerabilities and since there's no save point before the fight you can't load back to before the fight starts and have the chance to change. I know for some people they won't save for ages they'll get to this point and be like oh there goes all my progress now. Just to change my loadout. 

Another slightly annoying thing is I couldn't figure out if you could even skip cutscenes. Especially with loading in and out of checkpoints. This becomes annoying watching the same scene happen again and again. 

Overall though the combat is fun and a little scary sometimes. Make sure you're always moving and don't get stuck against a wall that happened a lot to me. 

[h1] Story - Not worth it [/h1] 

This is the biggest part of the game where I wished a neutral button existed. This game is really not worth it for the story. A lot of the time to me it felt incredibly rushed an many cutscenes including the end. So much went unexplained and leaves you questioning a lot. I don't know if they're planning a sequel but it really felt they were sequel baiting way too hard. 

[h1] Overall - Combat fun, but I wish the story was done [/h1]

For the gameplay I think it is worth picking up. It is fun to play and challenging at times. But for everything else meh

On first glance it seems like a solid mashup, a bit RPG, a bit Bioshock, a bit classic FPS, a bit Parcours, a bit puzzle.
But this at times borderline weird setting, top notch creative art, good Graphics and a unique (fascinating) style very easily makes it stand on its own feet.
Small Details like looking at Posters etc. and getting a short translation on-screen all add up, very nice.

Maybe the only recommendation would be to check out at least one of the existing Guides about important in-game details that could be overlooked. This will still avoid spoilers but greatly smoothen progress and maximize your experience.
I didn't and missed a few Details - but thanks to the in-game replay Option with retained Progression against harder enemies I catched it all during the 2nd run.

On top, it all goes along with a thorough sense of humor - be it one doorlock or laser puzzle too many or the commentary a friendly Tereshkova gives off :)

Even if you experience too many ""NOMEP"" events (you'll find out lol) - the Game acts rather friendly and typically doesn't set you back by much.
One recommendation of mine is not to treat this Game like any other, be it in regard to robotic enemies that resurrect (under certain conditions) or some enemies feeling ""spongy"" because you haven't mastered the Combat System yet (and might simply use the wrong types of Weapons). Once you understand how it all works (it's fairly simple), you'll be good.

Many features that were missing at first were latter added in so that you wouldn't have to go third party route, thankfully as well.

Mostly everyone is saying this is Soviet Bioshock, and that's in the absolute best way possible. With plenty of customization options for builds and weaponry. Thankfully enough you can experiment however you choose as you are free to re-spec your ability points when you want to without restriction. 

Pros +
- Graphically solid
- Fun Combat
- Varying areas
- Multiple Types of Enemies
- Multiple Powers/Weapons
- Fairly good Story (This kept me wanting to further explore this universe and actually see the conclusion.)
- Phenomenal world building from the start (advisable to read the lore if that interests you.)

Cons -
- English VO can be a bit off in terms on inflection and delivery. (After completing the game, P3 gets better but the English delivery is very cringe inducing early on. 
- Fairly Linear, much like Bioshock 1. (This isn't the worst thing by far and the pace has been held well. I would have liked more of this world to explore in each area)
- Strafing is particularly slow. It feels clunky due to this in the movement department, but you are supplemented with a quick charging dodge. So this was probably by design. 

This has so far been such a solid recommend and it feels so close to bioshock that it might as well exist in the same universe.

There is DLC planned out with three more expansion. During this update as of 7/9/2023 one has been released out of the four planned, 

The game is such a good single player experience, I absolutely recommend this to anyone who even relatively enjoyed the Bioshock series, or are just looking for a new single player game. I humbly believe this is worth your time.

You are Nu-Booker Dewitt, a protagonist that might have been reused from a discarded draft of Bioshock Infinite that was dug up from Ken Levine's trashcan over at Irrational Game's office. You're a dedicated Russian/Communist agent with an almost fetish otaku love for your handler, who I cannot remember because they really weren't all that interesting even though being a super major part of the story. The game welcomes you, it's journeyman the player to a hyperbole grandiose Soviet Union set in the theme of Futurism wrapped in a flag of Communist fervor. You are impressed by the opening walking simulator portion of the opening game, a pair of very attractive ballerina twins, (which if you had bought the game based on this hook, shame on you and shame on me) Clap. 

Robots soon go awry on a proportional level that rivals Itchy & Scratchy Land. Something is a foot, and the futurism of Atomic Heart goes into overdrive. Suddenly you are thrust into 'hand-holding' cutscenes and pointless dribble written in hairdresser machines that act like diaries of no-name characters who add no value to the story whatsoever. 

PERFORMANCE 

At this point, Atomic Heart the game has either crashed my game numerous times, locked me in place, or made my weapons unchangeable. Still I pressed on, because like many of you, I saw something gleaming in all this concept, I could feel that developers really wanted to make something here. 

OPEN WORLD

The open world portion of atomic heart is fairly straight forward, but nothing too grand to be impressed about lurking in its vista, except maybe, a building dedicated to the developers of the game which was a fun treat to explore. 

GAMEPLAY

Long review short, the game drops many of its red apple balls, scenes with long dialogue locking characters in place, more walking simulators, and silly puzzles or fetch quests which for this type of game really distracted from the atomic heart and core of the matter here. 

Boss battles were fun, but the robotic bosses were uninteresting, except for the twins which was a fun treat, I feel the game should have been filled with many fun treats, alas it wasn't so here. 

CONCLUSION

The story overall could have been fleshed out better; for something with a high-concept as this game, it should have been equal if not the most important factor in its development, but it feels like the developers had no one with such talent, someone to write something to complement the visionary example set by the game's opening.

I think the story ended somewhat abruptly, I thought that I had at least a few more hours of story/gameplay left before the final fight. It just didn't feel like things were addressed or wrapped up like you would normally expect, it's a serviceable conclusion, but only just barely. But the biggest reason I am rating this game as not recommended is because I just don't trust the developers and I think they are terrible at communicating with the public.

The biggest thing is that they removed ray tracing from the PC version and saw fit not to announce it, Rock Paper Shotgun had to ask them to get clarification after they announced that the console versions would not feature any RT. To this day, they have never said anything officially other that they are considering adding it. This wouldn't be as big of a deal if they wouldn't have marketed the game as featuring RT for YEARS. I know a lot of PC gamers don't care about ray tracing and think it kills performance with little to no benefit in visual fidelity, but that's not the point. The point is that they advertised features that never shipped with their game AND chose to keep silent about why, while never saying if/when the game would be updated to include ray tracing.

Now let's talk about the version of the game for Steam Deck, when the game launched- you could run it at nearly 60fps with medium settings using FSR Quality mode. I will give it to Mundfish, this game runs exceptionally well to be using Unreal Engine, they did a great job on the technical part of the game. Respawn and Avalanche (Jedi Survivor/Hogwarts Legacy) could learn a thing or two from these guys about how to ship a game that is not a stuttering mess. So what's the problem then? They decided to completely remove any and all display/graphical settings from the Menu on the Steam Deck version, so you couldn't adjust shadow quality or even the game's resolution or anything related to those types of things. I have never seen any developer do something like this on the Steam Deck. Eventually, after some media attention and angry owners of the game spoke out on twitter, they decided to bring back the graphics/display settings. But wait, it gets better- this time they chose to lock the frame rate to 30fps (even though the game could run at 60fps with the right combination of settings/resolution/FSR). 

I get that many people don't care about the Steam Deck or ray tracing, which is fine. But those two issues alone were enough to make me want to leave a negative review. I will change it back to positive if they ever fix the Steam Deck version and tell people why they removed RT (and if PC players will ever get the option or not).",1688781389,1688781389,False,2,0,0.525091946125030518,0,True,False,False

Flip Magnets, Pull platform and put ball in socket. There is only so much you can do with that and despite their best efforts the devs could not make it interesting for long. Some Dungeons are Obstructed and require some thinking on your part to actually get in. The game respects you thus far but then throws you into the same ""turn platform until you get through"" Puzzle you feel like you´ve completed 5 times already.

The Open world isn`t really open, not to mention the Map lacks basic features youd expect in a 40€ game. The overworld is there, there is is just nothing to do except go to the next dungeon. The Travel is horrendous. Sure there is 1 car you can use which has been copied 2000 times. But there is ""roadblocks"" everywhere and the NPCs just charge at you. Also terrain youd expect to be destructable isnt and your vehicle will just come to a dead halt. Running past everything is more advisable. especially since everything respawns endlessly anyway. Why engage in combat if it only drains rescources?
Especially near the endgame this becomes horrendous. You cant walk 20m without hitting a patrol. Its not fun after the fifth time. You will build Conga lines behind you.

There is also a climbing mechanic. Think of it like Homeopathic Uncharted. It completely breaks the flow of the game and sometimes barely works.
 
The Story is forgetable and predictable, the companion is the most fun part of the game and is really held back by the protagonist, ""crispy critters"" if you know what I´m saying. Dialogue can be fun when it´s not cringe inducing, but more often than not the overworld dialogue gets interrupted and not resumed when things happen at times.

The combat is solid. You can Min Max against each enemy according to your strenght and their weaknesses or Brute force your way through any and all encounters. But it also gets repetitive after a while.

Thats the thing, the repetitiveness. This game loops back so often on itself it makes fun of itself for it on more than one occasion. I really have to make myself play more because I want to get my money´s worth out of it. Right now I´d rather write this fuckin review.

I want to love this game because of its unique setting, but it is a complete mess. Playing Atomic Heart feels like playing through a pastiche of every remotely popular Single Player FPS of the past 30 years (Cyberpunk, Bioshock, Resident Evil, Prey, Uncharted, etc.). 

Plot wise, there is some really interesting ideas, but its strung together in such a linear and jarring way that it feels like you're being read a children's book. Games like Bioshock are interesting narratives because you are not spoon fed the story, but rather experience it through the environment and level design. Atomic Heart felt like it wanted to have be a character drama, choices matter story, political intrigue, detail sci-fi, alternative history, and cosmic horror all at once, but managed to do none of them. 

The gameplay is decent, but the weird combination of puzzles, bullet sponge enemies, and ultra linear level design leave the second half of the game feeling like a bit of a chore. The open world felt pointless to explore because there was no way to stop enemies re-spawning for more than a couple minutes. Stealth was also non-existent, and levels were ultra linear. 

Style wise, the art and music direction is phenomenal. The setting is a fun and fresh idea. But the way the gameplay interacts with these elements makes it feel shallow.

Ultimately, this game aspires for the likes of Bioshock and Prey, but despite how much the game tries, it forgets the most important part of an immersive sim, the ability to play your own way. The game being so linear and pulling from so many different popular franchises makes it feel shallow. 

Regardless, its a fun experience, but if you're looking to fill the hole that Bioshock, Prey, or any other immersive sim has left, I don't think you'll find it here. Still probably worth it if its on a good sale. 

All that said, keen to see what the developer does next.",1688645708,1688645708,False,409,10,0.807298898696899414,0,True,False,False

While the game has some noteable flaws they are overcome by polished gameplay and decent storytelling. Overall i think this is a buy, especially if you can get it on sale. 
Pros:
The combat is excellent, it manages to have a fast paced action feel in a shooter while incorporating mmo raid-like boss mechanics, the likes of which i haven't seen before. 
To go with the above the music is excellent. There are combat sequences with music and ambiance that just feel right. 
The graphics are excellent.
The devs definitely have a sense of humor and i appreciated it.
I've seen a lot of critique that p-3 is not a likeable character. I have issue with this in that the player character doesn't have to be likeable, its an absurd requirement. Additionally without delving into spoilers p-3 is a complex person, along with much of the other cast, he has motivations, a past, and is subject to the whims of those around him. I feel like a lot of thought was actually put into his character and i personally appreciated it. 
The game is a decent length, im pretty slow and i did all the optional areas and all the endings at 45 hours. That probably puts someone who just wants to finish it somewhere in the 20-30 hour range. Games can be too long and drug out and Atomic Heart respects that. 
Cons:
The game isnt really open world, sure you are plopped into a somewhat large area that you can explore at your whim, but besides the research facilities there really isnt much to explore. Additionally the main story happens linearly at set designations underground, meaning the main story really isnt tied to the open world in any way, its a clever mechanic if you dont see it for what it is.
I get why they tried the respawning robot system, but it didn't really work. Its just frustrating, and later on they give you a weapon that lets you bypass it, so i think they were aware that it wasn't going to be fun. Trying to loot and figure out where things are while fighting endless robot waves was not fun for me. 
The game lacks polish, there is this area you enter later on where you are supposed to fight waves of monsters, there is heavy music, its pretty apparent its supposed to be a big drawn out battle. Unfortunately the monsters spawned behind the walls so it was pretty underwhelming. There are conversations that get cut off if you move to far from where they are scripted to happen, or if you dont move. Crashes when boss pathing gets messed up. Not indicative of a game with a full box price. 
Some of the story is good and some of it is bad. I appreciate the dynamicness of all the characters in the story, most people aren't just good or evil, it mimics real life. That said the ending felt kind of rushed, you are supposed to feel sorry for characters that you never really built repoire with, or people you did build repoire with kind of just dissapear without any resolution. It points to a game that was probably rushed to completion, and they just had to wrap the story up asap to meet deadlines. 
The beginning is too slow, 1/3 of the game is in a linear ""tutorial"" area. I actually enjoy linear games but it was just too long and too much of a tutorial to be enjoyable.

There are a few bugs that will make you reload your save file and a few questionable design choices that will make you scratch your head. However, the overall the experience was absolutely fantastic. Anyone who likes open world shooter games should give this one a go. It has everything you could want. Excellent gun play, character development, and even a pretty decent story to keep you interested. 



PSA: A good chunk of the story unfolds via ""radio"" communications between characters. These trigger when you reach a certain area and only when you reach those areas. This is a problem in an open world environment. Not because you might miss something but because you might encounter something too early.  This only applies once the game truly becomes a fully open world. Below is a very minor potential spoiler to help mitigate any disjointed story.

[Spoiler] Once you get off the train beware of exploring too far. I would suggest you do not explore past Testing ground 9 until you have advanced the main story past that area. [/spoiler]

CONS
-super short
-no replay ability
-you're CONSTANTLY being chased and it never ends.
-You only use 13 weapons in the game but 5 of them are melee...so not a lot of variety
-kinda felt like a chore to do the 5 extra missions and TO ME they weren't fun

PROS
-The world is amazing and VERY VERY VERY creative
-the story line was fairly good
-when you make your weapons/abilities work together it feels awesome!
-the gore/effects were really good
-the game was pretty well optimized when it came out! and thats saying alot for nowadays

This is an 'everything and the kitchen sink' type of game, FPS mostly, but with puzzles, collectibles, story lines, lore, boss fights, countless enemy types, countless custom weaponry and so on. It's an overwhelming assault on the senses.

It took me 11.5 hours to leave the 'newbie' zone and enter the 'open world' section (oh yeah the game has 'dungeons', too, Skyrim style). It took another 49 to finish everything. What a blast!


[b] The good [/b]

- Performance is [i]excellent [/i] - 100fps average with peaks at 144fps on 'atomic mode' at 1440p with just a 2080 and an i9900 laptop. (pacth 1.8) Never dropped below 80fps, no stutter.
- It's wild, fun, and some of the cut-scenes are the most fun I've played in a game of this style.
- A little creative thinking and a lot of planning means death can be avoided. I counted 12 deaths in total over the entire campaign and all side quests , most of them accidental on normal mode. 
- You can respect your character anytime at no cost. If you for example have a certain build, say 'shield and shock', you can re-spec in seconds  to 'fire and electricy'. Weapons can be re-specced in seconds, too. Very useful as the game requires it to an extent
- everything , and i mean EVERYTHING in the game wants you dead. Keeps you on your toes.


[b]the not-so good[/b]

- There is a bit too much vulgarity to my taste, seems a bit immature - I'm 45, not 15 anymore, but hey.
- The dungeons are a bit repetitive conceptually.
- It's good to be able to re-spec, but for the OCD population wanting to 100% ace the game, you'll find yourself having to do a bit too  much .
- The game mechanics DEMAND to be respected. ""resistance to fire"" means ""almost immune to fire"". It can be quite tricky to adjust to coming from other titles.


[b]worth mentioning[/b]

Yes the game is a bit immature in terms of dialog but it's not all bad. Because..and more importantly: 
- ZERO WOKE BS
- ZERO WOKE BS
- ZERO WOKE BS


[b]Conclusion[/b]

I wish this game was 150h. In reality, even if you're OCD and collect/search everything, you'll find yourself near-invincible by hour 25 and will finish the game by hour 50. And by that I mean 100% ace it, complete all side missions, dungeons, get all the guns, collectibles and find all the secrets. 

AH is  a return to the glory days of PC gaming, its' hilarious, enemies are varied, gun play is fun and feels right, strategy and planning matters, performance is excellent, and you won't see the time pass.

You're supposed to be able to stealth, but the only opportunity to sneak behind an enemy is in a scripted tutorial sequence - but even then the game doesn't make it clear what it expects you to do after you activate the stealth attack and I had to watch a Youtube video to figure out that they expect you to tap E repeatedly afterwards.

You get a scanner at the start of the game, which is supposedly able to show enemies through walls etc. .. so you try to sneak around corridors, scanning, only to have an enemy that the scanner did not show burst through a door when you walk past it.

In the first 110 minutes I have seen *exactly one* enemy model, the emotionless Günther from the screenshots. Sometimes he wears a black suit. The combat seems kinda bad. I've only been swinging an axe around because I've found a total of 16 shotgun shells during the time I've played the game.

Every single time you activate the slightest thing there's a scripted even where the devs are trying to make you go ""WHOAH THAT WAS AMAZING"" but end up with you just going ""jesus when will these assholes stop with this shit and let me play the game"" instead.

Atomic Heart is very much like Bioshock. You have abilities and an arsenal of weapons to use. If you liked Bioshock and its gameplay loop, I would say this game is for you. Atomic Heart is a good game and worth the price (especially if you get this on sale). There are many things that could have been better, but this is a solid and fun game. The bones of this game are strong and I look forward to a sequel.

THE GOOD:
- Combat
What can I say? It feels like Bioshock. Using guns in conjunction with your abilities while dodging hits is satisfying.

- Loot
Looting feels great! You gather materials for crafting items via hand vacuum, which is so much fun. I wish more games did something like this. You can then use said materials for upgrading weapons and skills to fit your playstyle.

- Graphics
The game looks fantastic! The open world is so beautiful which adds to the joy of exploration. The only drawback for me was how faces were recycled all the time. NPCs all looked the same. But you hardly spend any time around these generic NPCs so I suppose it doesn't matter. It just felt worth pointing out.

- Customization
Lots of available upgrades for weapons, this is great! Although ability upgrades didn't have that same impression on me. As they pretty much only upgraded skills in things like more damage, faster cooldown, etc. Skill upgrades didn't really change the function of skills like I hoped they would.

THE NOT SO GREAT:
- Characters
I didn't really like the protagonist and found him to be quite an asshole.

- Dialogue
There is such thing as too much dialogue. There's so much exposition dumping that after a while I found it draining. Though I did sort of enjoy the banter between Char-less and P-3. I also wish Nora has more interesting things to say, as she basically says the same thing over and over.

- Story
It took too long to really get interesting. And when it finally does, you're near the end of the game. The rising action and climax of the plot is short-lived.

- Combat
Wait, didn't I say combat was good? While the combat is generally fun for the most part. It lacks weapon and skill variety. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty and the guns/energy guns felt pretty underwhelming compared to melee. The Zvezdochka + Electro combo was just too effective and completely overshadowed everything else in the game. It even overshadows the heavy weaponry of the game such as the launcher or railgun.

Additionally, skills could've had more variety I basically used Mass Telekinesis the entire time. Having a little more skill variety would have definitely made the experience much better and opened the game up more to different playstyles.

Lastly, I'd say this game needed much more damage types available to the player. As you pretty much are limited to the cartridges for your damage type variety. If you didn't know, cartridges are a consumable item that adds elemental damage to your weapons. In which there are only 3 cartridges in the game: fire, shock, frost (why aren't there explosive or acid cartridges? Some enemies appear to be weak to those)

Exploration:
- This is really frustrating. Enemies infinitely respawn in the open world. While it is possible to stop the respawning for 15-20 mins while simultaneously temporarily disabling robots in the area. It still felt frustrating with having to deal with so many enemies when all I wanted to do was explore the open world. It's an interesting concept, but it could've been done in a less frustrating way. Maybe make it much harder to stop respawning bots in the area but make it a permanent effect. That way players wouldn't feel discouraged from exploration.

CONCLUSION:
I had many things to criticize about the game. But despite all that, I think Atomic Heart is a great game and I genuinely enjoyed playing. Atomic Heart has a solid foundation and is worth the asking price.

This game would have been a lot better if it had just been linear. The open world takes it from being great to merely being good, given how rapidly enemies respawn and the relative lack of interesting things to see. 

The actual story missions themselves are full of cool visuals and concepts, and have some pretty satisfying puzzles and combat encounters. The open world takes these encounters and makes them tedious by functionally giving them no end. Enemies will pursue you across the map, and they will respawn the moment your back is turned. This is all explained in lore, and I understand the feeling they were going for, but it just throws the pacing off and makes the game a few hours longer than it realistically should be.

This system of avoiding cameras and enemies littered around make for horrible exploration as it's punished with horrible unending combat. Killing enemies is often inevitably viewed by cameras, which spawns more enemies and cameras, always including enemies that rapidly revive enemies you've killed already. This combined with spongy enemies leads to this horrible cycle that is only compounded by the egregious checkpoints. The exploration is pretty but there's no meat to it, it's all beautiful set dressing and no more. The English VA was not only given awful dialogue but directed so bad sometimes it's honestly pretty funny, which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't TALK SO MUCH. It's like Marvel dialogue at 1.5X speed. The story has such a killer opener too only to turn into keys jingling in front of the players face leading you to your next checkpoint. The weapon balance is all wrong as well but it's mostly just bloated. The puzzles, while a nice idea, often feel dragged out akin more to padding than something genuinely tickling my brain.
     There is a lot of good to this game despite all of that, mainly the style, gunplay, and music. This game has excellent art direction that really pulls a lot of the weight, the environments look great and enemy design is so cool I don't think I've seen such creative bots in a game. The gunplay, although unbalanced and often frustrating because of the systems mentioned before, is satisfyingly brutal. The weapons themselves look and sound properly devastating. The story occasionally made me grin as it caught me off guard but only rarely. The soundtrack is some of Mick Gordon's best and when the combat music and animations all work, it's a really good time. I can't stress enough how great the core combat is and it's a shame it's so wasted on such poor systems that actively work against it.

I would not recommend it 
First, the game was crashing a lot, but after days of following help forums I think I found out why.  Someone said it was an overclock in MSI Afterburner. When I removed my slight overclock, no more crashes.  No problem with any of my other games, though. Thank you unknown person. I am still running it in dx11, and it works. That was one of the many things I tried to keep it from crashing constantly.

There is no ability to save as you go along. Once again, for some unknown reason, the developers have save points, although as the game goes on, they have more so it's not too awful, but still not great.   Now since I've progressed in the game, I'm even more certain this game is a pain in the butt. I'm in testing ground 8.  Now I have to climb all over the place to find the way out, but if I die, I go all the way back because there is no place to save. This game sucks. 

Way too many locked doors and annoying shifting room puzzles. It's  more of a puzzle game than it is a shooter. The dream sequences are just stupid plus annoying.   
The long and annoying cut scenes don't help to make it a fun experience. They even have a couple of elevator rides that take a minute. You sit there and just wait, I guess for ""reality"".
 
I don't mind the dead people conversations, and you have to go through some of them because, at least in one case I found so far, if you don't, you're stuck. That's when you have to give three objects to a robot. You also have to talk to one to get a door open.

The AI is very good, though, and the graphics are good.

Best if you buy it at 50% off or more if you decide to buy it.  Then may be worth it if you like puzzles.   I don't see why so many liked it.  The ending was a joke. There are two endings. I didn't bother finishing as I thought it wasn't worth the effort.

You know those games with creative writing that ends up being the most unbearable thing you've heard? Well, not Atomic Heart. The writing's actually the right brand of quirky, which is not easy to achieve.

The combat is pretty hyper. Not DOOM level of moving around, but combining abilities and weapons on the fly is incredibly satisfying. Especially on the kickass soundtrack.
 
Another thing I like is the main character's voice. A lot of games with a male lead tend to have that Geralt of Rivia raspiness which is great... for Geralt of Rivia.

The game does a good job of making sure you never actually feel safe. This is supposed to be a dystopian Soviet world and boy does it feel like it. I absolutely love the atmosphere of this game.

     Gameplay is actually quite linear despite technically being an open world. There is no real ""clearing"" of areas because enemies can infinitely repair so it really is a matter of running from one point of relative safety to the next. I have read many complaints about the story, but I actually like it, you never really know quite what is going on above you, which is very Soviet. 

     All things considered, this is absolutely a buy, but I would say wait for a sale. $60 seems steep for the base game. As they add more DLC this might change, so probably buy the Gold Edition.

I'm writing this review because I've seen so many negative things said about this game that almost dissuaded me from purchasing this masterpiece and guaranteed is dissuading others.

This game is incredible. It's one of the most unique pieces of art I've ever played. I'm a huge bioshock, fallout, and wolfenstein fan and playing this is like a breath of fresh air. If you like any of those games, seriously consider this one.

First off the art style and visuals are amazing and in some instances absolutely captivating. The intro area had me hooked immediately in that regard as you walk around during a massive parade in the futuristic alternate soviet union. While I was walking around I stumbled upon a robot dj playing a banger phonk track and instantly knew I had made an excellent decision buying the game. That brings me to my next point:

The soundtrack. Wow. The games soundtrack is phenomenal especially if you enjoy electronic music. From the combat music that plays, to the radio, and the songs that play in the testing centers its just incredible. 

Then of course you have the crowd pleasers with the Twins and NORA which is hilarious btw, crazy ass fridge.

But the combat in this game personally I feel is where it shines the most alongside everything mentioned above. It's basically Bioshock combat brought into the modern age, totally revamped but still unique. I've seen a lot of people complaining the game is too hard and this had me concerned at first, despite having beaten each bioshock entry on its hardest mode. I still took the plunge of trying this game on hard too and yes, at first it's hard but so is bioshock. As you level up you end up becoming a robot killing god so it kind of baffles me to see how many people complain about the games difficulty. I'm thinking maybe people aren't using the right abilities/weapons, or are playing on a higher difficulty than they can handle but if you use shok, freeze, and telekinesis you will find yourself in a strong position to handle pretty much anything the game throws at you until you get the weapons you need. And once you get the fat boy and the zvezdochka plus upgrades it's game over.

The other things I keep seeing people complain about are the main character and the open world aspect. Honestly, neither of these have been that much of an issue for me. The main character can say dumb things but it's not that big of a deal imo. I don't mind him being a jarhead character because that's kind of what he is anyway. I haven't found it to be detrimental but I keep seeing so many people whine about it. Also the open world, yes it's a hostile open world. However, I've found that if you move to objectives either story or the optional testing centers for upgrades and loot as you go without mindlessly wandering around, you'll be fine. Again, not that big of a deal.

Overall, the game is absolutely fantastic and goty material for me personally. I highly recommend this one and would also recommend you to try it out rather than listen to people whine about things that can be trivialized.",1687970468,1687970468,True,64,0,0.780880272388458252,0,True,False,False

This also isn't the first time there's been a the ""bad guys"" win alternate universe, Wolfenstein did it with the Nazis, Fallout sort of does it with the Chinese (or more accurately no one won there).

The game is a mess. The ideas are decent, but the execution is problematic. Functionally I have had it CTD on average every [strike]6[/strike] 5 or so hours of play time ([strike]4 times in 23[/strike] 5 times in 26 hours), and with no way to save outside of specifically designated save spots, this has made me replay the same section a few times. The loot collecting animation is fun at first, but it's terribly glitched, I've had objects just hang in mid air because the looting animation didn't actually give those particular objects gravity after you sucked in everything else of actual value. Even with the 'polymer' meant to defy gravity the graphical glitch was a bit jarring.

Rather than progress with the main story, I decided to hunt upgrades to my gear [spoiler](A choice I made after getting my a** handed to me my first time trying to fight Hedgie)[/spoiler] This meant me exploring some areas sooner than I otherwise would and the difficulty spikes were an issue, but the real issue is the sheer number of seemingly infinitely spawning repair bots in the open world, repairing everything you kill it, sometimes as fast as you can kill them. The repair bots only don't seem to repair themselves, but they don't need to, another swarm of 3 or 4 will be launched if you kill off the last one every single time. This sidequesting hunt brought up two other issues in the game though, first is some of the puzzle rooms were not thought out well. In some cases I think I skipped the intended solution and found shortcuts, in others those shortcuts I did find made it impossible to continue, I had found my way to an  area I shouldn't have been able to reach by jumping and dashing around an obstacle. The second issue is that at one point the game messed up where I was in the main quest. I was getting calls from [spoiler]Petrov, a man who was supposed to be dead, [/spoiler] and the player character just had an attitude with him and accepted it. This wasn't the only dialogue issue, a few times the PC and CHarles have commented on noticing some item, that they shouldn't even know they were looking for, because like a lot of players I live by the creed the right way is the last path you take when in 'dungeons' and I hadn't seen why I needed for example [spoiler] a Tereshkova's arm,[/spoiler].

The puzzle and platforming designs are pretty good, I've heard some complaints about some puzzles, but there are more than enough hints on those if you pay attention. I am not sure but I believe the magnetic poles are backwards sometimes, - attracting - instead of +. The player character is a bit off, swinging between unflinching, almost fanatic, loyalty [spoiler]that I and Charles both think is misplaced[/spoiler] and a bad attitude at the drop of an ushanka.

The worldbuilding is great,  I like it probably better than Bioshock Infinite, though it could use more travel between flying parts of the complex. Mostly I am enjoying the game, but there's some pretty glaring holes that need to be fixed, both in the programming and in the writing, which is why I don't recommend this game until they fix those issues.  I am writing this after yet another CTD is probably going to force me to replay the last 20+ minutes of the game, so take that as you will.",1687913647,1687919596,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It starts out pretty strong as a typical corridor shooter, and that really is where this game shines the most. But then it drops you into an open world after the first two levels. First of all, this open world sucks. It has too many enemies running around in it that all take way too long to dispose of. It also has way too many security cameras set up literally everywhere that send bots after you if they catch you. So, you have enemies and security cameras, just like the linear levels, except now they're tediously spread out over an unnecessary open world. What the hell kind of game design is this? Seriously, what does it add other than wasting your time? The elemental power-ups are cooldown-based instead of being on a shared resource meter like in Bioshock, which means more often than not you're just spamming the abilities off cooldown instead of employing strategy and using the powers in clever or unique ways. And they're pretty much all airlifted from Bioshock and made worse. 

And then we get to the more superficial aspects. Firstly, the voice acting. The person they chose to represent Agent P-3, is awful and clearly not the right casting. Why not just do what Metro did and have everyone running around with faux Russian accents? Playing in Russian is more tolerable, but P-3 is still unnecessarily rude to everyone, including his AI glove. Ok with that out of the way, I have to explain my biggest gripe, which is that shooting robots, just isn't fun. I'm sorry, it's not. It doesn't feel satisfying to do anything other than whack them with your axe. My primitive bloodlust simply isn't satiated watching these robots die, especially because they are super spongy. Which reminds me, don't play on Armageddon difficulty unless you hate yourself. All it does is beef up the enemy health 2-3 times, nerf your defenses 2-3 times, and also increase the number of enemies. Now this isn't COD where you never worry about ammo, in this game you actually have to conserve ammo because pick-ups are rare. Which means using your dinky energy weapons or using your melee which also take forever and just drag out the process.

Oh and that stupid fridge/twins sexual shit. Don't even get me started. I think the target audience of this game is something like 12 year olds who think sex is funny. I don't mean sexual jokes, I mean the kind where you just say ""sex"" and they start bursting out laughing. And I'm not against sexual jokes at all but at least make them funny or entertaining, the fridge thing just creeped me out and it was super annoying because you can't turn off the dialogue while upgrading your shit. 

If you see this ""game"" as more of a self-indulgent art project or tech demo, it begins to make more sense why so much of it was copy-pasted from better games. it's really a presentation-first kind of media.

Atomic Heart is a thrill ride with great gunplay, cool abilities, arresting visuals, good atmosphere, decent exploration, punchy evolving guns, and a creative sci-fi world brimming with technological wonders. 

It pretty much is a superior Bioshock: Infinite, and unlike Bioshock: Infinite ( as much as I enjoy it too ), the upgrades actually alter the appearance of your weapons for damn once. That isn't the only thing I liked, but it's the first thing I noticed about the weapons and upgrades.

You get the usual goodies to find, which I found enjoyable to collect due to the gravity-glove style interaction of holding down the use key to force open cabinets, drawers, storage containers, and more to suck up crafting components or upgrade parts. Yeah, every game these days has to have crafting, upgrades, and whatever, but Atomic Heart does it well by offering a decent selection of upgrades and weapons. Nothing we haven't seen before though.

The game is somewhat linear, but not too linear, it rewards poking around into various rooms off the beaten path, and it's a world so breathtaking that I want to explore it a lot. At some point, things open up and you get open world sections connecting each major indoor area. From the first minute, you are immersed as much as an immersive sim can possibly immerse you, into a Soviet world of technology and utopia. But, there is a rotten core here full of contradictions and problems, and as per Bioshock or immersive sim tradition, things hit the fan!

Out in the open world sections of the game, you will find little dungeons that each have their own unique puzzles, rewards/loot, and encounters. They are a lot of fun and add a lot to how rewarding exploration can be. The open worlds themselves are filled with enemies or stuff to see. I don't like how enemies basically respawn infinitely, due to repair bots, but overall it's a stunning world I want to sink my teeth into. The open world is the weakest part of the game, but hardly that bad.

As you progress, you fight bosses like many other games, but these bosses are actually quite awesome and memorable, they all have unique mechanics or behaviors.

The music and audio is amazing. Apparently, Mick Gordon did the soundtrack and whatnot, and I can really tell. It really gives us this feeling of a technological utopia gone wrong.

Combat is pretty good and satisfying. Some of the enemies are quite bullet spongey... but they are robots, honestly if they weren't bullet spongey then something is wrong quite frankly. Parts of them fall off in glorious and surprising detail as you battle them and damage them. Enemy variety is damn solid.

The story is pretty interesting, but the main character is an unlikable piece of garbage. The voiceacting is okay and feels kind of off... leading me to believe it's all translated from Russian. I mean, of course it is. I am led to believe that they are trying to make the main character, Agent P-3, into the next Duke Nukem or Caleb from Blood. Because he is a wise-cracking action hero through and through.

The gameplay is probably one of the best parts of the game, the different abilities and weapons work so well together, allowing you to hack down evil communist robots with the utmost joy, additionally, all of the music in the game is incredible, from the OST to licensed music, it's all been crafted and picked very well to naturally fit into the game world. And the story, the story while it starts out pretty slow, it is pretty good. while it's not the best story in the world, it's a decent one, there are twists and turns, and the ending alone is something I was not anticipating, totally took me by surprise.
As for the bad:
The dialog and voice acting can get very irritating and annoying. This may just be the English voice acting, but I personally found all the back and forth and corny one-liners from the protagonist to be very annoying, with constant quips each time he defeats one robot, hell, every other minute. Additionally, I found the open world segments more irritating than fun; security cameras litter every other lamp post, keeping you either constantly on the run with no time to get your resources in order, or constantly fighting enemies that will just be repaired in five seconds by the repair drone.Z

Overall, Atomic Heart isn't a perfect game, it has its own flaws that depending on your preference, may be a turn off. But I recommend giving Atomic Heart a chance, the gameplay itself is quite fun, and you'll feel accomplished once you defeat a group of enemies or beat a boss; and you just have to experience this OST in game for yourself. So all in all, if you have 60 dollars that you're looking to spend, Atomic Heart isn't a terrible choice, but you should consider waiting for a sale to get this game.",1687286831,1687901095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is fun, although a little jank at times in melee, but mostly takes some getting used to. Guns feel fantastic, and powers are fun to us.

Story seems engaging enough for what it is. Only just getting into the game at the moment but I'd highly recommend it to all you lovely people who enjoyed things such as Bioshock.

If you are a fan of running around bashing robot heads, performing feats with your glove superpowers, occasional quips/humour, fighting interesting boss battles, and solving puzzles that actually make you think, then this game is for you.

[hr][/hr]

To start, we have the gameplay, and it is juicy. One of the greatest features this game has to offer is the ability to break things down to their components and be able to build whatever you want with it. Not only that, but you can break down upgraded weapons and powers [b]for 100% of their value for free[/b]. This means that you can change your loadout on a whim. The combat feels really good. There is actual weight behind the melee swings, and the hits are satisfying. The powers feel great too. The boss battles are really interesting and engaging, with a prime example being the early boss [spoiler]PT-1X12[/spoiler], which had great mechanics and music. The puzzles throughout the game were also really fun to do too. Most of these puzzles are optional, but unlock some gameplay changing upgrades for your weapons. They also have some pretty banger music playing as you try to solve them.

There are a few things that I do have issues with in the game however. I feel like stealth just does not feel worth it. Even the loading screen tip acknowledges this. You just move... so... slowly when stealthed, and it takes so long to pull off a kill. Another minor thing is the achievement tracking. Hopefully this will be resolved, but at the time of writing this, the trackers are a bit finicky with Burning Ears and Necromancer. Sometimes, the collectables don't even show up.

Overall though, this was one of the more enjoyable games that I played. Despite its flaws, I had a blast playing it.

This is the end of my actual review, however below is a more personal experience with the game.

[hr][/hr]

I played this game with the original Russian dubbing with English subtitling. Let's just say that it's leaps and bounds better than the English voice acting. The Russian dubbing also has more feeling into it, like its the person actually talking, and not some person just reading off a script. Some of the stuff they do get lost in translation, but I was still able to understand it for the most part, and I was able to get a chuckle out of the banter.

As I was playing through the game, I recognised the songs that were playing over the loudspeakers and radio. I grew up listening to some of the older songs from the USSR, as well as some of their cartoons and movies (such as Nu Pogodi, Ostrov Sokrovish, and so on). It was part of my early childhood, so listening to those again was pretty nostalgic.",1687836612,1687836679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My greatest, most crippling anxiety is the very real possibility of accidentally saying ""crispy critters"" in a natural conversation. Just a matter of time before a Freudian Slip. 

Anyways this game is weird. The narrative is lame and the main character dialogue is so bad that I modded it out. The open world aspects are mediocre at best, and I was disappointed with the linear nature of the main dungeon levels. This may have been since my expectations were leaning towards something resembling Bioshock, but I hope the DLCs do add more open sandbox areas. 

But I still like this game. Gun play felt good and didn't feel too repetitive unless you chose to aimlessly wander the open world. Gun upgrades actually appearing on your gun as you buy them is a great touch; more games should do this. Enemy design was appealing and creative, and the bosses while a little too easy even on the hardest difficulty, were a joy to shoot up. Also, I adore the way the robots literally fall apart as you deal more damage, Doom Eternal style. While the enjoy the overall art style of the game, I found that installing ReShade presets gave the game much needed color and vibrancy. 

The music in this game is mind-blowingly good. PT-1x12 (Hedgie boss music) is on the same level as Mick Gordons BFG Division and The Only Thing They Fear Is You. Personally, I think it's better than both of those songs. The rest of the remix tracks are all amazing, my personal favorite being Alla Pugachevas ""Arlekino"". Massive props to everyone on the sound team and Geoffrey Day, excellent work.

The quests are so lazy. Most quests are ""go here, pick this"". And they make the player do so multiple times. ""Find 4 containers"", ""Put 3 little balls here"", ""Turn on 2 mirrors"", ""Find 4 robot pieces"", ""Find 3 elements that represent the USSR"" etc...

Exposition is awful. Everyone goes on and on about the things that are happening non-stop. Even in the middle of fights. Characters are bland and one sided. Main character is obnoxious.

The ""open world"" is one of the worst experiences I've ever had. They made so easy being detected, so monsters will attack you on sight. If you kill them, then these medic robots will spawn infinitely, and killing them would increase the alert level. If you don't kill them, they will revive the robots, which probably would spot you again.

You are supposed to hack stuff so these stop spawning, but you need to find some sort of mini control room to do it, but is just not fun. Is easier to run instead of fighting an infinite wave of monsters.

Gameplay wise can be very bad. While basic combat is okay, the game doesn't prepare you fully before fighting enemy bosses. For example, I got stuck with a boss with no ammo, with no possibility for getting ammo from the vendor machine. Luckily, the boss got stuck in a infinite running pattern, so I waited for my energy gun to recharge. Otherwise I would have been soft-locked, as the previous save game was like 4 hours ago.

Also enemies are so bullet spongy, even after all the upgrades. Dashing ability tends to stop working for no reason.

Game pacing is just bad. you finished killing a boss, and then the game makes you fight 8 robots in the very next section. Finished an elevator ride? Okay, shoot this robot when the door opens.

Story is just... okay. Would have been betters if things shouldn't be 'at your face' at all times. I didn't like the ending.

And for the love of god, why an UI element that is clickable is red?

At moments, the game wants to be Farcry, then Bioshock, then Dying Light, then Watch_Dogs. And that means there's enjoyable moments to be had, but they are far in between.

In the end, Atomic Heart is a game that tries to do too much, and fails at most of these. If it wouldn't be for the graphics and art style, it would be a mediocre game.

Also, always online DRM for a single player game. No thank you.

They also included many beautiful soviet songs in original or a metal remix. The story was a bit weird at times but in the end made sense and the ending actually surprised me.

Story:
In an alternate universe the story takes the ""soviet dream"" of building a better and workfree world but perfectly places the human failure and powerhungry politics in it that prevents this world. The world building is further done through audiologs and ""dead"" bodies that you can talk to. There were quite some hilarious dialogues like a dead talking cow that gives you famous history quotes that include a cow. I recommend to play on russian dialoges if you know the language. The russian voice actors did an amazing job. Many people seemend to dislike the playercharacter but i think his reactions were fitting.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is a good old classic shooter with a semi-open world that is mostly skipable if you just want to experience the story. Or you can do optional bunkers for upgrades. The level design reminds me of old shooters with interesting puzzles and enemy encounters. You can loot (in a cool style) many of the desks, chests and other containers for materials to upgrade your equipment and your character. If you want you can even grind stuff on the open world.

Weapons:
The weapons feel really really weighty. I don´t know how it feels to smash a fire axe on a killerrobot. But atomic heart is probably extremely close to that experience. It was fun from start to the end to smash the axe into the robots, your every hit leaving a big robo scar behind. They should add a damage amplifier with the mouse movement in my opinion, that would make the robo slashing even more fun. There are also guns that can be modified a lot like the classic shotgun, AK47 or a railgun. I loved how your glove and your handgun are completely seperated. If you use your ability while ADS the player will hold the gun with one hand in ADS. Nice little detail. The guns are also quite powerful and the ammo is supposed to be scarce. But honestly if you loot a lot and are experienced with shooters you will always have ammo for some gun at least.

Only complaints i had were that there are way too many melee weapons and they all look like duct taped. In an advanced soviet alternate universe they could have included laser swords but instead went for the full rusty look. There are also some annoying situations where enemies trap you into a wall and you can do nothing but slashing your way free.

But those are just some minor things. If you are looking for a good shooter with a very fresh and unused design setting you can do nothing wrong here.",1687203170,1687205306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to like this game, I really did. I gave it every opportunity. I played past the two hour return window even tho I had the urge to stop and just return it, but I liked the concept so much that I forced on the rose-colored glasses and pushed through.

... I shouldn't have.

The concept is wonderful, and proven:
* An aesthetically beautiful world.
* A gun-with-the-right, magic-with-the-left setup that's been successful in the past.
* A skill and weapon tree that allows you to power up things as you go.
* Sexy ballerina robots!
* Who couldn't love such a setup?

Spoiler... me.
This game failed completely in its implementation. I'm not even sure where... If I had to compare it to a movie I guess I'd fire the writer, director and the actors but give awards to the original concept creator, art and sound crews. My specific gripes are:
* The acting is either 0 or 11. Either ""I don't give a damn"" or dragonball Zlevel ""I'VE TAKEN ALL I CAN IT ENDS NOW I'M COMING FOR YOU FEEL MY WRATH AAAAAAAAAAHHH!"" It's like a poorly translated voice-over where the voice actors didn't bother to watch the original and are just phoning it in and working only with the punctuation on their prompts.
* The story, well, sucks. It's not that it's horrible... just completely forgettable. It just never commits to anything and skirts around like someone with ADD tried to write a detective novel.  ""The vat of goo killed him no wait later it will just be a [spoiler]body disposal unit[/spoiler] but no wait these ballerina chicks have to make out to get it to work ooh what if one of them [spoiler]stabbed the other one[/spoiler] no wait ooh what if the special key to activate the goo was in [spoiler]one of their bellies[/spoiler] no wait she has to do a ballet move to USE the key no wait later the goo can [spoiler]become sentient[/spoiler] if it has other goo jump in it!""
* The skill tree and weapon upgrade system fails to matter about halfway through the game. You get to a certain point are either maxed out on the stuff you use or find that the remaining upgrades just aren't worth the trek to the map location where you have to trudge through yet another ""dungeon"" level to pick them up. You wind up running around with a Costo's worth of inventory on your back and nothing to spend it on, yet still religiously looting every damned box you see ""just in case.""
* It's just plain too easy. The first boss is the hardest, but once you figure out the gimmick it's not a problem. And the other bosses don't even have strategy any more. Just load up on [spoiler]health and rockets[/spoiler] and you win everything.
* Nothing COMMITS. Too many spoilers, but long story short each major plot ""twist"" has no effect. There's a voice at some point but you'll never meet them or resolve the story line. An NPC promises you lots of weapons in a cutscene but then dumps you right back in the game with nothing new.... stuff like that. It's like a plot with 20 Jar Jars in it.

Long story short, this might be a cool twitch experience if it were on sale for like $25. Otherwise, I'd pass if you're the kind of person who would rather have a great story and challenge over fancy graphics.",1687192612,1687192855,False,4,1,0.516676664352416992,0,True,False,False

- Can't speak for other languages, but the voice actor for the American version SUCKS

- Tthe head bobbing during the cut scenes and when being hit makes me sick to watch
- The climbing/jumping mechanics need to be ironed out 
- Your character will get stuck in many places, especially platforms
- Dialogue options are not that interesting
- Puzzles are repetitive and kind of stupid
- Pressing/holding the F key to search and collect components makes me feel like they really don't matter, it's more about just holding a key and collecting what's there so I can do some meager upgrades later
- The map sucks and is useless
- The weapons are all meh at best, even with upgrades
- Combat sucks overall.  The dodge mechanic is crappy
- I'd say the game is fairly difficult on the medium setting - robots pummel you pretty fast
- Some of the more ""exotic"" robots are stupid (A saw blade with legs?  Bite me)
- I'm not from Russia, so the music sucks to my ears
- Outdoor scenes are confusing to look at, as well as the sounds being heard - there's no logical association with anything
- It's fairly linear - very little to be explored and nothing open world about it

I have finished the game. This is the most innovative games I have played in a while. Robots are scary in the beginning but as the game progress you will overpower them all by the end of game. Graphics & animations & world are really beautiful. 

The game allows to backtrack into levels as you will open doors that are closed from other side. It kind of remind me of Prey which also allows unlocking levels that were inaccessible before. 

The game can be played twice and you will understand why Charles is saying something so weird and cryptic. You will understated the meaning of conversations better.

 The game glitch at places & it demand more resources because developers have pushed unreal to its extreme and set a new bar for games in 2023.

The game in general is good but its poorly optimized. Randomly Frame rate drops faster than Russian Rubal. Each software update take forever for patching.

One really GREAT thing about it is that if you dismantle an item or want to undo your skills, you can do so and you will get back ALL of the points/resources you used to make it or to get to unlock that skill. Most games will either not let you redo your weapons & skills or, if you do, there is a cost. In this game, there is no disincentive to mix and match your skills and weapons/weapon upgrades whenever you want.

One really BAD thing is the way the climbing and jumping work. If you grab a ledge, there is no way to just let go. You have to turn the camera far enough that your character lets go with one hand and then you can jump away. And sometimes, the game doesn't recognize that you are turned, or you will get stuck moving around a corner or going along a long section.

Another big annoyance is that in the over-world of the game, most enemies that you kill will be repaired and brought back shortly after you destroy them. This means there is no way to ""clear"" an area to allow you to just explore.

And if you are the type that wants to get all of the collectibles, you MUST get everything in the underground centers before you leave because there is no way to backtrack.

And finally, the story. It is fairly interesting, but the ending is just really unsatisfying.

Now to be fair, this world is incredibly well realized, and the art direction is world-class, but there's nothing to do when running 500 meters to the next objective. Yes, there are hidden dungeon-like places where you platform around, trying to find weapon upgrades, but that's the only thing to find, so you end up saying ""well how badly do I need a red dot sight for an AK if it's going to be a half hour slog?"" Because mark my words, this game is a slog after the impressiveness of everything wheres off.

The action is great, shooting feels good, enemies are fun to fight, but when you're not fighting enemies, you're fighting the urge to throw your monitor through a window because our beloved protagonist has said ""CRISPY CRITTERS"" for the 45000th time, and you just opened your 400th lock/puzzle and oops, looks like there's another one right over there blocking progression. Fallout has lockpicking and terminal hacking, and they're tired and boring, but they're also optional (to my memory) and never barred plot progression. Imagine finishing an area in Doom and then the door to the next area won't open because you have to do a sliding block puzzle. There's breaking up the game for pacing reasons, and then there's wasting my time, and this game decided to do the latter.

But probably the final straw: The protagonist. My god, how do you write your main character to be so unlikable and not notice? Language evolved 100,000+ years ago, and nobody has ever said ""Crispy critters"" in place of ""Dammit"" or any other exclamation of frustration. But our guy? Well that's 60% of his dialogue, and the other 40% is calling people liars because the plot is too confusing for him. Comparing this to Bioshock, one of the reasons that plot probably holds up so well is because the protagonist isn't going ""What do you mean? What's going on? Crispy critters, look at that!"" every 3 minutes. Silent protagonists exist to put yourself in their shoes, so you can project onto them. Atomic Heart's protagonist exists to put myself in the hospital after I clawed out my eardrums.

So really, if you can get this for like 30$ or so, then sure, its OK, but for 60$ I could not recommend this. This game definitely took a lot of inspiration from Bioshock, and this game deserves a similar criticism that game got: Would've been better as a movie. And to have the gall to sequel-bait instead of an actual ending? I thought I got some Bad Ending, but no, canon ending not only leaves it open, but the Big Bad gets away and narration that ""wow dunno what happened here but this place is messed up.""

It is not a Bioshock clone, nor is it the love child of DOOM and Fallout. The game holds its own and its definitely an enjoyable play. While the story isn't something completely innovative, the amount of lore it does have keeps you on your feet and is very interesting. There isn't a terribly huge selection of alternate history games out there, so that helps Atomic Heart stand out in that regard. The game play, while somewhat difficult at first, definitely mellows out as you upgrade your character and arsenal. I do not see that as a bad thing as this game has a clear focus on the story aspect of it. If you are expecting a grind fest like Fallout and DOOM, then you will surely be disappointed.

All in all, the game's not very long, i only played so long because i had to backtrack on the overworld to find all the research centers that had the weapon mods that weren't as great as Nora's interface promised. And it was quite fun. I was just hoping for a little more originality and a spiritual successor to Bioshock.

One thing i will give it though, the puzzle solving. There are puzzles to solve throughout the thing, like zelda-esque ones. That was pretty nice. 

Really, i wanted to be around more of the sexy ballerina bots. The trailers made me think i'd be seeing more of those. But no, there's 2 plus a few more that don't really move.",1686519887,1686519887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's also going to depend on your puzzle tolerance. If you are planning to see evrything more or less this game is 40 percent puzzle.

So here's what Atomic heart is good at.

1. It's well optimised and looks good. (AAA devs take note)

2. The world and how it works is fascinating and it's a joy just to be there and walk around in it.

3. Nora is one of the most interesting characters you will meet in a video game this year. Petition for romance option.

4. Flow of combat is enjoyable once it hits its stride and you get enough upgrades.

5. The sound track is weird and wonderful. It's the kind of soundtrack you can listen to for hours on end and not get tired of it. 

Here's what it's not good at. 

1. The main character is a special forces agent but whines like a millennial streamer (I'm a millenial streamer) this is kind of immersion breaking and when the impactful moments happen it's hard to feel anything because it's more of the same. 

2. Atomic heart looks like an immersive sim but this is only skin deep. You will not be able to interact with the environment the way you would expect in an immersive sim.

3. While the world building is really good, the narrative is linear so while  you as the player might want to explore the breadth that the world invites, you will be quickly snapped back to the main narrative. (which sadly includes more of the main character)

4. Infinite spawning enemies in the open areas will annoy many. Once you understand how the ecosystem works it's not so bad, but understanding it takes time. I think most people would have preferred a system where you can subdue an area and make it yours or lower the threat. 

Atomic heart is not game of the year material but its a solid game that isn't mired in technical difficulties. While it doesn't break new ground in game play I don't think anyone can say the world and theming is boring, all this to say that if you look at the trailers and want to explore this world you probably should give it a go. I reccomend playing the game in russian for better immersion. It makes your character more tolerable.

Slight Spoiler if you know what I am referencing (Bioshock)



So heres the thing. The story pissed me off because of how comparable to bioshock it is as far as the tone and the story beats it pulls. The protagonist is annoying as shit but lowkey it does get explained why hes a prick which does not take away from the annoyance of him but does give reasoning. The ending that I got which is the ""good"" ending really pulled this games story for me. It went from a 4/10 story super clique to damn okay 8/10 just because I really did not see the twist coming. The visuals, audio, technical performance, and feel give it a solid 9/10 just because it does really care about the world its in. Overall I would give it a 7.5/10.

Level design - 3/5, just tons of frustrating moments during battles and when climbing - jumping (like you must gen on a ...lamp at some point!)
Weapons 3/5 - half of the weapons are useless, to understand how to manage your weaponry / which keys to use you have to watch Youtube.

I am a fan of the rpg fps due to there needing to be some form of constant progression in my arsenal or abilities needed to keep me entertained and engaged. At the time of this comment I had just finished the game at around 27 hours of play time with light/mid venturing from the path. 

Standouts: 
-Great combat system and GREAT difficulty progression
-MANY save points, this is done amazingly. There are some parts that the save points are spaced more but that is done strategically to be a dial they turn to tweak the difficulty but you can often backtrack to a save point if you need to exit the game or just want to make sure you do not have to go back to collect all of the side things you collected.
-Great job with upgrades for abilities, deconstructing something gives back 100% of materials taken to make it which IS HUGE, making you not have to go and go grind more materials because you upgraded the wrong thing or made the wrong thing.

English voice actors speaking with US/UK accents. Just do what Metro does and speak with eastern euro accents.
Quick time events, especially button-mash style. Ugh.
Pointless generic boring boss fights.
Annoying-ass crafting system with too many components. Let crafting die. Just give me the weapon and let me buy upgrades with 'XP'. Remember XP? It's always worked so well. Why give us single-player 'microtransactions' in in-game currencies? By god.
Invisible walls in the overworld.

Werid-ass setting.
Continuously and utterly disturbing imagery. Everything looks like a dick or a vulva or a face. Or it's just scenery.

The puzzles can be annoying but they do actually enrich the game, there is enough variety for it to not get stale.

One thing that is kind of cool: as you are fighting robots there is something interesting that happens... It's really easy to have suspension of disbelief while you are kiting and cheesing the F out of the game, since they are robots that kinda works. I know I will finish the game, I'm kind of annoyed that I missed some stuff but it seems I can't go back - not sure if I'd replay it since I'm allready playing it really thoroughly (my technique involves killing twice, for reasons I'll let you figure out yourself).

The result: not quite... But its a cool game none the less!

NOTE: I played the game in Russian with English subtitles which I suggest if you dont mind reading subtitles... The English voice acting is really bad.

In truth, the game seems to take inspiration from a variety of different things, at times it feels like Bioshock with the Polymer abilities but then the story structure is somewhat reminiscent of the latest Wolfenstein games.

Set in an alternate 1955 where the Soviet Union becomes the leading world power thanks to the technological and scientific advancements of a select group of polymath scientists. The protagonist or 'P-3' is tasked with exploring the centre point facility of these scientists to discover why robots and mutated plants have started killing people...

The story of course takes twists and turns that one would come to expect. Some of the plot points are needlessly convoluted but overall the story is decent and serves as a convenient framework for the game to take place with a variety of strange game-play mechanics and weapons.

The high point of the game is when the player progresses through the linear underground facility locations, where the story, combat, puzzles and more take place.

The low point is the 'open world' on the surface which is fine but poorly executed. The player will need to get used to the convoluted process of deactivating regions of robots in order to properly explore those regions otherwise the player will constantly be assaulted by enemies. 

Also there are various points of no return which means lots of miss-able collectables.

The Story - Though it definitely is a spiritual successor to the Bioshock series, it's refreshing and interesting enough to commend some good originality. What can go wrong when you are on the verge of setting up the entire Soviet Union with a single human-robot neural network? What happens when someone tries to mess with it? Who is trying to control who? Is everyone actually telling you the truth? Throughout the game, there's loads of great dialogue, tons of recorded audio (much like Bioshock), and plenty of computer terminals to give even more interesting lore. Though some people complain about the writing, I really enjoyed the banter between me and Char-Les, among other characters too, and it honestly never got old. The ending, however... not so much. The end of the game has almost no resolution, more just a ""WTF"" kind of vibe - not quite as cliffhanger-like as Half Life 2: Episode 2, but frustratingly close. Almost like they want to create an immediate sequel, but without any idea whatsoever how.

The Gameplay: I have to admit, this game is hard. Even on ""Peaceful Atom"" difficulty, it definitely had some difficult points. However, I'm actually glad of that decision to skew the gameplay towards the more difficult side. I was kept on my toes, and it only towards the end, when I acquired all the possible upgrades, did it feel somewhat monotonous to destroy the enemies (the boss fights still took quite a bit of effort, though).
The Testing Facilities were interesting to begin with, but once you're at your 4th or 5th facility, the puzzles begin to get a bit repetitive. I'm not saying they're annoying, but don't try and burn through all twelve of them in one go.
Which brings me to the map design. This is one of the rare, excellent executions of a hybrid linear+open map designs in an FPS game. The Testing Facilities are quite linear, but the map in general is wide open and allows for tons of great exploration opportunity, which is also decently rewarded too. The idea of the Testing Facilities tying into the larger map is done very well. It never really felt like a chore to explore all the available areas.
The Weapons + Abilities: I absolutely LOVE the fact that you can return abilties/upgrades/weapons/ammo back into resources without any penalties whatsoever. The game encourages you to try new things, which is the main issue with so many other games (not getting everything back if you want to ""sell"" a weapon or ability or upgrade). This allowed me to experiment with loads of weapons, abilities, etc.
I will say, though, that some need tuning. Frostbite is pretty much useless, while Mas Telekenises is the biggest life saver one can have. Melee weapons are actually quite useful.

The game ran great on my RTX 2080 machine with a 1440p ultrawide. It's by no means a screamer, but it made for a beautiful game that ran smoothly. Bravo to the good optimization team.

The game definitely earned its $2 per hour entertainment value, felt like a solid AAA title, was decently polished (there was only one puzzle I just could not figure out at all, and even after the walkthrough, still was left confused), and had a sufficiently original story to tell.

-Absolutely banger soundtrack
-Great graphics and art direction (Still no Ray Tracing though)

-Endless waves of enemies on the surface which limits exploration...
-...speaking of which, not much to explore anyway except for some bonus challenge stages and chitchatting with some confused corpses
-Forgettable story with lame ending and gaping plot holes
-Confusing crafting and map UI
-Tedious puzzle sections
-Low enemy variety 
-Too short for its price

It was such a description that drew me in when I first heard about Atomic Heart many years ago. And [b]while the finished product doesn't fully hold up to these lofty promises, it's still a solid (and very polished) 7/10 game[/b]. You know: The type of game that's not really a must-play, but good fun for genre enthusiasts.

First of all, [b]Atomic Heart isn't a full-fledged imsim[/b]. It's way closer to [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/8870/BioShock_Infinite]Bioshock Infinite[/url][/i] than [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2]System Shock 2[/url][/i] (in terms of its gameplay design, not the quality of said gameplay). In other words: It's a shooter with some gimmicks and more options for player expression compared to a strictly linear shooter – but [b]you're never really required to engage deeply with this additional layer of player expression[/b]. The map layouts offer some freedom, but after you're finished with a story-relevant section, you typically can't return to those areas (not that there's any reason to return in the first place). Some of the powers you get are pretty original conceptually (shooting goo from your hand comes to mind), but they're very much focused on combat – which makes most of them kinda superfluous because you have plenty of guns that can do the job just as well.

[b]The game does have some truly inspired elements, such as the overall art style and visual design. Or the way it handles audio logs, specifically[/b]: You see, not only do you collect traditional audio logs, but there are also [spoiler]corpses[/spoiler] lying around that [spoiler]retain some of the memories of the deceased thanks to a cybernetic gizmo[/spoiler]. Thus, many of the 'audio logs' in Atomic Heart are actually short and bizarre (in a good way) dialogue sequences, which I think is a great way of making them more engaging.

[b]But for every idea that works, there's another one that just sorta goes nowhere[/b]. For example, many parts of the game are filled with sexual innuendo, from crash-test dummies arranged in suggestive poses and an overly pushy weapons upgrade station to more subtle things like suspiciously-shaped oval doors. These design choices give the entire game a pervasive theme of 'sexual frustration', so I was looking forward to seeing how Atomic Heart would tie this into its narrative. Maybe it would turn out that this was all just a hallucination of our main character, indicative of his own sexual frustrations. Or maybe it's meant to be symbolic of the sexual frustration lurking underneath the clean façade of this highly repressive society? Well, the game does kinda [spoiler]go with the latter explanation[/spoiler], but that information is only explicitly revealed as a side note in an optional area and it really doesn't tie into anything in the greater narrative. It's an omnipresent part of the worldbuilding that ultimately only exists to say: “Ain't that weird, huh?”

All in all, Atomic Heart is a good game, especially as a first outing for this developer. [b]If you’re interested in shooters with some slight imsim elements and unique visual design (and you don't mind some of its ideas going nowhere), you might enjoy Atomic Heart – though there are plenty of games I’d recommend playing before you get to this one.[/b]

Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room, which is the fact that Atomic Heart is developed by a Russian team (masquerading as a Cypriote company) and it’s been released at a time when the Russian government is committing what I and many others believe is an ongoing attempted genocide against the Ukrainian people and their culture. The fact that I've bought, played and enjoyed Atomic Heart should clue you in that I've nevertheless come to the conclusion for myself that the allegations against these devs aren't conclusive enough to tie them to the current political regime. I encourage you to read up on these allegations before buying the game, though, as you might well come to a different conclusion.
What I feel the need to point out to adequately describe the finished product, however, is this: [b]Atomic Heart is set in an alternate-history 1955 Soviet Union, and at least in the first half of the plot, you’ll be bombarded with 'evidence' of how awesome this fictionalised nation is[/b]. In light of the current political and humanitarian situation, it's sometimes hard to stomach reading yet another text log about how alt-history Soviet science is the saviour of the people of the world, or hearing our main character talk about how we should just trust the Soviet leadership. But [b]all of this makes way for much more dystopian themes later in the game[/b]. Even our main character ultimately comes off as a 'useful idiot' anti-hero whose main fault is that he blindly follows the party line against all common sense. Now, I’m not saying it's IMPOSSIBLE to still interpret this fictional USSR as a 'utopia ruined by a few bad apples', if you really want to understand it that way. But the game does give you enough dissenting information to make that reading less valid. I do wish there were more personal stories of dissent and evidence of oppression under this regime (see [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey]Prey[/url][/i]'s sub-plot about future-Soviet forced labour victims), but it's better than nothing, I guess...",1678137494,1685292910,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a sci-fi game set in an alternate past via the USSR in the 1950s. That has a quirkiness to it that I can't quite describe.

For instance, there is a homicidal nymphomaniac vending machine where you can't be sure if it wants in your pants or to murder you horribly (probably both, lets be honest). But you have to talk to it in order to upgrade your gear or buy skills. Other times you'll be talking to dead corpses, including a Cow of all things. As for how it plays, it is fairly smooth.

The combat starts off a little rough. Like a lightweight stepping into the ring to face off against someone above his weight class. But once you start getting some skills, upgrade the gear a bit, and get used to it you start to become more formidable. I mainly kept one melee weapon and three ranged weapons the entire game. Which I think is the way to go. You don't want to overdo it with your inventory, as the space is limited. 

This game claims it is open world, and it is in the loosest sense. This is no RPG or GTA game where you'll find a whole bunch of things to do in the map outside the facilities/polygons you'll be exploring. Nah. If anything, the ""open world"" feels like an oversized dungeon that connects all the other dungeons. The only difference is in the open world you try to keep combat to a minimum trying to stay out of the line of sight of cameras. It's a mistake to fight in the open world everywhere you go because endless little flying trashcans will fly over to fallen enemies to restore them. Also, you can get swarmed in sections of the open world much like a mosh pit at concert. Only this one tenderises you until your ground meat. So at first it might feel frustrating. Until you get a feel for it and decide to opt to only do what's necessary to accomplish your objectives on the world map. Whether it's to do the story mission or enter a optional dungeon (a polygon). Thankfully, the locations of the polygons are often conveniently located close-ish to whatever your currently doing story wise in the game. So the only pain in your ass is finding a way to open them. Often you'll be able to tackle two polygons before having to do a story mission or you can simply wait to do it later. And the puzzles you encounter in this game are a great way to break up the combat while keeping the traversal interesting.

As for the story, it's an okay story. I immediately got Forspoken deja vu picking this up. When I realised that once again I was playing a game with a sentient chatty accessory attached to my arm. That it honestly made me wonder if we're in some kind of weird year for chatty fashion accessories cause I know there is yet another f**kin game coming out in August with a sentient gauntlet on your arm (which I'll probably get). And will that ""friend"" on my arm also turn out to be a [redacted] like [redacted]? Oh well. I thought that was worth mentioning.

So is this a game worth getting? Will you finally awaken to becoming a robosexual? Yes. To maybe one or both of those. It's a solid game with fun puzzles, crazy boss fights, surreal flashbacks, and some of the weirdest interactions you'll ever have in a video game.",1685241154,1685241154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game seems to be a combination of ""BioShock"" and ""Half-LIfe"", but set on an alternate earth, where the Sovient Union won WWII. The world is primarily run using advanced robotics and other technologies. Gameplay and story-wise is decent enough as the player plays ""Agent P-3"", exploring the world whilst performing his mission.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Players require to farm a lot of resources to upgrade the various weapons available. Open world does feel rather ""dead"" and lacking, as well as empty apart from farming resources. The materials are very scarce, hence, making this tedious. Enemies are relatively repetitive, and it lacks creativity unlike in the ""BioShock"" or ""Half-Life"" franchise. Melee weapons make barely any difference overall, just different designs and slightly different speeds and damage.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics is quite good, not the best. Stable on max settings for RTX2080, mostly constant > 100fps.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The music and voice acting is relatively good. Sound effects are very good, especially when using THX 5.1 or 7.1 Surround Sound. The interactions feel a bit too much, so many ""talking"", interactions can be sped up, but not skipped.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Controls are relatively straightforward like most first person games. Nothing special, except the use of additional keys like the ""Alt"" key to constantly scan the area.

[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]
Minor bugs may include:
1. Enemies or player might get stuck in terrain
2. Random animation issues in cutscenes
3. Animation delays will become annoying at some point
4. Actions performed like climbing not triggering properly
5. Random ragdoll physics issues
6. Multiple achievement bugs, causing a lot of frustration (Fixed in latest patch)
7. Random interaction issues with NPC or collectibles, reloading from checkpoint usually fixes most issues

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall a good game with decent enough story and beautiful open world, similar to the first game. Disappointed with range of enemies and slightly dull storyline. Characters are forgettable and barely have any impact to the overall story. Weaponry are also relatively boring when compared to other FPS games available, as it barely makes any difference even on higher difficulties. One of the redeeming properties of the game is the final boss, the ""Twin"" robots.

This game built itself up with extremely interesting teasers and showcases featuring bizarre architecture, strange mechanical devices, and the promise of a wild and deep mystery. On one hand, the game delivers. Every lab or underground lair you visit has this bizarre twinge of brutal devices carrying out strange tasks, seemingly nonsensical scientific experiments, and wild technology that seems almost like magic. Unfortunately, the game ruins all of this because [i]it just cannot keep its goddamn mouth shut[/i]

Every single time you encounter one of these wonderful and horrible creations or experiments your companion character immediately explains exactly what's going on and the purpose of what you're looking at. You'll enter a room with giant, rotating platforms, strange mannequins strewn about, and a bizarre floating goo, and instead of letting you take time to digest what you're looking at and try to puzzle out what all this could be for, your companion will butt in and say ""oh this is just how we test rockets,"" which makes what your looking at paradoxically banal and unbelievable. I enjoy a good technical explanation of strange technology in settings like Mass Effect, Warhammer 40k, or Death Stranding, but in a game that hinges on mystery and the bizarre, this ruins the effect immediately.

Speaking of mystery, there isn't one. You immediately know who the villain and what you'll be fighting, and the only twists this game comes up with come completely out of nowhere and are either inconsequential or completely unbelievable. None of the characters come off as compelling, mostly just one-note actors going through motives we can't really relate to because they're either complete monsters or just idiots. A character like Andrew Ryan can be a complete monster but you learn enough about him to make him interesting, to really learn his points of view. Despite how much this game talks about the main villain and his views, I never felt I really knew who I was fighting, just some card-carrying villain who had to be shot.

As for the gameplay, the reason it took me so long to get to it is because it's largely just fine. The weapons are fun and customizable in ways that suit your playstyle, and a lot of them are satisfying with a good punch. The powers are serviceable but never feel that substation, and the enemy variety is slightly lacking but decent enough. None of it ever felt tactical however. Most AI will typically just rush you down with little thought, or hang slightly back to shoot at you. I never had moments where an AI would try to go around and flank me or try to retreat for a better opportunity, it all felt very basic. In addition, with how many healing supplies you can carry and how prolific supplies are, I never truly felt challenged.

This game also has no reason to be open world. The only collectable upgrades or items you can get are located in specific bonus buildings. There's never any reason to go off and explore or see what's over the next hill, no side quests or interesting locations, just a bunch of copy-pasted buildings and mindless driving that quickly becomes little more than a commute.

Overall I really did want to like this game, and it just so borders on being good. If there was ever a mod released that completely cut out any of the over-explanatory dialogue, that would probably push this game to a recommend, but as it stands, it kills any sense of mystery the moment it happens and doesn't have a plot strong enough to carry its decent but inconsistent and simple gameplay.",1685143216,1685159246,False,12,0,0.575371384620666504,0,True,False,False

tl;dr: you are paying for the art style and the cinematics. Anything other than these sucks. Not recommend buying and I would recommend watching someone's playthrough (yes, it is THAT BAD).



Earlier this year I was deeply attracted by the art style of the game. I am very into utopian/disutopian stuff and this game provided a spectacular view of ""what if USSR was still there"". In the first two hours of the game (which is just enough for me to meet Petrov for the first time) I thought everything is so good. Chelomey (aka the flying city island thingy) looks good, prologue feels smooth, the transition is cool. Hell, the first underground facility before we can actually ""explore"" Facilities 3826 is so attractive. You only got an axe and not much bullets. Every enemy could be deadly. and......

And the game decides to disappoint you. You chased Petrov, found two balls to open a door, you found Petrov, and holy mogus they need you to find four fucking cans of plants to open a door. It is so boring and redundant. Some of you might say ""jeez everything is different in different complex they are not the same."" And I am not buying that.

Once you are outside. Congrats! You now have so many things to explore! Only till you realise that the polygon (testing grounds) are overall the same, and there are so many places that got nothing to explore (seriously, they built a whole ass Kollektive Complex and I thought it is a side-quest throughout the game. Yet to be found out that IT IS JUST A SCENIC SITE). The open world element feels like complete bs to the game as even with no open world area to explore, the game proceeds as the same. You don't even need to go through any testing ground to defeat the final boss. And the testing ground, it's a common issue but obviously fps above 60 will cause you to not able to pick things up and use the charge? wtf and how? I encountered those bugs when I was exploring the testing grounds and jesus it is so annoying. I cannot describe how annoying it was but imagine a mosquito keeps flying around your ear while you are not able to catch it.

Oh, and did I mention about the combat system? Of course you can use close combat throughout the game, but the weapon and the skills are busted. Just infinite stunlock using the gel and shock and telekinetics. Every combat starts with telekinetics and stunlock, and then it ends. 

The game starts suddenly, and ends suddenly. And like, maybe it is on me, but both endings sucks. In the beginning of the story they emphasized that the beta connector is important. And then our protagonist chose to yeet it into the ocean. No choice for us? Really? 

For me, this game feels like not at all finished, considering how detailed it was in the prologue and it feels completely different after you arrived Facilities 3826. The game feels less engaging and rather empty. Again, the art style and the plot are great. But the gameplay is just, all over the place. So, if you are trying to find answer of which you should buy the game, I can tell you, you don't have to if you want an enjoyable experience. But if you like to see the world they described in their game, you can buy it. If you think of it as a linear RPG w/ an unknown purpose open area, then the game should be fine for you.

gameplay is good. I dont have too much to say about it. it feels like it was trying to compete with bioshock. and it does an admirable job at the worst of times. solid. and felt nice. nitpick is the enemys can feel too bullet spongy at times. but once you have upgraded your weapons as you are encouraged to do by exploring the open world you can find the stuff you need. fully upgraded rocket launcher melts. also there is a few mods on the nexus to increase weapon damage which I downloaded and then set the game to hard so that I stomped enemys and enemys stomped me. The gameplay is definitely good. the weapons all feel like they have decent use cases at worst especially once you upgrade them. 


the story:
the story is pretty good. it would be great. but the endings let the story down. it has alot of good points. alot of high points. its more than servicable. do yourself a favor. just use russian. in my opinion english doesnt translate as well from russian and it makes it awkward at times. and also. it just feels silly to me personally. I enjoyed the russian voice acting much more. but this is entirely up to you. I am learning japanese and listened to the japanese as well for a time. it was also pretty decent. but I prefer russian even though I cannot understand it. the dialogue is ok. I can definitely agree that there is too much banter at times. but I didnt mind it. there is a mod on the nexus to limit talking to plot elements only if you'd like. I dont think it drags down the atmosphere at all. in any case there are two endings. I wont spoil them. but out of the two endings one is very clearly the good ending. but both in addition to being unsatisfying dont really feel like great options. but then again that isnt a problem in itself. not every story has to have some good option. plenty have worked out with no good option. regardless both endings are weak. be prepared for that and I think you will have a good time overall.



graphics/performance. very good performance for me. with dlss on my 3060ti I get 144fps consistently on my 1440p monitor. dlss is a miracle. theres no need for a 700 dollar+ gpu anymore in games that use dlss to get results. some people have said they have stutters. Personally I never once had stutters on 1440p high settings with dlss set to balanced. the game looks pretty good. The art style is great. the graphics look pretty good. Personally I dont give two shits about graphical fidelity most of the time. I care about the art style. unreal engine 5 shows that any game can look like real life v2. its do they have an art direction that matters now. this game has a great art direction. flashy sorta furturistic/ultra modern soviet aesthetic. very opulant contrasted with the shitshow going on around you. it speaks to the themes of the game. 


I will say there are pretty much no politics in this game. a HUGE bonus for me. what do I mean by that? the game will never at any point stop itself to lecture you about x or y. soviet communism is all over the place because thats the settings. thats where the story the devs wanted to tell was. there is no political stance in the game. its there. you can make up your own mind about it. the game is here to tell you a interesting story. show you the the horrifying secrets behind a mega advanced complex. and to tell the story of individuals. not a story about muh capitalism. or muh dictatorship or any of that. I highly appreciate it. It boosts the experience. I am not here to listen to the game devs political beliefs and they arent here to sell me on any political beliefs. its just a game telling a story. 


if the ending was stronger and the enemys were tuned just a bit more to be challenging in themselves and not because of a health bar IT would be a 10/10 from me personally. What I can say is you can safely buy this. and have a good time. its not a live service. its not going to demand a subscription from you in microtransactions or whatever. its just a game. a very weird sorta spiritual succesor to bioshock. and it does a very good job at doing that.

MASSIVE CONS:

- ENEMIES IN THE OPEN WORLD COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME AND NOTHING WOULD CHANGE - it is pointless to fight them and if you just walk by them they can't hit you or catch you so it's ideal to just act like they don't exist

- MOST OF THE GUNS COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME AND NOTHING WOULD CHANGE -freezing and hitting enemies in melee is MUCH easier and more efficient than trying to kill them with guns. there is no point to use guns unless you need to hit an enemy that you can't get to

- ALL THE LOCKS AND PUZZLES COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME AND NOTHING WOULD CHANGE - they are all so stupidly easy to solve that you can solve and unlock all of them just by accident

- MOST OF THE DIALOGUE IS POINTLESS, BUGGED, OVERLAPS, REPEATS RANDOMLY FOR NO REASON AND COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME AND NOTHING WOULD CHANGE - it's just pointless random whining and characters attacking each other verbally for no real reason

I could go on much longer but the basic idea is that MOST OF THE THINGS IN THIS GAME COULD BE REMOVED AND NOTHING WOULD CHANGE FOR THE WORSE which is very very odd.

Some jumping puzzles left me confused due to them showing some jumps in a highlighted yellow and other times not.

Fun fact for my setup 4070ti I prefer much more fluid cap of 90 than 120fps which had for some reason very bad frame pace making it looks less fluid despite producing locked 117fps for gsync. That’s with frame gen which works pretty good and a bit of lag is there compared to no frame generation but I’m surprised how well it works. Think about it’s like increasing the mouse smoothing effect. Honestly I’ve played games with worst lag and no frame gen.",1684807447,1684807447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
A first-person shooter set in the USSR in the years following World War 2, Russia has become a technological dystopia where advanced machines are completing a wide range of tasks for humans. Atomic Heart attempts to reinvent what games like Prey and Bioshock did in a new environment and setting. But did their formula start the reaction they were hoping for or did the experiment blow up in their faces?

[table]
[tr]
	[th][b]🟩 Positives[/b][/th]
	[th][b]🟥 Negatives[/b][/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]🟩 Atomic Heart is a stunning game. With a beautiful open world and captivatingly vibrant design, it's easy to get lost in the ambient beauty of this title.

🟩 There are a few different weapons to implement chaos on your journey. From different styles of melee weapons to the more standard selection such as pistols, shotguns and assault rifles.

🟩 The soundtrack, while being mostly in Russian, is outstanding. It's fast-paced when it needs to be, it slows down for the emotional scenes, and it's perfect everywhere in between.[/td]
	[td]🟥 The story is an utterly confusing disaster of boring events, terrible dialogue and rushed storytelling.

🟥 The ""powers"" you unlock are underwhelming and practically useless. I only really used them to unlock achievements and then put them away.

🟥 There are bugs and glitches galore in this game.

🟥 While Atomic Heart is technically an open-world game, it is more accurate to say it's closer to a linear experience with slightly wider parameters. [/td]

[/table]

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as Agent P-3, a special operations soldier, in the employ of an influential scientist in the USSR, Dr Dimitry Sechenov. Having just arrived in Chelomey, the capital city of this fictional region of floating islands in Russia, things quickly get out of hand when the robots everyone relies on get switched to combat mode and begin to kill indiscriminately.

Agent P-3 gets ordered to bring the man who has done this heinous deed to heel by any means necessary, and thus his journey across this newly war-torn region begins. Fighting both organic monsters and deadly machines, P-3 will have to master a series of weapons and abilities to come out alive and hopefully find an answer to why this all started in the first place.

For the most part, Atomic Heart has the potential to be a pretty decent story experience. The bones of something substantial and remarkable are there just beneath the surface. Unfortunately, however, this is never acknowledged and rapidly stagnates in its cumbersome dialogue and tedious event cycles. If you push through the seemingly endless sexual innuendos, and corny one-liners, you will discover there is very little else to experience here. The pacing is terrible, and the amount of missing context is confusing. If you were hoping this to be your story-driven experience of the year, you're probably best skipping this one.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[b]The Hammer and Sickle.[/b]
The best part of this title, hands down, is the combat. There are very few feelings more intoxicating than bringing a giant mace down on the head of a robot enemy and having their shell cave in before your eyes. There is a minor variety of weapons to choose from, such as maces and axes, both one and two-handed. In addition to the melee weapons, we have the more common implements of warfare, such as the Kalash, Makarov and the tantamount bringer of destruction, the Shotgun.

With all that said, the unfortunate downfall of this paradigm is that the ""powers"" P-3 unlocks throughout his development remain underwhelming until they have a substantial investment from the player. The ""Shok"" skill at the beginning of the game is extremely weak and provides little reason to use it beyond taking down the miscreant flying robot before a reload.

[b]Freedom for all, or close enough.[/b]
As I mentioned above, Atomic Heart is technically an open-world experience, and it could be the interpretation based on map scale. However, from a player's perspective, you will begin to notice red laser barricades all over the place that bar you from freely exploring. So, essentially you will have the illusion of open-world exploration from the safety of a linear experience.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941935148

While we are speaking of maps, the one implemented here, while visually detailed and impressive to scroll over, is fundamentally useless as you can't set waypoints or zoom in enough to use it when exploring towns.

[b]A puzzling outcome.[/b]
The puzzles in Atomic Heart are pretty fun! They test your aptitude, ability to think under pressure, and how you process information in your environment. The ""testing grounds"" are particularly entertaining situations as they are built purely to do this to you and act, for the most part, as puzzle dungeons for you to complete. Easily one of the best parts of the Atomic Heart journey.

[b]Unable to achieve excellence.[/b]
My last point is more of a peeve than anything else, and while it is an annoying bug, it doesn't fundamentally change the gameplay experience. The achievements for Atomic Heart are fundamentally ""broken"" as many will not tally their objectives, and others will be impossible due to missing or poorly designed mechanics.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
From a purely visual standpoint, Atomic Heart is above many in design and presentation, and it stands as one of the most breathtaking gaming experiences I've ever had the opportunity to enjoy. The general ambience with how the trees sway and the subtle way the grass ripples with each gust of wind is sublime. It's also true of the finer textures, old and worn rails have visible paint peeling away, the makeshift guns you create have scratches and scuffs on their surface, and cables are frayed and worn. The attention to detail is immense.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941936287

The audio doesn't quite hit the same mark., The voice acting is pretty subpar, the general audio ambience feels generic, and dialogue is interrupted by things and doesn't continue afterwards, which leaves plenty of conversational blanks.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
With Atomic Heart set to Ultra settings and running at 2560 x 1440, I had minimal framerate drops below 60 FPS. There was a substantial quantity of bugs in the game, such as; textural and gameplay issues.
🟧 Achievements are broken and are impossible to 100% complete at this stage.
🟨 Visual quality drops greatly in the latter portion of the game, and the number of graphical tears and missing textures increases exorbitantly.
RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 42%)

[h1]Final Thoughts - Imperfect[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
I wanted to love this game so much. I gave it many chances to impress me, and the experience failed to meet my expectations every time. The game isn't bad, it's just bland in nearly every facet of its creation, and that's why it will be unmemorable. The voice acting is poor, the jokes are crude and dry, and the overall gameplay loop is unsatisfying. If you are still keen to play Atomic Heart, wait for a steep enough sale to negate the sting of the purchase.

It's perfect, it feels smooth and practically has no issues, although i do wish there were bit more cool weapons mods (pls add Saiga or some fast-firing smg). Love the energy and how it can be played around
[b]Soundtrack 1000/10[/b]
Its practically flawless, as per usual Mick Gordon is showing that in games where there is brutality and combat, he is the Messiah of songs. Love the remixes of Soviet song quite fitting actually, my favorite must be Plyusch and the hard metal Arlekino, with Kamarov being great to.

Among positive moments, I would state the following:
1) The lore in general. You won't find much game in the Soviet / Communist world.
2) Agile fights with enemies. And I really liked the bosses. 
3) Craft system, which aids in choosing combat style.
4) The large open areas, which you can explore.

But there are also many negative clauses and questionable decisions, which, I hope, developers will take into account in the future. Here are some of them.

1) Well, It is the Bioshock. Just in another wrapping. Anyone who completed Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinitive will see literally ""Copy-Paste"" of the solutions, mechanics and other stuff. Just compare the first minutes of the gameplay: flying city, the holiday, happy citizens and then sudden catastrophe. The protagonist who lost his memories. The special abilities engage by the certain chemicals. You may add more items in the list. The developers even didn't try to hide it well enough. And I wouldn't call it ""inspiration"".

2) The plot. Frankly, I was expecting something more intricate and intriguing than regular ""Evil Soviet Union eager to conquer the world"". Too shallow, too expected. Seriously, you're creating a communist utopia world, so why don't take a completely alternative path? Why don't address to the soviet science fiction authors like Ivan Efremov, Alexander Beliayev and many others? They're definitely not popular now, but they should give a better view on ""Home Soveticus"". Instead, we have a regular ""rebellious dog"" of the ""bad guys trying to make bad things"". Shallow and even vulgar.

3) I haven't found any in-game description of the ""polymer"" term. I am an engineer, so I have an idea, that polymers are a type of molecules which tends to create long chains of connections. It definitely suits well for its purpose in the game - connect all peoples (chain them) together. But someone may not know about this fact. It would be better to put a clear description somewhere at the beginning of the game. And it seems, that the origins of the polymers are not explained well too, though, maybe, I've just missed that moment.

4) The retro era does not feel solid enough. It's made up of the sole recognizable pieces stitched together. Here are soldiers in the Red Army uniform, and next to them is Larisa with painted hair. Come on, she's working at the secret facility, where social rating does matters! There definitely must be a certain dress and look code. Next, we have an AI driven robots, and in the same room there is a TV-4 school lathe machine (or something really reminiscent). What does Typhoon-class submarine doing in one of the polygons? It is 1950s, alternative 1950s, but still, why do we have a 1980's submarine there? It is completely out of place. 

5) Next, a significant amount of technical bugs (version 1.5). The ""shaking"" bodies, when they disappear and then return to the view area. The ""Gryphon"" control booth, which suddenly closed its door for some reason, nudging me to quickload (there is no means to open it from inside). I've got stuck in the decorations in some of the polygons, though finally got out by multiple ""jump-move-rotate"" sequences. Annoying. If you leave your enemies at the round roof of the polygon in the Sechenov location, when it opens up, they remain in the midair.

6) Middle graphics settings introduce horrible shades in the open areas. You literally don't have ones inside buildings or caves (there is one at the shore).

7) Infinite enemies spawn. It is a very bad decision from my standpoint. It's fine to stick to the ""clean up - explore - leave - respawn"" approach. But not when enemies are continuously ""repaired/spawn"" immediately after the kill. It significantly degrades the ""exploring large areas"" experience I've mentioned atop.

8) Farming to pure game ratio. I've spent 40 hours in the game, and half of that was in the polygon areas or farming resources for the craft. The polygon areas are huge, their puzzles primitive and there are too little enemies there. So why do we have them in the shooter? 

9) Too many texts to read. Again, you may omit the local ""PCs"" and ignore mails there. But it seems like they may contain valuable information, like locations of the secrets. But in fact they don't. And they don't contain much of plot-describing or extending information in it as well.

10) Strange concept of ""talking dead"". Well, they speak, they tell you some stories, but they have no impact at gameplay. Only once you it gives you a code to the door, so the rest just waste your time. 

11) Some strange decisions, like list of the all enemies with their description in the ""Info"" menu. Why? it is no fun to know what types of enemies you're expecting to meet in the future. The list of the employees is strange as well. Is there something hidden inside that dossiers? Should I read them all or not? The ""Schebetar"" item seems even more strange. Its concept definitely has been taken from the Bioshock Infinite's voxaphones (don't remember what item was used in the first Bioshock), and tried to be integrated into the local lore. But talking clock? With animation showing its mechanical parts? I don't buy that idea. By the way, its playback is completely interrupted by the Polymer Glove. You can restart it from the ""Info"" menu only. 

The list above does not mean that the game is bad by any means, I did have some fun with it. But it definitely lacks consistency and depth, and sometimes irritate a little, and that's why for seems a little overpriced and overvaluated. Actually, it was the very first time in my life, I bought something on the top of hype. And the deal was not as great as I thought.

The story is really the bread and butter here and while it may seem frustratingly confusing at first, things will come together more neatly at the end of the game.

To start with the bad, the dialogue is lengthy but the triggers are poorly placed. The player character has lots of dialogue whilst playing the game and if you progress too far, a trigger will end the current dialogue with no chance to replay it - other than to reload a save. Secondly, there is a semi-open world but there's not much to do. Outside of the main missions, the two options are doing Training Grounds (Atomic Heart's version of ""dungeons"") to gain some loot, or you can loot the open world. No side quests, interesting people to meet, or anything else engaging in the world. I personally really enjoyed the training grounds as they had some interesting puzzle mechanics but otherwise, it was a lackluster world.

As for the good, I was very surprised at how well optimized the game is. Besides 1 or 2 crashes, it runs extremely well at a consistent 1080p@144Hz. The graphics are incredible and the scenery will leave your jaw on the floor. The gunplay is chunky and all of the weapons felt fun to use. The game could've used more enemy variety for sure, but overall the combat is superb.

Despite its flaws, it's safe to say that Atomic Heart exceeded my expectations after so many years in alleged development hell. This was clearly a labor of love that takes inspiration from Bioshock, Far Cry, perhaps a little bit of Wolfenstein, and definitely some of Kojima's narrative prowess.

I played the ""extended demo"" AKA some amazing human being leaked the whole damn thing 2 days before release and was I was shocked on how good the game is, enough for me to buy the whole-ass 100$ bundle mega ultra super duper Soviet Russia reloaded to the max extreme edition.
The graphics are amazing. The damage mechanic on the enemies is out of the world. If you hit someone across or from top down , you can actually see the damage being dealt in that area.
There are plenty of enemies to fight and they all have their own resistances and vulnerabilities.
The game is VERY forgiving with making a build due to the possibility of restarting skill or disassembling guns/upgrades for FULL PRICE. Feel like shotgun ? go shotgun . Tiered of your old axe? Get a sword. want those pesky Vovas to stop swarming you ? freeze the fuckers. It's all there for you to explore and combine as much as you want.
The music . oh the music slaps harder than my parents slapped me . It's all these old Russian/Soviet songs remixed for the future (which even has a fking explanation in the game on WHY it's remixed in the first place) 
Did I mention mods? Want your thicc ballerina robo mammas even thiccer? Guess what? We got a mod for that! 
There ARE bugs here and there like flying enemies that spawn from other enemies getting stuck in a wall . But those are more of a rarity than an exception. In today's world where unfinished garbage keeps getting rushed out just to meet some shitty ass quotas that are there from people that don't even know what a video game is. This game is a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.
My problem with the game is : I want more scripted drawn out fights to some hardcore remixed old Soviet tunes by Mick Gordon.

In the end of the day I give this game a thicc ballerina robo mommy milkies out of Soviet Shock.

1-  wonderful charming art direction
2- solid gameplay , varying options to chose from
3 - intriguing story with a great ending

cons :

1- the pacing is all over the place  , the game has what its called ''an identity crisis'' , it doesn't know what it wants to be at certain parts that it feels rushed.

2-  the exploration in open areas is ruined by a simple design choice , to put it simply , any robot you will kill in open areas will respawn within 1 min cause of the repair pods that you can't disable , so you can't basically explore at your own pace , you'll have a constant feeling of just rushing the open areas and disliking spending time in them.

3- the protagonist and his dialogue with his glove in english is beyond cringe and unfunny , i highly recommend you to play the game in russian , the voice is alot better and more immersive.

It's essentially a post-apocalyptic zombie style game, but instead of zombies it's robots. But the robots were purposefully programmed to go nuts and the reason why isn't clear in the story, yet.

The combat is fairly bland and you often find yourself backed into a corner surrounded by enemies unable to move. Just a robot gangbang. Melee is stupidly effective and necessary as you burn through ammo really quickly with projectile weapons and energy weapons; you'll be swinging some kind of melee weapon around a lot more than you'll be shooting.

The dialogue.... the main character, P-3, often says what you're thinking - but with his annoying catch phrase (which he'll point out is his catch phrase) and a whole slew of expletives. Nothing the repair vendor, NORA, says is appropriate in polite company or in the presence of children. Constant BDSM references. P-3 can't stand it and will often use his catch phrase and more expletives when talking with NORA. However, it's still pretty amusing, and the actual NORA machines are spaced enough that you'll more often run into non-sexualized repair stations.

The abilities you can unlock are pretty useful, though I've found I've not really needed to buy into anything other than SHOK and Frostbite, yet. You can respec at any time and all your resources are returned for doing so. The same goes for weapon crafting and disassembly; tear stuff apart and build something new to try out various options. 

I'm finding the saw blade on a stick works wonders (knocks down enemies on a full charge attack, very useful), shotgun, and the Electro gun. Shotgun works great on biological enemies (and really well against robot weak points), while the Electro saves on some ammo, hurts robots pretty well, but also generates a large EMP around you that outright destroys smaller enemies while temporarily stunning larger ones. The saw bladed melee weapon is useful on pretty much everything - just get used to an enemy's moves before going melee.",1684541308,1684541308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Beautiful Graphics, although glitchy at some times  (The sun will turn your entire screen white during cutscenes)
- Unique Story and lots of secrets to explore away from main quest.
- Interesting concepts like the Charles and Looting.

-A lot of fetch quests.
-Open World is very annoying because of the robots being repaired every 30 seconds.
-Not a whole lot of weapons for how big the game is.
-Protagonist complains the entire story.
- Dialogue is glitchy and will cutoff people from talking if you interact with something as small as a door or lock
- WAYYY to many locks and tedious puzzles for no reason, some sprinkled here and there is fine but some sections is just filled with them for average tier loot. 
-Some Skills are useless and outclassed or outdamaged by many other skills. 
- Jumping/Mantling is God Awful in certain parts of the game. 
- FOR ACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS, Some achievements are so tedious and silly its frustrating to 100% the game ie; Collect 100+ Apples in a mini level, or Upgrade a weapon fully which gets very expensive and requires you to go out the way and collect mods in the bunkers.

You use vending machines to upgrade, you play in a floating city in the sky, it takes place in a alternative 1950's soviet union.  Lots of commie propaganda and pro commie themes by design.  I played on easy mode to make the game a bit more fun and less of a constant death spiral.  I am usually a normal to hard mode kind of guy, but this one had me lower the bar a bit.  Part of the reason I went to easy mode was because I just wanted to get through the game and see the story/puzzles and part was because other parts of the game like the platforming are annoying and I just wanted to end the game faster.  
The way you have to mod some of the guns and weapons was a little tough to figure out too.  The way you have to install the cartridges took me a while to understand.  You can easily forget you have certain abilities like telekinesis because it is never introduced to the player in a fluid way.  You just all the sudden unlock it at some point and don't ever really need to use it.  In bio-shock when you unlock an ability it is because you can not progress through the area without it, but here it is just a way of changing up your plays style if you start to get board with it.  
It's a good game with a fun story, but it lacks some game design polish in my opinion.  Its still worth checking out, but it doesn't offer anything spectacular.  Also the main character saying ""Crispy Critters"" every 5 minutes was really cringey.  The voice acting was good, but the script itself either doesn't translate well, or Russian people swear every other word for no reason whatsoever.  Certain euphemisms didn't really go over right at times too.

Bad part:
I have played lots of games and this one gives me a numbing dizziness after just less than one hour play.
Even if you run this game 120FPS you can still get dizziness and here is why:

1. Combat is really fast paced and you have to dodge attacks fast. When you failed to dodge you get knocked over and the camera is all shaking. Or when you do a swipe attack with your axe, your camera is literally flying 360 degrees around.

2. There are computers lying around the map and you can read its contents using a floating in-game screen. The texts on that floating screen is literally shaking (because the screen is a hologram I guess). 

3. The game pops up a window everytime there is something new, even when you are walking or in middle of a combat. It fucked my brain so hard when I got spooked by a robot and the window popped up.

There's a lot of things to say about this game that makes it great.
---
Things I liked about the game:
-Incredible story and an amazing ending that leaves us at a big cliffhanger.
-Tons of weapons to choose from that fit your play-style.
-A big open world to explore and discover all it's secrets.
-Testing grounds that present great rewards for passing it's tests

As great of a game there is, there is a ton of things bad about listing them all would make it a whole essay.
---
Main things I didn't like:
-A lot of heavily reused jokes that turn out to be really annoying. Such as the ""Self Pleasure"" machine joke that was funny the first time you see it but the devs decide to put hundreds of them in every single facility. But I wouldn't expect Europeans to actually be funny.
-What I found annoying was the lack of fact transportation. No fast travel is annoying seeing how big of the map this is. And the only car is a shitty red sedan that would catch on fire if you crash it once. The use of the cars prove over useless since the devs though it was a great idea to spread a lot of loot areas near the roads, so taking a car would cause you to miss a lot of loot.
-The devs give us a character more fit than all of the Robot Twin fanatics combined. And he's an annoying asshole that for no reason is mean to everyone he meets. Fortunately the easiest fix to this was setting the language to Russian.
-The map design is pretty good, but has tons of things that ruin it, which also is the parkour in this game, which really wants to be Dying Light. A lot of times while running from enemies in rural areas there are unnecessary invisible walls that don't make sense to be there. Even in the facilities while fighting enemies I can get stuck on a damn drawer and P-3 for some reason can't jump over that.
-The most useless thing in this game is the stealth mechanic, it doesn't even work because enemies can spot you from a mile away. And even when I try to sneak up on robots they seem to have eyes on the back of their head and turn around right as I approach them. Your crouch speed isn't nearly as fast as their walking speed anyway.

I brought this game mainly for the experience and story. And honestly, I am pretty surprised that the story was actually good, even though the end seemed a little rushed and incomplete. The gunplay is interesting and the replacement of the sprint button with dodge is a smart move. No more worrying about stamina. I'm still sad there's no co-op, as it would've been more fun, but I understand the reasoning behind the devs and realize co-op wouldn't make much sense.

I gotta say, the dev's marketing strategy was the smartest thats ever been done. Luring a ton of bitchless people through social media platforms marketing specifically the twins. When ads of this were still running through TikTok, I've noticed a lot of this type of people being tricked. Even in the reviews of this game it's filled with people praising the robot twins. The 5-hour cutscene joke isn't funny. It's just straight up weird.

*IMPORTANT:* This game honestly isn't worth it except for the base game, which I think is still pretty overpriced. DLC skins are straight up useless and is just a quick cash grab since nobody but you can see these skins. And these skins give no benefit to you at all. I HIGHLY recommend buying this game ONLY when it's on sale, NEVER base price.

It's just your everyday run of the mill single player experience that's well optimised while still looking great. It's so jarring to have all this, yet this is what we should be expecting.

*Edit* They recently announced a season pass with more content, but I'll still say that the game feels more or less complete without it. Though it's there unfortunately, so I'll withdraw my comment regarding it having no DLCs locking content away.

The story is interesting, it's not about some post apocalyptic soviet country or anything like that. It's more about being this agent and his AI glove trying to stop some madman to prevent killer robots from going out of control in their country. The country is prosperous, the people are happy, it's just the place we are going had a big oopsie happen and everyone is basically dead in there. But as the story goes along, there's clearly something else happening behind the scenes.

P3 and Charles are our 2 main characters and they serve most of the dialogue in the game. There are NPCs here and there, but they honestly barely count as characters. So it's nice to have Charles and P3 striking up conversations here and there to alleviate this desolate feeling of being alone in a deserted place. Really well done for the most part.

The gameplay is mixed honestly, shooting feels great, the quick dodges that P3 can do really help to make things feel more active, especially during boss fights. Even regular enemies require you to be on your toes at times, whenever they're about to do a heavy attack, the game gives you a signal to dodge. This gives them a bit more presence than your standard mobs in other games. It's really good.

The game wants to have an emphasis on melee, but I honestly didn't think much of it. The game has some enemies that are resistant to gun fire, so you have to resort to melee/explosives to take them out effectively. It's really awkward. These enemies just make you feel like 80% of your inventory is pointless whenever they show up since most people will only bring 1 melee weapon due to the limited inventory space.

Plasmids or whatever they call abilities in this game, are very underwhelming to be honest. You don't have to worry about running out of juice to use these as they regenerate after use, but that also means their effectiveness is very watered down. They work, but I feel they don't add much to the game. 

Aside from the combat itself, the game feels very odd. It's a linear game with a lot of corridors and tight interiors. But wait there's an open world! Aaannnd it's pointless. It's a place to travel between the story missions and facilities for upgrades. Killing enemies in the open world feels like trying to throw out cockroaches that keep crawling back in. It's meaningless, they'll keep sending drones to repair the robots you broke, making you wonder why you're even fighting them in the first place. You're spending resources to craft bullets, just so you can waste them to kill enemies to get more resources. There's just nothing interesting to do in the world. 

Far from a Bioshock game, it felt like I was playing Portal. With all the puzzles and tightly packed interior locations we go through in the game to get upgrades and to progress the story. The gameplay loop really suffers due to this. You can be having a blast fighting through tons of enemies one moment, and 30 minutes later you're finally done with all the puzzles in an area without fighting a single thing. Another janky thing about the game is the choice to play random music for totally normal encounters, it completely falls flat when the music is still playing after killing everything.

Boss fights in this game are very hit or miss, there are some that feel very energetic in your face. They're big, oppressive and fast. While some feel like a complete joke. Dodging a flaming piece of debris from a giant robot that threw it at you is peak boss design. It's fun, half of the bosses are like this. The other half feel like a joke as they are defeated so easily.

In conclusion, it's a great first attempt at a FPS campaign. There are flaws here and there, but the overall package is still definitely worth checking out despite the shortcomings.

Big map to explore but shame, you cant explore the map with your own pace because most of the map is an open area full with robots.

I was genuinely excited to play Atomic Heart and even invested in all the add-ons to maximize my enjoyment. Unfortunately, the game doesn't support 5120x1440 / 32:9 resolutions, which was a significant disappointment. As someone with a high-end gaming setup, it's frustrating to find that a modern game has failed to cater to the diverse needs of its players.

I went to great lengths to make the game playable, exploring various hacks and trying out Flawless Widescreen. Sadly, these attempts were fruitless, only resulting in scanfix errors. The in-game field of view (FOV) doesn't help either. With a maximum setting of 110, the experience is far from ideal. Whenever I wield a weapon, it disappears from my screen's POV, which is simply unacceptable.

It's surprising that a highly anticipated game like Atomic Heart would overlook the importance of providing support for different resolutions, especially in 2023. As it stands, I've invested money in a game that I cannot play, which is nothing short of disheartening.

If you have a 32:9 gaming setup like I do, I strongly advise against purchasing Atomic Heart. Save yourself from the frustration and disappointment that I've experienced, and avoid making the same mistake. Until the developers address the resolution issue, it's best to steer clear of this title.

Combat is different and fun

Bosses were great (though some of them could use more advanced movesets)
I enjoyed the dungeons (it's puzzle stuff though so not everyone's flavor & I feel like more could have utilized enemies to make them more interesting)

My primary critiques would be the difficulty after a certain point in progression. It eventually just becomes very difficult to have any struggle against enemies as you just have such good options at your disposal. I love that you can become so strong with the cool weapon upgrades and abilities but after a certain point the enemies (including bosses) just seem helpless.

我个人是比较看重剧情和整体艺术效果，然后对于战斗的方面基本不关心（故事模式能摸就摸玩家）。个人内心评分会是6-7这样，是一个能让人眼前一亮的游戏，但我期待后续的DLC或者本体更新能够补全剧情和设计上的不足。




如果单评价剧情的话，我觉得这个游戏是一个潜力股。我可以看到有很好的框架和思路，可以看到一个非常完善（且我也很喜欢的大纲）。但是因为对细节和连接处的处理让这个剧情变的支离破碎。
虽然这是一个最近游戏公司的习惯，但我非常讨厌因为做续集而不把这个故事讲完，在最后看到这个时候我对这个游戏剧情方面的好感度直接跌倒了谷底。不知道是不是为了留下悬念，结尾非常粗制滥造。我对于多结局的理解是，两个结局都有相同的重量，并不是一个是结局，一个是三句话的总结。在完成第一个结局后我非常期待第二个结局，然后只有三句话不到的一幕真的让我大跌眼镜。然后和第一个结局基本一模一样的收尾（甚至冲突元素都一样）让人感到啼笑皆非。
如此潦草的结局以及糟糕的衔接也让我无法评价这个游戏整体的故事线以及人物的塑造。理论上来说是整个故事高潮的揭秘环节甚至没有之前芭蕾舞剧院的探险精彩。在极少的提示下，我被硬生生喂了一嘴真相。主角的性格也从，啊我的老板世界最伟大，突然360转成了我的老板世界最邪恶。

但这些现在看起来的粗制滥造，都有可能是之后的伏笔。比如一直在后期重复着的P1,P2,P3你们一直被操控着，且游戏里提虚拟世界里除了自由意志，其他都和现实一样。还有许多没有解答的伏笔，前后矛盾和一堆东西被随意的丢在了故事当中。希望能够在DLC看到最最起码的故事补全。



我觉得这个游戏工作室有做好好游戏的潜力（前半段和后半段的代入感差距非常的大）。芭蕾舞剧院那段让我觉得虽然气氛后来并没有抬起来，但这以及值回了票价。剧情，动作，配乐，三者结合在一起构造出了一场非常惊险的战斗和探索经历。我相信这个游戏公司能有水平把这些缺陷在DLC中化身成优势展现起来。


操作系统
虽然我不关心打斗剧情，但有些时候这些奇怪的虫已经严重影响到了甚至在接单模式下的体验。ex.卡住）机器人无数次卡墙会让我被幽默到。在跳台子的时候我直接跳出了世界，在无法脱离卡死的情况下必须要重新读档才可以继续游戏，这就是一个问题了orz。作为一个剧情玩家来说我可以很快的重启然后3分钟回来。但我也可以想到这些bug对于其他想要硬核体验的人来说都是一场灾难。
我并不是第一个体验这个游戏的玩家，甚至我觉得这个游戏已经出售了很久，可是bug的可怕数量让我举得这是一个beta版而不是一个可以卖的游戏。


关于中文
在一个藏有暗示的游戏里，把文字翻译出来是非常重要的。我并不能读懂俄语，而许多在以文字形式出现的许多俄语线索是我靠截图一个个谷歌翻译查出来的。我100%赞同因为各个方面的限制翻译组不可以翻译完全、认为一些地方是不重要的（比如随便贴的电影海报）。但是请一定翻译出重要的内容（比如主角在回忆时走的通路上方的俄语名就是没有翻译的）。



其实感觉因为对这个游戏抱有很大的期望（因为也是被同学推荐来玩的）也在游戏里看到了很多潜力，所以在评分的时候会比较harsh。如果单把芭蕾舞剧院的那一章拿出来评分我可能会给到一个high 9，但是在很好的Build up之后整段垮掉的剧情和沉浸感让他降到了一个low 6。

会是一个眼前一亮的beta版，但是希望后期可以修一修啦

It’s a high octane shooter with a kick-ass soundtrack that gives me the dopamine strike Doom just never could.  With an open world brimming at the edges with character and substance.  A world that is constantly moving, one that breathes and feels alive despite the staggering amount of corpses that litter the world.  With a modernized spin on 1950s Soviet propaganda and architecture that gives the game a wholly unique world that I haven’t seen so well realized since the original Bioshock.  It’s the kind of world that makes you go out and buy a controller just so you can walk through it.  The enemies are all varied, each taking up a different role to harass you on the battlefield, making a natural hierarchy of prioritized targets that continually shake up the flow of combat.  On top of this each and every enemy, including yourself, have magnificently fluid animations making every leap, strike, and slash oh so satisfying.

It comes so close to being a masterpiece.  So very close.  But the game's glaring problems cannot be overlooked and unfortunately almost ruin the experience.

I’m going to be very critical in this review moving forward but I just want to reiterate here that I do suggest this game.  The listed positives above, I believe, outweigh the negative and are worth the price of admission alone.  Still if the poorer aspects of the game are not addressed properly I fear it will sink the experience of anyone who jumps in blind.

This game acts as a great showcase of the multifaceted nature of video games, and how just one thing being off can ruin the game.  The game itself, in its world, gameplay, and atmosphere are top notch.  Some of the best in the business.  But the story and writing are some of the worst.  I meant it when I say it almost ruins the game.

The story fails in just about every faucet and I’ll explain how here

The most glaring issue is the voice acting but you probably already knew this, it’s almost famous at this point.  But why is it?  I don’t blame the voice actors in this instance.  Not only is the writing just plain bad and awkward but these actors were very clearly given bad direction from the director in a multitude of scenes.  Where the emotional range is way off.

Which is odd because it’s not consistently bad.  About midway through the game you chase this weird incel dude to an underground theater and suddenly the game turns around.  The writing and acting are solid.  Not perfect but clearly show that these actors, when given the proper direction, can give a really good performance.  It even shows that the writers can actually come up with something competent.  It's a great set piece and I wish the game had stuck with it because it makes the rest of the game feel very jarring.  

The voice acting gets better as the game goes on, when the main character is alone with the glove it’s actually pretty good.  It's when he has to interact with other characters that the game starts to fall apart.

The story itself is shockingly transparent.  You will know just every story beat moving forward, save for the ending which gets pretty wild, but it’s still nothing groundbreaking or all that surprising.  And it only becomes more frustrating that none of the characters can figure it out and act like it’s such a mystery.  Again it does get better as the game goes on but those initial few hours can really sour the rest of the experience.

The game is at its best when the protagonist is silent (again no hate to the actors they did their best) and you are left to explore this otherworldly land.  This is where the game excels.  Sure the puzzles can be annoying and tedious, same with the combat which I had to turn the difficulty up just to pose half a challenge.

Despite all of this the game is so vibrant and so engaging to just exist in makes the experience still well worth it.  But that duality in quality, going from the amazing world and animations to the downright jarring story can hit you like whiplash.

It just goes to show that despite everything working in this game's favor it will never reach the heights of its contemporaries.  If the story had had the time and money it clearly needed the game could have easily been a masterpiece.

But for now it will remain a warning to others.  Always reaching out for greatness but just missing it.

8/10 - despite my negativity the game is beautiful and helped fill the Bioshock-esc itch I’ve been looking for.  It is still well worth the price of admission and I highly recommend it.",1680807593,1683769352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The melee combat feels good, but the difficulty spikes unrealistically. It quickly goes from a walk in the park to being pan-seared in the depths of hell, even on normal mode. Could be a skill issue, but I don't like having to repeat the same combat segments 3+ times.

The repair bots have got to be one of the most annoying game mechanics I've had to play around. When I kill enemies in the area I'm in, I expect them to stay dead so that I can go manage my inventory or look around at the sights. You could argue that seeking out and disabling the security for that region helps remedy that, but it's usually very out of the way and only lasts for.... 2 minutes or less.

Puzzles are varied and actually challenged me sometimes; something VERY refreshing for modern games. It actually irked me how many times I felt like looking up a tutorial; really shows how we've departed from good puzzles in video games as of late. The game also performs very well, running perfect 165hz at 2k on a 3060ti (with dlss).

The game's item looting system is so overwhelming that it takes away from the overall experience.

Furthermore, the dialogue in Atomic Heart is incredibly cringe-worthy and not well aligned with the story. It often feels forced and disconnected from the narrative, making it difficult to get invested in the characters and the world they inhabit.

Finally, certain cinematics in the game are disappointingly choppy, which can be jarring and take you out of the game's immersive world.

As a sort of disclaimer I will tell you this game is really weird and twisted all throughout and it's definitely intentional so just be ready for that. Among the strangeness there is some slightly sexual material in the form of Russian sex robots and talking refrigerators.

Anyway:
The combat is very fun--featuring an awesome weapons, abilities, and enemies sandbox.
The world design, art style, and visuals are super cool.
GREAT MUSIC.
The crafting system and skill tree are rewarding.
Looting is visually satisfying.
The puzzles are pretty tricky at times and can be pretty satisfying to solve.
PC performance and graphics are very, very good.

The game has a very compelling and interesting setting--a futuristic Soviet Russia where the communist society is propped up by advanced robotics and technology. There is a lot of allusion to the cold war here as well as socioeconomic commentary. This game will make you think a lot about science and technology and I appreciated that.

You play as this enhanced soldier named Sergey who is a bit of a sh!thead and it's honestly pretty funny to me but you might be annoyed by him. He kind of reminds me of Jesse Pinkman for some reason. Think of fucking Jesse Pinkman walking around like he's Duke Nukem. That's this guy. His catchphrase is ""crispy critters!"" Love him or hate him, he's a goofy little guy. Don't take him too seriously and you'll get over his treacherous personality very quickly.

I will say again that I do really like this game, so much that I am compelled to play through it again on the hard mode. The game isn't perfect though. I have no idea why they didn't opt for the English voice dub to be done by people with Russian accents. This is my biggest gripe with the game. Why do these very much RUSSIAN characters sound like they're from fucking Oakland California or something??? It just doesn't make any sense and kind of takes me out of it sometimes. Almost all of the dialogue in this game is pretty mid anyway. [u]I would say the most appropriate way for an English speaking person to play this game is with Russian voice-overs and English subtitles[/u]. I intend to play that way next time around.

The normal difficulty gets pretty easy once you get upgraded weapons and perks. Other than the main story missions  there are secret labs you can find throughout the (gorgeous) overworld that feature some really challenging puzzles that reward you with advanced weapon upgrades. They're definitely optional, but I did them all and I recommend giving them a try.

Also, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbIc2_FwReE]this is the best gameplay trailer for a game I have ever seen.[/url]

I feel like I can say a lot more about this game because I really do care for it but I'll leave it there for now at least.

Update: I can't complete it. I got too bored. Everything is so far apart, the cars blow up too easy, and there is no real sprint mechanic. It feel like they made the world big for no reason. Also enemy detection is a little wonky sometimes. Like I should have been hidden but apparently they could see through walls that day. It isn't a ""bad"" game, I just think it needed some refining. The open world is awesome but also feels barren and without any fun ways to traverse the areas it felt slow. Even with fast travel. The individual little zones were fun and the story was interesting but it taking 15-20 min to run to one you don't have fast travel open on is annoying. In all, I really hope this studio makes more games BUT I hope they improve their world. Either a fun mobility option or making the world feel a little more alive and enjoyable to traverse rather than a chore.",1680890994,1683569221,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The alternative future Soviet Union is spot on. The story is really weak however, a game doesn't need an immersive story to be good, but there has to be motivation and here you are just sort of thrown into this world, you have to help some scientist or whatever, bla bla.

The constant blabber between the protagonist and the AI companion is really irritating and I found myself muting the dialogue and turning subtitles on as to not have to listen to it. This feels like a culture clash thing, not something I've ever seen to this extreme degree in a game developed in the west. Compare it to Half-Life where the protagonist never says a word. Equally irritating is the horny fridge crafting station.

I really hate crafting in games. I went into this game wanting to play an FPS-like game, and you barely get any ammunition at all from drops here. So you have to craft it. And of course the same resources that you use to craft ammunition are the resources you also use to craft new weapons for example. It's such a stupid design decision. Imagine in Doom if you had to choose between crafting ammunition for the shotgun or be able to craft the next weapon instead of being able to pick it up? In a game like Minecraft, crafting makes sense because the only thing you do is pick up resources and they are available in abundance.

1. The worst protagonist (this applies to every single character robot or human) I have ever had the displeasure of allowing to speak into my ear drums. Insufferable, useless, troglodyte that snapped me out of the immersion quicker than whiplash snaps your upper vertebrae during a car crash. If my money for this game really did go to Russian investors like all the controversy points to then I hope they construct a gulag specifically for the writing team of this game. 

2. The story is non existent. Imagine you order a meal and get a plate full of sauce. Thats the level of satisfaction you will get from the storytelling.

3. Ignore those comparing this to Bioshock because they need to be sent there too. Everything this game has to offer, Bioshock did better three games over and many years ago. Half of it is just a blatant rip off (big daddies, plasmids etc) Ironic for a game about a successful communist country.

4. Its visually stunning and the combat is above average but so is life with my girlfriend and at least will fuck me in a way that doesn't leave me feeling annoyed or confused.

5. Hur hur the robots do a sexy thing lots of sexual innuendo hur hur my willy feel good! - Your average enjoyer of this game unironically.

6. Possibly the worst sin this game has. It's boring. Really boring. Go reinstall ANY Bioshock game.

To this day it's still an amazing piece of design work that has barely aged visually. It has much of the ideas this game attempted to implement in their original form, from various gimmicks of the gameworld to even the style of intro-cinematic.
It was more balanced and immersive. The whole game was a remarkable, lived-in world which felt like a whole hand-crafted dungeon to pick apart and progress through. There was a myriad of ways in which to approach enemies, also they didn't respawn endlessly like when outside of Atomic Heart's mini-dungeons, so it felt like spent resources always counted for something.

Atomic Heart has a wonderful Art team behind it and created something that looks unique. However the game's general DNA appears derivative and inorganic, though. It can be said they respected how great and underappreciated PREY was and tried to recreate it, like how communists tried to recreate Art Deco.

The premise kinda stinks, its Robotics theme is interesting and well fleshed out up to a point, but then it's all explained away by a tech revolution known as 'polymer,' the robots themselves, your player upgrades and even many weapon parts exist 'because polymer'. 
They might as well have said 'one of our comrade shamans discovered magic' and it would have had the same effect.

The weapons are satisfying, fun, and effective. There's usually at least one interesting upgrade for a weapon. Turn your Makarov pistol into a burst revolver. Make your rocket launcher shoot proximity mines instead. Launch buzz-saws from a pipe and control them with your mind.

The abilities are alright. I wish there were more and had better upgrades, but they're still okay nevertheless.

The world is really cool. While I wouldn't call it ""cohesive"", it's still very interesting and a joy to explore. Swim though bubbles of polymer and hear thoughts of the deceased. Wander through abandoned laboratories populated only by robots, monsters, and both of their victims. Pass through inconspicuous villages and explore their technological, morally-questionable underbellies.


Could've been better. 

The translation is a bit off due to the speed of the original Russian and the use of Russian-specific phrases. ""Crispy Critters"" sounds weird because the original doesn't have meaning in English. Better than the original ""Fucking Pies"" I suppose.

The plot's a little whacked. Things just kind of happen, leaving me confused. The political tones are weird because there isn't anything meaningfully political.

Gameplay is often poorly timed and randomly implemented. That's not to say it's bad or unengaging. But, there's still problems. Robots you kill repeatedly come back to life. Unless you shut down them all down, leaving the area completely devoid of combat. It's all or nothing a lot of the time.

The crafting and inventory system feels kind of out of place and gets annoying at times.

I enjoyed it enough to 100% it, despite the gripes i have with it. If you like Bioshock and similar games, you will likely enjoy this. The story is good, gunplay and weapon upgrades are fantastic, and the world that is developed is very interesting and well- detailed. The graphics are very nice and polished, at least on high settings. The difficulty scaling is also very well done. My first play through was on ""Local Failure"" (medium) and after a while it flowed rather well, getting adapted to combat and improving my weapons eventually made it pretty easy. My second play through was on ""Armageddon"" (hard) and it was a huge step up in difficulty. Every bot was a danger and you had to be on your guard to not get swarmed and killed, and you encountered dangerous bots much earlier in the game. Finally ""Peaceful Atom"" (easy) was such a step down from both difficulties, so much so that i edited the game to 2x speed and could wildly swing my vastly under powered melee weapons to great effect, and defeating enemies with minimal effort.

Now for a few gripes, some minor and some pretty irritating. You will likely encounter bugs, but at least in my experience, nothing too terrible. It wasnt much worse than a box being able to launch you if you jumped onto it, which actually helped me in that particular case. You can also not return to certain areas after you progress in the story, so if you missed a collectible and you have overridden the furthest save to get to that area, you have to start a new game (in my case, i had to play through the game 3 times to get all the collectibles). Finally, The cutscenes are unskippable. I wouldn't have an issue if its a first time thing, but going through the game 3 times makes you want to get past some of them. 

I would recommend this to anyone who is even vaguely interested, as I have definitely enjoyed and expect many who find this will. Oh, and they have fantastic music, Mick Gordon even joined in on it",1683373774,1683374018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is actually very interesting, which surprised me a lot. I expected this to be a game whose story is just there so that it has one, but they actually put a lot of effort into it. This is also supported by great cutscenes, something that I was missing in certain other games that have released in recent years.

The visuals are great. When I saw the trailers for the game I thought it'll get downgraded, but it does actually look like that. The performance is ok. Nothing amazing, but I was able to play on a solid 60fps on a mix of high and ultra settings, with only a few occasional framedrops.

Difficulty wise it surprised me too. I normally play almost all my games on their hardest difficulty (as long as it's not permadeath), and of course I had to do that here too. I was expecting to breeze through this game, but it was actually hard. It wasn't even the bossfights that were the problem, I was able to beat most in one attempt. The problem is that the game loves to put you into a small room, with about 30 enemies swarming you at the same time. There is a certain level that takes place in a hospital, which was very stressful. In an earlier level I also had to turn the difficulty down once, because I literally couldn't get past a room. This isn't necessarily a flaw in the game, it just means you actually have to prepare well and get good items. If you think going into a huge area with one small healing capsule and 30 Ammo, it won't be fun. There may be crafting stations at some points, but sometimes you'll run out of luck and there won't be one in sight, while you are forced to go through a very difficult room. 

The ending, while I won't spoil it, is quite good in my opinion, although a little confusing. To be fair, the whole game is a little confusing. You actually do have the ability to choose between one of two endings.

The soundtrack slaps. 

What I was personally not a huge fan of were the testing grounds. These are underground bunkers, in which you can get weapon upgrades and other useful stuff. Instead of relying on combat, these locations consist almost entirely of puzzles. This is a purely subjective opinion of course, but I just don't like puzzles in games. They are optional though.

My only big criticism with the game is that I found the controls to be somewhat clunky. Maybe it's the lack of ability to sprint, or the fact that the dodge doesn't exactly have a large range, but I just found the movement to be a little frustrating, especially in difficult combat scenarios. In my opinion, the enemies were also a little bit too much of a bullet sponge. Although I'll forgive this, since I played on the hardest difficulty. As far as I know, it's better on the lower ones.


Overall, this game surpassed my expectations slightly. 

TLDR: Great, unique game. Quite difficult. Amazing soundtrack. Very nice graphics. Somewhat clunky though, and maybe just a little bit too short (for the price). 9/10.

Atomic Heart is perfectly balanced. In the early parts of the game, you are under powered and every encounter feels intimidating and dangerous, but as you progress and your arsenal and abilities expand, you begin to feel more and more capable, even though the enemies remain dangerous and worthy of caution. Boss fights are also well balanced, often requiring a few attempts, but never being so difficult that they're frustrating.
The combat is refreshingly open to experimentation, and resources can be used to upgrade weapons and abilities, and then traded in for other weapons and abilities while you hone in on your desired play style. On Hard difficulty, you have enough resources to survive challenging situations, but you never feel as if you have more than you need, or too little to survive.
The puzzles range from your standard pattern matching or timing fare, to more creative concepts like sliding magnetic walls, but also include exploration and deduction based puzzles, such as realizing that a seemingly closed building can actually be entered if you know where the equipment for opening such doors usually resides. That's one of AH's strongest features - it doesn't lead you around. You will have objective markers on the screen, but rarely do you get your hand held, and optional content is never pointed out to you. I stumbled onto side content entirely by accident, and at other times, stumbled away from the mission area without anyone correcting me or forcing me to go back on the critical path. I had to figure that out on my own. And at no point did an NPC talk me through a puzzle, but rather, allowed me to experiment and find the solutions, which weren't always obvious, on my own. The puzzles aren't difficult, but they require more thinking your average ""match the symbol to the color"" kind of thing, and it feels at least a little satisfying to solve them.
The game world is gorgeous and creative, offering an otherworldly, retro future sci-fi vibe soaking in soviet atmosphere. It feels as if the game never overstays it's welcome with a particular concept or area - the inside locations are unique and varied, but occasionally get traded for an open world to explore freely for optional side missions and for moving between different areas of the game.
It is also very refreshing, in a world dominated by western games, to get a Russian perspective. It becomes clear very quickly that the cultural moorings for this game are not Hollywood or the US, and the characters have a more old-school charm that embraces bad-assery. Your character is not some complex wounded hero with a dark past trying to atone for his sins; he's a tough guy soldier, with an almost naive sense of loyalty that he doesn't seem to doubt too much at first. I find the dialogue between him and his more eloquent AI companion crudely charming and funny. The story also has a much more intricate plot than it first seems to, and there will be several twists and turns along the way, and several story beats have well placed set ups and pay offs. 
I've encountered minor bugs - audio that didn't play, getting stuck in geometry once or twice, and subtitles that occasionally failed to load, though this was early on, and after a few patches, it seems these issues are mostly ironed out.",1681512269,1683056926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The performance is really impressive among seas of shitty unoptimized pc ports. Only the occasional crash shortly after release, and the current version is very stable.

The gameplay has some good ideas and solid foundation, but the standard enemies you encounter provide little to no challenge. To remedy this the late game fills rooms with a large amount of enemies and early game bosses. The feeling of progression where a boss that once took a significant amount of effort to kill being reduced to something that dies in a few shots and can barely put a scratch in you is rewarding, but feels somewhat misguided in the enemy spam late game. The bosses are a real highlight as each has their own unique set of mechanics, and only the Plyusch feels like a bit of a letdown.

The story feels like a lot was lost in translation. The basic core story beats are easy enough to follow and fairly interesting in just how bizarre what they are presenting is. The voice acting is the most noticeable oddity where the main character's performance is just awful. Every other voice actor does a pretty solid job which makes the singular poor performance feel even worse. The rest of my issues with the story I think could be the result of shoddy localization, and how a lot of back and forth dialogue happens mid gameplay where it is hard to pay attention to.

The music, what little of it there is, is fantastic. I wish the game leaned more on it's soundtrack as it did help make duller sections more interesting, and heighten fun moments like boss fights. Just a shame it was so criminally under utilized.

I hope this dev makes more stuff, and improves while doing so. There is a really solid foundation here, but the small flaws in execution bring the experience down.

Pros:-
1.) Lore and Environment - Unique setting and aesthetic. Beautiful art all around. Interesting worldbuilding too. Worth playing just for that.
2.) Combat Variety and Options. Gunplay also feels very very solid.
3.) Enemy Types and Variation.
4.) Music (Just on its own. There are some looping and sync issues with the combat and whats happening on screen, but by itself the music is good)
5.)All characters other than the protagonist.
6.) Boss Fights.
7.) Granny Muthafuckin Zina.

Cons:-
1.) GAME BREAKING BUGS - So, you get a shotgun at the start of the game and you are supposed to get the blueprint for it along with it. But you don't apparently. And there is no blueprint for the actual shotgun weapon anywhere else on the map. So if you deconstruct the shotgun to respec or try out other weapons(like I did), you can no longer reconstruct the shotgun and you can't get the achievement for having crafted all weapons. This is a well known bug and its shocking that the devs have not fixed it even now.
2.) The hostility of the not-so-open open world - After the first 2-3 hours, you eventually step out from a bunker into the world and it is unnecessarily and overly hostile. Wayyy too many cameras. and robots moving around in sporadic patterns. And you simply don't have enough ammo(even the free energy ammo) to deal with all of them.
3.) The morgue section - Like...why was that in the game? So bloody unnecessary. That entire segment could have been skipped and noone would have given two wet farts.
4.) The protagonist is an absolute moron with no capacity for contemplation,apprehension or self-thought. His default setting is to revert to saying ""Crispy Critters"" (he says that like a 100 times in the game) and then start shooting everything.
5.) Getting stuck in geometry - Got stuck in geometry (chairs, behind a ladder, on a wall, elevator door). Button mashing jump and running with direction keys eventually helped in getting unstuck.

I can't stand the MC. He's a complete moron. It's like a 3rd grader joined a gang and tried talking trash to everything and everyone. Most of the dialogue is sooo unnecessary. Not mention it isn't even done that well. The writing is absolutely atrocious. They treat the audience like we are too stupid to pick up on anything.

It has a ton of potential, but you can tell it will never live up to it. So many little things that bring it down. Shotgun out of ammo? Hit the reload and get 3 shells instead of the full 4. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Why did they add trashy platforming to this? This isn't Lara Croft. Sergei just can't hold a candle to her. Get ready to die needlessly from falling until it randomly works your 5th or 6th time. One thing that will help but they don't tell you until later, you can dash after jumping. Almost all the puzzles just aren't fun either. Or maybe more accurately they are just out of place in this game. They would be fine if they were in a Russian style Portal game. I wanted to skip them so badly. So annoying. Not Fun.

I would like to customize a few of the controls, but that isn't allowed. So Volt, which is your basic stun (think your quick melee bash) is set to 'V' and cannot be changed.

For the first half of game, the axe is by far the best weapon, but don't get the area attack with it, you'll get pummeled to death. Instead get the overhead attack. If I use the axe, I  eventually destroy things, but if I try to use skills or the crappy bb guns too much, then it's no good. Freeze the extras then just keep swinging with weak attacks until they die. About halfway through the game after you have painfully accumulated enough resources to boost your firearms, they start becoming useful.

I'd say the game is good, it's fun to play, there's a lot to explore, tho after the game dumps you out of the sort of 'internal-tutorial' facility, and puts you in the open world, the segments that have you back inside buildings feel fulfilling, (including boss fights) the free roam is a little dull and a bit on the boring side. And its a little disheartening but you cannot set 'markers' on your map to guide you to locations that you want to visit ( {Example} those weapon upgrade facilities ). So you end up reopening the map over and over to check your grid coordinates relative to the non-GUI marked location, a bit on the immersion breaking.

Another peeve is the lack of a cut-scene skip, I saw in the game Dev's posting that they wanted you to experience the cut-scenes that they worked on, to tell the story. But it kinda falls flat in some instances where; for example, the game black-screens or has a failed load after the scene is over, you have to restart, and re-watch the WHOLE cut-scene again. 

The option to still free-roam after the game is complete is a little on the strange side, as the only thing you really can do afterwards is collect more gun upgrades and such.

And I couldn't see an option to ""New Game +"" that would be a pleasant addition in a future patch, just be able to take everything you've gained, your upgrades, your weapons, everything into a fresh game, experience it all again but with more power. :D

The open world segment is extremely tough in some cases since while outside there is a high chance that robots you destroy will get repaired fairly quickly.  I found it was better to just run than try to stay and fight while exploring.   

The dialogue is interesting for the most part.  I did like the banter between P-3 and his partner.  Though P-3 came off as extremely naive and blind to the bigger picture to the point where even when presented with facts about what's going on that he  refuses to acknowledge it as a bad thing.  You'll get a much better idea of this as you progress through the story.

The games Aesthetic is neat and looks great.  It had a very 50's feel to it.

There are bugs to be sure.  One such bug prevented a destroyed camera from coming back, and when I managed to get the camera to respawn the game still thought it was destroyed.  It just so happened to be a camera that I needed in order to access one of the test sites and since that camera effectively no longer worked I was locked out of getting into an area that would have gotten me an upgrade I was looking for.  There were other times where I managed to jump onto things I shouldn't have been able to jump onto and got stuck.  Though it was my fault for jumping onto a small plan to see what would happen, not realizing that I would get stuck and have to reload.  The lesson there is watch where you jump sometimes.

The game play is solid, though post battle looting feels somewhat clunky, there a slight delay before you get items and again it starts to wear on you.

Has AAA quality with AMAZING optimization. This game really utilizes your CPU's single core performance and clock speed, it will max out your GPU usage while giving great FPS. I have a 3060Ti & 5600X, at 1080p on Atomic (max) settings with DLSS Quality I was constantly getting 150-300 fps inside the Vavilov Complex. That means the game has great CPU utilization and allows your GPU to flex. Seriously you can still EASILY play this game if you have an older GPU, even a 2060 6gb will run this game EZ with DLSS. Trust me when I say it's always better to be GPU bound rather than CPU bound. In fact, DLSS Quality may look better in-game than native resolution. If you have an RTX card I insist you try it.

This game is what optimization should be. TLOU1 PC port is an abomination. GTA 4's PC port was an abomination. Hogwarts Legacy performance is terrible. So many others. But not Atomic Heart, they gave us a fully baked cake with frosting & candles.

Also this game has some good political commentary. Various anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, anti-imperialist, pro-workers posters scattered across the game, notably in the Vavilov Complex. Although they're meant to fit the theme of a utopian 1950s USSR, they are unironically true and apply to the real world today.

668580,137383740,76561197988450419,0,9,1660,0,1660,1682618335,"A fun singleplayer FPS experience. The gunplay, melee combat, and movement feel good and the powers add a nice bit of extra variety and depth of gameplay. I appreciated that each of the weapons and powers were distinct enough that I really felt like I was making a meaningful decision when choosing which weapons to carry and which powers to have equipped. The crafting system is likewise ideal in my mind: it does the job of gating progression and forcing you to prioritize what to improve without bogging you down with inventory management, crafting intermediate materials, 

The worldbuilding is very interesting, and the storyline is mostly good, though a bit hit-or-miss. I think the weakest parts are the characterization. For a story that focuses so much on characters' secret motivations and manipulations, I would expect to see much more focus on interactions with those characters (or even references in terminal messages) that could give the player the opportunity to see how those characters behave, rather than relying on characters simply stating what certain people are like. The other very weak part in my mind is the very beginning: it feels like the game itself is confused about what the starting beats of the story are (possibly due to it being changed at some point during the development process), and as a result your character is knocked unconscious for multiple full days out in the open while murderous robots go on a rampage, and then you wake up with no indication so much time has passed. It's not until characters start making reference to the emergency going on for multiple days that it's clear that your character was knocked out for more than a half hour.

One issue is that the game uses references to invite comparisons to immersive sim games (in the vein of Deus Ex and BioShock), but I don't feel like it really does the work to fully justify inviting such comparisons. Spatially, the level design is very linear (that is, to get from point A to point B there is pretty much always just one possible route). Even in open-world where it feels like you should be able to go off the road to take shortcuts or avoid patrols, glitches in the level geometry are common enough that you will probably get stuck and have to re-load a save if you try. Your story choices are very limited (and there are no real side quests). The environmental interactions mostly feel more like using a key you have in all the locks that are paired to it rather than using your powers and tools to creatively circumvent obstacles. And while there are plenty of terminals full of in-world messages and audio logs scattered around to find, it's not really rewarding to seek them out. Basically, if you're looking for a spiritual successor to Deus Ex, BioShock, or Prey (2017), you will not be satisfied, although you will feel some recognition of certain elements.

In all, it's definitely a very fun game that I do recommend if you're satisfied with a fairly linear FPS experience, and I don't regret playing it. However, there's definitely the promise of something more here that I feel like the developers wanted to achieve and am disappointed they didn't.",1682621712,1682621712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's linger on the combat for a bit. Each weapon has a weighty feel to its attacks and sounds, compounded by how the enemies will stagger from your hits and shatter into pieces, explode, and overall visually become damaged as you hit them. I think it's the best thing that Atomic Heart does, making your attacks have impact, in a genre where enemies are infamous for being sponges that seem to be impervious to all notions of physics and force, this game, by contrast, will have its enemies become battered and smashed to bits in satisfying ways.

That experience however is hampered by dialogue interruptions and unskippable cutscenes. At the very least, it became expected when a cutscene would happen so I could let go of the keyboard for a prolonged period of time and enjoy the well-crafted models and animations, but the dialogue suffered from the same problem that almost all dialogue these days suffers from, you don't know how long it is, and if it will get cut off by triggering another event. That said, while the protagonist does come off as insufferable at the beginning, I began to enjoy his idiosyncracies (with the many moments of ""A locked door? What do I have to do? Open it?"" and other nuggets of brilliance).

What's important to understand about Atomic Heart however, is that the main thrust of the game isn't really to deliver a compelling shooter (which it ended up doing anyway), or well-written unique characters (of which the main cast can and are almost certainly written off for being tropey and tired). It's more about delivering an interpretation of the vision of the idealistic dreams of the communists, and how it came crashing down because of one critical factor, a lack of respect for the dignity of the individual for the sake of the supposed ""greater good.""

The ballerina bots, the extravagant visuals, the over the top self-assurance, make no mistake, these aren't to promote the USSR as some great society of the future, or to simply appeal to our modern lesser vices. It's to highlight the vanity and arrogance of its leaders, and to juxapose it with the several sacrifices of the brilliants minds and workers that made it that way.

Nationalism and nationalistic narratives are nothing new, but Atomic Heart brings to life the fiction that the very real USSR believed, in a way that is so close to the chest. That said, it feels more or less like a tech demo, and while it has some truly commendable parts to its gameplay, the overall product still ended up much like other mediocre triple AAA titles. What distinguishes Atomic Heart from the others is that its strong commitment to its world and robots gives it a unique feeling and look among the rest.

One thing though, I cannot emphasize enough. The gun play in this game is very fun.",1682386694,1682386932,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all, the soundtrack is amazing and I still listen to it even though I finished the game over a month ago.  It's probably one of the best video game soundtracks I've ever heard.  ""Zvyozdnoe Leto"" is an especially awesome song but there are so many to choose from.  

The graphics are quite beautiful and made the parade scene at the beginning a breathtaking experience.  The art style is extremely interesting, though the testing zones can look like a hoarder house sometimes and the main character even makes a funny comment about the state of one of them.  Enemy design is also interesting, though the robotic ones are the best.  I especially love the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" enemy you fight at a certain point in the game.  

The gameplay is also solid.  This game gets compared to BioShock a lot but I liked the combat more in Atomic Heart.  The melee feels satisfying most of the time and I like the heavy-hitting weapon with the sawblades (Zvezdochka) the most, though the fast attack blade (Pashtet) is also very powerful when combined with energy abilities.  One thing that this game could have used, however, is a block/parry function so perhaps they will add a feature like that in the DLC.  

Gunplay is also good.  I like to judge FPS games by the shotgun and Atomic Heart has a great one and I used it more than any other ranged weapon, but the Kalash is no slouch either. The energy weapons are also good, but I mostly stuck with the Electro pistol.  You do get a really powerful rail gun near the end but it's rather slow and an energy pig.

While Atomic Heart doesn't have as many powers as BioShock, I found all but one of them fun to use.  Mass telekinesis is awesome because there's nothing more fun than hurling your enemies up into the air and slamming them into the ground.  I also thought the polymer foam is an interesting weapon since you can charge it with different elemental effects and spray it around in creative ways.  Shok, however, is by far the most useful power since you can easily shut down robots and those annoying cameras with it.  The only power I didn't care much about was Frostbite because I didn't need to freeze enemies often and there are elemental canisters that can do the job instead.

One of the best things about this game is that materials get refunded when you respec and deconstruct weapons, so if you want to experiment with every weapon in the game you can do so without having to loot a lot for materials.  Even if you do want to spend time looting, the scanner ability and the ""loot vacuum"" makes this a painless experience.  

The story is pretty good for the most part, though the ending was a bit of a letdown.  There is a ton of lore in the game, but you don't have to read most of it to understand the plot.  I'm a bit of a lorehound, though, so I spent time going through all the terminals because it was interesting to learn about the science behind the polymer.  

The characters are mostly great.  I love Granny Zina the most, though CHAR-les and the main character P-3 have plenty of cool moments. The tram ticket scene was especially hilarious.  However, P-3 is a bit of a doofus and has a rather abrasive and childish personality that reminds me of 90s FPS protagonists.  I liked the character, but other players might find him annoying and stupid.  The other characters are more forgettable except for Nora the infamous vending machine and the Tereshkova tour guide.  

This game did have some jank, however, like getting stuck in the environment and the occasional crash.  I also experienced a frame rate issue that made it impossible to loot or use powers with cooldowns, but capping the frame rate to 120 fixed this.  There have been several patches since I played, so some of these issues may have been resolved.  Overall, Atomic Heart runs like a dream and it's probably the only AAA release I've played in a year that didn't have stuttering issues at launch.  

I paid full price for this game and I regret nothing.  I'm totally getting the DLC when it releases.",1682372129,1682372129,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Lots of amazing craft and brilliant, well-executed ideas here.
Was blown away by the visual direction, environmental design, models, texturing, animation, lighting, optimization, sci-fi tech and alt history concepts, ""dream"" sequences, gameplay pacing, cartoons, soundtrack, and more. All stellar on their own and when they come together, tended to be the strongest parts of the experience for me.

What needed more polish than anything was combat.
High highs and mid mids. A lot of the time it clicks - the feedback is great, its fun, you get lost in it, it gets your heart racing, you barely make it out alive. And sometimes, its tedious, drawn out, and not so fun. The game highly incentivizes you to be aggressive. Stealth and sniping aren't really viable combat strategies.

What was utterly baffling - the real time storytelling. I played with English subs and dubs. The story is told primarily through amatuerish, grating dialogue, and a smattering of awkwardly paced cutscenes. Not all of it is annoying and unintelligent, but most of it is. The script feels like a script the whole time, the performances are mixed but usually don't sell what's attempting to be sold, so much of it is highly derivative. I can't figure out what happened here - its so weird a giant project with so much going for it can fall on its face to this degree in this category. Its almost like highly skilled industry veterans tackled the creative for the entire project, teeing up the world, but the narrative writing was a first pass by a layperson that got rushed and had no oversight. Like... a bunch of people signed off on this right? How does that happen?

What was straight up not fun was my character getting stuck on objects in the environment, especially during combat. Since we're doing Plasmids, could we have an always-equipped one related to mobility that helps solve this pervasive issue?

I see a lot of complaints about the overworld, but I found it highly immersive. I never felt safe walking around in the open and I knew engaging with robots in that environment was high risk - but that's kind of the point right? If one person, even as uniquely qualified as Comrade Major, was able to tear through the open world no problem, wouldn't that undercut how much of a threat these robots are supposed to be? For me, it made exploring feel a lot less like running around in a giant, empty void, and a lot more like a calculated gamble where I might lose resources or progress if I'm not careful - but if I push through and use the provided tools to my advantage - I might discover something interesting, beautiful, or at the very least, a plain ol upgrade.",1682343366,1682343366,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Original Review - As an achievement hunter, I cant give this game a positive review. I honestly wish there was a neutral option but as there is not one, negative is closer to my overall feelings towards the game.
I have been following this game for years and even pre-ordered on Steam the moment I realised it was available but unfortunately there are multiple issues effecting such achievements as ""Apple Pie"" (apparently recent patch is to blame, only 99 apples but asking for 114), ""The Necromancer"" (every time i open the game, the counter changes) and ""The Motherland Does Not Forget its Heroes"" (another broken counter).
Having said all this, if you don't care about achievements, I would recommend the game, I have really enjoyed the vibe, music is awesome and story is cool but as reviews are meant for personal opinion (and I love to chase achievements), my review will remain negative as at this point, even if the issues with achievements are fixed, it will still require me to replay not for the fun of it but to rectify achievements i should have already had.",1680054367,1682319909,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I loved the size and complexity of the maps and puzzles. However, the protagonist, while not intended as a role model, sets an abysmal example with his constant complaining and outbursts, making him come off as a temperamental teen rather than a trained military officer. The dialogue is unimaginative and repetitive, and the constant banter with the 'glove' gets tiresome quickly. 
The game's anti-science tone is disappointing. The constant disparagement of scientists and the portrayal of science as evil hubris feels outdated and unproductive. In reality, science and technology have improved our lives in countless ways and should be celebrated and respected.
The game's narrative seems to present a critique of both communism and capitalism, but the criticism of capitalism is more explicit. However, the argument against capitalism seems to be a bit of a straw-man, as the game doesn't offer a clear alternative. Rather than presenting a nuanced critique of economic systems, the game appears to aim only to sow discontent without offering any solutions or alternatives. This approach ultimately feels unsatisfying and shallow.

It is part a vacuum cleaner simulator - and anyone who climbs ladder rungs the way this guy does has the brain of an ape.

Get it on sale.

I found it difficult to like at first and the main character's constant chat with his glove is a bit overdone. The end game is a bit too 'talky' as well.

But in the end, levelling the character and weapons is quite satisfying, and it becomes fun. Making the 'optional' Training ground maps, quite useful.

I'm not generally a fan of infinitely spawning enemies, but there is a way to temporarily disable all the robots in an area, allowing you to take a breather; And the 'Training Ground' puzzle 'dungeons' actually make a nice change of pace, as a few of them don't have any enemies at all, and the others have a limited number.

So it's actually a bit daunting at first - there are so many enemies and cameras, and infinitely re-spawning repair bots.

But it gets easier with levelling and upgrading - perhaps a bit too easy - I played most of the game with a melee weapon, and shock, frost and shield. Even defeating the final bosses with melee and shield alone.

I have started on Hardest difficulty, first 2 hours was real hard and almost turn difficulty down (i did not). 1st starting facility is big, like i can see some AAA devs just do that and call it a game. 

Sounds and soundtrack are so, so good, guns, enemys, you will be immersed in it. Guns and gun play is on the good side of it, but i used KS-23(shotty) 90% of the time, it just felt best on Hardest. Setting is so interesting and creative, you can feel and see every idea they had. Leveling and skill tree is well done, you can realy find your own style. Also gun mods looks nice on guns, only exception is collimator, unusable for me. 

Special shoutouts for the artistic vision of the world, nicely shows that such a system is always doomed to fail (as a post USSR country I can realy see all the pokes), and NORA is just an interesting twist on leveling, every time I was happy to see and hear her.

Pros:
+ weapons and gun feel
+ sound design
+ skills
+ progression
+ NORA 

Cons:
- first hour of gameplay is not so fun
- some characters are not well written
- main charakter is an idiot 
- in the open world it can fell blank (no radio, no dialog)

Conclusion: Great FPS that does everything that FPS game must and should do. I have been immersed. It have some flaws.

The game is fun, it just feels like there could've been more. They clearly spent most of their time making the game look sexual than adding game-play. There is only a handful of powers and half of them either feel weak against enemies or are useless entirely. The guns, melees, and weapon crafting is fun, but once again, it feels like they added the bare minimum amount of weapons to put in the game. In my opinion, the main character is insufferable and doesn't really redeem himself later in the game, i wish there was a mute button for him and i didn't pay attention to the story because i skipped everything he said when it gave me the chance. The game presents a way to be stealthy in this game buts its pointless, the only way to do that is to get behind every single enemy and press F. Halfway through the game, there is this an open world map you crash into and it was most fun part, it had a good bit of dungeons to go through and all sorts of puzzles and rewards, but shortly after that it got back to being a straight through closed world, which felt weird. The robots are very creative and fun to fight, i just wish the bosses were more than a one-time fight. The game's story was odd but the world looked incredible, the whole ""Limbo"" thing felt pretty forced into the story so i didn't care much for it.

However, towards the end of the game, the mini-boss known as Plyusch becomes a major obstacle that can ruin the experience for players. While the game gives you some clues on how to defeat Plyusch and escape its grasp, even a single mistake can result in instant death, regardless of your game's difficulty setting.

This difficulty spike is a major flaw that the developers should address, as it can frustrate players and make them lose interest in the game. Despite this issue, I still recommend Atomic Heart for its strong points. The game's narrative is intriguing and well-crafted, and the majority of the combat encounters are challenging but fair.

In conclusion, Atomic Heart is a solid game that delivers a thrilling experience for most of its runtime.

There are no ""builds"" you use guns and plasmids. I mean glove-powers, whatever the hell they are.
Run around the entire game spamming SHOK and maybe use the frost one for the plant enemies. 
The robot enemies are kind of interesting if there wasn't a literal infinite amount of them at ALL times.

Did you think the blood monster boss was cool and interesting and unique, did you want to fight 15 more of them throughout the game with literally NO change in their combat strategy. A simple method is to circle them spamming double dash while you destroy your left click on a melee weapon until they disappear forever.

The combat itself isn't bad, it's quite enjoyable. The first 2 hours of the game really do suck you in, being on the floating city from bioshock infinite is great, oh literally NO gameplay takes place here, except for the last 2 fights.

As a fan who had eagerly awaited the release of Atomic Heart for four long years, I was deeply disappointed with the overall experience of the game.

One of the major issues with Atomic Heart is its lack of direction and coherence. The game's story and gameplay feel disjointed and confusing, with little explanation or guidance provided. The plot is convoluted, and the events are often difficult to follow, leaving me feeling disconnected from the game world.

Despite the long development time, the gameplay in Atomic Heart falls short. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, making combat and movement feel frustrating and tedious. The enemy AI is inconsistent, ranging from overly aggressive to completely passive, which breaks immersion and hampers the overall gameplay experience.

Another letdown is the technical performance of Atomic Heart. The game is plagued with numerous bugs, including graphical glitches, crashes, and performance issues, which detract from the immersion and enjoyment of the game. After waiting for four years, I had expected a more polished and stable experience.

Furthermore, the visuals and audio in Atomic Heart, while initially promising, fail to deliver. The graphics are inconsistent, with moments of stunning visuals followed by lackluster and dated-looking environments. The audio design is also underwhelming, with repetitive sound effects and lack of variety in music.

As someone who had been eagerly anticipating Atomic Heart for years, the overall experience was a letdown. The lack of direction, clunky gameplay, technical issues, and underwhelming visuals and audio all contributed to a disappointing and long-awaited letdown.

The story and characters are relatively awful, the gameplay is very fun, the graphics are great (read: sex bots), the soundtrack is amazing. I played through it twice. With that said you may be wondering why I'd recommend against this game. I started this review about halfway through the game on my first playthrough, and so far I've had to overcome game breaking bugs about every other session, including in just 15 minutes in one case. Most of these bugs force me to reload the game, which are the ones I'm including here. This game is at best a beta test experiment rushed out to market, sloppily tested and unless you feel like being a beta tester for a game that most likely won't ever be patched, I'd recommend to avoid it, at least until all these bugs have been dealt with. I'll list out the fun progress-halting bugs below. If you are a fellow player who has run into your own share of bugs and you wish to add your own stories, I am enabling comments for you to do just that.

1) The most frequent bug, with a workaround as of 1.5 (the most recent patch) has to do with player collision. Just about any time you get wedged into a corner, whether it be from enemy special attacks, climbing, or just an unlucky jump on your part, you'll end up stuck inside an object. At this point you can jump to escape the wall you're in, and while I'm sure situations still exist where you can't escape, I haven't run into any. This was previously the worst bug in the game.

2) Similar to the last bug and likely due to the same problems, you are prone to randomly fall through the floor. Reload your game when this happens. I have some screenshots of this phenomenon.

3) There are many, many game stopping bugs in the form of the game incorrectly reading the current story progress state and locking you out of the next part of a quest. The one I encountered was when I had been farming resources and I had opened a side area called a testing ground when I noticed the elevator had locked itself again. I tried unlocking it again but this was impossible. One time it was randomly open when I loaded a save but I couldn't interact with the elevator. Finally I reloaded a save that was at least an hour before and made my way back to that spot and wouldn't you know it this time the elevator wasn't bugged. This happened both playthroughs, and affects the elevator in the wheat fields. 

4) I've run into a strange bug with the alert level in the game. Reminiscent of GTA's star levels, this game has cameras that have alert level 1, they see you, and 2, they see you fighting back. There is an overworld boss where, if you get alert level 2 right before going to it (this involves climbing on a Hawk) your alert level will permanently be level 2 until you reload the game, save, and reload again. Upon replaying the game I have new appreciation of this bug, since you are invincible in the boss area and can spawn infinite enemies that can't get to you, which makes it by far the most efficient farming method in the game.

5) This one was unexpected. I mean they all are, but I haven't seen something quite like this in another game. I was wandering a side area (and for a game that encourages exploration, these side areas seem to be fraught with game ending bugs) and I took a puzzle item known as a Candle out of the area, and into a liquid the game regularly refers to as Polymer, some sort of semi-solid you can swim around in. The polymer forces you to press shift to get out of its sides. Anyway, when I took this candle into the polymer, I found that I couldn't press shift to escape it. Nothing could get me out of it. I tried with no luck to get rid of the candle, but my character seemed to have developed a deep attachment to it and just wouldn't let it go. There are other areas in the game that you have to take candles into polymer, but they don't seem to have the same problem.

6) So this one isn't game breaking and partly bug, but mostly poor mechanic explanation. There is a very standard door lock in the game, a slit which your little wires go into. You can pick these locks at the very beginning of the game, though the game doesn't explain this. On PC, the game shows left click as the interact button when you are messing with the lock but shows nothing for ""Rotate"". Apparently this is shown as a stick button for a controller. This misleads one into making any number of assumptions about the rotate function, in my case I assumed that if I held click it would rotate. No, the devs just decided not to explain these locks and left out an icon for mouse movement at the side of ""Rotate"". What you have to do is first ""Rotate"" which moves the wires around, then ""Interact"" with your mouse by clicking and judge how rotated you must be by watching the varying angles of the wire. Your goal is to get the lock horizontal, so you triangulate the position of the wires by clicking until you get the position where it unlocks. You won't see this explanation in the game, and console players appear to have a much better one because when you search this you find many PC gamers frustrated and confused, where console players seem to find it intuitive. Perhaps it translates poorly to PC. Either way it doesn't help that there is no icon for the rotate function. I missed several of these doors, assuming I'd need another ability to unlock them since your glove outright says it can't pick locks, and finally I ran into a locked door impeding story progress where I finally found some explanation regarding this. It doesn't stop your progress outright or corrupt your save at least.

7) The game has outright crashed on me.

Bugs 8 and 9) These were deleted by the steam editorial review, and I only remember the first one. You can permanently get stuck, or at least have to reload, in testing grounds if a candle gets stuck behind objects and you can no longer interact with it. Not sure why the steam review process removed these from my list, I assume it takes steam too long to review things and I had a second edit that made them lose the first one. I don't remember the other bug so you don't get to know what it was, just that it exists.

10) After I finished the testing ground under a bunch of mutants, which is an extremely bugged area, I went back to the elevator entrance to see if I could get some stuff I missed and the elevator no longer existed, the room instead led to an infinite fall into the skybox. I couldn't fix this, I was permanently locked out of that area.

11) The area for the testing ground in 10 had me run into another bug, when I did a sneak kill on an enemy my guy became permanently diagonal. At first I thought it was my perspective, but then I noticed I couldn't get through doors or over certain objects.",1680990413,1681794473,False,2,0,0.504903912544250488,0,True,False,False

This game has a wonderful story and I myself did enjoy playing through it however it has many inconsistencies some parts of the game look better than others and some objects dont really look like they are rendered properly. one of the many bugs I experienced while playing was the game freezing this could be due to my PC as its not exactly a powerhouse but its not weak by any means I run a 1660 super/intel i9/and 16 GB of ram I played on medium graphics. the boss fights were hit and miss once again with inconsistencies some were really high quality and amazing others just ''meh'' another big issue with this game  was the writing for the dialogue it sounds like it was written by a teenager and made me cringe at times. Additionally there wasn't too much enemy variety in this game most of the game was just you fighting the same robots with others just barely sprinkled in. You did get to see more during the end however I wish we got to see more earlier on. This game could have benefited massively from another 3 years in development if all of these issues had gotten fixed I would rate this game 8/10. But due to the bugs/quality inconsistency and horrible dialogue I have to give this game a low rating. If you have the extra money and want to you can for sure buy this it had a great story and some moments were really cool.

I've been streaming this off and on since it came out, and I think today was the final straw. The protagonist is an annoying douchebag who never shuts up. He and his glove will be having lengthy discussions while countless robots are pummeling me into the ground. I sigh with relief any moment the speaking stops (which usually isn't for long). There's no reason the Major P3 and Charles need to be talking nonstop. As for the enemies, there is definitely a learning curve to the combat, but they're as cheap as they can get. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the helicopter robots coming back every five minutes and reviving all the enemies you just killed. The outdoor environments are begging to be explored, but it's not worth it. There's a half-assed stealth system and robots swarm you quickly. You kill them, loot a house and then they're back because of the flying robots who've respawned them. So you fight them again...and then your alert level has increased AGAIN...and more robots show up to rip you in half. Even looting things is a chore. It was novel, at first, seeing items fly out of drawers and into your inventory, but later on it's so monotonous. You'll enter a room full of shelves and 20 desks to loot, and you'll spend five minutes doing so. I'd say you could just not bother, but you'll need the components to upgrade your weapons to TRY and hold your own against the cheap-ass robot battles. The puzzles are okay. Some pretty unique concepts I've never seen in games before, but there are lengthy sections where you have to find five or six items and bring them back to a central location, one by one, so you can open a door or something. Therefore, you're constantly backtracking, fighting the same damn robots over and over. I could go on, but honestly what's the point?

Positives? The setting is really cool. I like the robot designs. I like the concept of the story, but I honestly don't know what the hell's going on. I don't know who anyone is, and the game gives me little reason to care. I rarely buy a game brand new, and I half-way regret buying this one.

The premise of ""Atomic Heart"" may not be revolutionary, but the setting and perspective give it a refreshing and somewhat innovative spin. Art direction, world building, level design are all top notch! Add to that the incredible selection of music, and you really do feel immersed in this utopian world. Fighting against various robot enemies never gets boring, and the various types of guns and abilities - each with upgrade paths - invite your to experiment. I found cartridges to be a great mechanic, intersecting gun upgrades, consumables and enemy weaknesses. Sadly, neither throwables (e.g. grenades) nor long-range weapons (e.g. snipers) are available, and melee may feel especially slow in the beginning. Crafting is key! And so is collecting resources, sufficiently available across the levels, and comfortably looted via a ""vacuum"" mechanic - although a sense of what actual resources are collected / required gets lost quickly. Character movement is fast, mantling and climbing works perfectly fine. Sometimes movement does not feel precise enough, though, especially during platforming puzzles. Stealth exists - but only theoretically, detection range and sensibility of robots is way too high (and cannot be improved via upgrades) for it to be a viable option. Cinematics - and animations in general - are of incredible high quality. One scene in particular (dancing ballerinas) is breathtakingly beautiful and will be stuck in my mind for a long time coming. You also have plenty of discussions with your robot companion, and they often turn out surprisingly philosophical, ethical, even political - nice!

Story and sense / pace of progression is a bit of a mixed bag, though. Some plot twists are predictable, others unexpected. There is a lot of exposition, discovery, showing off / explaining the world around you. At the same time, the game occasionally feels more like a museum tour than an actual story. Then there's the ""open world"" area in the middle of the game. It's essentially unnecessary, as you only traverse it to jump from mission to mission, not offering any meaningful additional activities or even story context. Yes, there are the ""Testing Ground"" puzzle side missions (all optional) to gather gear upgrades, but they quickly get repetitive and stale. All this leads to the overall story progression feeling slow, badly paced, stretched even. Investing into a few more ""linear"" story missions instead would've definitely been a better choice here.

Overall, I do recommend ""Atomic Heart"", and I'd probably advise skipping the whole ""open world"" / ""Testing Grounds"" parts for an overall more enjoyable experience.

That said, I have 50 hours of game time while writing this review and that's all from one play through---and I didn't even complete everything. I know people have beat it in much less but it's a game I felt in awe of while exploring and loved every tiny detail, historical reference and piece of art I came across and so, much of my time spent was outside of the main story line. However, for those that love a good gun-in-one-hand, pseudo-science-and/or-magic-ability-in-the-other-hand, I'd definitely recommend Atomic Heart. 

Bullet Points:

-Positive-

-Beautiful visuals, artistic design impresses throughout the game.
-Combat is fun and diverse enough to offer adaptation/experimentation as you advance.
-Leveling/Crafting system more supplementary than necessary (on normal difficulty bosses can be beat without heavy modding of weapons or completion of every fetch-quest side-quest for example).
-Absolutely wonderful soundtrack that goes from groovy folk-disco to techno death metal on a dime. 
-Good character design and movement/dodge mechanics.
-Good physics mechanics; it's really cool to see accurate and corresponding slash marks and dents in a robot's metal body as you wail on it with a machete. 
-Engaging boss fights (the first is my personal favorite, along with the accompanying music drop).
-Rich lore and culture throughout the world, both in the visual, audible and written records you can find.
-A pretty solid story that acknowledges the shoulders of the giants that it stands on.

-Negative-

-Some animation bugs with certain enemies/cut scenes (granted, many of these were experienced shortly after launch and were quickly patched).
-Odd editing choices at certain story-cut scenes (maybe this is just personal taste), with cutting between in-game scenes, cinematic scenes and quick-time events that can be a little jarring when unexpected.
-English voice actors are kinda bad, the protagonist sounds like a very stereotypical Chad (granted, some of the fault is in the dialogue writing---but also, I played in Russian which made the lines a lot more contextually funny).
-Dialogue can be a bit cringe at times (mainly is just in the sx jokes, but usually I didn't mind. The character is supposed to be crass, so whadd'ya expect when he's crass).
-Robot repair mechanic is way too fast and often in my opinion, you can barely kill some droids before repair bots are bringing them back for a second round (this is a game play mechanic so my complaint is simply a complaint rather than an actual critique). 
  
Personal Context:
I count games like Bioshock: Infinite, the Dishonored franchise, Fallout and some other Bethesda rpgs among my favorite games of all time and beyond that, have always found Slavic and Soviet history and culture fascinating. So, when in 2017 I first heard a semi-Bioshock, sci-fi, Soviet adventure shooter was coming, I immediately was hooked. I've followed this game's development over the six--nearly seven--years since then and I'm so damn happy to say (at least for me) it was well worth the wait. 

The Gameplay:
I found the movement and combat really fun in this game; I liked the Soul's style dodge mechanic for combat a lot, especially once upgraded, and how certainly abilities could be paired really well. However, while there's a lot of different possible combos that you can try throughout the game---and the game does encourage you to continually try new abilities by allowing you to effectively return your abilities for the same about of resources you originally spent on them so you can reinvest in a new ability---I will say that, once you find a weapon and set of abilities you like, you kinda just stick with those for the rest of the game (at least I did). I was constantly upgrading those weapons and abilities that I chose, but I was still using the second weapon you get in the beginning all the way through the end. This isn't a critique necessarily, just something to keep in mind if you're expecting a Borderland's level arsenal. Beyond that, the enemies are really diverse and all require different approaches to effectively fight, and the physics effects within combat are really cool to see in real time---I absolutely love to see bullet holes appear in an android's casing or dents and shattered lights on the head of those scythe-bots as you smash it with a saw-bladed bat. What's more, I think I experienced my favorite boss battle of all time in this game; the first boss you fight was cued up so well and matched with such a heart-clenching, floor-shaking banger of a song that it forever will reside in my memory---the way the boss's attacks are synced to the beat of the soundtrack really got me firing on all cylinders. 

The Visuals:
So I'm running this on what I'd consider a mid-ranged pc (but I'm not really an expert), with a 2600x cpu, 16gb of  ram and a 5600x gpu. Nonetheless, I was running the game on a mix of high and ultra settings with well over 60 fps (the max of my screen) on a 42"" inch 4k tv. I'm saying this all just to give you the context for what follows. Overall, I think Atomic Heart is an absolutely beautiful game, with a really gorgeous world and map for you to explore and a unique graphics and visual style that's definitely drawn from the Slavic and Soviet art the game populates itself with. The game seems to be pretty well optimized as well, as the draw and render distance was really great, allowing me to see super fine detail that I definitely appreciated. The only critique I have of the visuals was the hair texture on characters during in-game cut scenes looked a little feathery at times and, during a few scenes near the end of the game, some liquid-based characters looked a little too chonky to be taken seriously (I heard xbox series x had similar experiences). Definitely nothing too distracting.

The Story:
I don't think it's a secret to anyone who knows anything about this game that a) it's Soviet based, and b) it's kinda like Bioshock. I think that's a pretty concise characterization of the story to be honest. I say that with only good intentions but, to rip the bandaid off at the get, it's not exactly Dostoevsky. Just as Bioshock 1 and Infinite are alternate-history satirizations of Ayn Rand Libertarians and Religious/Fascist extremists in Reconstruction-era America, respectively, Atomic Heart is a satire of post Great Patriotic War-era Soviet Union in an alternate history (where I guess Stalin didn't exist? I didn't come across one reference to him which one would think would be relevant, the game being set in the 50's after all,) in which a scientific breakthrough put the USSR at the forefront of robot and android design. Surprise, surprise, though, another cutting-edge breakthrough goes horribly wrong at launch (like a lot of AAA games nowadays,) and the utopia becomes a dystopia that the protagonist is responsible for fixing. Yet another surprise, the protagonist's cryptic boss with weirdly sexual android ballerina bodyguards seems to be behind everything going wrong. It may sound like I'm being dismissive of the writing and I don't mean to be, because I did really enjoy the story and how many people and references from history were drawn into it; it's just that, once one has played enough of these story-rich adventure shooter games the twists and turns can be seen coming before they actually do. In conclusion, despite some minor bumps, the characters are fun and believable inhabitants for the game's crazy world, the story kept me engaged and wanting more from beginning to end (even when I felt a reveal coming,) and the writing worked really well with incorporating the combat and boss fights into the story's structure. On a scale of Fallout 4 to The Last of Us, the story scored a solid Dishonored 1 + DLC for me.

Fun and unique combat. Incredible visuals that nothing else even comes close to. I recommend this game just for the visuals alone, the combat is another plus. Its very slow and methodical at first, it eventually ramps up and once you have a bunch of ability and gun upgrades you finally become the god  that you imagine you would be when you first get the game. But the ramp up to this part is tedious if you cant settle down and enjoy it. It is very fun. 
As for the downsides... the main character's dialogue (and NORA.) Extremely, extremely grating and terrible dialogue. The mc is very rude and just plain mean to every other character he encounters. Swears a lot, very coarse and rough. And it is just terrible to listen to. It was so bad I was only able to enjoy the game after I turned the audio to Russian and subtitles on, which I mostly ignored. And there is a character called ""NORA"" who is a violent sexual sadist that you have to interact with. Who the hell thought this shit was a good idea...? Why not just make the characters normal people...? A huge and looming negative in an otherwise very good game. If they had made the characters good this game would be a GEM. 
Worth buying, but you MUST play with Russian language audio. Make the game much much better

By the time the game starts to actually unfold any story and give meaning to what your doing it just abruptly ends.... The dialog is quite bad and voice acting is alright. I feel the voice actors could have done a better job if the writing for the dialog was improved. It honestly feels like this team had a really original idea and some cool gameplay but the devs pack pedalled on making a hard game and went for a more mindless experience. Once I came to terms with the games combat quirks it was really not a hard game at all. 

The shooting and melee combat is fun but again has pacing issues. By the time you get all the upgrades and get things going the game just kinda ends. The Atmosphere and area/map design is very good and a highlight. The Art as well is also where the game stands out. It looks great and feels just interesting to explore, its one of the primary reasons I want to go back and play the game again.

Graphics
The world is beautiful and the game is definitely a 2023 release. What I mean by that is it isn't like some of those games released in recent years that have low quality textures for ""performance"" and ""artistic"" reasons (cough* Valorant cough* Valheim). In its current state, it doesn't even have ray tracing yet so I am excited to see how much better it looks when it does release later. The problem with this is, there was so much hype and even an Nvidia tech demo showcasing this game with raytracing, only for it to not release with it at launch.

Gameplay
I've never played Bioshock before, but I heard this game draws a lot of inspiration from it in terms of the guns and enemies. What I can say however is the few guns there are are actually fun and unique to use, so it's really a breath of fresh air from your typical first person shooter type of game. But notice I said ""few"", because again, there aren't many of them and the ones that are coming are locked behind DLCs.

Story
Predictable but interesting enough story with slightly cringy dialogue. I don't take issue with P-3 saying ""crispy critters"" but the constant arguing between him and CHARLES got old fast. Maybe it's the way Russian people speak, because towards the end P-3 considered CHARLES a friend. What I hated the most though is that the story was rather short, and it also ended on a huge cliffhanger. They seem to be banking on DLCs and a sequel to conclude the story but this feels like buying an incomplete game but paying full price for it. Kinda scummy.

Overall, I'll still recommend it. But at the time of its release and this review, just get Hogwarts Legacy first. Buy this game when it goes on discount because it isn't worthy of its full price.",1681533428,1681533501,True,0,0,0.473603814840316772,0,True,False,False

The game play was also fun, but i feel like they could improve the different abilities that you can acquire. The only abilities i found myself using were the polymer shield, shok, polymeric jet, energy management, and character. The other abilities didn't seem like they would be useful throughout the campaign.
Additionally the weapons were all good and unique, except for the melee weapons, most of them felt like they were not worth the materials because you already had a melee weapon to begin with, the only argument i can make for the melee weapons is that each of them come with unique abilities that make them stand out from one another. Each weapon brings in a unique aspect that makes them feel like you can play however you want, and with the addition of elemental cartridges, no weapon is a bad weapon, and they can be used for any encounter effectively.
The story of the game was amazing, there were parts that felt dragged out and annoying, but one thing I liked, which i have not seen another game do, is to have the character that you are playing be annoyed at the interactions as much as you are. I truly felt that the protagonist (P3) was annoyed at common video game tropes, even making comments about what happened earlier in the game and how much they got on his nerves.
The protagonist (Agent P3) was an amazing person, you could see how he could be swayed by different groups based on the facts they provided him, but at the same time he knew who he had allegiance to even when he was doubtful. P3 (or Sergei) was an amazing protagonist that I felt had developed a personality throughout the game. And throughout the game you got to learn more of his backstory, but very minimal information is given on who P3 is or how he got to where he is, Throughout the dialog you will have to create your own idea's or realities on what happened to P3. 
As the player I felt that the game made you think and how it didn't help you, you would just need to realize what you need to do by the environmental story telling. Atomic Heart provided many puzzles that you will not be coddled through and make you actually think and look around the environment for the solution.
At the same time I would not say the game is difficult but that depends on your play style. There were points when I felt like i could just walk through all the enemies, at other points I would find a secret passage then seek out the enemies I missed because the combat was fun.
The combat was fun, it was very enjoyable, you are offered many different approaches and you can handle combat however you like. The combat was enjoyable all way around, I don't really have anything else to say about it.
In short I would recommend this game to a lot of people and have already purchased this game for a friend so they can see how goo it is.

First 20 or so minutes I didn't need my hands on the keyboard. It was a lot of dull story line that felt rushed through. I went from riding in a river to walking, to riding an elevator, grabbing a key, riding back DOWN the elevator, going into a car copter, and then some other things that I didn't have to touch the keyboard for.

Some initial moments are lacking some sound effects, and the first 'boss' of the game never felt like a boss. He didn't get off his laser. Died before hand.

PROs: Awesome visuals and environments. Creative puzzles (the optional side-quest ones later are really good), great graphics, cool world, good if crass at times sense of humor. Open world aspect is nice, decent weapon variety. GREAT combat -- it somehow does a decent job of melee too, even if it's simple. Cool upgrade system. Tons of things to do, things to explore and find. Great boss fights.

CONs: Glitchy at times. Loading times in elevators take a while. Charles is great, MC is a bit too obnoxious in the way most MCs are: cynical and overly crude. Using maps to get around in the open world section is both essential and long/awkward/annoying.

Don't listen to people excessively dumping on it. Part of that is because the game is because of political nonsense, especially since it's political in a way games normally aren't. Which is funny since the depiction of the promised world at the start of the game is actually inspiring, and the MC is a true believer.

Atomic Heart is definitely an odd game. It has a lot of issues, both in it's design and in it's functionality, but it is also a unique, interesting and overall very fun game.

First, let me start by listing a few things that might make the game unbearable to play for some people. If any of these things make your blood boil, stay away from it:
- The game has LOTS of dialogue, and nothing will stop the characters from delivering their lines (yes, there are entire conversations during intense combat sections). Through at least 60% of the game, some dialogue is being played.
- About three quarters of the game's puzzles are either tedious or frustratingly difficult. Most can be bypassed and there aren't a ton, but you will miss out on a lot of things (mostly weapon upgrades and loot) if you don't complete them.
- The game has quite a lot of collision issues (eg: getting stuck between two rocks). I've never gotten permanently stuck, but I had to aggressively dodge, jump and move a few times to get unstuck from geometry. At some point you'll start understanding what type of geometry you should try to interact with and what to avoid, but it is frustrating for the first few hours.
- The narrative and dialogues aren't the best of the year for sure. I'm not saying it's bad, but if you're the type of person who mostly plays games for good stories, this isn't the game for you.
- Horrible platforming. There isn't a ton of it and it's mostly optional, but it's definitely not what makes the game shine.
- The game offers very little in terms of accessibility (both design and features), so it's most likely unplayable for anyone with moderate to severe motor, visual, auditive or cognitive disabilities.

Now to the good stuff. Atomic Heart does a few things poorly as mentioned above, but it also does some things with absolute brilliance. Here they are:
- This game has the best FPS boss fights I've ever experienced. I almost feel bad making the comparison, but this is Dark Souls levels of brilliant boss design: challenging, unique, visually and auditively striking, intimidating and, most importantly, fair. I've seriously never had more fun fighting bosses in an FPS, it's mind-boggling how good they are.
- The music in this game is absolutely bonkers. Not only does it have some of the best combat music I've ever heard, but it also has great in-world radio songs and atmospheric music. And it's not only good; it's well used. I'm not going to spoil anything, but this game has the best mix of gameplay and music in a sequence since FarCry 3's Make It Bun Dem mission.
- The gameplay is a great mix of old-school and new-gen. No sprinting, plenty of dodging, multiple guns have alternative fire modes, huge emphasis on mixing melee and ranged combat (moreso during the first half as resources are scarce) and fun, varied enemies.
- The game has a very well-paced power fantasy. Most games that come out either make you work too hard to feel empowered, or they just make you feel empowered from the very beginning without asking anything of you. Meanwhile, Atomic Heart has a very nice and organic crescendo of Player strength that just feels great.
- Brilliant world-building. Like, I can't put it into words because it's so weird and unique, but it's seriously one of the nicest universes I've seen in recent gaming history. It's dark while also being colorful, it's dirty while seeming clean, it's both conservative and progressive at the same time, and it's very weird.
- The game runs and looks great. This is something very rare in this era of unoptimized, okay-looking messes, but this game looks extremely good for how little it demands from your hardware

Now, as you might have noticed, I've skipped a few things that are mentioned a lot in other reviews; the protagonist's constant swearing and odd expressions, the weird plot twists, the lore and the intro's dissociation with the rest of the game. I'll be honest; those things don't matter when you do a few things or look at things differently:
- Protagonist's swearing and expressions: set the game's VO to Russian. It feels more immersive, you can focus on the dialogue only in contexts that interest you, and Russian people swear all the time in real-life. It seriously makes the whole experience that much better.
- Plot twist and lore: As previously mentioned, this game shouldn't be played for it's story. It's not bad, hell it's even pretty good, but targeting this aspect of the title to say whether it's a good game or not is irrelevant when considering everything else it has to offer from a gameplay, pacing and world-building perspective.
- Intro feeling disconnected from the rest of the game: It's a tutorial. It's purpose is not to feel like the whole game, but to give you the tools and knowledge to perform as well as expected once the game actually begins. And you know what? It does a great job at it.

So, I won't give a grade or anything like that since I believe people should buy games based on their strengths and weaknesses instead of an overall score, but what I can say is if you like immersive sims like Prey, shooters like DOOM, atmospheric experiences like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., or even impressive tech demos like Half-Life 2, this game is definitely for you. See you in Facility 3826, Tovarisch.

P.S: Armageddon (Hard) difficulty is highly recommended since it forces you to use all the tools at your disposal. Playing on easier difficulties will likely end up in finding a cheap/easy way to tackle everything instead of using varied tools and strategies.",1681301612,1681401955,True,3,0,0.544713377952575684,0,True,False,False

668580,136622099,76561198020657797,0,50,2432,0,2432,1681368593,"Personally, I'm biased. I love, and studied, Slavic culture for four years in university, the Russian Language for three years, and have been fascinated with Soviet-Era technology, mentality, and history for almost as long as I can remember, all the way back to the Red Alert 2 days. So, I'm DEFINITELY biased, but let's address some things right out of the gate here. 

1) This is basically a watered down bioshock clone. There's less interactivity with the world in many ways, but that doesn't take away from the game very much. You won't find a hacking mini-game here, for instance, but you CAN hack things in a technical sense, and it's very useful.

2) The English voice acting and translation is pretty dogshit. I've tried both English VO and Russian VO. The Russian has the right tone, and changes everything considerably. My recommendation for non-Russian speakers is to play with the Russian VO and whatever subtitles you can get in your language. For English speakers at least, you'll get the right tone and the original vision much more closely. The English guy sounds like a parody of the guy the Russian one is trying to portray.

Now onto what Bio- er... I mean, Atomic Heart is about.

Atomic Heart is based in an alt-universe Soviet Russia where, from what I can gather, the USSR gained access to German engineers rather than the newly forming NATO. As a result, NATO countries have been seeing an economic downturn, but that may not be the only reason. There's a lot of backdrop here that's hard to piece together without a second run, something I don't have time for. However, the main story is about an amnesiac supersoldier with a glove that talks to him, spits lightning and can telekinese enemies, and whose job is to stop a localized catastrophe from getting any MORE out of hand than it already has. 

Think Rapture, but like... a few weeks BEFORE the protagonist arrived. You, the player, arrive on the scene mere hours after the 'big thing' happens. So, you get to experience all the beauty and wonder of the things going on, while also 'enjoying' the juxtaposing blood and death that accompanies the event in question. It's quite stark. 

That's the deal without ruining the story any.

Other than that, you shoot robots and things, upgrade weapons, craft new stuff, and break into secret bunkers which hold advanced schematics for everything from new stocks for your AK, to a literal Railgun. This is not a spoiler.

There are a few gripes to be had, but other than those, the world is beautifully realized, and totally wild. That being said... The secret labs seem rushed. There is talk of experiments which could have been very interesting to see in progress, but instead you get room-sized lock puzzles in their place. This feels like a result of things being rushed, or maybe it's a result of the development hell this game went through that I heard about in whispers through the net. It's hard to say, because it cannot be a result of a lack of imagination. Not with everything I saw over the course of 40 hours. 

Speaking of 40 hours, I played on Armageddon (Hard). I'm not sure if I recommend it over the middle difficulty. Everything is very tanky on Armageddon, hits like a literal truck, and you may find yourself running away more than fighting in the overworld. I feel like this is how it's supposed to be, but there are some annoyances which accompany that. I'll leave those for you to find out on your own, since they're likely subjective anyways. 

Also, if anyone starts speaking to you, MAKE SURE you STOP moving. Some of the dialogue is fairly long, and if you trigger something in the game while someone is speaking, there's a good chance they'll get cut off and you'll miss something. Additionally, should you choose to pursue the Testing Grounds... the MOMENT you see one of the special chests, DO NOT proceed further into the facility to make sure you didn't miss anything. IMMEDIATELY get the chest, and then IMMEDIATELY return to your closest save point and SAVE. I made the mistake of dying after getting a chest, forgot to retrieve it, then was surprise-lifted to the surface for a boss fight in an elevator I didn't even know was an elevator, forcing me to go back through the same facility AGAIN, but this time I had to get really creative because some Testing Grounds are not built to go through twice. I succeeded, but you may not be so lucky.

All in all, this game has great vibes, a huge imagination, and the ending is particularly 'Slavic,' for those who know what that means. I won't ruin it for those unfamiliar with Slavic storytelling and how things tend to flow and go, but I do not think you will be disappointed. Try to see both endings, but choose the wrong answer the first time, trust me. Then maybe watch the one where you don't fight anything on Youtube, because you have to go through a 30 minute walking/dreaming tour just to reach the decision point again, otherwise.",1681387251,1681387279,True,1,0,0.501968502998352051,0,True,False,False

Enjoying the game-play so far. Not quite 1/3 way through the story. Appreciate the design choice that recycling items and switching skills give 100% resources back, to allow for experimentation without losing resources. 

My one complaint is the key binds. If you're not a standard WASD player you're screwed when it comes to driving since not all the functions change when changing the keybinds (like left and right turn). Also cannot have move forward and accelerate as they same key unless its the default W key. Had to find the local settings files and change it there, instead of in-game settings. 

Hopefully something that'll get patched.  4.5 out 5 for me so far.

*Update*
After completing the story, I probably will not play it again. 

I did like the puzzle areas, but the game-play overall got repetitive and easy. With certain skills I was able endlessly stun lock enemies (GOO + Shock).

A little jank here and there, with some bizarrely bad writing and acting in places, but wow, the visuals, art style, lore, satisfying combat and sense of progression are great. Performance on PC is also unbelievably smooth.

Every area feels unique, and seeing new environments with amazing art and lighting is a treat. The game plays kinda like Bioshock; taking place in a deteriorating retro-futuristic utopia - the period art-deco environments, with lots of underwater and sky-floating definitely evoke a lot of Rapture / Columbia vibes. In terms of gameplay, you have elements / plasmids on your left hand and can use guns with the right. There are larger 'miniboss' enemies like Big Daddies that have specific weaknesses and resistances, and you can loot all corpses and containers in the environments for a ton of crafting materials and supplies. If you like exploring alternate-history worlds with sci-fi elements, this is gold.

Scavenging the environment and defeated enemies will yield crafting components that you can use to upgrade your skill tree, which has things like extra health, chain lighting for your shock-glove, more inventory capacity, etc. Then there's also weapon upgrades which can alter how the weapon handles and also change the visuals considerably. You can spec weapons so they deal more damage to robots, or organic enemies, etc. There are also 'element' capsules that you can screw into the weapons to add extra fire / electric damage, etc. Plenty to play and experiment with.

The first 4-5 hours are pretty linear and introductory, and then the game opens up quite a bit, with lots of optional side areas (with decent challenges and puzzles) The 'challenge' / testing facilities all have unique puzzles and encounters, which lead to weapon upgrades. Finding and completing these has been very fun and rewarding.

The boss fights are really cool and intense - and the soundtrack is extremely good. Mick Gordon (of DOOM fame) knocks it out of the park with very heart-pounding tracks. The music also smoothly changes as you enter combat and clear areas of enemies.

Animation quality is absolutely stellar. All the robots and characters move with so much detail and personality that they're a joy to watch. The cutscenes and other in-game interactions your character has with the environment are exceptionally detailed and cinematic. 

Performance is smooth as butter, even on my ageing PC (i7 6700K which is 8 years old) and a 2080 Super with 32gb DDR4 RAM. I have the game maxed out on Ultra at 2560x1440 and in most areas it's a solid 144fps (with some dips down to the 80's in the open-world areas.) It also has ZERO shader stuttering, unlike every other Unreal Engine 4 game I've played in the last few years. I'm shocked at how well made this is. There's a quick 1-2 minute shader compile while you fiddle with the settings menu, and then it's smooth-sailing.

There are some negatives, which I can kinda look past, since things overall get better after the intro. The opening hour or so is basically an unskippable auto-scroller that really shows you the world. The intro is filled with walking / talking sections where you slowly ride a boat, slowly ride an elevator, slowly ride a car, slowly converse with several plot characters, etc. And some missions involve some tedious fetch-quest stuff. Though thankfully the action between these is great.

The first few hours feature some [i]very[/i] cringe dialogue. Over-bearing sexual innuendos, tons of unneccessary inflammatory dialogue that makes the main character unlikeable, and some very odd voice direction at times. Though the wackiness of it has made it an entertaining curiosity so far. I never know what's going to happen next, or how characters will react! In fairness, there's also a lot of good dialogue, and some has genuinely made me laugh, with some fun meta commentary on the world of gaming.

Overall, if you can look past some of the writing and occasional bugs, there's a lot to like here. As a huge fan of Prey, Bioshock and Half Life, I'm having a blast with this.",1677267635,1681353745,True,8,0,0.592314183712005615,0,True,False,False

Gamplay: arguably the most important part of a game, atomic heart at times knocks it out of the park but also stumbles a lot with its gameplay. where it succeeds is the linear dungeon like segments, these usually offer the perfect blend of exploring the enviorments, puzzles, and fighting enemies, not to mention the bossfights are great in atomic heart, with a great soundtrack (mick gordon is the goat) mixed with funfights. however for as much as i like the linear segments, the open world is not the same, in fact i hate it. its covered head to toe with enemies and cameras that spawn more enemies, your only real way of travel is a car that explodes after 2 hits and controls terribly,  i love the world and want to explore it but i just cannot get anywhere with out getting attacked by enemies every which way its so annoying, while you can turn off the enemy spawners this takes a good bit of time, and its honestly easier to just drive or run by the enemies. on a more positive note the gunplay and melee is pretty good, its just how many enemies you fight that makes it annoying and monotonous.

smaller issues: the english dub is awful, like really awful, it ruins the story, but theres a solution, change it to russian, the native language, the acting is fine there the worst that will happen is you might miss some dialouge. next issue the game can be a bit buggy, they not so common its gamebreaking but every now and then you will see a bug. finally the game is a bit too horny, at first its funny but nearing the end the sexy robot close-ups and sex jokes can a bit tiring. 

Verdict: atomic heart does a lot good, a lot average, and a lot bad but overral its still a unique experience in a sea of the same games and while its not perfect i do still quite enjoy it. that being said its not worth the 60 bucks, wait for it to be on sale.

I ended up playing to the end, and during that time I went from being bored, to having fun, to feeling like I was finally getting in to the game, only to be crushed in what I can only describe as one of the most disappointing endings I have seen in a game in a long time.

To start with, the combat is only mediocre.  The weapon selection is decent and nothing ever really becomes outdated, but the limited enemy variety means that combat becomes stale at times.  The powers range from feeling pointless to feeling overpowered, but often require a lot of upgrading before they even are worth using.  At the beginning of the game, ammo is very limited and you don't have access to decent powers, so combat can be stressful as you try to conserve ammo while still avoiding damage.  By the end, when resources are more plentiful, waves of enemies come at you and are bullet soaks, so it really becomes a question of how quickly you can burn the enemies down while dodging their attacks, and yet, the combat still doesn't feel as fun as some other modern shooters.

The story goes from being boring to being outright ridiculous.  I feel as if the writers felt they were being clever in their story telling and that they wanted the end to be this big, exciting revelation, but everything through the story came across as convoluted and the ending just seemed to distill an overly complex situation into simplicity.  I really was rather apathetic about the whole thing.

In the end, I enjoyed large chunks of the game, but the lackluster combat and convoluted storytelling just left me blase about the whole situation.  I've chose not to recommend mostly because I don't care enough about the game play or story to want a sequel and I feel that other people should spend their money on a game that is actually satisfying.",1681303366,1681303366,False,4,0,0.546383559703826904,0,True,False,False

My recommendation would be to just watch a video about the story instead, it's not that long anyway and you save yourself a bunch of money and time.

But let me sum up my experience in a little pro/contra-section:

Pro:
- The idea of the setting of the game - being a soviet tech-utopia - is ingenius and super interesting
- Stunning visuals
- The story itself - while cliche - is not that bad (but way too short)

Contra:
- Playtime of ~15 hours for 60€... that is pretty harsh... 
- The core gameplay during those ~15 hours consists mainly of [b] shooting at three types of enemies [/b] (they have variations, but they all do basically the same things). These are quite unimaginative and it just gets exhausting after about two hours of gameplay...
- The same enemies keep getting repaired (especially in the outside world), so they just keep coming back after being defeated, making them even more annoying and eliminating any sense of reward...
- The [b] fighting system [/b] is quite boring (a simple dodge, some melee weapons which all do the same thing and some ranged weapons, plus some stuff you can shoot from your hand). This wouldn't be a problem if the focus of the game wasn't put on shooting the aforementioned enemies for 15 hours, but it is.
- The puzzles - usually in form of door locks, lasers on a wall or canisters that have to be plugged in somewhere - are super unnecessary... and the most annoying, almost enraging thing is: P-3 has [b] multiple voicelines complaining [/b] about how stupid and annoying those are... Why they decided to put those in (other than to drag out the playtime) is beyond me
- The main character - no offense - is kind of stupid and seems to forget pretty much every discovery he makes. The result of this are about 4 hours of gameplay where you learn pretty much nothing, because P-3 (the main character) keeps learning the same information over and over, while you eagerly await some new information
- A lot of mails can be reach on these ""PEACH""-terminals (computers)... unfortunately it's a waste of time, most of the [b] information on them adds no value to the world or story [/b]... same can be said for audio recordings scattered around the world
- Major spoiler for the ending of Season 8 of GoT and minor spoiler for the end of the game: [spoiler] The game ends on a ""plot twist"" that's about as good and foreseeable as Daenaerys burning down kings landing... [/spoiler]

Conclusion:
In my opinion, this game could have been much better, if it had focused on the rich world and the story within and much less on just fighting dull enemies. It's pretty clear to me that the devs tried to replicate the formula of God of War, which to be fair also has quite a small variety of enemies that you keep fighting over and over whilst finding yourself in an wondrous world. Unfortunately they missed to realize that GoW also tells an incredibly gripping story, which keeps players pinned to their seats, which this game fails to do. If they had managed to succeed on that front, this game could have been truly amazing, because the overall vision of it is phenomenal.",1681232480,1681232480,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Arsenal creativity: Great 4/5 (crafting, disassembling, upgrading are all in there. I would say Fallout 4 sits at 4.4/5.0 compared to this game)
Open world design: 2/5 Okay (maybe I am not into Open World games as much anymore, but it should have been more like the 3rd-5th Far Cry games)
Enemy design: Great 4/5 (evokes uncanny emotions, the need to defend yourself, emerge victorious)
Enemy variety: Great 4/5 (Terminator-like enemies, liquid metal terminator-like enemies ( >:) ), lawn mowers, refrigerators, vacuum-robots, Mark Zuckerberg)
Enemy distribution: 2/5 okay (the game's intention to overwhelm you and make you feel small gets old pretty quickly, especially when you git gud and it doesn't work on you anymore)
Stealth mechanics: 1/5 not enjoyable (you can't hide from Communism)
Problem solving: Good 3/5 (would be good, like Portal 2's, if not for the too many locked doors)
World building: Good 3/5 (mostly in the intro of the game)
Story quality: Great 4/5 (was more interested in story than the Open World, bc of main character)
Story length: 2/5 Okay (as if they were gonna make it longer but the Kremlin came to the devs and made them stop (joke)
Character design: Great 3/5 (well, there are no characters, almost everybody is dead. But at least the guy you play as curses a lot and has a friend and some dead people to talk to)

Things I didn't like:
>Indoors, every 4th door has a bloody lock puzzle on it that probably takes up 1/6 of my game-play time when I could be kicking doors down giving the character the bad-ass scene he deserves - ruins the otherwise dynamic flow of the game. I'm only referring to door locks. There are environmental puzzles in the game that are enjoyable otherwise.
>Enemy design is amazing, but for the love of russian commie god, the enemy distribution mechanics get pretty old after a while. The most I'll say without spoiling is there is a system implemented that has sends new enemies to resurrect (no, not just respawn) fallen enemies  - and the break period between your successful fights and these dudes coming back to life AND having reinforcements to get revenge on your ass is way too short. And if your Overpowered by then? It's still annoying because man oh man, there eventually makes it to where there are A LOT OF ENEMIES IN AN AREA. They will become at the very least angry roadblocks during your open world travel (sometimes they don't despawn!)
More on this, this prospect of getting of getting overwhelmed by angry amazon Alexa's no matter how many of them you kill is supposed to incentivize you into 
1. not lingering in one local area for too long, go explore other areas
2. performing a quasi complex task of shutting down the local area's enemy ""control hub"" (the equivalent of taking out outposts in far cry 3) to free up the territory.
The thing is, #2 only lasts for TEN MINUTES. Even worse, shutting down disables puzzle systems needed to unlock dungeon-like structures that contain things you might want later on (on the small chance that the BUG occurs where the area is shut down PERMANENTLY, hooray for you! [unless a dungeon you really want to get into is permanently locked, then YOU'RE F***ED])
>The characters are good, but the character acting is great. During cut-scenes, the atmosphere and tone of the story worked really well with what I thought was stellar localized language voice acting and animated expression. The story itself wasn't 4-D chess, but the character acting really carried it forward. I felt like I was going places in the story, witnessing alternate history.
...which is why I was really angry when the game ended sooner than I expected. For such a high price tag, I really was hoping for a longer ride, but at the end of the rollercoaster, I had to go home.
>They tried to implement stealth in the game, but it's virtually non existent because
1. This is the USSR in the game, there are cameras everywhere and they catch you in 2 seconds so stealth is not only useless but you have to deal with destroying them constantly in the open world but that doesn't work either because
2. the cameras are robots also run by Jeff Bezos of amazon and they get resurrected like everything else
3. When they see you they will send even more Roomba iROBOTs to kick your ass or keep you from having a 5 minute break (Jeff Bezos HATES employee breaks)
4.  You don't have silenced firearms because you can't afford it because you're Soviet and all your weapons are made out of (combat effective) toaster ovens that your grandparents used to kill Nazis in world war bazinga.
If they wanted good open world stealth, they should've taken notes from Far Cry 3 and Metal Gear 5, hell maybe even Skyrim and Fallout series.

Things I wish it had:
>less locks on doors, even the player character complains about the jarring amount of locks on doors.
>More story content and/or expansive DLC - The story itself was was alright, but I really enjoyed the character design, especially the main character (no more spoiler). The voice acting and animated acting was very compelling which is why I was sad when the game suddenly ended, I got off the rollercoaster and had to go home
>More character abilities, the ability customization and design was no more sophisticated than Bioshock franchise, however Bioshock was able to implement the interactivity and situational ka-pow to special abilities a little better than this game. The biggest upside however is that you can easily refund your ability points for ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of the cost, allowing you to experiment. (knock knock, keep this in your next game mundfish)
>more open world incentive, not going to talk too much on this, though I will say to any prospective players is to explore as much as you want to as early as possible before proceeding through the main story, because if you get into the main story too deep, after a certain mission open world will no longer be in the works for you

Humor was great, storytelling throughout was clunky in the way only translated game can be but I found it worked fine if I didn't get hung up on it.

Weapons vary well enough, powers seem effective, most even work on bosses to some degree or another.

The open world is optional and can be passed if you're happy with your equipment as-is. Use of puzzles to gate extra content and things like doors is a clever way to keep you from running past everyone. 

Varied and interesting enemies, cool environments, unique challenges.

Unfortunately the last little bit really is frustrating. Feels like there was a Bioshock-esque twist in their minds, but what it felt like was half predictable stuff that I guess as soon as they brought up the topic, and half complete surprises that I had no way to interact with. The twistiest part of the twist makes you feel like a booby and the only alternative is lame. I don't know how I could possibly play the game and be happy with where things end up and it manages to sour much of the rest of the game in the process. 

I would still absolutely recommend this game if you like games in the Bioshock, Dishonored, Deathloop vein.

But not buying this game for me after 5 years of waiting proved too tempting for me.

Gameplay: First of all let me start by complimenting this game on the gameplay situation in several aspects. The gun play is smooth, the abilities are fun, although I never really tried any of them because there seems to be little reason to. The polymer jet/frost or whatever its called is perfectly fine to use all game with the gravity thing so yeah I ll give it the criticism I gave to BioShock Infinite - having only two of guns or abilities with a big variety does not work. We should have been given all abilities to play with at all times. However, the gameplay is still really fun! You probably heard about the spongyness of the enimies and that would not really be an issue were it not for the gameplay loop. I dont have a problem with gameplay in terms of gun play and controls and whatnot (except for something I will go deeper into later), but I really have a big problem with the gameplay loop. You see, in this open world there are these indestructable (at least to my knowledge) robot spawners, which will spawn a robot immediately after you kill another robot or destroy a camera and it will try to repair them. Repairing takes only seconds and there is an unlimited number of these repairing bots, not to mention these spawners are everywhere. So the problem with this game is 100% in terms of gameplay the fact that the enemies can literally respawn in front of your eyes. I have unironically found myself in a situation at one point, in which I killed 11 robots at once and within seconds I had to fight them again because they were immediately repaired. These repairing robots they are flying drones btw, so yeah you gotta waste some ammo on them. Were it not for this mechanic the gameplay would be flawless for the game that it is. Truth is I was hoping this game would be more BioShock than it is, I was hoping for a proper survival horror, but I dont have a problem with the more action-y take, even though it kinda makes me sad.

Movement: I m only including this point because for some reason its incredibly easy to get stuck on anything in this game. I mean it, anything. ANYTHING. This is hard to explain through text, but for some reason I kept getting stuck in completely random places around furnitare and unable to move and the only way to solve this situation was by quitting to main menu and reloading a safe. I once lost like 15 to 20 minutes of progress and the saving stations and saves in general are not really far away! Also the parkour is very clunky, Rockstar Games´ games have less clunky parkour than this game. Its really hard to jump from platform to platform without bumping off of it into oblivion.

Story: I must say I was not that fond of the story. Basically from the get-go I was calling what was happening until I got cocky at the end and didnt call the ending twist. I am an aspiring author, but of course no expert on writing. I would, however, considering the ending twists of the game quite nonsensical, although if you read into terminal e-mails it does make some sense. I personally think Babushka Zina turning on you is simply weird. Is she in love with the glove? She acted her surprise he was alive? She wants to die and join him as black goo? Also, the ending is completely unsatisfying. You either are left with a horrible ending of a single guy controlling humanity or a horrible ending of a single guy trying to kill everyone while trying to also control everyone, while the game teases a third option, which does not exist, and I have searched! I consider this such a shame because the story, while not ground-breaking is otherwise quite fun. The endings ruin it and thats really sad. You are not left with any moral of the story, you are left with Russian pessimism, which I, as a Slovak, fully understand. At the same time I find myself wondering why have I even gone on this journey of a story-focused game if the story has no point? I suppose they do tease a sequel a bit though. Also, there is a LOT of sex jokes. A LOT A LOT. I personally dont mind them since I come from a Slavic country and we here basically only have sex jokes when we grow up, but I can see why many people would be turned off by them (haha, get it? Sex jokes turning you off not on?)

Soundtrack: NOW THIS, THIS ladies and gents is something I cannot say a single bad word about. While sure, sometimes a little weirldy implemented the soundtrack of this game is genius. I think I love every single remix, every single sound the game makes, it is truly wonderful. Something I will unironically put into my playlist on Spotify. 

Lore: The lore of this game is simply amazing. They truly worked on it and I have nothing more to say. The world building is fantastic and you should go out there and enjoy it for yourself without me spoiling much for you! Oh and a certain Andrey Rayanovsky is waiting for you in a certain terminal at a certain places called Academy of Consequences. So read all the mail there, you ll thank me for it! 

Final thoughts: I would recommend this game. While I think it got, just like BioShock Infinite, watered down from a masterpiece to what we have now I think it is still a solid game. Now, I dont really like giving number reviews, but I ll do it anyway since its quite obligatory. I d give this game 8/10. Were it not for the fun gameplay, the soundtrack and for the great world building I would give this game a 6 sadly, because the story would not be able to carry this. However, this is truly a good game and if the developer can somehow survive the hell that is modern Russia (as if Russia was ever not a hellhole I suppose) I ll be looking forward to whatever they ll make next!",1681174244,1681174244,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

After all this and hearing everybody call each other comrade 1000 times I was pretty much sold :D.

On a more serious note, the game looks pretty good, and is technically sound - stable framerate, no stuttering or anything of the sort on decent level settings. The story is interesting (it would probably resonate more with people who have knowledge or experience with the eastern block during the soviet era). As many people have already mentioned, it has some strong Bioshock vibes due to the setting and the subject area.

3. Very laggy and huge FPS drops even tho i have a really good PC

Upd #1 : I start to get really tilted from some puzzles etc, super annoying to play because the whole gameplay starts to be like ""go get this, bring this, this door does not open, kill this"". Ugh... Mixed feelings. Like the vibe, dislike the gameplay and the story... Sad.


4 days later but i finished the game! Sooo... Do i recommend it? Meeh. Only for the aesthetic and sexy twins, sure. But the game is way too long, laggy and buggy. Not such interesting storyline, confusing where to go, stupid puzzles, boring gameplay and fighting aka ""oh this door is blocked. Need to find another way"" for the next 20 hours. Small variety of bosses too and my favorite was getting stuck in everything possible and need to restart from the last load every half hour.

My review in few words.

1. Aesthetic and the vibe
2. Music and bosses soundtracks
3. Twins

Character animations are super slick too. Each weapon feels very punchy with a sense of weight to them. I'm finding the bosses somewhat easy to defeat once you've upgraded the polymers and arsenal. They're tanky though and they feel more of a grind than anything. Quite a lot of bugs to begin with but it seems a lot have been ironed out. I had one game breaking bug stopping me from continuing with the main story and I had to park it for a few weeks until it got fixed. I'm not invested in the story much and I find the dialogue between P-3 and Charles can go on forever. Annoyingly, some of the conversations are at impromptu moments like when you're engrossed in combat and you couldn't give two figs about what they're banging on about. Bar some minor gripes, I'm really enjoying it. It's quite a unique game and I'm looking forward to Mundfish's next game. 8/10.

The combat is fun, although on the normal difficulty it was fairly easy. I only died a few times and most of those deaths were because homeboy wouldn't grab the damn ledge I was jumping towards. The story is interesting, although there's not much freedom. It's very linear aside from one section where it turns into a bit of an open world, where you can get into dungeons for upgrades for your weapons. The optimization and aesthetic is top notch.

The game is split in 3: story, puzzles, and combat. The story is good but not great and at times a bit confusing. Dialogue sometimes starts and cuts out at weird times. The puzzles get old really quickly and use some finicky mechanics. The combat is fun and well done, but gets repetitive. Overall a 6.5/10 for me. I'd say worth it when it's on sale.

Other than that, the atmosphere is absolutely incredible, the setting is straight out of a wet dream and the gameplay is fun! It sure has some minor bugs that I encountered so far, but nothing gamebreaking and they will probably be fixed soon.

Atomic Heart definitely has Fallout and Bioshock influences, but it stands out on its own EASILY. I'm currently ~10 hours in the game and I already want some T-shirt or merchandise with the little Pioneer kid from the Ability videos that kind of mirrors Vault Boy from Fallout, but in a setting that speaks to me way more.

I can't say much about the story since I haven't finished it yet (and I don't think I'm even close!) but I kiiiinda think I can guess what happened. I hope I'll be surprised 😅

I want to say that all throughout the game, I could see the inspiration they took from Bioshock in making this game. The environment, the weapons, the upgrades, the atmosphere, all of it.

The game feels incredible to play and it is honestly some of the best gun play I have ever experienced. 

The story keeps you on your toes right until the very end, and the constant questioning of how everything will end leaves you wanting more at every turn. 

The testing grounds are great fun, engaging puzzles that are very rewarding in giving you rare upgrades for your guns and melee weapons to really have an impact on your effectiveness in taking out enemies. Bosses feel tough especially later in the game. 

I cannot really fault this game, if you are a fan of FPS games with good storytelling, amazing combat, fun puzzles and an intriguing world, then get this game.

The game itself is gorgeous and the architecture designs are pretty amazing to look at. Everything else is a hot mess of problems, ranging from ""Why bother even doing this?"" to ""Did this even get playtested? Did they listen?"" For examples of the former, your glove has a Gravity Gun-style TK ability, but it has no real oomph to hurt enemies, it's only useful for distracting cameras and you can just shoot those to disable them, and there's no way to upgrade it like any of the other glove-abilities. For the latter, I cannot for the life of me understand the design decision to make enemies respawn infinitely in the overworld at such a rapid rate and that there is very little YOU can do about it. Plus, respawned enemies do not give out material/ammo drops after you kill them the first time, so all in all, sticking around is pointless and actively bad for you.

I understand that yes, this game had a lot of promise from the early trailers and gameplay vids we were getting. What we ended up with is a game desperately trying to be like Bioshock or Half-Life and failing to understand what made either of those games unique and engaging. This game turns into a chore to play, a slog, and isn't very rewarding on its story or characters either. The English localization is damn near godawful, giving us a main character that is so unlikable and foolhardy in his dialogue that he makes the guy from Bulletstorm look well-spoken and thoughtful. It's...not a total failiure.

It's just meh. Middle of the road. Graphically pleasing but very little else shines in this game. The gunplay sucks, the melee weapons are mostly a joke, the plasmid-like glove powers are all bland and have no real shine to them. Story's predictable and messy, localization is awful, and it all just feels like this is a knockoff of better games that have been around for longer for better reasons.

If you must, get this game on sale. DEEP sale. I wouldn't pay more than $20 now for this and you shouldn't either. I beat it, uninstalled it, and have been happier ever since. Play for the pretty stuff and if you're really sussed, go watch the Russian voices with English translations. It's far better...Not enough to save this game from bland, averageness, but it's very clear that it worked better and likely should have just stayed that way.

This feels as though it lacks polish, I think it was testing grounds 6 the last puzzle you can just ignore everything and phase through the wall.

the combat was okay but repetitive once you realise you only need a couple of ability's and weapons, seriously why are the rail gun and fatman so s##t? my load out was machete, pistol, shotgun and Electro. eventually swapped the machete to the Zvezdochka and good god that thing is strong. ability's after a bit of trial and error i settled on maxed zap, shield and frost and i barely used the frost one.

the enemies while where fun and odd enjoyed the battles even tho they didn't really pose much of a challenge, also on a quick note why no burav battle? 

the game was okay but that was about it, they terrain was god awful at times i got stuck on so much random crap.

From the moment you start playing, you are plunged into a world of intrigue and danger, where nothing is quite as it seems.

The story is masterfully crafted, with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The characters are well-developed, and their motivations are complex and compelling, making you care deeply about their fates.

Gameplay-wise, Atomic Heart delivers in spades. The controls are tight and responsive, and the game mechanics are intuitive and easy to learn. There is a great variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal, allowing you to approach each encounter in your own unique way.

What really sets Atomic Heart apart, however, is the level of depth present throughout the game. The world is incredibly rich and detailed, with a vast array of hidden secrets and Easter eggs to discover. Every location is unique and memorable, with its own distinct atmosphere and personality.

Overall, if you're looking for a game that will challenge you both mentally and physically, while also providing an incredibly satisfying narrative experience, then Atomic Heart is an absolute must-play.",1680982848,1680982848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The not so good: The melee feels a little hack and slash like skyrim, but overall is fine. The game also will omit to tell you things, or tell you how certain mechanics work. Some stuff it just makes you figure out, like how ammo cartridges work. 

The bad: Lacks the refinement you'd expect from a game that looks this good. Don't think you can just jump on random objects to get around something in the open world. You will get stuck and have to reload. 

Overall: Great game, and I haven't enjoyed an FPS this much in years. The first two hours are honestly meh but stick with it because it picks up from there. One thing that has to be said, the English is terrible. It makes the game unplayable honestly.

Though the protagonists dialogue isn't for everyone, I find it quite funny at times. The action is quite fun, and the weapons though limited are still fun and entertaining. The skills are quite interesting and the abilities the player can use have applications. There is a lot that can be done in the game and I'm interested in finishing the game. The enemies are not too tough but still provide a good challenge and the first boss I came across (the HOG 7 if I recall) took me a bit to figure out how to handle it properly.

The writing isn't the best but it is still passable and interesting, with the dialogue sometimes not being the best. But that is really my only complaint with the game so far, with everything else being quite enjoyable. Some of the human characters are interesting and the conflict seems interesting as well. 

To me my favorite part is the atmosphere of and the environment with it being science fiction and soviet. A lot of little details were crammed in there and it really adds to the aesthetic of the world. The worldbuilding, though not perfect, is still good. 

 After completing the game three times I can say that this game is a solid 9/10. Though a lot of issues, the game play, mechanics, story, and more, the game is quite enjoyable and the music sells it.

Driving a vehicle feels bad, the melee combat doesn't feel good/clunky, and the mantling system sucks at times. Some bugs completely kill this game for me and make me not recommend it.    !!!!SOME SPOILERS IN THIS BIT!!!!    First off full screen mode gets bugged sometimes when you use the upgrade robot fridge no big deal since you can press esc and get out of this one but with the computers (forgot name of what they called them) you cant. You have to move your mouse to the escape button and click on it rather than pressing esc on your keyboard and since it bugged you cant move your mouse down far enough to click it, its annoying (playing on windowed full screen fixes this problem). There is a puzzle called red arrow and it is bugged on m@k where no inputs on your keyboard or mouse work to be able move the red worm to eat the blue diamond multiple times to solve the puzzle, which sucks. I had to plug in a controller to get past this part and its the main story so you cant skip it. (!!!SPOILER OVER!!!!) The last thing i hate about this game is getting stuck in geo around the map and not being able to get out so i have to start over and lose my progress its annoying  as hell, its happened to me a few times already and it just makes me want to stop playing the game when it happens.

The game is a huge mix of different mechanics so diverse, that it ends up being it's own thing, but we have to admit that it's biggest influence is Bioshock, that is evident, but it is not a bad thing, at all.

As a game is solid, fun to play, fast and of course, fun. The enemies and the weapons are on point, the loot mechanic is fun, the weapon upgrade mechanic is really interesting and vast, it reminds you of games like Dead Island, and the energy mechanic is fun in it's implementation. The music is... Oh my dog... Perfect. The Heavy-Metal covers of old Russian Pop Songs are sublime, and the original tracks created by Mick Gordon are, well, created by Mick Gordon, there's not much else to say there.

For the 'not that good', well, the open world doesn't really fits in and feels weird, and the story is really not that good, I don't have nothing bad to say about the VA's or the lines, in fact I find them funny, not 'Portal 2' level of funny, but funny enough. My biggest gripe is the ending tho, I think it happens too fast and too out of nowhere, and it feels inconsistent, or out of place, considering all the story that leads up to it.

Overall, it's a good game. Leaving any kind of politics aside, I do recommend you buy and play this game, specially if you like games like Bioshock or even Dead Island/Dying Light.",1680871874,1680871874,True,2,0,0.543592751026153564,0,True,False,False

So far, four hours in, I'm still hooked. Though this game should have more love to the PC version. I think it could push the graphics further. I think I've experienced a lot of tiny bugs so far that should not have made it through any kind of QC testing. I had only one bug that prevented progress and I had to load a save. Probably lost 30 mins of gameplay. I learned to make sure to find the manual save rooms more often.

Gunplay is thoroughly underwhelming. You move like molasses and the majority of the enemy types (of which there are very few) are melee based for some reason.

Way too many """"puzzles"""" that are trivial to solve and just further slow the already slow pacing. There's also a handful of truly awful platforming and climbing sections that do the same.

The story is simultaneously too complicated and dead boring. Your AI companion will talk your ear off about the complex political drama supposedly happening off screen but all it ever boils down to is ""we need to go here, but oh no its locked, better find the key"". This is virtually the only thing you ever do as a character, just open locks via increasingly contrived methods.

Speaking of characters, they are all pretty annoying and unlikable, most of all the protagonist, whose three biggest defining traits are being rude, dismissive, and foul-mouthed. He's a massive dickhead to basically everyone from the second he meets them for no discernible reason.

To top it all off, there's a severe lack of polish, including progression blocking bugs, which was where I finally threw in the towel and gave up with this mess of a game.

Since i didn't enter the game with very high expectations, i can say that i was pleasantly astonished!

Things in the game that i love:

*Music.
*Enviroment.
*Superb graphics.
*Slick combat, with the dodge mechanic and weapon/ability upgrade system.
*Story is great actually. There's lots of lore around the world that let's you keep up. And if you actually stop whatever you're doing at the moment and listen to the character/glove/npc conversations, it's really good.
*Some plot-twists in the story that i didn't see coming, which i like.

I played for a few hours on the xbox game pass, then i bought it on steam, and beat the game in 12 hours. I mainly rushed the story, so there is lots of puzzles ""dungeons"" left for me to explore and collect. I would say you could easily get 20 hours of gametime here, if you are a completionist. 


**I can highly recommend this game** to anyone that is looking for that ""open world"" ""Shooter"" ""puzzle"" game out there. 
It's a nice playthrough once atleast. You can also just get back into the game after completion and do all the things you missed or skipped.

The worldbuilding seems very promising, and ""fresh"", however it's only ever an inch deep. The character speaks American English, but sometimes tries to (badly) pronounce Russian words. He is arrogant, but not in that cool-guy way that some writers can pull off. He's just annoying. So is the glove.

The facilities are repetitive. The puzzles countless, and vapid (press your mouse button in time with the rhythms, find the 3 keys, etc.)

The combat is ... clunky. The robot enemies knock you down easily, and often. Your swings are slow, clunky, and barely seem to do any damage. It's all just extremely unsatisfying.

The environment seems overwhelmingly detailed (in a good way), but soon starts to look repetitive. The pathing is linear, and the jumping mechanics incredibly clunky and frustrating. The very first time I encountered a jumping puzzle, I thought I was doing it wrong, because I kept missing the final jump. Turns out, I had to be looking UP, otherwise the character would not clear the ledge. Sure, ok.

All in all, the game is more frustrating than entertaining.

Common Complaints
-I didn't find the dialogue annoying. I found it fun, but I can see why some might not enjoy it. Think 2000s games with more chatty main characters. Duke Nukem could be somewhat apt as a comparison. I didn't find it too cheesy, and it wasn't political cringe at all. 

-Enemies respawn: This is only in the first outdoor area, and you are meant to run through it somewhat. It really isn't a bother. Indoors when it rarely comes up, you can zap the repair drone spawn tub to stop it. 

-Story: Story was enjoyable and interesting. I didn't find it clique or obvious. It sets up a great world and I enjoyed playing it to unfold. It is linear, so don't expect to explore a random area and experience the story of the world.

-Fetch Quests: I didn't see much of an issue. You need to get pieces and you travel different parts of a complex to get them. Yeah you're fetching, but it isn't having you going back and forth.

Environment
-The world is beautiful and pretty well thought out in looks and world building. You are Sovie Agent P3 in a alternate timeline where technology is more advanced. WW2 ended with a massive plague spread by Germany.

  You are located in a high-tech Soviet Research base that expand throughout the mountainous valley it is located in; the base leads the world in robotics and other advanced technological development. The Robots go mad and start killing people, and your job is to solve it. 

Combat
- The combat is smooth and enjoyable. Your damage on enemies is shown and felt in melee and gunfire, an there are 12 weapons to craft, multiple skills (with the ability to use up to three), and an elegant dodge mechanic that fit right into it the game. The game is somewhat of an immersive sim; combat is similar but a bit better than the Bioshock series. It is similar to Prey. I would appreciate more depth and ways to play in any sequel. There is no real stealth in the game

Quest/Story
-The story is linear, but there are items to discover and collect that reveal more story. There are no side quests in the game. There are some dialogue options to learn more, but they do not have any consequence to your story or character. I really enjoyed the story and world! 

Puzzles:
-Tons of decent puzzles in the game that I enjoyed. More games need them! Nothing complex or grand, but i enjoyed it.

8ish/10 (7 is avg good game) It is a definite buy for me! I loved games like Dishonored, Bioshock, Prey, and Deus Ex, so having something similar hit the spot. It caught me and had me playing it for many hours at a time to bear it.

This modern Video Game contains a superbly splendid story (if you'll mind my alliteration). I was rather enjoyed upon receiving the ending of the game, you see I chose to fight Sechenov. Now, without spoiling the story to the best of my ability I will wholeheartedly say that it was a very surprising plot twist of which came directly another plot twist that was second to yet another plot twist. This game reminds me of the Metro series not only because of it's Russian setting but the immaculate story telling through uses that require one to be attent at practically all times if he or she wishes to understand the story being presented. I for one wished to learn more about the story and try my absolute best to not skip over too many details. This goal was ever-so-harder to complete considering that I decided to start off my Atomic Heart journey on the hardest difficulty. Despite having a more challenging approach to the game than many others I was able to appreciate the combat system put into play by the developers. I must say though, this game depends on you looting very often to upgrade your gear and once you have found a good melee weapon, that might as well be ""Game Over"".  So, without bending your ear anymore than I have already (If you have read so far into this review) I will summarize my experience very quickly.

Story: Amazing
Gameplay (combat): smooth - melee focus but guns are an option
Gameplay (standard): The very few times that cars are presented, they are not the greatest option as the 
                 catch on fire very often and are hard for someone like me to drive. You need to collect as many 
                 resources as possible early-game so you'll be ""overpowered"" as some say very quickly. Also the 
                 ""dismantle"" options at the NORA stations are underrated and very helpful.
Voice Acting: Not the best, though it was translated from Russian and translations are often sloppy or hard to 
                 understand considering a large culture gap. But overall, I found the characters to be rather unique, 
                 especially the main character despite his constant swearing or hard-to-take-seriously remarks. 
Setting: Immaculate, Spectacular, undoubtedly amazing. Such a sci-fi world seems to put myself in Awe. The 
                 futuristic world with senses of our world (during the 50s) is so very refreshing. I am an American 
                 who takes pride in such a fact and the idea of the Soviets winning the 2nd world war, astonishing. 
                 Though I for one do not find Communism appealing, the focus of the game was far from Political. 

Overall, I would give this game a 10/10 and I hope that you, the very reader, did or will too.",1680674788,1680674788,True,3,0,0.540086150169372559,0,True,False,False

Enemies and enviroments all feel rather fun and have a unique flair that i'd hoped this game would channel when i first heard about it years and years ago. Its not what i imagined it was going to be and i'm glad for it.

gameplay is pretty fun for the most part. Combat and shooting feels responsive and well made. Enemies have a variety of attack patterns and telegraph most of their attacks so you can utilize the game's dodge function easily enough to get out of most situations. The addition of plasmi- i mean polymers for your glove give you a few tools to mix up combats and deal with threats in more ways than just using your gun or cudgel.

Platforming is a different beast. it feels clunky and usually a pain but only when you have to climb things or grab ledges all the hitboxes for it feel off. pro tip: you can use your dash in mid air. the game doesn't tell you this till you're quite a ways in.

I've found a variety of puzzles and most of them are very entertaining. numerous minigames for lockpicking, hacking and restoring power keep you on your toes and most of them are pretty fun to boot. Though i found the restore power puzzle overly difficult as i have minor colorblind issues and i can only imagine someone worse off would struggle for the others as almost all of them involve color matching of some sort.

The story has been a interesting one but i don't wish to go into detail without spoiling. You get some hints early on however about what you might be dealing with down the line. i can say however that your character (and his fashionware) are chatty...a little TOO chatty sometimes at least early on. I usually like voiced protagonists in games as they give a level of personality but the exchanges these 2 have are a little excessive sometimes, made worse by occasionally overridding each others conversation because you took a step too close to the next trigger.
A minor issue that fortunately doesn't really affect gameplay

Will definitely be back for more once the story DLC drops!! 
Pros: 
- Story, atmosphere, lore
- Voice Acting. P3 is an insufferable jock in the beginning BUT this is explained and he also mellows out later
- Telekinesis never gets old 
- Some of the puzzles are dope 
- Enemy design and BOSS fights
- Mick Gordon's epic music 

Cons
- Guns lack some punch, same for melee weapons 
- Mick Gordon's music only comes on during set pieces and boss fights. Only mentioning this as a con since IMO the music mixing is a bit weird when you transition and and out of combat
- The open world gets pretty blah, there's nothing to do apart from the optional dungeons and the story missions (which are generally indoors / underground)

All in All I highly recommend the game just to enjoy this weird weird ride. You can definitely tell the devs put in a lot of love and effort into the game!!

April '23. bug-ridden garbage. constantly stuck in game geometry reloading old saves, falling through maps into the white void etc. played 2 hrs with minimal bugs. by the third hour i had to reload 12 saves trying to explore chests across different areas. can't even get a steam refund for this piece of trash and no, i wont give it another shot.

Story is lack luster throwing the whole caboodle at u right at the end. not very flesh out with a very and abrupt and unsatisfactory ending. It just did feel very compelling. puzzles are tedious and lot of annoying parts especially at the beginning where the developers recognize the annoyance of doing the canister things. combat is kinda cool but gets a little bit stale when you unlock every thing since the skill tree isn't very fleshed out there for not allowing for much replay ability. All it does is slightly tweak numbers or its effect. the enemies are not very diverse  kinda like Hogwarts with a few enemys that are just kinda resistant to things or are weaker. THE MOVEMENT IS AN ABSOLUTE SLOGGG. Some bosses are so annoying to fight because it is a repeat of shoot once and waddle away at a jogging pace because if u dont there is no real way to gain distance because there is no real way of getting way from them with one boss that is repeated many times it is very apparent. Not supper hard just kinda boring and as mentioned before a slogg. Better hope u enjoy the cool looting animation because u gotta get used to it because there are a ton of different materials and if u dont know exactly what u are going to upgrade it gets very expensive. The premise is cool although the story botches it. Cars are practically useless dew to the fact that a tiny tickle will send them ablaze. overall i dont really hate my decision to buy it since I was kinda bored but was it worth $60s No. would of prefered to buy belle delphines OF with that kind of price point but if u are bored and see it on a %50 percent sale or something sure buy it but otherwise I dont really recommend this title.,1680644321,1680644321,False,6,1,0.51353830099105835,0,True,False,False

However... I feel like everyone did there jobs 'right' and yet the game failed because the Director, or whoever was in charge of putting it all together sucked and ruined the whole game. 

1. Voice acting. Way too intense for what the guy is doing. Not everything has to be FUCK this and HOLY SHIT that. You don't need the guy to be so intense with every sentence.
2. Sound. Can't hear recordings and TV news over music that is way to intense where it shouldn't be. I'm getting mission dialog and I can't hear it over battle music... there are no enemies around. Battle music seems to turn on at random. 

3. Weapon selection, weapon wheel, equipping weapon add-ons. Weapon selection doesn't loop back to the first weapon when selecting next. It stops at the lat one. Adding an environmental canister to a weapon was so unclear, I was wondering 'when will I get a chance to use them""... turns out, any time. I had to look up how to do it and when I searched, EVERYONE has this problem. Number one thing googled for that game. 

4. Check points are practically none existent. You have to save at save stations. If you die, that's where you start again. No check points in between. There is a limit of how many times you are willing to do the same part over and over... and you do that because...

5. Game play SUCKS! Everything about it sucks. Shooting mechanics are bad. You get hit because things shoot and jump at you from WAY further then anyone would think. Things jump and attack you, you get hit, you get turned around. I spend most of the game going ""where am I getting hit from?"" ... there are robots that roll in bushes. You can't see them. I can't walk through some of the bushes. They stop me from moving, 
it feels like you are stuck. Yet the robot will shoot you and kill you from behind them and you can't see it.
I walk through a gate, I finely did it. I kill 'em all... now I have to be quick, they respond fast. I walk through the gate, get mowed down by 2 machine guns behind a car, behind 2 bushes. Can't see them. Now you have to go back and do the WHOLE section over again... and over... and... we're done here. 

How did Bioshok do it right? How did Fallout 4 do it right? How did this game do everything wrong? 
I really wanted to like the game. I wanted to explore the world, get into it. But nope... I will never buy any game from this company again. I'll look up the people who made the game and make sure I will never buy a game they were part of, ever. 

In fact, if I ever meet anyone who made this game, I'll Honeymooners them. Beng, zoom... To the MOON!

hell, i've been in the game for about 30-ish minutes, and the game installed the shaders for about 5 of them.
ok fine so far, that needs to be done.

then i'm on a rowboat rowboating or propellering down a stream, with some conservation going on.
ah i see the end of the stream/canal, ok now i have control over the character i'm playing, and can do stuff and explore shit.
WRONG!
It takes a right turn, i follow some other dude in a propellorboat and then i can lave! ok now i can explore?
WRONG!
I can follow a predesigned path and get more exposition.
there is also a parade and all that shiny stuff that soviets love.
eternal flame? ok,. let' me try to climb that pedestal there.
NOPE!
invisible wall
can i go there?
NOPE!
invisible wall

ok, i play along an follow that route to a lab, where i get 5 more minutes of exposition, that i don't want, need or ask for.
can i now play the game?
NOPE!
i have to follow another path into a big house, city hall or something. ok looks impressive - if it was real and i would've been there.
up an elevator - my moving space is about 2 x 2 meters, and i get to hear 90 seconds of exposition.
now i'm on top  and there is the first highlight
it's the robot twings.
Damn those are some eyecandy <3
but what's that?
i have the key i'm send to get here and... i have to attend the 90 second elevator ride back down.
till now i'm about 16 minutes in game, and have had no freedom or game at all, just exposition in form of dialouge and some cutscenes.
back down i'm shoved into a car
nice! now i can drive, so Cyberpunk or GTA style right?
WRONG!
i get a tour with some helicopter - flying pig - bot, and it swrils me arround all those fancy sights.
for another 10 minutes...
I'm off to get me a snack in the kitchen by now, since i'm bored by this game... 
back at my seat i see that some bot is attacking my car - flying pig robot whatever, and i crash in a lab.
ok ok ok now it gets exciting.
WRONG!
i get shoved into another exposition dump, and another cutscene, and get shoved into an elevator when the first bots went rogue.
ok but now i can finally do some pew pew and chop and kung fu moves?
NOPE!
i can see a cutscene where that elevator falls down, and i black out.
i get my vision back and now i can move?
WRONG!
i can get another cutscene where the camera pans arround the character i'm suposed to play.. i get first person view again
now i can play my character?
NOPE!
I can get another cutscene where i go to a metal bar or something.
didn't care 
I'm 31 minutes in the game by now, and that's when i hit ALT +F4 and got a refund on this game.

Maybe the intro was over by that point, maybe not, i don't know, i don't care, i don't give a shit anymore.

I rather go back to play sea of thieves or factorio by this point and watch some stargate atlantis, SG-1 or whatever show was on TV a few years back.

Really anticipated more of this game, after hearing all that praise i've seen online and in youtube vid recommendations
But i want to play it, not see some cutscenes.
when i'm not controlling the character that i'm supposed to play, i'm watching a movie (that's a fact dear gamedevs or better movie directors...)

Weapons look and feel fantastic, bordering Call of duty levels of gunplay. Everything you would expect from Bioshock is mostly here, like looting for upgrade materials, powering up powers, identifying weaknesses to optimize damage, the only thing missing is a big daddy-like robot wandering around the open world. Music is really damn good, which doesn't surprise me considering they got Mick Gordon to compose the music.

But with each positive comes a negative, although to be clear the negatives don't outweigh the positives in any way, but maybe a sequel can clean them up.

Remember when i said Bioshock made by horny devs? Im not exaggerating when i say that, the twin robots are obvisouly the biggest (and best) example, but you get sexually assaulted by a vending machine, the robots dry hump each other, and you'll find several areas FILLED with mannequins placed in every conceivable sex position. A pro or a con depending on who you are, but we all agree them twins are STACKED.
The game is very confused on what it wants to be for the first 4-5 hours. It starts as a linear survival game, enemies hit like trucks and your ammo and weapons are limited. Then it wants to be a slightly bigger exploration game, focusing on exploring a large area and finding materials and upgrade schematics. THEN it goes full blown open world, with new mechanics that don't really work or are VERY lack luster, like driving and the threat level mechanic. If the game started and ended with a clear vision, it would have benefited the end product DRAMATICALLY.
Gunplay as mentioned is solid, shooting robots and people are satisfying regardless of weapon choice. The issue is, the enemy variety never promotes anything other than shooting, even when enemies are resistant to bullets, you get SO MUCH AMMO that even with a 90% damage reduction to bullets, i still managed to kill them with half my total ammo left. Certain upgrade trees benefit more towards flesh enemies or metal ones, but every enemy can be demolished with a shotgun to the face, regardless of damage focus. The powers in particular are either useless or broken, and its not like Plasmids where you can have several, you only get 3 unlockable ones and one mandatory power. Again, a shotgun solves most problems.
Last but not least, YOU HAVE MICK FUCKING GORDON! USE HIM! I swear to god, i forgot he was even a composer until i heard a random BANGER song come out of nowhere. Not for a boss, but for a random section in the game. Could be bugged for me, but i would have really liked more Comrade Gordon.

Atomic Heart is a fantastic game with some flaws, but all in all, its a great Bioshock-like that hopefully a sequel can make even better. $60 is 100% earned, on sale is a massive steal.

However, to my surprise I encountered minimal bugs and glitches, minus not being able to shimmy across two ledges connected together. It was a really well put together game, and it was beautiful, from the environment to the enemies and the other humans (Before they died). 

The Story itself was captivating, but annoying at times because combat or other things might interrupt what CHAR-LES might be saying or someone else filling you in on the plot. It would've been nice if I could craft/upgrade while still having CHAR-LES speak. However the end kinda left me feeling a bit empty, like something was missing, even after doing both endings. But I think that's the entire point of the ending, [spoiler] no matter what choice you make you still lose in the end, you can either let P-3 go off the grid and deal with his trauma while Sechanov takes over mankind. Or you can stop Sechanov and do what you though was right, just to be betrayed by CHAR-LES in the end to ""evolve mankind further"" as he takes over the data control and walks away.[/spoiler] 

The combat was pretty fun in my opinion, the guns felt nice and the option to put cartridges on all the weapons (except the fat boy and rail gun) was a great idea to spice it up. Scavenging left you with plenty of materials and ammo to get from your storage and craft more.

In inventory when moving items the storage scrolls back up, annoying.

Why is there a loading when trying to upgrade my glove? I know it's a couple of seconds, still annoying. 
Why make a game when recycle items I should hold the button? Just make it one click that's it.
I've tested both endings, it was disappointing. 

Gameplay wise, I enjoy using my weapons, did not get all the parts though, the bosses are easy when you have a rocket launcher. Sometimes you need 24 rockets for 2 bosses in some areas.

Is this the long-awaited worthy successor to Bioshock? Nope. The story's predictable, the characters are unremarkable, the combat feels very floaty and unsatisfying, the achievement tracking is buggy (seems better after the last patch), everything after the early game is too easy (even on Hardcore mode), the AI can occasionally be brain dead, the world is barely interactable and some of the characters have absolutely horrible designs (P-3 and Filatova would look more at home in a shitty hipster bar than the Soviet Union in the 50s).

Is this the worst game of all time and literally makes you a Russian war criminal? Nope. The world is beautiful, the performance is fantastic, the music is stellar (especially the remixed Soviet songs), the robots are super cool (some even dare I say...hot?), the Soviet aesthetic is striking, the powers are interesting and the overall pace of the game is pretty good with a solid mix of combat, exploration and puzzles. Concerning the controversy surrounding this game, I don't believe that Russian artists should be punished for the actions of their state, something in which they literally have no say, and I don't find boycotting games to be a meaningful way of combating state terrorism (the Russian government has their fingers in EVERYTHING over there anyway so the devs are operating out of Cyprus). Some of the haters and the things they say make me wonder if they'd walk out of a room if they found out someone there was *gasp* Russian. Seems kinda harsh to me at that point. All in all, the game's alright. It's not groundbreaking, it's not bad, it's a decent enough time for people who enjoy sci-fi or FPS games.",1679804885,1680497980,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I know a lot of people have issues with the subject matter and comparisons to bioshock, but that's really missing the whole point. Some people have an issue with the robot's hairstyle. If you're one of these people, I can't help you. I'm not sure anyone can.

Coming back to the game, I really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I got to experience this. However, if you're not either from the former soviet union or for some reason have a great interest in soviet history, I'm not sure you'll appreciate it the same way. There are A LOT of cultural references, and if you didn't grow up with at least communist parents, I'm not sure you'd ""get it.""

And that's important because as much as I enjoyed playing this game, the gameplay per se is not stellar. The enemies are dumb, even for robots. The infinitely respawning enemies can be annoying (though useful for resource farming). The stealth mechanics are nonexistant, but the game throws in a backstab function anyway. The parkour is messy at times (but still rewarding to figure out). The portal-like puzzle sections are all kind of the same.

The combat, when it gets down and dirty, is a lot of fun. The chaos, elemental weaknesses, different weapon types, upgrades--it all works well together. The audio work is fantastic. The map and enemies/graphics are flawless. The story? Do you really care? If you do, then actually the story is pretty good. 

The controls are a bit strange--but once I got used to it it was fine. 

Coming back to the bioshock comparison--this isn't bioshock. Rather the game it reminds me the most of is Prey (from Arkane, the studio that made Dishonored). There are a lot of similarities, if you've played that before you'll see them. But ultimately, Prey was the better game.

Still, there is nothing out there that shows this subject matter in this way, so if you're interested in soviet cold-war-punk and committing mass murder against droids/zombies while rocking out to soviet hardcore remixes, this is your best bet.",1680479551,1680479670,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

Weapons feel weighty and it feels like you've actually made an impact when you strike an enemy. Story bounced back and forth between 6 and 8 depending on the area. I will say that yes, the protagonist says some extremely cringy and wild shit sometimes, but somehow his personality literally has a narrative explanation but it isn't directly explained in the main story and is only picked up in terminals and recording. Performance of the game is absolutely outstanding. Better than any major release I've played in years. I've never considered my build to be an absolute monster of a game station but I can run this game at max (Atomic) settings 1440p and consistently see 95+FPS throughout the entire world with no DLSS turned on.

I wanted to like it but at a 60 euro price tag, get something else. This game is clearly inspired by bioshock but does everything worse besides graphical fidelity, but even the art style is worse. The comic-esque dialogue doesn't fit the tone and the main protagonist never shuts up. Also they gives enemies a ton of health and you need to reload all the time. Combat is too much waiting around.

I kind of ran through the game faster than what I wanted, simply because some elements of the over-world were very annoying (perma respawning repair drones, unclear indications on where to find the underground sites, god awful driving and the car made of paper). 

The artistic direction is top-tier, and the lore is pretty neat. The main character can be very grating with his constant silly talk but it did grow on me (that and it felt like the writing improved as the game progressed). I recommend taking the narrative not too seriously and you will have a better time.

The game took a very doom-like stance on combat but sadly the character is nowhere near fast enough for that to work well. Some perks allow you to improve mobility which is mandatory imo. Abusing your powers is critical in higher difficulties. If you struggle even in normal difficulty, it might not be you but rather the game itself being balanced poorly so feel free to lower it to easy.

The game looks and sounds genuinely very good. It runs well, the OST is rock-solid and some visuals are stunning.

It was totally absurd, the main character and the ai glove on his hand would get out of character, it was good.

After that it wasn't good.  I finished it because I didn't want to let this game beat me.  The main character is annoying.  The combat was too difficult on hard at the beginning then too simple when you upgraded your guns.  You hear the word ""polymer"" once per sentence.

The story is a take on the Singularity, will the Soviet Communist Singularity be good or should it be stopped?  The writers gave you everything you need to figure out what's really going with subtle foreshadowing that is always with you from the beginning.  It's intuitively easy to figure this out inbetween the characters constantly reviewing how their utopian soviet society works, blackouts, misdirection, cryptic dialog, innumerable audio & text logs, and side characters who's actions are guided by being mad or uninformed.  (The dissonance of having the utopia narrative [i]constantly[/i] explained to you by placid robot voices while seeing unethical medical experiments and dead mutilated human corpses strung up everywhere made up for some of that.)

The delivery of the narrative is very high concept and it doesn't deliver.  Maybe the devs were distracted by making [i]artistic stuff[/i] happen.  Nine foot tall chrome and brass robot ladies perform an intense ballet ritual where they shake and shudder with the effort of penetrating each other's mercury filled insides to extract keys(?) which release a pulsating humanoid goo entity that subsumes a human corpse to upload it's dead mind into some form of cybernetic afterlife.  There's also a very long [strike]melodramatic[/strike] [i]artistic[/i] sequence where you're chasing an antagonist through a theatre full of locked doors and you get to listen to the antagonist use the PA system to announce how nobody appreciated them and that you suck.

The narrative really falls apart at the end. [spoiler] There's a deus ex machina when the main character finds out he's an unreliable narrator but he doesn't know [i]how unreliable[/i] he is.  You can't know what events were actually hallucinations or what's subtle foreshadowing anymore.  All the text logs you've been reading could be totally fake, who knows!  The polymer has so much unknown potential that anything could have happened!  Which leaves you with no clues before the story comes crashing to a halt.  And the real end to the story, the real lesson to take from it is not great.  You learn that half the conflict you witnessed was done by the misinformed/mad and the other half was misdirection, so you should have stood by the enigmatic genius who's going to uplift everyone instead of enslaving them, but enslaving everyone is still possible under his system.[/spoiler]

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1680358899,1680358899,True,5,0,0.498257815837860107,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Good optimization even on lower end systems like mine
- Kick-ass amazing soundtrack
- Amazing looking world and incredible consistency in art direction and sound design
- Fluid combat and movement
- Simple - yet impactful choices in weapon and skill customization
- Very interesting story premise

Cons: 
- Aside from cool visuals, crafting materials and some very rare lore tid-bids, the open world is desolate.
Optional side content is just as flat. Doing those puzzle facilities and unlocking weapon upgrades is fun and i love the concept of Lootyagins, but lore wise those side quests are pretty much empty aside from a few throw-away lines that give a superficial explanation of what went on there.
- Bugs, lots of them: 
- Constantly being hardstuck in the geometry, being forced to reload the last save
- Enemy AI glitching out on a regular basis, INCLUDING MAIN STORY BOSSES
- Towards the end of the game i ran into a bug that prevented me from receiving a certain recource through any means (both looting and from dismantling weapons) which forced me into my current setup, unable to test out any of the new upgrades i unlocked.
- Dialogue seems to be hardlocked to reaching location checkpoints, and those checkpoints are sometimes located way too close to each other, which meant one dialogue was cut off and another started which made me feel forced to just stand still and wait for it to end before advancing because i didn't want to miss anything.
- Dialogue overlaps even in non gameplay cutscenes which happaned to me in the final cutscene of the game. Yikes.
- Collectables like Chirpers sometimes bug out and simply cannot be interacted with
- While the weapon choices you get are cool and interesting, the pace at which you aquire them seems completely out of whack. I did a completionist playthrough, looting every chest i found and received the blueprint for the rocket launcher before even taking the train to the main open world area, making every boss trivial. On the other hand, i dismantled my shotgun early on to test some builds and somehow have missed the blueprint, which left the weapon locked for the entirety of my playthrough. Why is this a thing?
- While the overall writing is great in many places, the main character is completely unlikable. Boneheaded, with the Intellect of a 12 year old and constantly being a complete jerk towards almost all characters you come across for no apparent reason and no matter the context. Rambo / Terminator style characters can be likable and well written, this one was not.

When the game fires on all cylinders and you slash through hordes of robots in tandem with the amazing soundtrack, or you explore the amazingly crafted locations, looking at all the dystopian science weirdness and retro-futuristic grandiose soviet design the game is fantastic, but ultimately too flat.
And while i felt satisfied with the game on a technical standpoint mostly, i felt like it had so much more potential when it comes to building the world and telling stories of locations and characters.

If you can deal with the bugs, even without exploring most side content the main story offers around 15 hours of solid entertainment that's almost AAA level and despite it's shortcomings the game gets my respect considering it was made by a relatively small and unknown development studio.

For anyone wandering:

""Crispy Critters"" is *kinda* like the Russian version of ""Ay caramba""

It's a nonsense phrase chosen as an English language replacement for a Russian nonsense phrase which loosely translates to ""fucking pies!"" The point is that it doesn't mean anything. The cultural difference is that in Russian, there is a traditional of nonsensical profanity. Basically memetic phrases.

A critter is a creature.

Crispy means it's fried.

So visualized a fried gerbil or something.

It can also be compared to the largely nonsensical catch phrases and movie quotes of  90s video game characters.

On a different matter, what the hell is with the intro? Devs, I want to play the darn game, was a 40 minute long, do-nothing, introduction / tutorial, really necessary? It even includes great action sequences, too bad I cannot PLAY them! It's not like I bought a game or anything.

Unique atmosphere and setting the likes of which you may not have seen
(provided you got the hardware) Amazing graphics with fantastic animations, The agricultural death orb was absolutely beautiful when you weren't getting crushed by it. 
Amazing sound track (I found my self purposefully triggering enemies in some areas to listen to ""summer"" remix used for battle music)
Simple yet engaging story which mended really well with gameplay and objectives (many good vibes from games like Prey and Bioshock yet refreshingly different)
What some may call a rogue-like combat system (maybe im just a bitch, but some bosses and areas were genuinely challenging especially when low on supplies)
CONS: 
I do wish there was more story driven side content (there is alot of great side content such as the polygons) but they are more like a dungeon you loot for upgrades. Each one with unique combination of puzzles and very fun and rewarding to make your way through. But not a lot of it does much for the story/lore of it all. Basically would have been cool to deal with more characters, see more cutscenes and develop the story more outside of the main objectives.

Did run into occasional spots where I got stuck on the environment, nothing major. Last few years of releases have seriously lowered my expectations in terms of day 1 quality. So overall state of the game should actually be a PRO if we are comparing it with alot of other AAA releases ;DDD.
Had a crash that kept triggering in a specific area of game, but im leaning towards it being a weird amd 7000 series gpu driver issue.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, if you like single player action rpg games, like Prey. Highly recommend.

668580,135840770,76561198318712615,0,8,1802,0,1802,1680307815,"In Atomic Heart, you play a Soviet soldier in an alternate-universe 1950s Russia.  Russia won WWII and has developed special technologies that allow for instant learning and 'psychic' manipulation of the environment.  When the robots go haywire and start attacking the humans, you must take orders from your boss and track down the one who is responsible for causing the disruption.
Atmosphere:  B - The visuals are really well-rendered except in certain spots (like the cliff near the lighthouse) where flashing causes graphics to shake and change brightness.  The environments are really well-rendered and contribute to the feel of the period.  Details are fine and many (but not all) of the objects are interactable.  
Gameplay:  C - This is a FPS and runs smooth for the most part.  But you can tell the playtesting was rushed as there are bugs throughout the game.  There are spots where you get stuck and can't get out, forcing a reload (like on the edges of roads, in between some objects, or near edges of drop-offs).  There are also objects like trunks and bodies that you should be able to interact with since they light up on your interface but there's no command offered to interact with them (most of the ones I saw like that were in the theater).  Sometimes combat was a bit jerky, and certain weapons (like the railgun) can actually be annoying to carry in front of you since the size of the gun blocks some of your vision as you're creeping along.  Dialogues are decent, and some come with options.  There are puzzles scattered throughout the game, some mandatory and some optional - the various locks were especially fun to figure out.  
Replayability:  A - Between the various upgrades offered, the level layouts, and (towards the end) dialogue options it's pretty fun to play the game multiple ways despite its linearity.  Not many linear games have high replay value but Atomic Heart makes it work.
Storyline:  A - Without giving too much away there are a few twists and the lore here comes together nicely.  It ties in well with what an alternate history could look like, and the progression keeps you wanting to learn more about what is going on.  
Overall:  B - Atomic Heart is worth playing for anyone who likes FPS with some mental puzzles thrown in here and there.  The difficulty levels make it playable for anyone, both the casual/explore-everything gamer to the hardcore combat power player.  It is hampered by some bugs and lack of tightness with some of the controls, therefore it's likely you may get frustrated at parts so do take every opportunity to save in case you need to reload.",1680309396,1680309396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Random boxes on the ground or a corner of a wall might cause you to be stuck in place if you touch it. Some lootable cases will not give you the icon to loot them even though your scanner shows them to you. Same goes for some bodies. Another gripe is that in the cut scenes, faces and expressions will not always match the way someone is speaking. Someone could be shouting but their face if perfectly neutral. Overall nothing game breaking. Now to the controversy. If there Russian propaganda in Atomic Heart? Yes. It is there and it is not hard to find. If you are a Russian speaker like myself, you will notice it much easier. There are certain audio logs in the game that are only in Russian and not subtitled. These hold quite a bit.

Captivating environment , cool story just destroyed by annoying gameplay . 
Character is slow , you never have enough weapons to shoot anything , you run out of bullets / rounds /energy after couple of enemies (and yes , I can land my headshots) .
You start with axe and you MUST use this axe all the time .

And (without spoiling anything) the ending only exists to make people buy the DLC. This is a incredibly shady to present this in current trailers with out disclaimers, as it is misleading.

things i don't like:
the open world kills the vibe. Traveling point to point breaks the momentum of game play.
I quickly got tired of the enemies. Every boss variant was a lot of fun to fight against but the common enemy's became more annoying than fun to fight. If the enemy's had more attack variants like the bosses, instead of being bum rushed by 30 of the same enemy; it would have been much more engaging. First and third boss could have been a great inclusions for overworld enemies you could discover much more rarely, but are absent after their death. In previous trailers, It looked as though organic and machine enemies could interact with one another, but are shown to either never be placed in the same vicinity to each other, or don’t care to interact when they are. Some enemies depicted in the trailers aren’t even enemies and are just plot and decoration; the ‘clown traps’ only appear for one segment and disappear, ‘daisy’ never makes an appearance beyond the intro of the game ,’burav’ is seen to appear as an upcoming boss or enemy but disappears after a confusing plot point. Many of the robots and “zombies” from older trailers are also scraped. the ‘tree boss’ is shown only briefly before blowing it to bits.

gameplay its self is quite breakneck as well. But instead of defending against the hoard with fast paced abilities and weapons, it can feel as none of which really matter in terms of gameplay, as your abilities are merely used to stall as you chip away at enemies little by little; causing a large stall in sections of the gameplay. The customization shown in older trailers has been scraped, As well as a couple weapons shown in resent trailers are nowhere to be found in-game, glory kills are scraped and replaced with a stealth kill function that has no focus in this version of the game, exclusive deaths scenes are scraped and used with only plyusch and lab techs. Despite talking about stealth and the use of silencers on weapons, stealth in not a focus of the gameplay; as many of the robots will hear you coming or walk to fast for you to even attempt to kill; there’s only one animation per robot, and organic creatures are far to hostile to sneak up on; so if you wanted a cool kill-animation with the weapons, they no longer exist. the beginning alone leads to show horror-esk themes but are ignored in later parts of the game. It also appears there might have been more to the story in later trailers were also scraped.

much of the story is a mess, there are plot points that don’t lead anywhere, the ending clearly exists only for DLC to come out and wrap up the story, as well as not letting the player to come to their own conclusions. Lore can be discussed in dialog in short bits of “what trivia does my left hand know”, pocket watches that record conversations, and e-mails on computers; All of which, mostly nudges to be joking and lacking in world building. 

There’s one section of the game showing portraits of random characters, that provoked the uncanny valley in the back of my head, when it hit me that they were made by AI. Leading me to wonder what other filler was created by nodes and AI; as well as some of the poorly written lore segments in emails.",1678949232,1680228934,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

A really nice first game for Mundfish (game developer), a solid game with some problems, but none of them are so critical that you should avoid this game. Don't expect too much, try not to compare it with other projects (especially Bioshock) and you'll not regret about spent time.

[h1]Ambience[/h1]
I'd like to start from coolest feature of this game for me: ambience. Have you ever heard about phenomenon when people are romanticizing some time (80s, disco, medieval etc.)?  This is it; this is pure good nostalgia about USSR and as a CIS born person, I felt everything from my childhood: houses, speeches, f-words, environment, music, USSR fails mostly in all aspects (spent all the polymers if you know what I mean). But just to be clear, it’s just a background for the game, nobody will try to tell you that USSR was the best country ever (I would even say the opposite, you will see why not).
And here comes one small problem, if you aren’t born in any CIS country, you might miss a lot of “local anchors” (memes, jokes, references to culture). 

[h1]Let me tell you a story[/h1]
Story is… Ok, it’s fine. As you might know, you’re a major, who was equipped with super-duper glove and sent to solve “situation”. The more you progress the story, the more complex “situation” become. Game has some twists, most of them you will guess, some of them might sounds interesting for you. There is only one thing here that actually spoils the impression: protagonist’s reaction. No-no-no. [b]The stupidity of protagonist[/b]. Everybody and everything will exactly tell him (and you), what’s wrong with this place and Major Nechayev will say something like “No, it’s not possible, he is a good man \ they are good people”. That should probably show him as a straight soldier, but actually it’s just annoying.
Except of this, cinematics are good, story dungeons are well designed and not boring, length of the game is pretty much balanced (by the time you’re starting to think “that starts to be boring” game actually says “ok, here is a final”)

[h1]How to kick robots with ... [/h1]
I've completed the game on Hardcore difficulty, so all my notes below should be read with one idea in mind: “What actually works to help you reach the end of the story?”. And I could say, not everything in your arsenal actually works.

[h1]Weapons[/h1]
Least claims to weapons: melee weapons are good, shotgun is awesome, energy weapon helps you get a good start, but after that you’ll find a recipe for Zvezdochka and realize that her special attack makes everything else (especially for bosses) be just a time filler until energy is restored. [spoiler]Seriously, 300 bullets in AK will not do as much damage as one full charge of Zvezdochka’s special (since Zvezdochka translates as a star, maybe it makes it so “star weapon”).[/spoiler]

[h1]Skills[/h1]
Here comes one of the two major problems of the game. Mundfish were trying to make skills unique, but instead, they made most of them useless:
[list]
[*] [b]Freeze[/b] will reduce amount of damage you’re doing to enemies, until they unfreeze and it takes too long to fully freeze a single enemy.
[*] [b]Bubble[/b] is not fully saves you from damage and if you attack, bubble is dropped (not confirmed for a fully upgraded bubble)
[*] [b]Jet[/b] sounds interesting, but it takes too long to make it work. You should spray it (3 seconds) and after that do something. You can freeze, fire or shock jet trails, but if you want to freeze, why not to use freeze skill instead? If you want to shock, why not to use shock skill (available in any combinations) instead? And you don’t have an easy way to cause burning, except flame ammo.
[*] [b]Telekinesis[/b]. OP skill even on initial level. Controls most of the enemies around you, you can shoot them in progress, they can’t do anything, works around you and area of effect is covering a half of USSR. Oh, did I say that at the end you can smack your enemies into the ground and while skill is active you gain energy?
[/list]
Somewhere in the middle of a game I’ve realized that I want to choose Telekinesis and more bullets for my build.

[h1]I (don't) want to explore[/h1]
Another major problem is open world. It’s really annoying. You don’t have a Ubisoft style outposts and juggernauts (and this is good), instead you have an endless amount of cameras that triggers an alarm and forces you to fight enemies you don’t want fight to. And except of that, open-world is just a source of resources for crafting. And polygons (mini dungeons with puzzles).

[h1]Comparison to other games[/h1]
A lot of reviewers are saying that this is a “Bioshock inspired game” and while it looks like it, for me it’s more of “Fallout 3 \ 4 (not New Vegas) without RPG elements”. Try to guess the game by description: “You have an upgrade station, and you need a various number of resources to craft or upgrade your weapons. You are heading to open world \ dungeon, killing some enemies, looting some houses, trying to find some recipes, loot until your inventory is full, get back to station, upgrade your weapons, craft some ammo, and repeat until final boss”.
 
[h1]Technical state[/h1]
At the time of review, game is pretty much in a good shape, it’s nicely optimized, but still has a lot of visual and technical issues (some objects are unreachable, some enemies are instantly stand after being knocked out, once textures for elevator weren’t loaded, bees sometimes “forgot” to repair camera, needed to progress to polygon). Fair to say, none of them are critical.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
It’s a first game for Mundfish and I could definitely say that this is a really good start. It’s not a best game of all years, I hope with DLC’s (or Atomic Heart 2) they will try to solve some of the problems, but for now I’d definitely recommend you to buy the game if you can afford it (but no need to rob the bank or get a loan to buy this game)",1678045666,1680218721,True,1,0,0.504069149494171143,0,True,False,False

Only gribe is the enemy density in the open world. Turned on cheats for those.
Bosses, every one was fresh. And the normal enemy types really worked well together. Fucking healing robots. Lol",1680217805,1680217805,True,1,0,0.514563083648681641,0,True,False,False

The environment and the setting is very cool and intriguing, and with upgrades, your abilities get really useful and cooler to use through out the game. But I have gripes with aspects of this game that I cannot overlook. 

Glitches occur which stop you from picking up certain weapon upgrades. Especially what got me was the AK sight. There is a room you are locked in, you have to pick up a ball that slides out from an area and place it in another. There is some invisible wall that prevents you from collecting it and progressing, causing you to reload or give up on it forever. If this gets fixed I might finish the game.

Combat needs work. The game wants you to conserve ammo but there is no block for the melee, only dodge. The block is a ""shield"" acquired through upgrades. It does not pull up fast enough and is more for long ranged defense. The only worthwhile defense is the ""no damage dodge"" which seemed to only work a fraction of the time

Bosses are meh. The first is impossible to get any space from and was pretty annoying to fight. Mainly running around the arena the whole time and doing big area attacks, then getting up in your face and doing attacks on you that not even the ""shield"" can withstand. After, the next boss fight were two different, but similar, robots meant to be big and bad looking only for me to take them out almost instantly.  

I'll add that I was playing the hardest difficulty expecting some sort of challenge but it just feels lack luster on enemies, and slow on game play. I don't need COD or DOOM type speeds but goddamn the game play is just too slow. I do, however, feel that this game would've fit in comfortably with speed shooters, given it's style, but it seems speed was sacrificed for more thought out and tactical attacks to show off the abilities in the game. It's not a bad thing to show off the abilities, but I do wish there was more haste in the game play. Even a sprint option would add so much to this game but it simply does not exist. 

Again I encourage you to play and see for yourself because it is fun. I've followed this game since 2018 so in conclusion I will say I was disappointed with the state of its release and game play.",1680217123,1680217123,False,2,0,0.527423858642578125,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is pretty fun overall, very bioshock-esque. You got the classic weapons; pistol, shotgun, rifle and rocket launcher, along with 5 different melee weapons (with one of them being absolutely broken) and a few more unique weapons. They all feel decent, like any other FPS, they get the job done but there's nothing noteworthy. If you enjoyed Bioshocks gameplay you'll like this one.

The storyline is where the game shows a clear lack of polish. There is just far too much talking. Not in the sense that you'll get a big info-dump occasionally, but in the sense that, especially at the start of the game, the characters just won't stop talking together. You'll often find audiologs that you can't listen to because you need to wait for the conversation to end, or you might reach the end of a section before they finish their talk, so you either have to akwardly stand around, or just move on and skip the rest of it. The story itself is quite frankly confusing, this could be because i ended up tuning out to some of the conversations, or because i couldn't listen to a lot of the audiologs i picked up, but it's just a bit of a wacky mess. The story is decent enough to get you through the game, but don't think too deeply about it, or you'll see all its flaws and pacing issues.

The visuals though, are where the game truly shines. The  overall design, enemies, props and environment all have proper thought and care put into them. The world is pretty, and while some of the underground research places get a bit repetitive, it's just an overall great looking game. If you like soviet-era design, you'll enjoy looking through this game. I personally loved the robot designs, and there's a really neat mechanic where as you hit robots, you're able to see modeled internals and robotic bits underneath the shell.

The music and OST in this game also really surprised me. It's just so good. You've got great original songs, super cool remixes, and just an overall really great experience for the ears. I sometimes found myself annoyed at finishing combat encounters too quickly cause i was jamming with the fight music

Overall the game was a fun enough experience, i got 18 hours out of it, you'll probably get closer to 25 if you do all the extra underground labs to unlock all the upgrades, but i didn't bother. The visuals carried me through the game, while the gameplay was good enough for me to not get bored. If you're looking for a Soviet Bioshock, this'll be a fun experience, but if you want a good or deep story, i would go somewhere else. I would give it a neutral vote if i could, but I'll give it a positive one, as i really do see the potential that Mundfish as a development team has.",1680213050,1680213194,True,0,0,0.489323854446411133,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the game play is fun at the beginning but gets boring after halfway through the game. I even grab most of the upgrades for the weapons to make it more enjoyable, but the upgrades, especially for the AK47, doesn't change its mechanics at all, unlike the upgrades for the normal pistol, melee weapon, and the energy pistol. The normal pistol can charge its shots when aimed, the buzz saw melee can have flying blades with its special attack, and the energy pistol has an EMP function that can stunt robots, which is fun and useful. But the AK47 upgrades were just stats and an element canister, and almost every weapon has a slot for an element canister. There are even cool looking guns that got taken out of the final release.

Secondly, the game being an open world doesn't do any justice, yes, it's fun to go around and explore, but you can have the same fun in BioShock 1 without an open world. Atomic Heart doesn't even have a fast travel system, the only way of transportation is to find the same red car, where it could explode if you run over just a tiny amount of robots, unlike Far Cry 3 which is set in an open world where you can drive many types of cars you find along the way and run over enemies many times without it exploding. But in Atomic Heart, when I see a car that I want to drive but realize is not driverable, it ruins the immersion too.

Thirdly, the powers, the only one that I felt really useful was kinetic, where you could lift multiple enemies up in the air and slam them down, compared to ice, which I had maxed out and wasn't useful at all because freezing a single enemy takes too long, by then the other enemies would already be attacking you or stunning you.

Lastly, there are enemies that I was interested in fighting, but it turns out they were only for show, which is disappointing. I even wanted to fight that weird yeti with an apple on his head in the trailer, but you don't even fight against it and many more enemies.

THE GOOD:
+Combat was fun
+Story was solid

+Roboballerinas
+NORA

THE BAD:

-Not much in the way of AI infighting, would have wanted to see different factions fight each other
-Not much variety in the enemies.
-Not everything was translated, would have liked to be able to read even the miscellaneous texts in the game, but i can't read hieroglyphs!

Pros:
- The setting is more unique than I thought
- I like the sometimes zany contrasting with the horrific (though I know this is not for everyone)
- Combat, looting, crafting, exploring feels good
- Characters are interesting
- Story is interesting
- Great OST
- Well optimized (rare crashes) and runs on linux with Proton Experimental or the latest Proton GE like a charm.

Con:
- Beware rocks and some terrain objects, you may get caught on them and it is a chore to wiggle free, this is not Skyrim for you to be able to jump up the side of a mountain
- Slight balance issues with the powers however, if you don't want to cheese it is OK (also has no multiplayer so really who cares)
- I played 36 hours and I want more... There isn't any more. :(  (There are DLCs promised, hopefully those will bring more.)
- Save often, it is easy to screw up and also there are occasional problems (getting caught of stuff and I had 1 crash so far, so really it is better than most AAA, especially considering I'm playing on linux, which is usually the worst case scenario)
(- I haven't finished the main story yet, but ppl are saying it is bad somehow idk, thought I would mention this).

This game somehow mashes in an amazing, in-depth story with incredible fighting mechanics and animations-- and im not saying that this has never been done before, it was just something that this game did better than most games I have played. 

Should You Get It?:

Many people got this game in hopes of blowing stuff up and running around endlessly on coke killing everything they saw and letting out all of their pre-pubescent anger. Instead, you get blowing stuff up and running around endlessly on coke killing everything you see while at the same time experiencing a full story. I mostly play games for the story aspect of it- of course, actual game play is fun too but i judge a game not by what cosmetics you can get, but by how much lore and cinematic moments you can get from it. 
Atomic Heart was a perfect example.

Defiantly takes from the first Bioshock that for sure and to be honest the only one i liked.   

Atomic heart as i said before is a little bit unusual but not bad in taste, it likes to tag different game play styles, platforms and puzzles that even had me scratching at the head sometimes.   This may not be for everyone but I do like it myself.

Atomic Heart has alot of heart, passion and potential and you can see it really punches above its weight, for a first time studio release you can really see the key details and that take you surprise.  Only some things fall by wayside, but there should be no shadow of doubt the that next possible game you could see from Mundfish (if they do make another game) would hopefully learn from this and make an even better game.  

I do believe the hype train was a bit much but so far it has not disappointed, the mixed reviews are possibly a result of this, announcing a title that people have to wait for years on brings on alot of expectations and then finally broken promises, somethings just don't work out as i have seen during gameplay and trailers.

As I have waited years for this it does bring a breath of fresh air, the controls take a while to get used to but after a couple of hours you will be blasting robots sending them backwards into pieces and it does not get old.

8/10 Good effort chaps certainly better effort from what has come out at least in the past 2 years by massive developers and publishers companies.


After finishing the game it only occurred to me when watching previous trailers that the game seemed very challenging, however (minor spoilers) the first arena boss you go to take out I did not die once and on hard mode, its seems to me that the devs turned down the difficulty massively after reading a lot of comments on how ""squishy"" the enemies are (even though they are robots), the devs did mention on how you have to learn a dance with them and that sort of thing i do enjoy, but was a bit let down when i mopped the floor with it.

It is a good game in my opinion with a unique overall story and game play experience. 
Combat can be difficult at times and the AI can be quite difficult to handle since their ability to spot you is just outstanding. Resource management is easy so that isn't an issue. There are some unique weapons that can be crafted but to get their attachments you need to do a lot of exploring in the areas scattered throughout.
The game is puzzle driven so expect a ton of puzzles after short intervals and although they are mostly a repetitive types but yet they can be challenging at times although not a big deal.
Overall I would rate the game a 7.5/10 because of the good visuals, good soundtracks.

Atomic heart is quite a bit of fun, and feels like a mix of Farcry and DOOM though not as smooth game play. There are some bugs holding it off from being a great game however. I found my character getting stuck on random tiny debris on the ground and getting stuck on random clutter in a perpetual fall animation causing me to re-load an old save hours back. The dialogue is quite cringe for lack of a better word, but playing with English sub titles and Russian audio works well to ignore most of it.

I won't spoil the game in this review but I will say that the music, the art style, the game system and world are all so interesting experience  that this game will be remembered through history because of everything new that it brings to the table.

Atomic Heart also builds on existing Imm Sim game concepts and stream lines so much in a very fun way, Every upgrade resource you use to make your character or weapons more powerful can be 100% refunded, this means that you can fully upgrade something, see if you like it and if you don't, you can break it down and upgrade something else with all the same resources, this eliminates the FOMO issue with most games like this. Making it a Joy to experiment without the need to reload a save or restart your run. Looting is also streamlined to be satisfying and fast so you can get your resources and move on quickly.

The amount of combos you can do in combat isn't Fromsoftware level but it does have great variety and deserves to be emulated in what I hope will be future sequels.

This game looks stunning for a modern era game, even though it's built on UE4 not UE5. It does have some bugs with animations and such but I have seen much much worse issues from AAA game studios, The performance of this game, as whole was so good that it was notable to me that my FPS almost never dropped even on ultra settings. Mundfish certainly should give talks about what they did with Unreal Engine to make the game look this nice and perform this well with an an older system.

The game breaks up a lot of its core elements in a natural way as to never bore you with the same things for too long. Corridor shooting, Puzzle solving, Arena battles, world building, set pieces, mini bosses, open world exploration. The blend of it all is healthy without it overstaying its welcome.

As for the story and the humor, I recommend going into this game as thinking of it like a solid B Movie flick, behind the veil it has some great ideas, and some thought provoking questions about science and humanity. The main story is crazy, over the top, doesn't, take it self too seriously, and has some great meta commentary and jokes about the world we live in.

One last thing, for now, is that the timing between sentences feels a bit quick and also timing with the dialogue during a cut-scene.

 For a bit more in-depth look, the game runs really smooth and if you seen someone say, ""oh Ive completed the game in 7-8 hours and it lacks (so and so) "". Im sure they have rushed the story and dint bother to look at the world for a bit. Im 8 hours in, nowhere near the end and I've been taking my time looting exploring and just taking a nice look at the world around me. Its quite bizarre and quite pretty with all the unique destruction and cool anomalies.
The cons I would say is that the number of weapons/blueprints you receive to make said weapons is a bit overwhelming since you do want to try them all. They should of also introduced guns a bit later like when you start to leave the complex. If looting properly you get a great amount of ammo which really lets you shoot without much consequence and also make you use the energy weapons less since they are technically infinite ammo.

Overall id say this is a great buy and just an awesome game, id sort of say this is a Ruined dystopia like Far Cry but with cool killer robots. Just take your time, look around and experiment with weapons. Would play this after a harsh day, either at work or in general.

Story is pretty medicore at best and pretty stupid at its worst.
The pacing is pretty awful....
Gunplay is ok.
Graphic is lovely.
the Soundtrack is migh hilight of the game tbo :D
The Setting is basicly unsused.
Low Enemy variaty wich is sad, but whats there looks fantastic.
In general the Roboter Desgin is realy awesome.
Personaly I realy enjoyed the little püuzzel level, nothing to hard or complex, but still fun.


This Game is my defenition of a Solid 7.5 (maybe 8).
Some things are realy great, some other's are pretty bad.

And for a first game, mundfish realy did an insane job.

Fun challenging enough and most importantly complete. In a day in age where everything feels like it's missing a part for future DLC or for a monetization later on, Atomic Heart feels like a game that knew what it wanted to do and did it, giving you a full experience in one go. Gunplay and melee felt good, bit different at the start but quickly adapted. Enemies have enough variation of types without going to far and while some might complain that there's not 100+ enemies I think it's to the game's benefit as each enemy feels fleshed out and in a game where you're suppose to figure out what to expect and how to approach different enemies (especially on higher difficulties) it feels like the better choice. Once again I felt like there was enough enemy variety. In addition to the combat the puzzles where fun and enjoyable, yes this game hides a puzzle game inside it with some platforming. The story I also enjoyed with enough twists that I legit didn't know where it was going at times. So I won't spoil anything and say experience it for yourself. The art direction was also refreshing as this world felt DIFFERENT then the usual alt history romp or even sci-fi ventures in general.Thank you Atomic Heart.",1679706072,1679706072,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This happened enough times (since you need to dash a lot) to annoy me but they've somewhat fixed it now (bringing up the pause menu lets you jump again after unpausing).Variety is probably the biggest weakness of this game as you don't have that many powers to use or enemies to fight.

I even had the opportunity to preview the Ray-tracing Gameplay back in 2019, which was fantastic. However, I can not say that this game is amazing. Unfortunately, I can not say that this game is even good. Though it does hold a lot of potential, I do not think this game will ever get better like Cyberpunk did.. and HERE IS WHY: The Good: Despite all the bad reviews and millions of bugs the game has, I have to say this game introduces a lot of new, potentially ""Game changing"" mechanics. One of the mechanics that really surprised me is the procedurally generated ""Dismantling"". The amount of detail of how you can kill your enemy is mind-blowing, but what is more interesting is the way that every single attack registers incredibly accurately on your enemy with every scratch appearing EXACTLY where you hit the enemy. Not to mention the broken parts being left lying around even after you quit the game.  The other part, that was quite impressive was the enemy AI. I liked, that the enemies found ways to get to you, even when you try to run away and hide in a safe area. They would literally  Jump, Climb up on objects and leaders, and even walk inside rooms while chasing you. I was very impressed, since I played Generation Zero I know what it's like to have ""DUMB"" AI robots. Atomic Heart AI seems to concentrate heavily on enemy engagement in the game, which is very impressive. Overall visuals are pretty good, though I expected a much higher level of details on textures. Of course, I really enjoyed the USSR Lore, especially the music in the background. I can't believe they actually have those songs playing in the background. Nostalgia :)  The Bad:As soon as you enter the game you are faced with very poor storytelling and very bad game coordination. Like for example at no point in the game, you are given any direction as to why you would need to seek out Polygons (Which are secondary objectives in the game)  And by the way aside from a handful of other side quests that is it. The story itself is incredibly bad. I played the whole thing in Russian and I have also seen the English translation. Though the Russian version is better (as the English version cuts out a lot of Easter eggs... I guess in relation to the war) The whole thing felt rushed at the end. In some places, it felt like whole scenes have been cut out from the story. Moving around the world felt unnecessary and linear. It felt more like a giant room instead of an open-world game. There were cars in the game, but they were useless, as you drive them for 100 meters before meeting an enemy. The car would easily get damaged and blow you up, so I never seemed to need it. Or you could move some objects ( like not every object or not even a few just random objects for some reason) like some chairs, but not other chairs or cardboard boxes. you couldn't really hit an enemy with it or use it in any useful way... I mean if it was there decoratively, why not make more objects like that...  I  really don't understand why these features were there. It seems like there were a lot of unnecessary things that were more in your way rather than helping you. This brings us to the UI of the Map. What a mess that was. not only you couldn't switch off unnecessary items (Like you would in any normal open-world game map... Cyber Punk, Horizon Down Zero, Red Dead Redemption 2 ) But most of the items highlighted would not even have names next to them, so you wouldn't even know what they are. Also, you could never tell where your location was, as your icon would be very similar to the background color.The UglyTHIS GAME IS BROKEN. In the state it is now, despite poor storytelling and the numerous flaws in uneasy items, that ruin the game and things that make the game very boring to play, I would have still liked it, BUT it's the many MANY MANY bugs that put a nail on a coffin. It's really sad to see this, as the game has a huge potential to be great, but it is simply unplayable in the state it is now. The many bugs I encountered:- Clipping - This one happens almost right after you start the game. Most of the time you would see through the wall if you come close, some items will be stuck in the floor or walls and even some of the key objective items will be stuck in some prices of geometry making it very difficult to proceed with the game. Not to mention the Character getting stuck in geometry all the time.  - The loot does not empty in full -This one comes later on in the game and at first, I ignored it, but the more progressed the more I noticed, that I could only get 1-2 items from any loot bag.  While it would still show the ""Collection "" circle and the action button F, I could not collect it- Things stuck in midair - Sometimes pieces of geometry would just be hanging in the air and not disappear after you loot or even after a big fight.- Enemy animations Stagger -This one is quite odd. It happened to me almost toward the end of the main campaign. I have never seen anything like that in a game bug before. Basically, the game would run at a normal FPS (*like 90-120) and everything would feel like it's 120 FPS, but the enemy will move as if it's moving at 1-5 FPS. This gives you an opportunity to kill an enemy without effort, but it breaks the immersion completely. This also happens when you try to unlock doors (The animation of your character will slow down to 1-5 FPS)- The Balloons-This is a personal one. I think one of the first things that put me off from immersion was the STATIC balloons. Everywhere you found them they would appear to be motionless. You would be able to go through them and they would act as a cement block when you shoot at them.- Textures missing - This one does not happen that often and it seems mostly on a very specific object throughout the game. You will basically see your standard black-and-white checkerboards on geometry instead of the texture.- Resources stop collecting - This happened to me toward the end of the game. Two of my resources just refused to show up even when I collected them, which made it impossible to upgrade or buy anything in the game. I ended up dropping a lot of options and my weapons just so I can move forward.This game felt like a very interesting experimental prototype or a BETA, with many bugs and unfinished work. I would not recommend it in the state it is right now",1679655962,1679656189,False,1,0,0.475100010633468628,0,True,False,False

The experience of piloting your character is tight and responsive (minus a few times I got stuck in an object by jumping too much), the art direction and level design are very creative and super tight, and the sound (both diegetic and non) does an excellent job building immersion and setting the mood of the scene appropriately -- also the soundtrack slaps, worth listening to on its own.  An example of where the game did things correctly can be found in the horror sections. In many of these very tense, slow, and methodical areas (with little or no combat) the devs demonstrate true mastery of the tenets of horror by perfectly combining the elements I mentioned previously together with excellent pacing to create some very tense dark and even scary environments and gameplay. These sections are so good in fact that I can't help but wonder whether this used to be a genuine horror game before the Atomic Heart you see now was created. Amazingly, the rest of the game is so bad it manages to ruin this base; a few things stand out as particularly egregious: the main character, the ending, and the open world.  Without giving spoilers I can say that the ending does not resolve a single plot point and feels very tacked on which together with the relatively weak plot leaves the strong central concept of the game feeling wasted on such mediocrity. The plot itself is also very predictable and cliché. Next, the open world. Let me just be clear: this game does not need to be open world. It works far better as a linear horror/immersive sim. The addition of open world sections just makes the game feel more tedious and adds hours for no payoff. This is not Talos I lobby style open world this is an attempt to be Far Cry and it fails horrendously. There are way too many enemies, travel time is slow and boring on foot and clunky in a car, and other than hunting for weapon mods the open world areas don't actually serve any purpose and don't impact the story progression at all. The only explanation I can come up with for those sections being in the game is some kind of focus group requirement: ""must have open world.""  Finally, the worst thing of all: the main character. He is the most unlikable, idiotic, and obnoxious character I have ever seen in any piece of media bar none; that he's so stupid is insulting to the audience, and to make things worse he has a talking glove that drops massive exposition bombs on you periodically -- completely destroying any chance that the you have to think for yourself even a single time. Every puzzle is explained to you in detail, every chance they get the talking glove explains what the current objective is and how to do it and where to go and ""oh, don't forget to do X and Y and Z."" It's infuriating! The game wants to be an immersive sim so badly but it's not possible to immerse yourself in a character written this poorly, and especially not one that talks as much as he does. Imagine if the hacker in System Shock narrated the entire game to you while you played: ya, it's really that bad. Overall, I do not recommend this game -- at least not at full price.",1679645737,1679646730,False,4,0,0.538427591323852539,0,True,False,False

They have textures but they have almost no correct shading and they show almost no real emotion in the face.(like fallout characters)And last but certainly not least P-3.

The story is a mess, full of odd decisions, plot holes and huge stretches of credibility to make things work they way they do. The ending is also highly unsatisfying.

I have never had so many robots try to seduce me

The Boss battles also leave a little to be desired. Some look like they should have been battles but then turn out to be nothing (Giant tree) and all the others are just big bullet sponges.

When you fight the big rolling boss there are actual mechanics that were kind of fun to figure out and utilize.

First of all, this is not the ""Soviet Bioshock"" game you are looking for, sure it has lots of similarities with the Bioshock franchise but it's not even close 90% of the time.

The ambiance is there, the graphics are the music is there but everything else is simply bland.

There are tons of gameplay mechanics either half-assed or never realized enough within the game. 

You can climb, grab, and vault but apart from a few areas where you absolutely need it you never want to depend on it because for some reason it works on some specially marked areas and some random edges of the random stuff on the map. Not every ledge is a ledge you can grab.

You can drive cars in this game but it's the exact same car everywhere and there are only a few paths to drive it. 

You can use your elemental abilities to electrocute or freeze stuff but it's mostly unnecessary or totally coincidental because the game never lets you do anything with it the elements -again apart from a few areas where you absolutely need it-.

Training grounds are just a good idea repeated but randomized each time again and again 8 times.

The open world is there for some reason but there is almost nothing about it is fun. I'm not talking about endless respawns or something that triggered me within the open world. There is absolutely nothing to do in the open world other than looting some containers scattered around.  The game introduces you to tons of mechanics about the open world and almost never does anything about it. 

The save system is just bad, it's obvious that the developers wanted the game to feel more like ""Bioshock-y"" but the first Bioshock game was released 16 years ago. I never had any issues with the save system at all but the requirement to find a spot to save your game feels very very dated today.

The story is plain bad, I'm not talking about the cheesy/cringe-ass protagonist, I'm talking about the story itself. I'm extremely done with this story, I've played, watched, and read the almost exact story within different settings more than 10 times each. I wasn't exactly expecting a mind-blowing story or anything.

Weapons were just meh. I played the entire game almost exclusively with Shotgun and Melee weapons and upgraded Mass Telekinesis to the max. Almost every combat was a cakewalk for trash mobs and bosses just took some time. There are many ranged weapons but almost everything rushes to your face and there is almost no reason to use ranged weapons.

I leveled up almost all abilities to some extent but never actually needed them.

The entire game feels like some ideas stitched together and thrown out before us to play.

Testing grounds feel like shrines from Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild but badly done.
Open World feels like pulled straight out of the Far Cry / Assassin's Creed series but badly done.
Gameplay feels like the mishmash of Bioshock and Doom 2016 but quite badly done.

Above all else the soundtrack is phenomenal.

This is definitely not a 60$ game, if you are interested wait for a 50% or at least for a minimum 33% discount if you ask me.",1677680416,1679602764,False,196,11,0.692047536373138428,0,True,False,False

Now, there's a fork in the road here, you can either let the protagonist wear you down to the point where you have to change the dialogue language to Russian just to emulate a more grounded and serious game.  You will find the gameplay is a little bland and the lore (in the form of interviews and 'audio logs' is lacking a certain spark

or...

Roll with the punches. Tonally, this isn't Prey or Bioshock, but we still have those games. This is more of a campy silly game that just so happens to have a golden, million dollar of an idea attached to it.

It's so strange, I originally fell into category 1, and was kinda turned off from the game for a while. I then took it at face value, let Charles and my main character grumble the whole way while smashing robots with an ax and treating it more along the lines of Resident Evil 2 with Resident Evil 7's inventory and sensibilities, if that makes sense...

There certainly is fun to be had here, but you kind of have to make sure you are looking in the right places. The story is pretty lackluster, but that is balanced out by an incredible world with some truly impressive graphics. It certainly isn't the next big thing, but its fun, plays good, runs absolutely fantastic, and has a lot of good going for it. I won't blame you if you just cannot get over the characters' banter or the bargin bin story

I will say though, having finished the game, the ending is unintentionally horrible and hilarious at the same time. My points above still stand, just also slap on a sense of anti-climax and one goofy plot point.",1677045353,1679601450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were a couple of weapons and skill trees I basically didn't touch in  my single playthrough and it didn't really matter because I felt like I was outpacing the challenge for the most part. I enjoyed the imagination behind the story and aesthetics, I though it had a lot of interesting social and science fiction elements to sustain my interests on that front. The story and dialog are not the strongest imo. All of that said, there is a element of hollowness this game gave me that is a bit hard to explain, the sum of all of it's parts is pretty good but I also can't help like feeling there are some holes that could be filled across the board.

Atomic heart.
This is a game I've been waiting for a long time and I clearly don't regret my purchase. The story is attractive. The USSR style universe with a mix of retrofuturism. A bit like the last wolfenstein movies. It's kind of bioshok-like. The gameplay is easy to pick up the weapons are pretty unique. I'm trying to do the game on apocalypse difficulty at the moment. It's pretty affordable.


Apart from the frequent bugs of being stuck in some kind of invisible wall or between 2 crates when jumping that kind of problem there. In this case, you have to save regularly to avoid losing too much time of your progress and restarting when this kind of problem occurs. I hope that the developers will correct this small handicap. 


The game remains pleasant to play. And we dive into it easily. If you're not too tempted and don't have money to spend, don't pick it up or wait for the sales. This single player game is well worth our time. On top of that, it's a game made by small developers and not the usual big names in video games.

Atomic heart.
Pour est un jeu que j'attendais depuis longtemps et je ne regrette clairement pas mon achat. L'histoire est attrayante. L'univers style URSS avec un mélange de rétrofuturismes. Un peu comme le coup des derniers volets de wolfenstein. C'est un genre de bioshok-like. Le gameplay est facile à prendre en main les armes sont assez unique en leur genre. J'essaie de faire le jeu en difficulté apocalypse pour le moment. C'est assez abordable.


Hormis les bugs fréquents d'être coincé dans un genre de mur invisible ou entre 2 caisses en sautant ce genre de problème là. Dans ce cas-là, il faut faire régulièrement des sauvegardes pour éviter de perdre trop de temps de notre progression et de relancer quand ce genre de problème survient. J'espère que les développeurs corrigeront ce petit handicape. 


Le jeu reste agréable à jouer. Et nous nous y plongeons dedans facilement. Si vous n'êtes pas trop tenté et que vous n'avez pas de l'argent à dépenser ne le prenez pas ou attendre les soldes. Ce jeu solo vaut largement que nous nous y attardons. En plus de cela, c'est un jeu fait par des petits développeurs et pas les habituels grands noms du domaine vidéoludique.

No sprint feature (had to get a sprint mod). Game encourages stealth but its harder to kill in stealth plus very slow crouch feature. also the main protagonist gets toxic at everything he talks to (its not his fault, hes fed up with talking to machines). your also gonna wonder why your in the middle of the game and you still haven't unlocked half your weapon arsenal.

EDIT : 

The further I've gone the buggier it has gotten, to the point you can wander levels looking for things you missed, but it's just the door didn't open or the lock cant be used.  Sometimes the Dandelion you shot earlier is the one you need to proceed, but it is not being repaired so too bad.  Enemy movement is also super sped up or they freeze in place in a couple of areas.
.
Getting into the testing areas is also pretty hard without consulting Youtube.  I dont have hours to just wander round hoping I'll stumble on the button, or manhole.

It was actually optimized and I experienced only a few crashes. Of course, it was also missing raytracing, achievements were bugged, and it had *no* FOV slider, but whatever - that's a minor detail (note: that was sarcasm). Despite missing an integral QoL feature, it actually worked on launch and didn't otherwise play like a beta. Or worse, an alpha. The core experience was well polished, even if it was missing some bells and whistles, which is more than some other AAA games can say. Given that this was the first game from a startup studio, and the tail end of development occurred during an impressive sanction regime against the host country, I'm of the opinion that AAA studios are now out of excuses.

Visuals are rock solid. I thought I'd have to make it ugly to run on my 1080ti. I was wrong. It's still on fairly high settings, and it looks AND runs great.

Music is solid. The remixes of old soviet songs are nice, and of course they snagged Mick Gordon, so naturally all his tracks are amazing. I'm stoked for the next portion of the soundtrack.

The gameplay isn't super innovative, but if you like Bioshock or Prey (2017), and you like scrounging, you'll definitely like what this game brings to the table. It's in the same vein as the Shock series, but with better gunplay. Being honest, I barely used the abilities, and I feel they could do more interesting things with them. Hopefully in the DLC they'll add some neat new [strike]plasmids[/strike] [b]polymers[/b]. I will add that the Zvezdochka is probably the most viscerally satisfying weapon in the entire game. I never knew that I wanted to watch my enemies be torn to shreds by angry flying buzz saws. The only real criticism I have is that I wish there was a way to disable Hives for at least like 5 minutes or something, so I could comfortably scrounge around. I understand the desire to keep the pressure up on the player, but dispatching an endless stream of Pchelas is both easy and tedious to deal with, and if you want to do anything on the surface, it's necessary. I never felt afraid of them, and I never felt like I ought to escape an area because I drew too much heat. Then again, I was also playing on normal difficulty. Oh, and also, the puzzles eventually became kinda tedious. Especially the ones where you just drag a ball through a tube.

And now for a long winded analysis of a story which nobody cares about.

I'm really not sure what to make of the story, but I'll say that it does some things well and other things not so well. It actually managed to surprise me, which doesn't happen often, and it provided adequate foreshadowing for the surprise (provided you read the logs), so that's neat. The voice acting in English is hit or miss. The overall message is kinda hard to suss out. It doesn't glorify communism or the USSR  - I mean, you're exploring evil science labs, you're killing the horrible machines/abominations which were built/birthed there, you're learning about ghoulish experiments done to prisoners, and everyone has a social credit score which is tabulated using data from insane levels of state surveillance. The Major has pretty understandable misgivings about what he sees, and slowly finds it indefensible. If I had to try and extract a message from this story, it would probably go something like this. It doesn't matter how miraculous your technology is, or how noble your ambitions are. At the end of the day, your dream of utopia will be reduced to a nightmare by the callous, misanthropic, self serving nature of humans. You can try to build people heaven and they will turn it into hell, and you may very well help them do it. All that being said, the Major is very much a caricature of the Soviet Man, and while later in the game he had a moment where he grasped some nuance during a discussion of international relations, he's very much a fan of both communism and the Soviets. While I am of the general opinion that communists do not have human rights, this is a videogame and I do not care about an imaginary person's opinions.

Honestly, I think that the regime is more like an aesthetic, story wise, because no real critique is made on it nor is a case made for it. Think about how Bioshock went after Objectivism, how it pointed out the unique ways Rand's philosophy would incentivize systemic dysfunction. Atomic Heart *didn't* do that with communism. It also didn't *advocate* for communism. Paranoia, opacity, poor delegation of authority, conniving backstabbing nonsense, leaders whose power is inversely proportional to their empathy - those are human failings, not failings which emerge from systemic incentives. What I see in the game is yet another soulless authoritarian bureaucracy, but with communist trappings. It wouldn't feel out of place in a cyberpunk setting, provided you gave it corporate trappings. I think there's a missed opportunity for something insightful, but I doubt *real* political analysis would fly given the current political climate in the Russian federation. So I'll let it slide.

Despite this analysis taking up the longest part of my review, I'd say I've encountered much worse stories, and much better. It's decidedly mid.",1679460663,1679461537,True,15,0,0.621248900890350342,0,True,False,False

It hits just the right notes from some of my favorite games of all time (Doom, Bioshock, Prey) and at the same time feels entirely unique. 

When you're exploring facilities or other indoor/underground areas the game plays like a puzzle-infused corridor shooter. There is plenty of gameplay variety found here - and the depth of which you'll encounter depends on your willingness to explore and play with the game's many interactibles. Most of the game's structured moments happen indoors, which makes the next part of the game so interesting to me...

While outside on the surface, the game is brutal and unstructured chaos. And I mean that in the best way. The game really beats it into you over and over again that this entire facility was fully built for these robots - that includes cameras and patrols on every corner - and humans are at a huge disadvantage here. I felt immersed in the world because of how terrifying on higher difficulties simply crossing the street can be if you're low on supplies. At first the relentlessness of the attacks and re-spawning enemies were frustrating, but as I changed my tactics and snuck around more often I began to really feel and appreciate the oppression of the world that Mundfish created.

Strongly recommend playing with the Russian VO as to avoid hearing ""crispy critters"" out loud because even once is too much and distracts from the otherwise intriguing story and mostly solid writing - not withstanding P-3's dialogue.

Minus 1 for the difficulty curve that keeps it entertaining in the very beginning, but flattens out and altogether plummets after a certain point in the game where you're just either fervently looting or nonchalantly dismantling mobs of bots and zombies along with unneeded ammo and unnecessary consumables to feed your arsenal. Only a few instances kept it interesting, especially where I was able to activate 3 Плющs and have them gang up on me. That, or the other times where you had gaggles of plant zombies coming at you. 
Bosses were also underwhelming with the variety (or lack thereof) of attack patterns. Mind you, I expected a challenge from Armageddon where game even warned about counting your ammo (I ended up counting the seconds between dismantling them). Mobs were interesting at first, but got boring after a while, I'd have liked more variety.

Minus 0.5 for the bugs. You'd think they'd iron out *most* of the glitches in this game after 5 years of development (e.g. stuck in textures, uninteractable characters, unlootable loot, etc.)
Minus another 0.5 for slightly unpolished design where there were literal blanks in map development, where you just cannot access certain loot/places.
And minus the last 0.5 for weapon and upgrade choices. Some are just outright useless (The Fox, The Dominator, etc.).

On the other hand...
Amazing optimization to the point where I thought Atomic graphics would melt my laptop (2060 RTX, Ryzen 4800H, 1 GB SSD), but ended up just dropping fps to around 20. Hence, I was able to get a stable 60 most of the time on Ultra.
Gunplay is great, satisfying and fairly realistic. 
Story was well-written enough to throw me for a loop with ХРАЗ and Сеченов's story. Environment was beautiful with only the occasional cheap cop outs (white background due to the sun? Come on, Mundfish).
I didn't play with English audio nor text (and for good reason, according to comments and reviews), I can only say the Russian voice acting was great, very grounded and realistic, even though I expected more obscenities (then again, this IS the USSR and people were slightly more reserved with their swearing back then). Штокхаузен's German accent in Russian was great and added to the USSR experience.

Eleonora, lmao. The actress must have had a field day with her lines XD.

I've been following this game since back when it was considered suspected vaporware, the trailers were excellently designed and had unique visuals and mechanics shown but almost no real gameplay. I was definitely hooked but wondered if it would ever see release. It was wonderful to finally have Atomic Heart come to fruition and I was amazed to see it even ended up looking better than much of the pre-release footage! And RTX isn't even implemented yet!!

This is seriously up there with the most graphically beautiful games out now, alongside Red Dead 2 and Metro Exodus, the art team should be really proud. The gameplay itself draws most comparisons to BioShock but is unfortunately a lot more restrictive with the special abilities of its main character. P-3 only has three real useful powers - Shok for robots, Mass Telekinesis for lifting/slamming enemies, and Polymeric Jet for Plyushes. Frost and Shield in my opinion are useless/redundant.

While the combat is ultimately held back by certain limitations like a small skill tree and minor weapon mods, what is on offer is still a hell of a good time! The melee weapons especially are nicely meaty-sounding and a visual treat! The Zvezdochka fully-ugraded with double saws is the best one hands-down - sending spinning saws to chop robots and mutants apart was every bit as fun as I hoped it would be ever since I saw the Plyush boss trailer.

I cannot recommend Atomic Heart harder enough, it is a 9/10 teetering on greatness but has flaws. The story is a bit convoluted but still has a charm and definite sense of style, no less helped by the amazing art team. I chose to play with Russian VA since I've heard how bad the English dub is. While this was more immersive and I recommend it, the subtitles have not been correctly implemented in certain dialogues for gameplay, cutscenes and even more troubling - audio logs on computers. So be aware you may lose out on certain bits of story information with Russian voices.

The amount of puzzles in the game is also overkill, but ultimately it was a nice way to break up the combat sections and keep things fresh which I appreciated. It needs more balance but for their first game, the devs at Mundfish should feel extremely accomplished.

The game has its upsides, but it honestly feels like it has just as many downsides. This review may change depending on how the eventual DLC handles any post-story content.

The pros:
-Interesting setting
-Somewhat fun and gory gameplay/story elements
-Thicc ballerina bots
-Some actually interesting puzzles built in as proving grounds
-An eerie atmosphere that actually made me jump a few times when playing with headphones on
-A protagonist that is completely hated by everyone but starts to make sense as the game progresses (I know, he annoyed me too at first, but the story started to make sense of why he acts the way he does. I'd be interested to see if his personality is any different in DLC since he sort of grows as a character over time.)

The cons:
-A handful a overly repeated enemies and mid-bosses
-An ""open world"" that's really just a hub world to ferry you from one instance to another and mostly acts as bloat, only being useful for trinket collecting since the rest of the world is void of life outside of bots.
-Weapons that end up becoming either useless immediately, or OP too quickly.
-Whatever the first limbo experience is - no seriously, why am I collecting floating apples?
-A story that does have interesting parts and twists, but is overall predictable and overdone.
-Weird bugs. For me I literally got stuck on anything and everything. Bots could force me into walls, jumping over anything almost guaranteed I was trapped in a jumping/running animation until enough button mashing/RNG decided to free me from the object, etc.

Final verdict:
Play it if you can get it for a bit of sale since the main story is really only around 15 hours and fully completing the game is both exhausting from the bloated collection achievements and the bugged atomic heart ending (as of this writing at least, look it up.) Also play it if you really are a fan of Bioshock games. Is it Bioshock? No, but it feels pretty close to the games which is what kept me going. 

Final thoughts:
Honestly, I think this game would have been even better had they done away with the weird hub world and just hid the proving grounds in various levels that you progress through. Not every game needs an open world, especially when the open world feels so empty and boring. Also, do we really need multiple variations of the same enemies? Even just using an actual different skin on some of them could have helped the game feel a little more robust. We also get left with some unanswered questions which wasn't too fun, maybe DLC will explain it, things such as  [spoiler]How did P-3 actually get the glove to begin with? I feel like the first part where you get your scanning ability, you could have also been given the glove instead of ""he just has it. Also How was the red polymer man actually created? It feels like it's inferred somehow in Pavlov, but not well enough?[/spoiler] Either way, the game was interesting enough for me to beat it, but I don't think I'll waste time collecting everything for the achievements.",1679368598,1679368598,True,0,0,0.497237592935562134,0,True,False,False

There's a glitch now where if you are running above 90 FPS, numerous glitches happen in testing areas and underground stages. I wasted probably 6 hours of gameplay until I found the cause. One of the most frustrating bugs I can recall in any game. 

Aside from that, the game play is decent and the story, art style and look of the game is fantastic, without being too derivative (but a bit admittedly). Elements of Bioshock, Fallout and Portal in this game. Phony voice acting, but good story overall.

Boss fights were pretty fun

English VA was obviously not ment to be the main VA, I assume in Russian it would be way better. (basically Im saying there's a few moments that feel overreacted or awkward)

Story: While it doesn't get too bogged down in the philosophical and social aspects of communism, it does do an interesting fly-bye of the problems arising from ideology meeting the realities of human nature and the socio-economic system's own internal contradictions. There's a lot of cool, interesting ideas in the story, and a fascinating setting, but the game is too fast-paced to let its characters or its ideas get fully fleshed out.
The characters themselves are a bit of a problem element. Characterization for individuals and relationships between characters change rapidly and without much warning; in the space of a single interaction, for example the player character can go from joking and jovial to murderous rage for little to no reason.
Gameplay: The combat is very fun from start to finish. There are 4 primary weapon types at your disposal: melee, guns, energy weapons, and the powers provided by the glove. These 4 can be combined in any which way you want, with different enemies calling for different offensive solutions. Though I preferred going in guns blazing, using the glove for crowd control, many situations called for alternative tactics that I had to improvise on the fly.
The other major part of the gameplay is the puzzle system, which primarily takes place in large underground 'testing' areas. The puzzles usually involve either flipping switches to change up an environment, retrieving keys, or a combination of the two in increasingly complicated combinations. These are fun little diversions that can take up to an hour to complete each, depending on how quickly you can solve each puzzle.
Crafting: One of the major faults of the game is the crafting system. I would say a good 1/4 of the time I spent playing was spent collecting every chest of craft materials I could find, and boy are there a LOT of them. There are probably thousands of chests, lockers, bags, and boxes scattered throughout the game, and if you spend the time collecting them all, you'll have fully upgraded weapons by about the halfway point. I had fully upgraded glove powers and weapons that I never used even once during the game. This leads to a major drop in difficulty, which lessened the impact of some of the bigger fights in the latter half of the game. Though still fun, having a fully upgraded telekinesis power lets you take out full groups of even tougher robots without breaking a sweat.
I would advise the development team for any future sequels to lessen the number of crafting resources so that players are forced to make tough choices about which powers and weapons to upgrade.",1679353586,1679353586,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story is...something else. I don't want to spoil anything but the idea of a Soviet Union with robots and music from the future is AWESOME. There are some twists here and there that you can't see coming. Phenomenal story.

The gameplay kicks ass. Shooting, driving, using a smart glove to fight robots. Sounds insane but it is cool as hell.

The music is, as I said earlier, SICK. The Russian people have some sick music that I had no idea of and now I am listening to the soundtrack on repeat. The mix of classical songs with fast songs = mindblowing

The characters are cool. I really liked Comrade Major and Charles. Such a cool duo. Comrade Major's lines are hilarious. Crispy critters, the set of characters the game is offering is really well done.

Although there was no shortage of bugs, I still did enjoy the game but recommend waiting for a sale and for more of the bugs to get patched. (Last update did fix a lot and noticed a lot less bugs since)

Pros: 
-The world building is the biggest thing this game has going for it, an alternate version of the Soviet Union is fun to explore and there is no shortage of lore, which for the most part is interesting
-The graphics are very good and some of the areas look amazing
-Game has a unique look and feel to it, which is rare in the current recycling era in gaming
-Dialogue is enjoyable and the personalities of the characters make the pseudo science mumbo-jumbo easy to digest

Cons:
-A lot of bugs
-The open world part of the game is boring/tedious and unnecessary
-Too many puzzles, which slow down the game considerably and are more tedious than challenging

Neutral:
-The story is a mixed bag with an unsatisfying ending but is good enough to keep you interested throughout
-The combat is fun but towards the middle of the game where ammo management is no longer a factor, it just becomes too simple and all challenge is gone

First, the game is buggy. 

As of this review, I'm dealing with a game breaking bug preventing progression. Another is during the course of the game, you can sabotage towers to disable bots. Which is mandatory for exploration as bots can be infinitely revived by infinitely respawning repair bots. These towers are supposed to be repaired by bots and reactivate. These towers can glitch and don't get repaired. This can prevent you from getting loot, or even access to puzzle rooms that reward you weapon mods (which are the only way to attain mods). You'll face several glitches during your time playing.


Next is gameplay.

Similar to Bioshock, you can unlock and improve special abilities. The problem here is you're only allowed to equip 3 out of the 5 abilities at one time. One of those being hard locked for story progression. 

For some reason the Dev's thought it would be a good idea to have NO SPRINTING. You read that correctly, there is NO SPRINTING IN THIS GAME. Your character speed walks everywhere at the beginning and unlocks ""running"" via character tree. The issue here is several boss/mini-boss/enemy encounters require a lot of movement. You're only given a single dodge. There is double dodge, but you have to unlock that too.


Lastly is narrative

Here we have another strange decision by the dev team. They thought it was a good idea for your character to talk about important narrative stuff in the middle of combat. Your character also spouts one liners in combat. So your character is talking about the narrative while in combat and will interrupt that conversation with a one liner as well.


While I understand it's from a indie dev, but they charge AAA game prices. Higher prices have higher expectations in my opinion.",1679273662,1679273662,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its done.  Quite an abrupt feel to the ending.  No spoilers.. One of the endings is as expected.  Yes I played through what appeared to be the different choices for endings..  Over all it felt like there was something missing in the game play.  I dont feel complete with any of the endings.  I also feel like I missed something.  I was hoping to get something more but like I said I was expecting this kind of an ending.  Based on the choppy game play, dialog, and over all flow of the story I would rate this as a good game to buy on sale.  Towards the end I finally got the winks towards other games over the years.  Thats probably on me.  I enjoyed the art and new look toward the environment.  But I was not excited to keep exploring.  I was not pulled into different areas of the map to find new things.  I felt more compelled to just get it over with.  Its a one and done game.  It seems as though they would like you to enjoy the arena after you are done but in fact I am just done over all.  It fulfills the Russian story line.. Just wish it did more with the story.. It kind of felt like they ran out of ideas towards the end and just wanted it done.  Good game on sale.. Not full price.  Hope they do better next time.
-------------------------------
Update:  Ok, well, I said I would come back in a couple of months thinking the screen tearing was an optimization issue... It is.. in my opinion but the steam forums suggested to set the frame rate to a max of 90 to resolve that issue.  It worked.. I can play just fine now.  So I am pretty savvy about staying away from places to get stuck now.. I cant really give it a thumbs down since I am having a good time with the game play.  
------------------
Ugh.. If you like choppy game play to the point of waking up dead, questionable dialog where the main character feels like a b list duke nukem, getting stuck in the environment (dont go trying to get around rock walls, or jump on broken magnet springs or get knocked into corners that have just about anything near by), oh and I know its a Russian game.  I was expecting the movie levels of propaganda.  You know the hero gets shrouded in the hammer and sickle after a big win or you get a bear pet that has a red hat or even some kind of homage to the proletariate... What I did not expect is to get constantly hammered with non stop dialog about how great the russian state is and how everyone wants their manufactured goods... and how much smarter they are and how great communism is and how bad capitalism is and well, the only thing I have not seen is how much sexier their women are and how much more handsome their men are... The only funny thing I heard when they said some people are more equal than others.
Its funny, even with all that I see a potentially good game.  I would easily look past the dialog especially since the graphics are unique... they are in fact quite well done.  I like the style.  It just would be nice if I could play the game with out all of the restarting issues mentioned above.  
I guess I am going to take a break on this for .. what?  a few months and see if its playable.  I expected more from the Russian programmers.  If the game play was as strong as the dialog's opinion of itself .. hell the game would practically play itself while it mined bitcoin in the background.  Sadly the boasting in game does not live up to the reality of the game play.  
I hope to come back in a few months to edit this and give it a thumbs up.
Just in case some one from the staff reads this... a teleport from stuck to a safe place would be nice .. but I know that can be game breaking... I would say a way to report bugs but I have not seen any that would be easily reportable.  It just needs optimization... and maybe a teleporter if you cant get to all of the places you can get stuck...",1679025475,1679272974,True,0,0,0.519609451293945313,0,True,False,False

Infelizmente, o jogo sofreu um pouco com as vendas devido ao preconceito de algumas pessoas em relação ao fato de ser desenvolvido por um estúdio russo. Entretanto, a jogabilidade é excelente, sem bugs ou erros notáveis, o que é raro nos dias de hoje. Embora no lançamento o jogo tenha tido um problema grave com a falta de opção no FOV, esse problema foi corrigido posteriormente com um patch.

A história do jogo segue P3 e seu companheiro Charles, que discutem diversos assuntos sobre o governo comunista e como a sociedade funciona, permitindo que os jogadores conheçam mais sobre as crenças e lealdades de P3 ao comunismo, além de aprender sobre os defeitos de tal governo. Os gráficos e o estilo de arte são impressionantes, e o jogo é extremamente otimizado. No entanto, a história do jogo é rasa, com um final decepcionante, mas que deixa aberto para uma futura sequência.

Recomendo o jogo, mas leve em consideração que, como acontece com muitos jogos, pode ser que você termine e nunca mais abra novamente. A não ser que a empresa lance DLCs ou expansões com novos conteúdos.

Por fim, embora o jogo custe R$200 na versão base, R$309 na versão gold e R$360 na versão premium, recomendo aguardar por uma boa promoção antes de comprar.

I killed every boss in the game with a metal stick for fun, because all bosses basically followed the exact same fighting mechanic sequence.

The comedy is good but sparse to the point were it almost feels out of place the odd time it shows up. The robots spawn infinity on the over map so its quickly turns into sprinting from point to point because there is 0 reason to engage in robots not in a building.

The story while interesting to start kind of just ends on the expected twist without filling in the protagonists actual story. It feels like a ton of story is missing or cut out to just end the way it ends. Maybe its an attempt at a cliff hanger, but it just ends up feeling unfinished. 

the puzzles are simple as can be and the various door unlocking mini games are not bad but do not get more difficult over time. 

the combat is good for the normal enemies but it all amounts to spam the shift button. All boss fights are the traditional 90s style run in a circle while you shoot and reload unless you have the big saw disk melee weapon then you just right click and the boss goes poof.

Imagine if you took an incredible setting and stunning visual design, added every gameplay mechanic you could want in a modern FPS, then tweaked those mechanics just enough so that they are all frustrating to use. That’s what Atomic Heart is.

This is such a weird game that will leave you constantly impressed and disappointed at the same time. It’s a game that I’m going to play through to the end because I have to know what is around the next corner, but I’m also going to be rushing from one objective to the next because the actual gameplay is so unsatisfying.

What I wasn't expecting was that this game would become so much more when looked at alongside Bioshock, a game that heavily inspired it. The themes of these two games intermingle in such a way that (to me, at least) it feels like a true understanding of either of these games can only be achieved by experiencing both. Well done, Mundfish! I look forward to seeing what you guys do next!

One of the few games that was playable on release and delivered on their promises... looking at you cyberpunk. The graphics in this game are awesome and I didn't notice any game breaking bugs after completing the game. The puzzles are fun and interesting to figure out and good enough to be fun without being irritating and annoying to progress. The story and characters are interesting and I thought the concept was really cool. The game is like if bio-shock, fallout, and metro exodus had a baby.

The Good: 
- Fun to Play
- Great Graphics
- Interesting Story
- Finished like it should be
- Updated Wide Monitor Mode
- Great FPS (I never went below 40 fps)

The Bad: 
- Small bugs (Sometimes you get caught briefly on objects if they're close together)
- Not ""Open world"" more like open level (Still linear game play)
- The character and glove talk a ton! 
- Interesting Inventory Management
- Sometimes it can feel repetitive initally but it gets better as you progress
- Denuvo Anti Tampering

I could live with it except for the fact that the lock picking animation now takes about a minute and a half just to get into it. All while its timer counts down.

What a shame, was looking forward to playing this game. Looked promising and not like the junk that came out the last two years. But sadly if you buy this you support the Russo-Ukrainian war because the investors are batshit crazy people like Gazprom. Check NFKRZ's video out.

Note: Played through Hardest Available Mode: Armageddon, Got all the Upgrades and Finished the Story.  let me list down the pros and cons. I tend to list more on Cons but dont let that deter you from trying this game out. I usually just put them there to vent and hopefully get the Devs to acknowledge the flaws of the game:

PROS
+ Ending was Bold enough. No Good Ending. I respect that.
+ Game is really optimized for an open world game. considering I have like an old entry level gamer laptop.
+ Gameplay is Fun until you get all the upgrades though. but still fun
+ The Looting Mechanic is Fun. getting to loot many things by holding down the button really helps
+ The Ability to store items to the Fridge on the Go
+ The Fridge
+ The Twins. The Devs and Artists know what they're doing
+ The Setting and the Premise have so much potential. They can do with alot of this in the future since ending seems to hint a sequel. It can make for a good Solid Survival Horror instead. they should bank on that genre in the future
+ Pausing the game does not interrupt or cover up the subtitles. wish they could implement like a dialogue history like lost judgement did but still helps for me who really likes to take time to read subs.
+ Dialogue choices are exactly what the character will say. not a summary of what the character might say unlike Fallout 4. 

CONS
- Character interaction with his Glove reminds me of Forspoken. Its Irritating and Exhausting. Id rather have the main character be Silent.
- The Open World didnt have much to offer other than Resources for Upgrades. 
- No Side Quests or even other NPCs. Everyones Dead. feels the world of Vermintide.
- Enemy Variety was honestly lacking. 
- Game is actually pretty easy. Especially when you get your weapons upgraded. Weapons like Snowball and its Leech Mechanic are too OP. Telekinesis is also OP. 
- Music Although by MIck Gordon, was little less than noticeable.  Also the way they repeat it all over the radios in the open world got me annoyed
- No Replayability
- Upgrades are too linear. No Build Diversity by Limiting your upgrades. you can upgrade your character to the max pretty early on. I hate when games do this. it hurts the replayability significantly
- No FOV option on Launch
- Even on hard Mode, resources are too plentiful, and enemies are still easily exploitable.
- Cutscenes and Voice Acting are pretty sub par. the way the camera's are shot goes way too fast. watching cutscenes feels rushed. this is even for Russian Dub
- Subtitles are too small and they go by way too fast. Sometimes they would start talking before subtitles come up, Sometimes they dont even appear especially in Epilogue scene.

Gameplay - The fighting style is nothing new but it still feels completely different. There is a lot of potential in the upgrades and different weapons. The open world aspect in between missions allows you to kill and loot as much as you want but its very risky. There are periodic puzzles usually to open doors or such, but they are reused and recycled. That's probably why they're so easy. Overall the gameplay makes you feel like a badass killing all these robots and mutants.

Story - I played with russian voice audio and I've got no complaints about the acting itself. Because I'm not as fluent as I thought I understood only about 80% of the story. There was a lot of build up and a lot of individual details that all came together in the end nicely but the endings were open-ended to say the least. I half expected there to be another hour of gameplay but nope the credits roll.

Some minor details - I absolutely loved all the references and easter eggs to old russian culture like movies, cartoons and music. This was the first time I played a game in russian in 10 years at least so it was a nostalgic and applauding experience.

This game is new so expect a few minor unpolished features.

FINAL THOUGHTS - This game definitely exceeded my expectations. Its not too long to finish even with the minimal resources. Combat is the pinacle of this game in my opinion so if you wanna kill some robots and feel good doing it then this game is a buy.",1679108074,1679122069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Atleast in both camps it's a fairly solid gameplay experience, it is quite nice that you can refund your points and resources to experiment with what works best for you, I just wish they would take it up a notch and let you really have to adapt to more unique situations.

Overall, the story is filled with twists and turns, lore filled Easter eggs and notes, tons of humor, and fantastic development pace. There are so many details to discover and small interactions to have with the various characters and even dead bodies scattered about the map. On top of this, the visuals and the music in the game are absolutely magnificent and the concept of the story and setting are brilliant. I won't go into depth and spoil anything of course, but this is worth it for the story alone. 8-9/10 easily.

Gameplay on the other hand is going to be a 5-6/10 for me. I found a frustrating amount of glitchy bits ranging from being pinned on terrain and perma stunlocked, to having jump puzzles break or have my character simply not want to grab on ledges, to the repetitive nature of the door puzzles that oftentimes served no purpose--blocking of little to nothing. Originally, some enemies even broke and began T-posing and moving about, though, after a recent patch that stopped happening. I think that the bioshock-esque combat system of the game (openly joked about by the MC towards the end) can be a bit stagnant as well.

Overall, I think this game gets an 7-8 out of 10 for me and was definitely worth the purchase. I just finished the full story and I have about half of the achievements and have done half of the optional dungeons.

Let me start by some reviews mentioning ""it's all over the place"", and ""trying to do many things"". Well let me tell you what they mean by ""trying to do many things"": 
It's three things 1)First person shooting 2) puzzles 3) mini games. It's not much.
And certainly not the only game which mixes first person shooting with puzzles. So why are they whining? Well, my guess is that either reviewers are so DUMB that they can't solve the puzzles or that they simply don't like them. It could be that it's both, the second reason is derived from the first.
The acting is not good. Reviews mention this, and it's true. But, I don't care. I am not watching a Netflix show or a movie. It's a freaking game and I am interested mostly in gameplay. So yeah, the protagonist can be annoying, but it's not big deal if you don't pay attention.
POSITIVES:
Immersive atmosphere. The opening scene is a masterpiece and serves well the purpose of grabbing you and throwing you in a crazy alternative reality where the citizens of the Soviet Union
 enjoy the services of advanced robotic AI  which is about to go very wrong.

Great combat system featuring (Bioshock - like) glove abilities and weapons.
Nice skill tree and upgrades.
Great puzzles. That's subjective of course. I like puzzles which are neither so hard that cause frustration,  nor easy enough that pose no challenge.I think the difficulty of puzzles is perfectly balanced. Not to mention their setting: Crazy rotating rooms and metal platforms that rise and descend under the influence of magnets, and more crazy stuff like that.

NEGATIVES
Manual saves. You've got to be extremely careful to save the game on dedicated in-game machines, because the game won't save automatically on every progress.
Dialog choices, they are not many but I don't like them.
The upgrade and crafting machine menu. It's kinda messy and not very convenient.
Some bugs like the infinite jump, or getting stuck in geometry. They still persist even after the latest update (March 17th).
You can finish the game and still not find HALF of the available weapons because you didn't find the randomly scattered crafting recipes.
Poor and inconvenient map. No key to explain the marks.
After you finish the game (Testing Ground included) there's not much to do.
You are left to roam an open world with no clear objective. My guess is that a future update will fix this with Game + option or something similar.

Far from a perfect game, it does, however, have a unique setting (even if the story itself is somewhat poorly executed and the less said about the ending - the better), it has excellent optimization (on launch.....sadly.....a rarity in our times.....), the gameplay is well set (boss fights are definitely the highlight, even though they are few in number), the music is appropriate to the situation.
I'm being soft on the developers, because it was their first game and they created a solid game, though, I certainly expect an upgrade in storytelling in their subsequent works.

It's a real shame that it was released at a time where actual Russia is doing some very unspeakable things to another country ( Ukraine ) but I can't find it logical to hold a Game Studio responsible for Russian Misbehavior ( Putin ) therefor I give this game a 4 out of 5 star rating and very much enjoy almost everything. The only thing I find lacking is ( RTX ) and ( FOV adjustments ) which you would think a game of this magnitude would offer both of these options.

We are now living in an RTX era like it or not and we are also in an era where at least 1 out of 5 gamers are gaming in ultrawide so It really blows my mind that game developers aren't giving more support options for ultrawide gaming like ( fov adjustments ) other than these two gripes I found the game to be extremely well optimized and very very fun!!!

Just be clear Atomic Heart does offer Ultrawide support just they do not offer FoV Adjustments. If you want any type of FoV Adjustments you have to download Flawless widescreen which is a 3rd party software. Don't get me wrong flawless widescreen is a great software for many games I just personally don't understand why in this day and age we aren't getting these settings in-game with the amount of money I spend on these games ( $70 minimum ) I should get every damn setting necessary to run an ultrawide monitor with ease and I should not have to depend on 3rd party software devs to make my gaming experience a better one.

POST GAME UPDATE: Review will stay positive. The combat is very fluid and fun, the music is amazing with tons of different styles of song, and the story is pretty good, but brings nothing new to the table. The biggest complaint I have is that sometimes dialogue will be cut off when you walk into another room with something scripted, or more important dialogue. I played with the english dub, and the lines in the beginning are somewhat cringe-worthy, I found it grew on me quite quickly, and found myself laughing at his ""Don't give a shit"" attitude and dialogue lines. Will do another play through and will return for DLC.

Let's start with the good things in the game. The biggest strengths of the game are, in my opinion, the worldbuilding and story. They managed to create an interesting world, where you want to learn as much about it, as possible. The story is convoluted, some plot twists seem obvious, but in the end you start asking your self, are the plot twists really what happend or just a way characters wanted to manipulate you, to get what they want. A lot of questions won't be answered in the game, so you have some things to speculate on, atleast until the dlcs and/or Atomic Heart 2 comes out. 
The combat system itself is fun and gives you freedom to chose how to fight, the only problem (atleast for me) is it's not a hardcore game, it's actually pretty easy after you figure the gameplay out. 

Now to the bad things. Sadly there are some bugs which can break the game, you can get stuck on objects and won't be able to get out, so you have to reload, which is not too bad but can get annoying. The bigger bug I encountered has something to do with the connection system of the robots. In the openworld you have a floting thingy called hawk, it transfers data between the robots in the area around it. You can use a console and overclock its powersource, a windmill, and destroy it that way, after that the hawk and all robots in the area will go more or less in a sleeping mode and do nothing and smaller repair robots will start repairing the windmill. The problem is for some reason most of the time the robots won't finish repairing the mill and the system in that area will stay deactivated, which is bad because you can't use the system too to open doors. 

There are more thing which I think could be better, the usage of the soundtrack is kindoff hit or miss, sometimes it just doesn't work other times it's just a great combo of gameplay and music and you wish it won't stop. The openworld is sadly somewhat boring too, there are not enough reasons to explore it, only reasons are some weapon upgrades hiden in on the map marked labs and just resources if you really want to max out everything, which is honestly not needed. The only other reason to explore is to find terminals or audiologs to findout more about the lore of the game. 
Another thing is the voice acting, the russian one has some little flaws but in general is great, the german and english one just felt way more infirior to the russian one, they couldn't depict the characters way of talking properly (atlest in my opinion).

But in the end the issues didn't outway the positives for me, it is a great game but sadly it could have been better.",1678967815,1678968018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just one example - You can loot a bunch of drawers from a cabinet rapidly using your gravity glove.  Saves you from the tedium of looting detailed rooms right?  No..... they put like a dozen cabinets in every room, making things just as tedious again.  Then, some cabinets just arbitrarily don't open.  And since the auto-open is flaky if you don't aim it right, you end up wasting a few seconds on each non-opening cabinet.  And it just feels blunted and annoying.

The dialog between the glove and the player character is every bit as terrible as reported.  Who are they trying to appeal to, 12 year olds?  Jocks who hate ""science pukes""?  Was this game made by 12 year olds who never grew up?  What the hell is going on there.  So, so jarring and cringe.",1678960699,1678960699,False,2,0,0.453917175531387329,0,True,False,False

It grew a following over these years, with the game's stunning visuals, unique designs, and intriguing world. Through great effort as well as great controversies, has Atomic Heart delivered on what fans had expected?

--ART DESIGN AND MECHANICS--

Atomic Heart certainly carries out what it promised with a visually amazing world that fits well with the atompunk-1950s aesthetic. The developers certainly found a brilliant style and keep it consistent throughout the game in all aspects, making every asset in the game fit very well. The world feels grand and intricate, although the actual play area itself that you cover in-game is smaller than it seems. Stray far from the beaten path, and outside of shallow explorable areas for upgrades and materials and the occasional speaking dead body, the world is pretty empty. Back on a lighter note, Atomic Heart introduces the player to some of the wackiest and most unique enemies, as well as an equally interesting arsenal to take them on. 

The approaches that you take to combat can be as simple as shooting a robotic terror until it's decommissioned, or as complicated as mixing and matching different polymers, weapon types, abilities, and environmental hazards to take them down shock-and-awe style. The progression of the game also allows players to experiment with ease, testing out new abilities and upgrading weapons in completely different ways with little cost to your resources as it refunds most if not all materials when exchanging upgrades for another.

I love the art design and mechanics in this game, and conceptually it is something I'd love to see more of. There are designs for enemies and weapons seen in development footage that I really wish we could have seen in the full release, but who knows if maybe we'd see it in the future.

--STORY AND CHARACTERS--

The story of Atomic Heart is a somewhat generic yet still pleasing one. At least in concept.

Throughout my entire playthrough which I'd streamed, taking roughly 16-17 hours total, the story felt extremely fragmented and boring. Typically, I'm one to attempt reading and listening to all the different bits of lore in story games. In this case, however, many of these audio logs and journal entries did not relate to the main story, and if they did, it was delivered in a way that felt very flat and was only there to pad time for people who want the achievements for finding all the lore bits. Most of them were random characters who were likely there to help with world building, but ultimately detract from the world as a whole. I found myself skimming these lore bits at best, skipping them at worst. At many points, dialogue from the characters would overlap or even cut off the audio logs and vice versa. Whether it be an audio log or dialogue between our main characters, there was a good chance it could get cut off and you'd then be completely lost.

The side characters ultimately are just that. They are cast off to the side, never feeling very interesting and instead just serving their purposes to the plot. After that, they aren't worthy of a second thought. Aside from the main characters and the twist villains, every other character can be forgotten about.

The main plot that drives the character is not particularly unique and has very poor execution. Slight spoiler warning, but 90% of the game has the goals of the player obscured and left unclear as part of setting up not one, but two different plot twists that it rams into the final half hour of the game. Additionally, the payoff for either of the endings left me very unsatisfied, leaving the last couple dozen hours of gameplay feeling like a waste. The game, in my opinion, would have been infinitely better had the main character been mute and most of the interaction instead coming from the side character that we spend the entire game with. The reality of the game, however, is that we are stuck with a poorly written antihero that makes it very difficult for the player to become invested in their story. The story would have also likely benefited from having more focused and clearly defined goals, instead of going from one government facility to another chasing one McGuffin after another for reasons that only the higher powers get to know about.

--OVERALL THOUGHTS--

It really pains me that my overall experience with the game came out as negative, because Atomic Heart was a game that I really wanted to enjoy. I was one of the many people hooked by the intriguing concepts and designs teased over the years by Mundfish, and I wanted to see a story that would be as compelling as its style. Unfortunately, I'm not someone who can enjoy a story-driven singleplayer game just for its style and mechanics. Moreover, I can't ignore a story that I previously wanted to enjoy but just ended up infuriating me throughout, especially at the end. When it delivered two consecutive twist villains that did not feel earned in the final thirty minutes of the game, I'd finally decided that this was not a game I enjoyed.",1678950506,1678950506,False,3,0,0.512953341007232666,0,True,False,False

3) Puzzles are interesting, at times tricky.
4) Story is good, though nothing is really hidden. So if you listen/read thorough enough you won't be very surprised in the ending.
Questionable:
1) For me battle system was fun, but I am filthy casul in FPS, so it might be boring for someone else.
2) Crafting is ok, but do not expect something special
What I disliked:
1) Bugs and bugged achievements (still don't have all of them). Some of bugs are already fixed, some will be fixed when the person reading this review will get the game. I didn't got a gamebreaking experience, but sometimes it was irritating.
2) Well, platforming does not feel fun, I'd say clunky. From what I understand, the developers tried to make it in 'realistic' way, so do not expect jumping and rolling for more than 1-2 meters.

i didnt understand the reason for the training grounds, or how to get inside of them, so i went straight to the main story, and missed all of the open world exploring and collecting blueprints for weapons. so that meant, i was constantly struggling to find enough supplies to have ammo to kill enemies.

I didnt like  that i had the shotgun, traded it in so i could make another weapon, and then was unable to make the shotgun again. apparently trading it in, you lose the blueprints to make it. i think thats a glitch the devs should fix. 

i dont like that you cant set a pin on a map to follow. you basically had to look at the map, and hope you head in the right direction. 

many times i would try to jump up things and get stuck. thankfullly i saved my progress all the time, so restarting wasnt too painful.

this is a great game, i just hope they add some fixes to things. 

the soundtrack is great. i love that they have puzzles in the game to mix up the slash and shoot aspects.

There is an alert system that sends robots after you if you are spotted too many times by the cameras so you think to yourself I will shoot the cameras but the issue is that there are legions of repair bots that go around and fix those cameras and you usually get 10 seconds before they show up and fully repair the camera.
So you think to yourself ok just shoot the repairs bots. Those repair bots are infinite and never stop spawning and they usually come with a bot that has camera on it that will patrol and try and spot you.
Then you say ok i'll stealth around and try and stealth kill the combat robots that are in the way of your exploration. 
Well the combat robots are very fast and you crouch walk very slowly and they also have a habit of turning around at the last second or just hitting you after you do the QTE kill.
Then even if you kill the combat robots remember those repair bots?, yeah they come in repair the enemies you just killed infinitely. 
So you have game that then either forces you to speed run the open world sections and avoid everything or you constantly waste all your ammo and resources just going around and temporarily blowing up the robots before they all re spawn in under 30 seconds.
But there is a way to turn them all off by turning off the robot hub and that's great because then you could take your time to explore, enjoy the background storytelling, maybe do some side quests and just do things at your own pace. 
Actually that hub shutdown lasts maybe 5 minutes at the most sometimes a little longer if you are lucky so you have speed run around still but now it is because you have a countdown until robots come back again.

Motion sickness, with movement-based combat encouraging that, so buyer-beware. Definitely controller.

Slow story that seems very straightforward. Main character has such an angry/aggressive personality right off the bat. The first buy station interaction shows a theme, and first few NPCs match it. 

Loot system - having to hold scan for 3-seconds to locate loot, then the loot button having a slight delay with the animation breaking every 5-seconds, and then repeating that loop to progress gear-wise is a task.

Medium difficulty, the main barrier to progressing is just time with the highest starting difficulty seeming to only increase that (because death) without any reward. Damage to enemies seems consistent between difficulties, and the 2-starting weapons (minorly upgraded) don't really help time wise. Combat loop seemed dull and processed in the brain more like ""another enemy...""

Stealth option does not seem viable since it's about a 10-second minigame + animation, with patrolling enemies so you really gotta try to make it work. (worth noting that of the my two stealth kills, 1 of those attempts bugged out and made me repeat the minigame)

Fantastic futuristic '50s aesthetic turned chaos, but first 2-hours of real gameplay were just copy-pasted mannequin enemies (with 1-2 slightly different elite mannequins) inside a dark concrete office building. From the pics/videos, seems to diversify but I'm not interested in seeing another one of those mannequins.

Lots of upgrade systems and different loot types available at the start so it's overwhelming, but if that's your thing then ayyyy game's worth a try. Weapon crafting/upgrading seems fully reversible so you can play with what fits your style once you get the blueprints.

Final thoughts: I can see it being some persons' thing for those that like the grind and gameplay loop, but not my thing. Tbh I now just have an irrational fear of sentient buy stations, and that's my main takeaway.",1678847705,1678847705,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most becomes prevalent during the first boss or during hectic fights against multiple enemies, where if you're familiar with souls gameplay the same instincts might kick in. Purely from a gameplay perspective, I'd say this is my second favorite game of it's kind, behind Ultrakill. I miss titanfall. Anyways, storywise and themes, I liked it, and the unease and light horror were done really well to not feel like jumpscares because I saw them coming, but they were very unnerving. I am a sucker for happy endings that fit my personal tastes so I would prefer that to the ones we got, but that may just be culture clash. Unlikely, but possible. Feels more likely there's something else in the works, not DLC or a sequel. Just something.
Only real complaint is like, fuck the uh, what was it called? The walking bundle of flesh and nerves that moved around like Vicar Amelia mixed with Stretch Armstrong. Hated fighting that thing, and not because of the five times I fought it three of them were cheesed/glitched and avoided. Oh and driving is a little akward.

The environment and music are both top notch.  The music that plays at upgrade stations is top notch background music.  Listening to it right now while writing the review.  Each area has its own character that makes it unique.  The atmosphere is top tier. 

The voice acting can be both great and awful at times.  There's timing issues for voice lines, so every now and then a conversation that shouldn't have a pause just has this awkward silence while the animations or voice lines load in.  Weird, but not that a deal breaker.  What  is a deal breaker is that some of the voice lines just feel... off.  Like someone was just reading from a page in class and not trying to do any voice acting.  

Enemies are fun at first, then get extremely repetitive.  This game took the ""just change how they look"" approach to create new enemy types when it comes to adds.  When they ran out of variants of base enemies they just throw more at you to make it feel fresh.  It is what it is.  The bosses and mini bosses are awesome, so it makes up for it.  

Controls can be a bit annoying.  I'm sure I could have remapped them, but I didn't so its kind of on me.  You have an ""inspect"" ability that is assigned to L-alt, healing is assigned to X.  I've accidentally wasted an ungodly amount of healing items trying to ""inspect"" something.  Character movement is pretty good, plays like a typical FPS with a dodge mechanic most of the time.  There are parkour/climbing aspects of the game that are just... janky a lot of the time.  

What I absolutely do not like are the puzzle trial areas you have to enter to get upgrades for the weapons.  I'm not a fan of puzzle or platformer games, and the puzzle trial areas are just chock full of them.  Climb this to go get access to that, then use janky parkour to get access here type of BS.  The puzzles are never too difficult, but janky parkour makes them a nightmare most of the time.  I wish there was an option to either fight your way through waves of enemies, or go through jank parkour to get the upgrades, but no such luck here. 

The story is solid, leads you to one conclusion then to another different conclusion.  If you're a huge fan of bioshock style of story telling, you'll like this game.

I would recommend this game, not that it's flawless, but for me the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones.

First the pro's:

-It's a very impressive  and unique universe with stunning visuals; 
 -Nice weaponry and upgrades;
 -Even nicer abilities (mass telekinesis!) : btw, do use ""polymeric jet"" (it looks rather inoffensive, but it's very useful !)
-There are quite a lot of  manual savepoints 
-Often funny (conversations with perv Nora)


Then the con's:

Some  very annoying bugs:
 -The forward key for driving the car doesn't work, no matter how you remap it  (so I never used it)
-The number-keys in dialogues don't work; you have to switch to an English keyboard to make them work (when I mentioned it to Mundfish, they never replied)
-I couldn't pick up the recordings for Zylatova (I had to reload the game)
-Some unbeatable Sprout on the bridge in ""Cross the bridge""( so I avoided it)


-Way too much chitchat between P3 and Charles, and other npc's

-Way too many , often extremely irritating and time consuming puzzles: doorlock's(OMG, Grrr) , never -ending- moving -platform-episode, some puzzles far fetched (snake-game, maze-game..)

There are also some cut content it seems, looking back at some of the teaser, there are things i am looking forward to that isn't in the game, again, i am dissapointed.

However, the gameplay is fun as hell, i enjoyed all the mechanic they are offering in this game (The looting system is convenient, probably one of the best i've seen in video game). The material to craft is also not too scarce, and not too frequent, it's just balanced.

Also don't play the game on the hardest difficulty like me, as the enemy can be REALLY BULLET SPONGE as hell. I think the best difficulty to enjoy this game would be Normal.

Also, the music's are absolute banger, they really didn't have to go that hard over the music in [spoiler] Hedgie fight and Pavlov Complex [/spoiler] but they did.

So overall, the game is worth enough to buy, maybe on sale, but me personally on full price. Aside all the cons in this game, the pros surely can cover them up.

I loved the graphics. I'm a sucker for retro futuristic stuff and eastern european history, so much to the point I've learned some Russian and have been to the eastern bloc. This game is right up my alley. As far as style goes, this is a 10/10

The gameplay is quite enjoyable but there is a clunky thing. When starting the game I would dash into boxes or furniture and get stuck and killed, so the combat feels a bit ""sticky"" if that makes sense. Outside of that, I actually used all my skills and was motivated to upgrade my weapons and glove. The game sort of changes ""gameplay modes"" throughout the game. It starts off like a bioshock corridor shooter and I thought that was the entire game and still felt like it could've been great, but then the game gets bigger. I got to the first open area and just... had a learning curve. No spoilers, but once you get off the train you might possibly hit a wall like I did where you just don't quite know why you're being attacked nonstop. I REALLY dislike the respawning of enemies in the open world. Oh yeah, the next gameplay feel has an open world meant for exploring, and you always slink around and watch for cameras otherwise the alarm will be set off and you're gonna get destroyed. This puts a hamper on the exploration of the open game world. So, thats not a big deal because you can shut down all hostility in an area for 15 minutes, so you gotta find a camera station, find the right camera, then open a door, and boom you can turn off hostility. See? Thats a lot of steps just to comfortably explore and thats the wall I'm talking about. Once you know how that works, my initial complaint with respawning enemies goes away but still, thats just frustrating when you don't know how to stop them from coming as the game doesn't really reinforce your knowledge on how to stop enemies in the open world. 

The audio is 10/10, I've listened to the soundtrack nonstop

I felt the ending was a bit short, it lasted less than 30 seconds but whatever, I almost prefer that now at this point now that I'm an adult with not as much time for games. Gimme the jist of things, I don't need a metal gear solid epic saga to tell me someone dies and sorrow a character feels. So yeah, I liked that. The story in itself was a bit convoluted at first but towards the end of the game they remind you of who is who and it is easy to keep up with all the different characters you have interacted with.

THE GAMEPLAY: The combat feels good. Shooting enemies feels good, using the couple abilities I found most fun felt good, and upgrading felt like it made a difference. The dungeons/non open-world segments I enjoyed every second of despite on occasion getting stuck on geometry and a couple of game crashes. The boss fights were a blast as well, not counting the final one. The open-world segments however, I found to be a chore and an annoyance. Go to this device, access a map that's a pain to operate so you can hunt for a specific camera to open a door so you can bum rush past enemies just to get to that door, and either shut them all down for about 5 minutes or climb onto a balloon to access specific areas. ""Well can't you just kill the enemies?"" Yes, but when you do kill one the infinitely spawning repair bots will arrive to start repairing the ones you've killed right away. ""Do I get more loot if I have to kill an enemy again after already looting them, to more easily recover ammo?"" No. ""Okay, well can I stealth past them?"" No. You can sneak, but the system for it is poor and you're likely to enter combat. The whole song and dance regarding the open world areas was the entire reason I only have 25 hours in the game and not more. I would have happily gotten all achievements if it weren't for that drudgery, but the pain of it all steered me away from accessing the optional areas that give you the cooler weapon upgrades. The unfun kept me from more fun, because the disparity between the two made it not seem worth it.

THE STORY: For 90% of the game, the story is why I kept playing. There's a lot of mystery, and I was really interested in it all. At the end when everything was being revealed, I only kept playing because I knew I was about to beat the game. The reveal is a huge disappointment, and they splurge a ton of exposition on you at the end of the game to clear up all of the smaller mysterious story points. Much of the mystery turns out to be a mystery just for the sake of it being mysterious. So much information is being withheld from the main character for seemingly no reason, and it's just.... dumb. On top of that, there are multiple endings which can be boiled down to 'fight the final boss' and 'don't fight the final boss'. The final boss, following suit of the story, being a massive disappointment. 

THE MUSIC: Part of why I bought this is because I mistakenly believed the whole thing was composed by Mick Gordon. It was not. One song was, and it slaps harder than your mama when she finds out you didn't put the chicken out to thaw. The rest was okay, with a couple bangers. One of the songs I'm pretty sure is from the movie ""Annihilation"", but for the purposes they used it for it fit well.

The first mission is so tedious that the main character makes fun of it for the rest of the game, which feels like they got bad feedback in play testing and instead oh changing anything they just make quips about it, which somewhat summarized the game. 

Other things that don't fit together - to see an enemies weakness it needs to be scanned which takes a good 5 seconds. Most bosses can't be scanned before entering the arena and then are ultra aggresive leaving 0 time to scan.

The weakness is a visual that makes no sense, I've searched on google for a legend but it's all posts of other people who can't understand what the symbols mean. 

The parkour/assassins creed parts are so ridiculously bad that it's almost all limited to optional puzzle challenges, mainly because the difficult piece is fighting the physics engine. At least one puzzle is based around getting the character to do something easy, but the engine only accepts it if it's at just the right angle. Feels like something play testers ripped to shred and instead of fixing it, they stuck made it optional content.

It's as if the creators of Atomic Heart played the Bioshock games, particularly Bioshock Infinite, and wanted to make a soviet counterpart, replacing the American exceptionalism of Bioshock Infinite with communist doctrine. Except they failed to realize that the American exceptionalism backdrop of Bioshock Infinite was placed there as a dystopian mockery of the idea, not as praise.  As such, since they missed that, the Atomic Heart story praises communist principles and ideals over and over, without offering any true criticisms. Sure, the specific version of  ""Kollektiv"" (to which you will be introduced in the game) is bad and corrupt, brought about by one or two corrupt individuals, but never is there any real critique of communism in general. Only praise. Praise, over and over and over.

As a matter of fact, the whole storyline of Atomic Heart is lacking; it's disjointed and not at all compelling. The protagonist is *deeply* unlikable. 

There are some good things about the game though. First, there's a lot of game. It took me on the order of ~50 hours to play it (that's several times the play-length of Bioshock Infinite). Of course, I'm the type of gamer who takes my time and likes to explore everywhere, basking in the scenery. And Atomic Heart has some wonderful and wacky scenery. There are both linear progression sections as well as wide, open world sections. The ecosystem of open world sections is actually pretty intricate and fairly enjoyable (e.g., finding a camera control station, opening doors by monitoring the correct camera, temporarily disabling all the robots in a given area, only after entering the correct building with the now-open door, etc.)

There are some pretty fun puzzles in the game in what are called ""proving grounds,"" offering loot in the form of materials and blueprints allowing you to upgrade your weapons. One of the funnest parts of the game are figuring out how to even enter any given proving ground. These are sometimes just as challenging as the puzzles themselves. 

There are many homages and tributes to other video games and stories. A few examples include the Bioshock series, obviously (floating cities and a not-so-obscure reference to ""Rapture""), Half-Life (mention of a silent protagonist in a hazard suit), Doom (iddqd and idkfa), and maybe even Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide series (""Thanks for all the fish."") I'm sure there are more that I've missed.

The combat mechanics are not bad -- not particularly great, but not bad either. The ability to spray enemies with ""Polymeric Jet,"" enhancing the effect of freezing or shocking them, is pretty novel. The weapons are nicely varied and configurable to suit different playstyles. 

I say the combat is ""not bad"", but frequently it is spoiled -- or shall I say, ruined -- by quick time events (where you have to press or mash some random key within a time limit). Atomic Heart does this frequently in boss fights. Look, if you're a game developer and you're reading this, and you are considering putting quick time events into your first person shooter's combat mechanics, stop. Just stop it. If your first person shooter's combat mechanics rely on quick time events, the game's combat immersion has already failed. You have failed. Stop it. Now.   

There is no penalty for tearing down one weapon to use the resources to upgrade another weapon, which is really nice. I wish more games did this. There's limited inventory space, but you can chose what you carry with you; there's no limitation on the number of guns you carry, so long as they fit in your inventory. Since health and ammo are also inventory items, this creates strategical tradoffs that the player needs to consider on what to carry with them. 

The music is sometimes fabulous. That should come as no surprise, since Mick Gordon was listed as composer/sound designer for the game. I say ""sometimes,"" because the music is often hit or miss. But for those times when it's good, it's really, really good. 

In summary, there's a lot of good, but there's also some bad. 7 out of 10.",1678756723,1678762322,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Atomic Heart is a solid FPS game with Bioshock vibes and influence. Game itself is rarity these days too since it is full from start to end. World is the best thing in it. It is simply enchanting and amazing. Build from scratch without cheap assests.
Gameplay is fun exept for some choke points that are overwhelemed with enemies for no real reason. Music is top notch and same goes for voice acting. I relaize that some might not like it. But I find it hitting the spot. Puzzles and polygons are also one of the best thing in the game. They bring back memeories of old school games that have such stuff.

[tr]
[td]
- Highly satisfying gunplay and melee combat: both have realistic handling, good weight behind hits and solid feedback from hits taken by both enemies and yourself.

- Compelling exploration that rewards meticulous looting and going off the beaten path. Many Easter eggs, secrets and optional areas are scattered throughout.

- Exceptional visuals / art direction that feature meticulously-designed environments consistently, despite the world’s large scale and high location density.

- Good variety of gameplay that alternates exploration, puzzle-solving, combat and story-related content (lore etc.), so that none of them become repetitive.

- Excellent optimization for the graphics it delivers. I managed to run maxed settings, constant 60 FPS on a four-years-old machine in 1440p.

- Dommy robo mommy.
[/td]
[td]
- Underwhelming, predictable story that uses way too many stale tropes, alongside a cringeworthy, unremarkable, one-sided protagonist.

- Difficulty curve becomes too forgiving after early game due to high power creep of weapons, abilities and passive perks compared to the threats you’ll encounter.

- Even if weapons and abilities are well-diversified, only a few of them truly prove to be ‘the best’, leaving many others as redundant or simply worse alternatives.

- The stealth system is a gimmick that you’ll never use at any point; it doesn’t reward you in any way for taking this difficult approach, and has no ‘raison d'être’.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
In an alternate timeline, the USSR has become a technological powerhouse after WW2, with breakthroughs in fields such as nanotechnology, AI and energy manipulation that far surpass those of our present-day world. Affirming itself as the leading world power, it builds the utopian symbol-city of Chelomey, and nears the launch of Kollektiv 2.0, a worldwide neural network merging man and machine to an unprecedented degree. Agent P-3, the protagonist, attends the ceremony, but things take a horribly wrong turn.

The narrative shines the most in its indirect form, through the visual clues and remains from events transpired before, while it proves mediocre in both lore files, dialogues and cutscenes. The worst offender is your musclehead alter-ego, which not only has the intellectual capacity of a broken treadmill, but is also a ceaseless discharge of cringe, with puns and lines that make Leon from RE4 seem like Socrates. The events are predictable, moral dilemmas get sidetracked, and the classic rushed exposition dump near the end comes as the last nail in this atomic coffin.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
The world is divided between linear and open-world areas, the latter becoming available only several hours later. The sprawl of facilities, complexes and residential areas comprising the freely roamed, although a few may be inaccessible until a specific story point is reached. In both instances, minutely exploring with the aid of your Scanner tool to highlight loot and other important things, will be paramount to accumulate crafting supplies, blueprints and useful consumables, while also discovering files and secret areas from time to time. 

It’s satisfying and enjoyable to traverse the world by foot or car - no fast travel so make sure you search accurately. Save points are placed regularly, allowing you to use them unlimited times. The main difference between closed and open-world areas is the enemy presence, much more massive outside, featuring reinforcements and an alarm level system, although your foes can be temporarily disabled by destroying a certain facility.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
With firearms, improvised melee tools and polymer-based powers at his disposal, P-3 is a living arsenal. Your limited, upgradable inventory can hold a generous amount of ammo, weapons and consumables to keep you alive in a fight, while powers and abilities only have cooldowns, no other resource than time is required. Energy is used instead to power certain weapons, and is gained passively, with consumables or by striking foes in melee. A dodge system allows you to avoid melee and ranged hits, while defensive upgrades and medkits do the rest. 

Enemies range from simple humanoid bots to mechanical horrors with many weapons and moves, and dangerous mutants worthy of STALKER’s Zone. Mini and proper bosses are uncommon sights, giving you fights that won’t prove too tough especially later on, due to your arsenal becoming way too powerful, same for your skills, granting you simply too many advantages for these fights to be as ‘epic’ as they should be. Unless you get caught in an insta-kill QTE - those are crap.

[h3]Character Progression & Crafting System[/h3]
AI-powered fridges, sometimes considerably more horny than expected, will be at your service to craft all sorts of consumables, ammo and upgrade both your weapons and P-3’s abilities -provided you have the needed materials, blueprints and XP, all looted from the world and enemies. These upgrades will add secondary fire modes to guns, improve their stats, specialize them to damage other robots or organics, and upgrade all of your abilities to be stronger, faster, and last longer.

In general, provided you loot thoroughly, you will never run out of anything and be in far excess of materials to make all the ammo, health kits and other stuff you may need. It has to be noted that scrapping weapons or abilities returns 100% of their materials, so that you can try different ones and spice up the gameplay, a good choice that however hinders the replay value, since you can “have it all” in the same playthrough this way.

[h3]Puzzles & Optional Content[/h3]
Both linear and open sections feature a generous quantity of puzzles, that range from logic-based locks, to timing sequences, beam redirections, and more than a few unique ones with their own mechanics. None of them is very complex, and they’re accessible even to those who aren’t familiar with the puzzle genre. Testing Grounds (dungeons) are the main secondary content, awarding unique upgrades for weapons and requiring some extra effort to unlock.",1678738460,1678739195,True,2160,36,0.94003218412399292,52,True,False,False

— I totally do.
It's not just balerinas and robots.
I loved the story.
The main characters are expressive and deep.
The world is interesting and surprising.
The puzzle aspect is something I totally adore.
The music. Yes, please, more, more!

I'd like to say that the original voices are awesome but... I just can't. Wouldn't be true. I guess it's the only major flaw for me. Played in English, and I absolutely love the voice of the protagonist... Charles, too, of course.
And the voices on the tapes, especially where people get angry are so much brighter in English version than they are in Russian. ohh. 

Gameplay was also very immersive.
I showed the beginning of the game to my mother who lived in the USSR and she said it was quite a natural replica of the world back then. I kinda felt it, too. We haven't seen a lot of products from our motherland before, and AH was a big step forward to such universes.

I think the upgrade system and weapons variety were quite cool and balance. I'd really like to see more of it in future.
Those... ""plasmids"" or how you call them... gave a cool ability to try different playstyles.

The game still needs bugfixing though, and several QOL improvements would be great (especially for the Map and Inventory) but it did not really affect my impressions of the game.
It's smoothly optimized and is ready for completion c:

That's not to say it's a bad game, I enjoyed playing it even if the most fun I had was when I stopped taking it seriously.  Visually, stylistically, I loved it; the style is what got me interested in the game to begin with.  Mechanically, I don't have many complaints.  The combat was fun and the movement never really got boring—save for the climbing sections.  I got tired of the looting almost immediately, however.  Every weapon upgrade requires loot, either from killing enemies or looting boxes and drawers and cabinets and desks, and while the process is simple, it feels like I spent a third of my time staring at desks.  

The plot is where all of my complaints really come from.  It feels like the plot doesn't start until halfway through the game, so it feels rushed and not very well put together.  The plot isn't BAD, really, I actually found myself interested somewhere between the disappointment of the game's beginning and the disappointment of the game's end, but it isn't a sound narrative.  It often felt like I was missing details, or that the player character had LESS knowledge of the world than I did, which most times was followed up by the game outright TELLING you what the plot was doing.  Take all that and add an ending that had little to no reasonable, logical buildup or foreshadowing and what you get is a disappointing conclusion that doesn't feel good.  There is no way to finish the game in a way that feels like a good, fitting conclusion to the game. 

Tl;dr  The beginning and end of the game are disappointing, and the plot feels like an afterthought, but it is a visually interesting game.  If you want hot robots and enjoyable combat, it's a decent enough game for that, but if you want an interesting story, I wouldn't spend the money.

I like some of the music. I will not compare it to other games, cause it takes so much from other games and still failed to make it exciting or fun. The sound mixing is so bad I had to configure it a lot during cutscenes and while combat was happening even towards endgame.

For starters the game looks great, it's built in Unreal Engine 4 and it shows. It's not the most beautiful game ever but it looks every bit the part of a 2023 game and just as importantly it runs great. I played it maxed at 1440p on an i9/3080/32gb and it ran at a nice high FPS way above 60 throughout most of the game. The most recent major patch, which was applied 3/10/23, seems to have caused some minor occasional hitching for me as I did my final play session to completion here yesterday, especially in the overworld. Not a huge deal but thought I'd mention it.

Game has an excellent, excellent soundtrack. Some real bangers in here, but the game doesn't utilize them all that intelligently sometimes. There are some really excellent tracks that only get used for a single fight, and there is little to no combat music for the first 1/3ish of the game which is an odd choice. Overall though it's great, and the in between atmospherics are excellent with tons of environmental noises. In the overworld you can hear the booming and whining of all the crazy technology in the facility, and while inside underground facilities and similar you can hear the banging of pipes and machines and all sorts of other atmospherics. Sound design is mostly excellent like the graphics.

Gameplay wise, the game is mostly great but suffers from pacing issues. Combat doesn't really start to come together into something great until about halfway through the game, early on it's just not that fun battling mustache bots with an axe and pistol. However by the end of the game with a full weapon and power loadout of heavily upgraded gear you're a walking machine of destruction and it's a lot of fun. The fully upgraded shotgun and pashtet are absolutely nuts when paired with cryonics and telekinesis. Fights that would have been a massive struggle early on turn into joyous bouts of epic destruction. Crafting is simple but gets the job done, and looting is great - your glove sucks stuff in from a reasonable distance and anything that can't fit in your bag is auto routed to your storage box. It's also worth noting that the game has pretty decent enemy variety, but you guessed it, it takes too long to present them. Ever present the pacing issues, it just kinda permeates the first half of the game - it's not bad by any means early on, but it's not until you leave the VDNH facility or a bit after, which is a solid 8-10 hours into the game, do things really start to click and does the games combat begin to elevate from ""acceptable/OK"" to ""really damn good"".

Much was made of Atomic Hearts open world prior to release, and while the game does have an open world, it's IMO there more in service to the story and atmosphere than the gameplay. It's really there to provide an emphasis to the size of the facility and demonstrate the feel of the world they created in between major setpiece locations more so than a massive thing meant to be explored extensively. The only real ""extra"" content present in the open world besides basic scrap loot is the ""Testing Grounds"" which are big underground complexes of mostly large roomscale puzzles that grant the player with lots of extra scrap for crafting and most importantly blueprints for weapon upgrades. They are optional but collectively they only add about 3-4 hours to the game (there are only 8 of them) and are mostly fun to do, so just go ahead and do them. The later ones also add a good bit of story exposition that fleshes some stuff out and answers some questions the player might have.

The story and characters are a mixed bag, but it's really going to depend on the individual player as to how they asses this. The main character, P3, is kind of annoying. He becomes slightly less annoying as the game goes on, and actually even has brief moments of thoughtfulness and endearment later in the game....but he never elevates to anything more than just kinda there. He didn't bother me but he might bother some, just depends. Charles on the other hand starts as just OK and becomes an excellent character as the game progresses and has a lot of great dialogue later on in the game as him and P3 start to soften up to each other, and he eventually becomes a core part of everything that is happening and acts as a very central piece of the game. I don't want to spoil anything, but Charles is great and will say a lot of stuff in later parts of the game that are genuinely thoughtful and chilling/sobering discussions on the role of governments and masters and power dynamics and the human condition and AI and robotics and all sorts of forward thinking subjects that go quite a bit beyond the average game. There is a reason for this as you'll learn, but again, no spoilers, so just know that Charles isn't just a fun AI sidekick. His presence eventually begins to elevate the entire story and game and that is appreciated because the game's story takes way too long to get truly rolling - again, pacing issues, and P3 alone could not have carried the burden of making the story evocative at all. It's also worth mentioning that there are some brief moments where I think the translation was not so perfect, although they are few and far enough in between not to interfere too much and they seem mostly to occur in the first half.

The story itself is good, but I can't really explain why without spoiling important elements and plot twists. Those ever present pacing issues dampen the story at first but as you begin to learn more, and realize things are NOT what they seem you'll start to get hooked. The final act of the game especially, the final 4-5 hours, are incredibly intriguing as the situation begins to escalate and go far beyond the scope it's initially presented with. It's one of those stories where ""once you know you know"" - you can only truly enjoy the story once, so try and appreciate it while it's happening because if you ever want to play it again it will be with an entirely different lens. The ending is....uh....something; it isn't unsatisfying, it isn't particularly overly satisfying either. It's just kinda sudden and shocking. It's not as if the game doesn't answer your questions necessarily, it mostly does, but it's just....I dunno haha you just have to experience it I guess. Like I said you can only truly experience the story once. 

Overall I really enjoyed my time with Atomic Heart, and I really really enjoyed my time with the final 1/3 of the game in particular. It's not perfect but for a freshman effort it's great - you can tell a lot of love was poured into this project. It's a great game that a lot of gamers will really appreciate, but for all of its charms you can't help but also point at the flaws even if they don't drag the whole experience down too much.

The game runs well, looks great and is at least mildly interesting.

The game design is quite bad though - gigantic empty rooms with no real purpose to them, inconsistent storytelling and an incredibly annoying voice over (even in Russian). Fetch quests so bad that even the fetch quests have fetch quests built into them.
The genius idea to put the player into an underground bunker for the first 4 hours of the game kills most of the desire to carry on, so that by the time you come out to the great-looking outdoors, you've just about had enough of the game. 
The guns are a mess concealed behind a pointlessly overcomplicated crafting system. Why is there a crafting system? Why is there a pretence of inventory management? Why is there a pretence of elemental damage system, when everything is a robot? If they took a scalpel to the game's systems and cut about two thirds of it away - it would have made for a better experience.
I also get inexplicable motion sickness, even despite them adding an FOV slider (thank you though!). Could be because the character bobs during motion...

-I will say this games optimization is phenomenal, and graphics will literately stop me in my tracks and look at the environment. Every detail is amazing.

Problems, come from the pacing and the story. First, off some sections are far too long while others are really short and sweet. Second, it feels like the game is too vague, without spoiling anything, the game ends with more questions then it answered. It is possible that it is lining up a sequel, but I don't see how. The story is very strange, at some points it is really cookie cutter, while other times it is really crazy and unique. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting, the ending left me feeling like, ""is that it?"" which I never liked from games. But other than that, it was really fun.

Exploration is fine and doesn't offend. Gameplay is the highlight. Other than 1 boss who was nothing more than a bullet sponge, all bosses were fun and unique, all areas fun and had cool details and backgrounds to them. Gunplay is smooth and flashy, there can be too much going on sometimes but overall it wasn't bad. The abilities were fine, but I wish they were a bit more powerful and there were more. I liked the characters they were all likable, I wish they did more with some of the side characters, but I can understand why they didn't.

Writing goes either way. You either find it fine and acceptable, or you will find the main character not very likable bordering on annoying. There were some times that I found the writing really damn funny, which was nice to see.

EDIT: 

While my original opinion stands, after spending some more time with Atomic Heart, I've grown to (somewhat) enjoy the experience. There are still design decisions that hurt the game, such as:

- Puzzle locks you cannot skip
- Clunky movement and melee combat system
- Questionable dialogue and voice acting (a lot of it)
- Open world that encourages you to run through as quickly as possible instead of exploring the map, lest you expend literally all of your ammunition/resources

[b] Плюсы [/b]

В игру было весело играть. Неплохая боевка, которую можно комбинировать со способностями, отличный саундтрек (правда, я так и не понял, где композиции Мика Гордона). Сюжет простой, и подается странно - но интересный. Свой кайф от него я получил.[spoiler]С ХРАЗом конечно подстава, я привязался к нему. К концу игры и его и П-3 хорошо раскрыли как персонажей.[/spoiler] Графоний не хватает звезд с неба, но приятный глазу. Играл на Атомных настройках, в QHD. Сам геймплей нельзя назвать шедевром - но в целом тоже довольно неплохо. Подземные локации исследовать было интересно, Визуальный стиль, проработка лора игры и мира в целом - шикарны. Все наполнено мелкими деталями и кучей отсылок.
Бои с боссами кстати тоже очень неплохо сделаны.[spoiler]Только Роса и Близняшки меня поддушишли и вызвали небольшие проблемы в виде нехватки хилок.[/spoiler] Играл на максимальном уровне. 

[b] Минусы [/b]

- Открытый мир - он странный. Сражаться с роботами в нем - бесполезно. Особенно на волнах. Потратишь больше ресурсов чем получишь. Там, где нет поселений - в открытом мире нет вообще ничего. И это печально. Осознав это, я просто пробегал его между точками, ничего не исследуя.
- Управление транспортом. К нему надо привыкнуть. Мне оно показалось немного деревянным.
- Баги с достижениями. Не все работает корректно. Иногда они не засчитывались.
Ну и были еще мелкие недоработки, думаю поправят патчами 

[h1] Итог [/h1]
 Игра - очень хорошая. Я буду ждать DLC, буду в числе первых, кто купит предзаказ сиквела (если он будет)
Игру делали с любовь и душой. Да, есть недочеты, есть ошибки, но они были и есть у всех. Но очень немногие студии вкладывают любовь и душу в разработку AAA-игр. Потому я не капли не жалею ни денег потраченных на нее, ни времени. И обязательно вернусь в этот мир - позже.

The open world aspect seems forced, there's a whole lot to like, but there's a distance to go between those things and it just feels like the majority of the time i'm trying to get to the next place to advance the story or get an upgrade and there's just no interest for me between that game-play loop, or the gameplay itself....

I want to say straight out it isn't a bad game in any aspect, there actually is a lot of redeeming qualities it has, i waited with anticipation for it since it was first announced. Its just the gap in between the meaningful parts of the game that has put me off of it, for example, go from A, to B slug it out with the same bots, fight them the same way then collect an item with no story telling value unless its a part of the main quest. I struggled to enjoy the game after i got to the free roam section of the map as it feels like there is too great a pause between the meaningful events in the game and everything is just a collect fest where you just get items too upgrade, but even that felt like a chore. I really, really wanted to like this game, but the 80 bucks i spent i could have brought multiple other games and had more fun, in fact i haven't actually ""wanted"" to play this game again since i last played it which was about a week from ago from this post.

Now, thats a bit unfair, so let me explain. 

Visual design of the game - world design, graphics, animations, enemies etc - is fantastic. Its gorgeous, has a fitting style to it, and looks great. You have an interesting variety of weapons and special abilities aka bioshock, and i quite enjoyed the back-and-forth main character has with his glove sidekick.

The problem is the level and gameplay loop. Having spent almost 5 hours doing exact same thing with exact same weapons against exact same enemies over and over, and constantly having to ""stop"" the fun loop of killing stuff to solve silly and simple puzzles, fetch quests and going back and forth to collect things, press buttons then collect more things, it becomes annoying. The main character constantly breaks fourth wall to talk about how annoying all these fetch quests are - cool, so why are they in the game, in such amount?

""Oh, you need to go to the Cafe? Well door is locked and you need to collect 5 keys from areas around you. So you spend 2 hours collecting the keys, open the door, turns out the train to cafe is broken so now you have to collect 5 batteries from areas around you"". You spend more time doing ""fetch quests"" than actual story.

But that's all still fine until you reach ""open world"" area. Thats when you realise that the game design is just annoying. Not hard, not challenging, not difficult - annoying is the word. You are surrounded by robots, who keep respawning, who keep summoning more reinforcements, and who keep repairing each other. Your best bet, in this ""open world"", is to play stealth and hide. It would be fine if it was just one segment, but entire open world section is designed to make you stealth around. In a first person shooter game. Who's bright idea was this?

In the end, i found myself losing interest, and once i reached the point where game told me to use its terrible map to find some ""Optional testing sites"" i realised i actually had no desire to continue, and stopped. 

A shame because it had a very strong start. It just... fumbled and fell face first into dirt shortly afterward. It desperately tries to be Bioshock, Prey and Deus Ex, but succeeds at being neither.",1678617188,1678618729,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you are fine with a few super annoying bugs and don't need accessibility, buy it. Otherwise wait a bit until these issues are resolved.

Pros:
-- This game has a unique old/futurism/steampunk vibe which makes the experience super fun. Love all the customization and options plus the ability to respect and recycle resources 1:1.
-- Combat is hard and rewarding. I'm playing on the Armageddon difficulty and it's a challenge!
-- Scenery is beautiful.


Issues:

1. Bugs: 
-- You can get stuck...I'm only at the beginning but I've had to reload my save in the trolley section and a few other areas due to being frozen in a object and unable to escape. Dodge should be a way to get out of that mess, however it does not help when you are suck. Only option is to reload a save. 

2. The game needs some polish for controllers. 
- There is no control map or way to look at controls for Xbox controllers on PC. So if you have an elite make sure you rebind the paddles to a PC equivalent command.
-- 14 Many keys are missing such as swapping the healing for controllers
-- controls are a bit limited for a Xbox controller, having options to remap the scanner would be nice.

3. Accessibility is missing. Not sure how lawsuits go with games, but for websites / apps its required to be inclusive.
-- (EDIT: They added it!) Missing text resize (the font is small for subtitles)
-- Missing colorblind options

4. (EDIT: They added it!) No FOV option, an issue for ultrawide monitors. Requiring tools such as wemod or flawless widescreen is a backwards approach. It's 2023, there are a ton of ultrawide monitors on the market, please support more FOV options.",1677623364,1678611412,True,0,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False

This game is like several pristine ingredients for a meal, mixed with one or two incorrect ones, and unfortunately not fully cooked well.

Ultimately, the universe, setting, and characters are enjoyable, even the cringeworthy main character who is written to be a complete dumbass who's got bravado and no other skills. But the actual gameplay itself is 50/50 with good things and bad things:

 - The game is riddled with puzzles for door locks. Some are simple, some are complex, all of them are not worth the effort for opening a door.

 + The gunplay feels very good.

 + Good weapon variety and customization.

 + Most of the interactions with enemies are not particularly interesting. The humanoid enemies are exceptionally identical. They're all quite spongey.

 - Many puzzles for progressing don't actually serve the plot. Often times they amount to a hallway and inbetween both sides is a series of fetch quests for literally no reason other than padding gameplay with busy work.

 + The game DOES defy expected narrative plot lines. I expected a couple of twists and, at least for me, it impressively did not go as planned.

 - There are moments in puzzles or movement areas where your progress needs to be redone if you accidentally miss a jump or otherwise move incorrectly. While its not a huge deal, theres been considerable moments where I'd rather quit the game than run through the same boring puzzle a second time.

 - It is incredibly easy to soft lock yourself by getting stuck on terrain collisions.

 - Both Endings seem to be missing something. Hopefully DLC would add more story to the game. Currently the normal version seems somewhat short.",1678609845,1678609845,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Tips popping up in the middle of jumps, messing with your timing;
- Getting stuck in the terrain/props (this happens A LOT, there is a whole 'secret' location where I had to keep mashing buttons to get unstuck every 10 seconds);
- Clipping through elevators;
- Character animation frozen, preventing me from shooting enemies;
- Enemies teleporting/disappearing/flickering on screen;
- Alarm stuck on triggering state, even after being destroyed or leaving from the area (far far away);

The music is wonderful, the art style is interesting and coherent, the combat is well rounded, but it doesn't really do anything interesting. If you've played bioshock infinite, you've seen nearly all this game has to offer, mechanically. The world lore is fascinating but I've never been one for lore. 

The combat is fast paced, but sort of repetitive. Find your favorite short ranged and long ranged option and use those for everything, slotting canisters where nessicary to apply specific damage types. 
Well rounded, competent, fairly boring and repetitive though, enemies don't use cover, almost none of them have ranged weapons, and so you just gotta backpedal and blast for the most part. That's the reason why big-ball McGee is such a hard boss, because it's so much faster than the player that the established combat routines are no longer a viable strategy. but once you figure out how to beat him it's back to the old grind.

The puzzles are varied, nonsensical and tedious. The character lampshades this multiple times. Lots of times. Hell, he's constantly bitching about the puzzles. Which makes sense, because they're stupid and nonsensical, and tedious. They're also fucking everywhere. Every door is locked by a fucking timing puzzles or something. Guys, lampshading is fun and all, but it doesn't actually fix the issue.

Cannot recommend this game for $60 unless you have not played any bioshock game before. If you have not played bioshock, this should be a great game for you. If you have, wait til it goes on sale for... say... $20. 

TLDR: Game drags on, has stupid puzzles, and has no soul. Play once and never touch again, grab on a steep sale unless they do the cyberpunk thing and apply a shitload of powerful improvements.

The game's setting, a surreal alternate reality where technology has advanced beyond our current understanding, is a marvel to behold. The world is filled with bizarre, otherworldly creatures, and the various locations you'll explore are hauntingly beautiful.

The gameplay of Atomic Heart is engaging and fun, with satisfying gunplay that feels impactful and weighty. The game borrows elements from other first-person shooters, such as Bioshock and Half-Life, but still manages to feel fresh and exciting. There's a wide variety of weapons and abilities to experiment with, and the game encourages you to approach combat encounters with creativity and ingenuity.

But where Atomic Heart truly shines is its story. As you explore the game's world, you'll uncover a complex narrative filled with intrigue and mystery. The game's plot centers around a Soviet research facility that has fallen into chaos after a mysterious incident. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter a wide cast of characters, each with their own motivations and agendas. The story is full of twists and turns, and it's sure to keep you engaged throughout.

The graphics of Atomic Heart are also worthy of note. While the game's visuals may not be as stunning as some of the earlier trailers implied, they are still impressive. The attention to detail in the game's environments and character models is top-notch, and the game's lighting and particle effects add to the immersive experience.

Performance-wise, I did not encounter any significant issues or glitches during my playthrough. The occasional missing texture on robot models was a minor issue, but it did not detract from the overall experience.

In conclusion, Atomic Heart is a must-play for fans of first-person shooters and science fiction. The game's unique setting, engaging gameplay, and captivating story make it a standout title that is well worth the investment.",1678559604,1678559604,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]What a dramatic events and unique journey i've had[/h1]
[b]-I spent the last two weeks arguing\fighting in the discussion hub, boycott campaigns were all over the place, it was hilarious.
-I Learned for a fact that many popular critics review games based on their political views and the origin of the game, which is not professional and disrespectful towards their followers,they're definitely not qualified to review.
-I Lost Ukrainian friends, Cause the Ukrainians blood is in my hand now they say, Even tho Mundfish is not a Russian studio and even if, Games must not get involved in these dirty political games. and if you think i'm being cruel towards the Ukrainian people, then i ask you to boycott all USA Devs\games, Cause they also invaded and ruined my country... no one cared and i know you won't, here is your double standards for you. 
-And finally I played one of the most interesting SIFI games ever, And cheated on my GF with a fridge in the process lol.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Perfect Gameplay loved it inside out
You can play this game stealthy (Mostly) or loud, you can go aggressive with guns or you play with style by abilities and tricks which helps you to manage your resources (If necessary). The Gameplay Mainly is in underground labs and Facilities, Each level of the game has puzzles rooms and mechanics need to be solved, it's simple but very fun and engaging.

Difficulty wise, it's a nightmare if you play it on hard and kids game if you play it on easy, in general It has a great aggressive combat system and stubborn enemies, If you master your weapons and abilities well nothing can stop you. sadly it's only 13 weapon, 5 abilities only, Yet the combos you can do with are amazing and very Satisfying. JUST DON'T PLAY IT ON EASY.

Also it has some cool and new features like
-New looting system, Press F To pull\loot everything.
-Cute and classic cartoon Demonstrations for your abilities, Which i enjoyed a lot.
-You can dismantle and re craft anything at anytime without losing any resources,
which very useful if you need to change your build from time to time,
-And you can drive a car.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as P-3 a perfect loyal employ Who got lost after the robots Apocalypse and starts questioning the world around him, what's right and wrong and who to follow. The story start interesting, then becomes kinda boring and then booom, Fast build up, Shocking, dramatic and sad events, which changed my mind on the story and left me very excited for the next Dlcs, Can't say much about the story, don't want to spoil it on you.

The characters and dialogues are good, Very political and serious and sometimes sexual, but mostly funny.
Be aware that some very critical story facts and infos are buried between the lines, you must not skip any side dialogues with your glove, if you want to fully understand everything.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Audio quality is good
The OSTs on the other hand are remarkable and a piece of art, I'd give it 10\10.
Some background tones are extremely repetitive and will probably drives you crazy, no joking, like the fridge music for example, where you upgrade your gear and craft stuff, it's nice music i swear but once you hear it 200 times it becomes the last thing you want to hear, And that tone.... no normal human can listen to it more than 3 times, but you keep coming to upgrade, and yes you can't mute it. i hope they fix it soon cause i'm sure many people will suffer from it. (Not to mention the Surveillance camera noise)

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Runs like butter
I use 3080 | 5800, all settings on Atomic (MAX) @3440X1440
Avg fps180 | highest 300, Many people doubt this game so hard, some even bet it would be badly optimized (based on nothing obviously) but it turned out it's one of the most optimized games DAY ONE!

[h1]Graphics&Environment[/h1]
This game is featurestic, hypred, atmospheric, and full of life, The environment is nicely detailed and very organised, Graphics are beautiful and so on. cut scenes animation was sadly mostly cheap, and some underground areas are not good as the outer world.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
ــــــــــــــــــــــــ
If you suffer from motion sickness you should stay away from this game, Until they optimize the FOV and add FOV settings, however you can lower the shake intensity from Gameplay settings to 0.2 and you can install Flawless ultrawide software and enable FOV fixer, this will help you a lot, otherwise you will quit the game.
ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I Strongly recommend it
It's a unique journey and something we didn't experienced before 
Great world, Great story, Great Gameplay and are optimized, fairly priced (40$ in my region), +40 hours of playtime ""depends on your play style and the difficulty"". 

You can't go wrong with this game
unless you hate the Russian accent or the soviet era, and perhaps looting

* Interesting mechanics,
* Good graphics,
* Kinda strange (in a good way) old Soviet vibe, tech, references (with now-days as well), etc.
* Interesting idea with a glove, reminds me of Bioshok; especially funny is the ""jizz"" function...
* Overall, that polymer reminds me of jizz everywhere: transparent jizz, red jizz, murky jizz, black jizz....
* Fun main character.
* Involuntarily, you'll become a loot hoarder because of the ""pick-up effect.""

But also, the game a little buggy:

* The flying drone that allows you to pick up the key for ""polygon 11"" got bugged after I landed it for the second time. and no longer flew up,
* In the polygon 12 - bronze (first) chest - didn't give me a blueprint for shotgun KS-23 (thermal scope).
* UI is not optimized for PC - backpack and scrolling, are getting more and more difficult with the game's progression as you collect more items.
* Some objects/items can't be interacted with even tho a they are highlighted on the scanner .

What I didn't like:
* Story ""wrap-up"" is quite fast at the end/last few hours (no spoilers here).
* The amount of weapons and space in inventory.
* Some grinding is required to get all the glove upgrades.
* The read part of the messages in those ""computer-like"" thingies (more like first phones ever invented)  - the listen (text to speech at least) option would have been great.
.
Overall interesting game played ~47H (some of those spent searching - ""where the hell is the entrance to that or another room"" or trying to get some additional loot).

I originally wrote this game 1 hour in. After people suggesting I keep playing it, then give my opinion, I decided to do just that; benefit of the doubt.
Now I just feel annoyed I wasted an additional 11 hours on this garbage.
Sure, the game's decent enough...But on 6...SIX separate occasions, I've now gotten haplessly, irrevocably stuck in random objects or areas of the game, forcing a reload to my last save, which is, given I play on Hard and the save stations are pretty spread out later on, quite a long fucking time ago.
Each time I've been forced to reload a save. It *just* happened to me again, and frankly, I'm tired of it. Getting stuck in things is about the easiest bug to fix and shouldn't have made it past the initial testing stages. Oh sure one or two is acceptable, but 6 completely different locations, including 2 stairs and 1 air vent you were MEANT to go into to progress the story? That's just pathetic.

It kind of reminds me of Security Breach in that it looks like they started to lay a substantial foundation, but weren't able to execute it in its entirety so they scaled things back towards the end in order to release a finished product. The huge world map blocked off by barriers is a pretty solid giveaway of the game's initial ambitions. It's Open World* in that you can bebop around the world map between approved locations, but you aren't able to return to story locations. It's your standard shooter with some light RPG elements. What few boss battles there were weren't as engaging as I'd hoped. They were too easy especially for as few as there were. Would have liked more scripted encounters with the larger enemies and a higher difficulty curve on said encounters. Resource balance is a little off as well. Health and Ammo are provided in such excess that you never need to produce it which leaves you with a substantial amount of the necessary resources as well, but finding enough of the rares stuff to build and upgrade all the weapons would require grinding enemies on main world for a substantial amount of time because of the low drop rate of those resources. It was still cool though, and the story was interesting enough. The ending actually caught me off guard though the Bioshock aspect is about as subtle as a third leg, but not in the way you think.

Happy to say it's an absolutely incredible game with a unique approach and varied pacing to keep it interesting.

Insanely detailed graphics, unique art style, satisfying combat, interesting puzzles, daft but hilarious dialogue if not somewhat cheesy but it works strangely. The story is decent enough, a little cliche but it helps drive everything along. There's also a big emphasis on rewarding exploration, going into little spaces will give you a tonne of parts to upgrade weapons and upgrades and craft consumables that can completely alter how a weapon performs or what type of target it's stronger against.

Well optimised with a range of options including DLSS for people wanting higher framerates at all resolutions, probably the first game I've seen using Denuvo that doesn't run like complete dogwater and if anything actually runs really well

*UPDATE* As of 10/03 this is now implemented.
The only current downside I've come across so far is the lack of FOV slider but they have confirmed it's coming in a patch very soon and there is a very quick workaround using FlawlessWidescreen so it's not a deal breaker by any means

And yes, the music is utterly brilliant. Blessed Mick Gordon, Geoffrey and others all making a varied but across the board brilliant soundtrack. Some classic Russian songs with their own remixes too making them heavier as well as super guitar heavy tracks that could've come straight out of DOOM along with some pulsing Russian era synth beats that make you feel like it's a robot slaughter rave club or something and the testing grounds songs are just complete bops

Honestly, was expecting to be somewhat disappointed given how ambitious the game looked and I wasn't sure it would be able to deliver on what it was promising but I've ended up being more than pleasantly surprised to say the least and enjoying nearly every second

9/10


(As a side note, I really couldn't care less about the controversy around this game. People who seriously think this game will counteract any sanctions towards Russia in the Ukraine war are delusional and those also taking a stab at the fact it's glorifying the USSR are missing the fact that it's an alternative history game set in 1955 where the USSR took a MUCH different approach to literally everything as apposed to how it played out in real life.

Imagine Bioshock and Wolfenstein in 1950's ""Atom-punk"" Soviet Russia, with clear inspirations and elements from Half-Life 2, Portal, Dishonored 2, and Prey. Enemy designs and environmental visuals are top notch. The game is also very optimized for how stunning it looks: 160-220fps the entire time max settings at 1440p. And to top it off, the soundtrack has Mick Gordon and Geoffrey Day behind the guitars remixing classic famous Russian songs and they're so damn good. Your arsenal consists of iconic 1950's Russian military legacy weapons that you can upgrade with retro-future sci-fi tech that makes your AKM, KS-23, and Makarov look like it came directly from the movie Elysium. Big fan of the aesthetics of mixing advanced tech with old Russian hardware. And your offhand has a glove that is an AI companion named Charles that acts as a ""Bioshock plasmid + HL2 Gravity Gun + Prey Glue Gun"" and is also used for looting containers (shop vac on steroids), throwing objects, solving physics-based puzzles, hacking, and navigating. 

And I have to say the ""Hedgie"" boss fight was the most visually impressive and intimidating boss fight I've experienced in years and it had no business having the hardest boss soundtrack I've heard since Doom2016. I was laughing at how good it was. My wife even sat down and watched captivated by it. The animation work and design is a spectacle. I am craving to see more of it. Also, the unique series of scientific test chamber areas that had gravity-based Portal-like puzzles and interchangeable rooms and walls like in Dishonored 2's famous Clockwork Mansion were also Chef's Kiss. I did them all and didn't want them to end.

However, the game needs a FOV slider (edit: they added 80-110 FOV, and it's the good kind where the weapon viewmodel changes with it), a way to disable the HUD or make it limited/fade away, and improve the timing of the English dialogue. But I understand the game has been fully voiced in like 10 different languages so I forgive it. Overall, the game felt super polished and I'm looking forward to more content and DLC.

If you're a Bioshock/Wolfenstein fan, it's a real treat and an easy must play for you. So many unapologetic cheeky callbacks to the Bioshock series, especially near the end. You'll know it when you see it/hear it.

Atomic heart is action FPS semi open-world game where you play as russian dude slapping robots.

Pros (+):
+ Performance is buttery smooth. almost all maxed and still run on 144 FPS.
+ Graphic is very great, not to mention great aesthetic too.
+ RPG system where you can upgrade and customize your weapon.
+ Melee has the ""weight"" feeling on it. Making satisfying slash.
+ Interesting story and world building.
+ Grandma with Rocket Launcher.

Grey (?):
? Alot of ""camera"" everywhere. alerting nearby enemy to you when spotted.
? Ammo management on guns.
? No running. Probably later on in game.. maybe??
? No photo mode.
? English dub is cheesy. Dude likes to jokes alot.

Cons (-):
- Fight is frustrating with alot of enemy surrounding you.
- Very slow climbing speed.
- No saving everywhere. Only auto save and save spot.
- No FoV slider. edit: FoV added

A lot of people will equivocate this game to Bioshock Infinite, and that's a fair take. The game is a solid feeling of gunplay, extraordinary abilities such as freezing enemies and hurling them around with Jedi-like powers after a certain point. It never left me feeling truly helpless, only that in a tight situation I had a toolbox to figure my way out.

As far as story goes. It took me 20 hours to beat the game. My personal metric for Price vs. Enjoyment tends to be 1 USD per hour, that being said, this silly equation is altered if I had an excessive amount of fun. Games like DOOM Eternal I bought for full price and beat within 16 hours of play - and I still whole-heartedly recommended them. Now! Does that stand up for this game?

No. I wish there was a button for a ""Yes & No"" recommendation. Yes, this game is fun, yes this game has very nice styling and a nice story. It's woefully short and the replay factor won't really bring me back in. There's no branching choices, no ""what ifs"" and fully upgrading my guns was never really a factor on Normal difficulty. I enjoyed the experience personally, but not enough to encourage people to pay full pricing for this game.

It has good quality, good gameplay, and a nice story. I'd give this game a solid ""buy it on sale, unless you really, really think this game is up your alley"".

For the record: I had three bugs that required me to reload a recent save to fix them, simple stuff like elevator buttons not working or getting stuck in geometry. The game only crashed once when I was closing it and that's hardly a problem. No saves got magically deleted during my playing and no game-breaking issues came up.

Do you like games like Bioshock or Prey? Atomic Heart is a different spin on the same kind of formula, being an FPS based around exploring unique locales with light crafting elements and a focus on combat. AH is more heftier in plot and will throw a lot at you expecting you to keep up. It has fun gameplay, and presents an interesting vision of a Soviet society built on propaganda. However, it's not as refined as an experience as Bioshock or Prey, so temper your expectations going into it.

Allow me to explain how an extremely bizarre game I initially hated grew to be my favorite game of this year (so far). I'm well acquainted with slav jank. I love games like Pathologic and S.T.A.L.K.E.R., both of which are buggy barely finished messes that are still in my top 10 favorite games of all time. Why? Because they have heart, like this game. Pun intended. Also, like those games, this one was clearly far too ambitious for a first time dev studio which explains the bizarre design decisions and jank. Don't be fooled. This is a AA game being sold as a AAA game. 

I've had the game crash once. I've gotten stuck on geometry multiple times. The map will suddenly stop working. Atomic Heart is simultaneously a technical achievement and a technical mess. The performance, at launch, was shockingly smooth at max settings 4K resolution. No hitches and my frame rate stayed above 90. Given AAA releases like Hogwarts Legacy still have horrendous performance with awfully implemented ray tracing, that's impressive. The game is beautiful. Easily one of the best looking games to ever come out on a technical and especially artistic level. It's a Soviet nightmare brought to life with some of the smoothest animations I've ever seen. I put it above Machine Games' Wolfenstein titles in art design. Speaking of, this game reminds me most of Wolfenstein instead of Bioshock. They even have Mick Gordon going hard on the fantastic soundtrack. Don't be deceived. This is NOT an ""immersive sim"" despite the obvious ""451"" reference in the boring, linear intro sequence that felt ripped right out of Bioshock Infinite. This game has a poor start, but gets going when you get into your first underground complex.

I started loving the game once I dropped the Bioshock expectations and looked at it as more of a boomer shooter like Wolfenstein. Think about it. It heavily emphasizes stealth. Instead of an advanced Nazi society, it's Soviet. The tone is extremely campy with a B-movie action hero dropping catch phrases like ""crispy critters"". There's no weapon limit. There are numerous AWESOME bosses and the combat is high octane and fast paced. This game doesn't take itself seriously at all and I love it. Major Comrade's voice acting is as corny as can be and it worked for me. Charles is genuinely well voice acted and bounces off of our hero's no-bs attitude really well with his professional attitude. The dialogue between them is compelling. The world building is the highlight of the game's writing even if the main story is nothing special. Reading emails on terminals, listening to audio logs, and literally conversing with corpses all flesh out the world in a more substantive manner than constant cutscenes ever could.

The gameplay is a huge mix of styles that make for a mixed bag that's more fun than frustrating. The gunplay is damn good. All of the reload animations look incredible and the weapons sound and handle extremely well. There aren't a ton of guns, but the deep customization that modifies the look and feel of each gun with numerous customizable melee weapons AND abilities like telekinesis, shock, frostbite, etc. AND elemental cartridges for every weapon, give the combat a lot of depth. The platforming sections were honestly really fun. It's no Mirror's Edge, but it works. The puzzles could be challenging at times and I liked the creativity of them. Each underground level was very well designed and I must give praise to the awesome enemy variety. Each design is distinct and extremely well animated. When you're getting swarmed, combat can get intense. Unlike 90% of other self-proclaimed ""RPG's"", this game's skill trees do make a massive difference and get me excited to unlock a new skill whenever I visit NORA, the horny vending machine. I'm not joking.

However, the open world is pointless and full of undercooked ideas. The camera system has so much potential for Deus Ex style hacking, but all you ever do is open a door sometimes to access this game's take on dungeons called Testing Grounds. There are cars and by cars, I mean that one red model you barely come across that handles like melted ass and breaks fast af. There was very little thought put into the design of the sandbox. They should've focused on just having more levels instead. Also, the stealth is about as basic as can be and is arguably worse than Wolfenstein. Cameras can be easily shocked or outright destroyed with little consequence. Yes, they can get repaired, along with every other enemy, but you'll be long gone before that happens. Escaping high alert status is extremely easy. On top of all of that, the loot in this game is waaaaaaay too plentiful. There's no reason my storage should have dozens of healing items. Either decrease the amount of loot or add more enemies to levels. For whatever reason, you will go through 75% of one of the Testing Grounds doing puzzles, looting, and platforming and not come across a single enemy. Why? This is an FPS isn't it? Also, the save system is hot trash. If you're just going to put a save room every 3 steps, why even have it? Just give us a basic save feature we can access from the pause menu.

That really is the core issue with Atomic Heart. It tries to do too much with too little. If they honed in on their strengths, we could be looking at an instant classic, but like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., instead we have a cult classic. This is a game I love, IN SPITE of its issues, NOT because of them. There's just nothing else like it out right now and hopefully, it can escape from Bioshock's shadow. As it stands, I had a great time with this strange, addictive, funny game and I look forward to whatever they make next. While I do recommend it, I say it's best to get it at $50 instead where it should've been priced. Like I said, this isn't a AAA game. It doesn't have that level of polish.

Luckily however I was proven wrong, this game is amazing and it shows a promising start for Mundfish.

Everything about the environment, and setting is astounding. The retro-futuristic soviet style definitely shines throughout. The gameplay itself was amazing, with enemies that were interesting and fun to fight, and the puzzles (located mostly in the optional testing grounds) were challenging but not infuriating and thus fun. The story was very compelling and whilst there were some twists I was expecting, I also didn't expect some of them as well, especially the ending (I know there are two but one of them is literally just ending the game before the final boss fight) which I won't spoil here but was quite the shock and took me off-guard.

There are two things I would like to point out however despite all of these positives. The movement in this game can feel clunky at times, which has caused me some frustration throughout my playthrough. And as weird as this sounds, the game is a little too horny. Sex with robots is talked about a lot more than you might expect and whilst this is often used cleverly, like during the theater area where it's used to show the corruption and vice of the high ranking communist party members, it is still somewhat overdone and a bit weird.

That being said though those are fairly small downsides and the majority of the game is very good. Overall, I highly recommend it, 9/10

3 - The ""open world"" is pretty damn chaotic and doesn't make you want to explore it because if you do you'll blow through all your ammo and health pots in the process. Trust me, if you play on anything other than easy, you'll need them.

You'll have a ridiculous amount of crafting materials, but there's not enough unique weapons and upgrades (and there's a lot of overlap between them all), and the game isn't hard enough to make you craft consumables, not to mention the fact that they give you so many that it just becomes annoying to clear them out of your inventory. Abilities were cool, but you're probably not going to switch from whichever ones you immediately like. I wish their individual purposes were more unique, and it'd be cool if there were more or if you could equip at least one more at a time. There used to be like 20 or 30 different weapons on Mundfish's website, the final game has like 10 or 11. The trailers show different weapons too. Hope they return for the DLC.

Combat was fine. It had more going for it than most shooters, but there aren't really that many enemies. It would've been nicer if there were more unique areas with unique enemies. In the end, you can find basically every enemy in single locations. I liked the puzzles, they didn't feel annoyingly repetitive to me personally. The way that the testing grounds, upgrades, and open-world work could've been explained better though. 

Story was meh. I didn't mind the cheesy dialogue that much personally. [spoiler] The Bioshock plot-twist was boring, and it came like 30 minutes after a very obvious and especially boring reference to Rapture. Apart from that, I really don't buy the protagonists change of heart within the last hour of the game. The change of his loyalty towards Sechenov is way to quick for it to be enjoyable or interesting. [/spoiler]

I break this game into 3 Acts

Act 1 - Beginning is ROUGH - Stick with it to get to the REALLY great middle bit. The vibe & aesthetic will see you through. Remember: You came for the robots.
Act 2 - The characters actually start talking to each other and not slinging one liners, it gets WEIRD, and just overall the gameplay becomes a lot more fun.
Act 3 - Ending is ROUGH - It's a very bad. The characters start monologue again instead of speaking and the ""twist"" is ham fisted and exactly what you expect it to be

Music is GREAT
Voice Acting is BAD, Protagonist is insufferable
Gameplay is GOOD
Story is OK 

Overall I barely give it a ""buy"" but I do, indeed, recommend you play the game.

Fun gameplay, you can choose from a variety of weapons without repercussions.

Pros:
- Absolutely beautiful game design.
- Realistic graphics. True to the design and style of the 1950's.
- A wealth of lore fills the world of Atomic Heart. Many things to read and listen to.
- A complex political storyline which hints at much larger story elements at play.
- Straightforward, challenging gameplay. Progress at your own pace and difficulty.
- An extremely large open-world area with ""dungeons"" that you are free to explore at any time.
- A rewarding crafting system.

Cons:
- A lot of things are introduced very quickly with little time to understand it.
- Very easy to lose track of your current objective. You can ""over-explore"" and become lost.
- Essential game mechanics can break if you abuse them.
- The player can become stuck in geometry, forcing the player to reload their last saved game.
- The game can lock progress if certain events do not trigger properly.
- Very short and abrupt final arc.
- Few crafting items.

Overall:
- Graphics: 5/5
- Gameplay: 3/5
- Storytelling: 4/5

Notes:
- Despite its flaws and unpolished artifacts, the game offers a lot in terms of introducing a brand-new world and story in an alternate world where the USSR and United States of America have a very different kind of Cold War.
- If you enjoy complex, psychological stories and lore with challenging gameplay, this is a great game to own. Make sure to read everything and loot whatever you can.
- Completing difficult parts of the game will reward you with story progression. Worth.

I personally enjoyed the banter and the dialog throughout the game.
All bugs but one were able to be fixed by relaunching the game. I did have one bug that stopped me from doing an optional loot/gear area due to the a game breaking bug that stopped the elevator from working and reloaded didnt fix anything. Had to go back to a previous save and it worked the second time around.

As someone who knows soviet history well, there is an abundance of Easter eggs that make the game really enjoyable, like 80's soviet songs and cartoons, etc. The dialogue is cringe but for someone who understand's russian, this is actually normal!

My only gripe is the movement. Its very....source engine like. Feels like you are in jello or on ice skates. I understand this because many russians grew up on counter strike, based on the source engine, but that movement is pretty mediocre my modern day standards. Also, I wish more objects were destructible, like glass.

8 Hours in, the game is just meh. Honestly just watch the cut scenes. Even on easy mode the enemies that do matter are pretty much same old hack and slash and heal nonsense.

Combat felt good but even with many variations to your abilities and weapons, it still got a little boring and repetitive before the game was over.

What about looter shooter mechanics? Yep! Puzzles, even? Y E S ! In short, I really like this game for what it offers. I'll list what I liked, didn't like and despised.

What I liked:
- The mix of several game types that was somewhat coherent. Looter shooter, FPS, Puzzle solving. Definitely a refresher compared to other fps games in my opinion.

- The wackiness of the world is, well, wacky. The designs of architecture, weapons, enemies, and characters. They're all really weird in a way that is super cool!

- There's a bunch of sound effects when looting cabinets, drawers and more that just sound SOOO FREAKIN' GOOD! All the clicky sounds just give me the good feels!

- The grind is pretty good during the story, I often found myself having more than enough resources to get everything I needed. After the main story, the grind gets slightly slower and more dull.

What I didn't like:
- There's something about those robot twins seen early in the game and in the game's trailers that make me super uncomfortable.

- The main character's voice in english feels very immature for the role he plays. Although he does sound somewhat serious when need be.

- Getting used to dodging when enemies are about to do a heavy attack seems jarring. When encountering this scenario for the first time, enemies would charge a heavy attack for what felt like a fraction of a second which gave me no time to react. Once you do get used to this and start dodging consistently, it is more tolerable.

- The world feels somewhat small compared to what you see in the in game map. I often found myself reaching the world boarders very quickly while moving to the next point of interest.
- The lack of an FOV slider on launch was a bit annoying. It was weird seeing things as if I had binoculars the whole time.

What I despised:
- There are cars in the map you can drive and they have 2 major flaws in my opinion. Their lack of health and too many obstacles on the road. If you ever so slightly bump into any solid object, the car catches fire and starts to hurt you. This gets even more annoying when the roads are always cluttered with wreckage everywhere. Also, there's no 3rd person perspective while in a car. That disappoints me even more.

Overall, I had a very good time playing Atomic Heart for the first time. Although if I were to run through the story again, it would have to be in Russian with English subtitles.

I wished using heavy attack with the zvezdochka would have that unchain action like in the trailer but it wasn't added into the final game. For a open world game you can really explore the facilities and switch play styles each time. The enemies are well done, specifically their attack time and speed, in normal difficulty it is challenging enough yet not over the top, I would describe it as perfect, as it fits the atomic world settings and difficulty settings. For the collectibles part, it is good but can improve a bit, a lot of time I would look behind stairs, pipes and other structures and expect a collectible such as chirper, dead talking body there but there wasn't. A lot of potential for the collectibles in the environment. Exploring the world everywhere you go you can screenshot right there and then and you have a decent wallpaper, the artistic element in the environment is excellent here, playing the game is also like going on a scenic trip with atompunk elements, which is really unique and rare. I wished we can replay boss fight with new equipments and even after story campaign, but this is not possible, although you can still explore the open world after the game ends. There are some bugs during my playthrough, player can get stuck in too many places, at the end of one of the tunnels in the game I can see through the ground, if you're stuck the game will fling the player off the stuck spot after a while but it doesn't always work, sometimes I would be incline to explore for fear of getting stuck. The weapon upgrade system is the best because it allows player to experiment with different play styles. Looting is so satisfying I CAN'T STOP LOOTING FOR THE WHOLE GAME. I am very much looking forward to the DLCs that they are planning to do, please, take as much time as possible, too many games release without finishing development nowadays, this game is one of the few that doesn't do that.

I want to like this game, I really do.
Since it was teased, I have been looking forward to it and despite the controversy, I tried to enjoy it, but the technical issues are too overwhelming and make it impossible for me to enjoy it.
Sadly these issues only cropped up once I was past the first section of the game and over the 2 hour refund mark. As soon as the game goes from indoor lab setting to the outdoor/open-world bit it starts to lag.
Despite lowering all settings to the minimum it remained jittery and sometimes downright froze for a second. This happened even in cutscenes, resulting in mismatch between audio and visual, taking me out of the story.

I will not recount how often I died due to glitches or laggy moments, but in conclusion I can say that while the game has good ideas and can look nice, it is NOT worth the full price. It would have needed more time to be polished, but I assume the current political issues forced them to release the game to even hope of selling it.",1678371699,1678371699,False,1,0,0.525316417217254639,0,True,False,False

668580,134329295,76561198034279018,0,81,1394,0,1394,1678316720,"Atomic Heart is what you'd call a AA game - unlike a modern AAA game that tries to incorporate tons of elements into a single title, Atomic Heart maintains a narrower focus that allows it to refine its main mechanics. The result is a strange, endearing, and mostly well-made atompunk FPS with RPG and exploration elements. Some aspects are clunkier than others, but the game generally succeeds in what it sets out to accomplish.

In Atomic Heart, the Soviet Union has revolutionized transportation, robotics, and communication using an organic technology called ""polymer."" On the day that the USSR's ""Collective"" initiative is set to launch, the worker robots in its main scientific facility go berserk and begin killing lab personnel and other civilians. As Major P-3, a close assistant to the facility's lead scientist, you're tasked with ending the robots' rampage and uncovering the source of their altered behaviors. Along the way, P-3 battles against plant mutants, numerous kinds of robots, and other bizarre creatures made by the facility. Investigating the attacks uncovers hard truths behind the ""utopia"" created by the USSR, from sleazy political maneuvering to dark secrets that threaten the future of Soviet science.

Combat in Atomic Heart reminds me of a mix of Bioshock Infinite and Resident Evil: Village, which is admittedly a strange comparison. Your backpack allows you to carry a limited number of supplies and weapons, but you can decide what to put in it, whether it's a ton of medical supplies or some guns/ammo/vodka bottles. While your right hand uses guns and melee weapons, your left hand can use special abilities given by CHAR-LES, the AI assistant within P-3's glove. You can continue to shoot or attack while creating a polymer shield or levitating objects, which hampers speed/accuracy but allows you to stay on the offensive. Broken robots, dead mutants, and storage units can be scavenged for supplies - some of which can be used to upgrade your abilities or build new items/weapons. 

Enemies are pretty ruthless and will put up a serious fight, especially in the early game. They will alternate between ranged and close-range attacks, use telegraphed special attacks to knock you down, or even fly out of your attacks ranges. Without the right abilities to soften up enemies or exploit their weaknesses, they will end up being tanky and shrugging off a lot of initial attacks. Fortunately, the game paces itself slowly at first, only throwing one or two robots at a time. The first complex you explore sets up the robot and mutant enemies while showcasing mechanics like customization, electronic lockpicking, ability upgrades, and scanning the environment for supplies.

When you're introduced to the exploration elements 3-4 hours in, though, there is a sharp difficulty spike. Enemies are much more frequent in the ""open world"" segments, and robots will be reinforced by repair drones that will bring them back to life, albeit without any parts to scavenge. Picking fights in this state can be disastrous, especially since you can never stop the repair drones from coming to help other robots. Mutants can be permanently killed, though, making them a much more satisfying enemy to fight in the open sections. My advice would be upgrade the SHOK ability to the ""chain lightening"" power as soon as possible, since it stuns robots and is effective at downing repair drones.

Robot enemies have a ton of variety when it comes to their designs and tactics, from the usual humanoid robots to stumpy lumberjack robots with sawblades for heads. The damage you deal is reflected on their models, like scorch marks from SHOK attacks and paint being chipped off from repeated gunshots and melee strikes. It's satisfying to go ham and absolutely tear them apart with explosives, full-power axe swings, and point-blank shotgun blasts. The game's arsenal is limited to 12 weapons, but each one stands out with its own strengths. I enjoyed how melee weapons remained relevant throughout the game, since they restore energy weapons' batteries on hits and can punch through energy shields.

The mutants are also a fun faction to fight, even if they aren't as prominent as the robots. Their behavior and tactics are much more animalistic, rushing you without regard for their safety or launching disgusting projectiles at you. Defeating them hinges on tracking down and destroying their hives, followed by eliminating the infected humans and plant mutants still active in the area. They don't take damage as visibly as the robots, but they still can explode and get gibbed on death. Both factions are used exclusively in some areas, keeping you from getting too used to them or bored with one or the other.

I enjoyed Atomic Heart, but it has some notable flaws that should be brought up. Some of the robot enemies are downright frustrating to fight, especially when they've been rebuilt and no longer offer any scavenging rewards. The sawblade robots and artillery ones have small hitboxes and spam knockdown attacks too frequently. The game is too generous with the repair drones in the open world areas, where you'll feel like no progress is made after a squad of robots gets rebuilt moments after you leave them. You can drive around in marked cars in these areas, but I didn't really enjoy the controls for driving and just ran around on foot (to be fair, this also gave me more chances to scrounge up resources, and the destinations aren't too far apart in-game). A few bosses have Quick Time Events that will instantly kill you regardless of your health or their health, and this as unsatisfying and frustrating as it sounds.

Some mechanics in Atomic Heart also seem unrefined, pointless, or unused after a certain point. The game teaches you about opening certain doors with SHOK...which you never do after leaving the first complex. There's a parkour system for climbing around obstacles and platforming, but it is only used in 4 or 5 sequences throughout the game. Bonus ""testing grounds"" scattered throughout the map offer exclusive weapon parts and rewards for completing their puzzles, but I made it through the story and stomped most late-game threats without ever visiting a single one. NORA, the red upgrade station that's unhealthily attracted to P-3, rarely talks between the first open-world segment and the buildup to the final boss battle. It feels like there were some changes in the game's main features during development, and these earlier parts of it weren't altered to reflect the new priorities.

It took me around 23 hours to beat Atomic Heart, and that includes some grinding I did to heavily upgrade my SHOK ability before the hedgehog robot boss. The game lasts long enough to hold your interest, but it also bows out before it overstays its welcome. The two endings leave room for a sequel or DLC expansion, but they are mostly satisfying and wrap up the events of the storyline. The game will take a pretty good PC to run, but you can squeeze out some more frames per second by going to Atomic Heart's AppData folder and cranking its settings down. It's a shame the game doesn't let you lower its resolution...

Atomic Heart is a wild, chaotic ride of an FPS game. It's not perfect, but it's fun and tells a story that will keep you on your toes with each new development. The length is also appropriate without feeling bloated. I would recommend it, but I would recommend making sure your computer can run it before buying it. I had to do a lot of adjustments on my end to make it semi-playable, and I still faced lag spikes at times. The overall concept is novel and the soundtrack has some standout tracks like ""Starry Summer."" In the end, I was willing to look past its flaws and enjoy what the game had to offer.",1678330911,1678330911,True,21,0,0.65282440185546875,0,True,False,False

The technical ability demonstrated in the graphics is unsurpassed, but the subject matter (appearance of the environment and cinematic ambiance) is entirely focused on making everything ugly, from the architecture to the garbage and junk strewn throughout the game. These guys have proven that they can present near photographic representations of life-like animation, but I'd like to see one shot of an entirely stunning depiction that doesn't make me want to tear the wall paper off my bathroom walls. Considering how much time and energy was put into mirror imaging, shadow and detail, it's not too much to ask to see at least one image that takes the breath away. These Devs could have done that.  It didn't happen. Colors were earth tone and muted pastels and hideous architectural construction.  I understand the Devs were trying to create a mood. But why waste such talent on making the game so artistically off-putting? 2.)  The game relied too heavily on a techno-science narrative. I found the dialogue about polymer and robotic - human assimilation to be pretentious. It was unnecessary to the game and demanded that I care about a far-fetched story line in order for it to work. It did not. The game would have been better if I did not have to listen to P-3 and the NPCs droning on and on about who did what to whom...and why. It's irrelevant. I felt my time was being wasted by engaging in forced dialogue over issues that didn't affect the game play and were implausible. 3.) Some (dream) scenes were too weird. If I wanted to jump over a nuclear sub in search of apples dressed as a monkey (or similar animal) I could take 4 hits of acid, i.e. it was a bit too much, considering this is primarily a shooter game and I found these surreal elements  detracted from the main objective: Kill Evil Bots. 4.) The puzzles, unlike other games were heady and unnecessarily intellectualized: ""Ballerinas depict prior deaths."" Fine, I get that the shadows needed to be juxtaposed to solve the puzzle. But please, I play games like this to test my skill at defeating invincible enemies with limited resources. I am not exhilarated by fiddling  with abstract images just to get through a door. 5.) With all the hype before this game came out, it did not live up to the advertising. It would have been much more effective if the entire game were simplified without all the cerebral story line, without the preponderance  of the painfully ugly environment, without the reliance on my willingness to buy into a PhD dissertation on ""what if communist Russia did (fill in the blank) back in the 50s. 

Despite all its pretense, the game was playable. I beat it. Apparently, I'm in the top 16%, for now. How did I do that? You can beat the Twins by simply buying all the ""Character"" polymer upgrades. I did not have all the best weapons, just Electro, KS-23, Fox and Kalash. Once you get a feel of how to deal with enemy bots, defeating them is easy, even without owning the more advanced weapons. Use the adrenaline meds (the little purple ones that look like acorns with spikes). Use the Kalash to inflict damage on the Twins. If you run out of ammo, use the shotgun. (Like I said, get all the polymer upgrades under ""Character."") This game is worth playing, but wait until it does not cost $65.",1678329509,1678329509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

P-3 and his glove ''companion'' Char-Les find themselves on a dangerous mission to find out the truth and the people responsible.  On occasion, P-3 was stuck in Limbo and reaches back to regain consciousness but the unfortunate part is that he starts to question his reality and everything around him before making up his own mind.

Another disclaimer: this game doesn't feature ray tracing. Developers marketed it as heavily RT-enabled title, and this would actually have been a big improvement for the game visually, due to the amount of metals, glass, and mixed out/indoor areas. All these RT would help with. Unfortunately, developers did a bit of a dirty move and didn't explain why they didn't include the RT into the main game, just that RT will be added ""post-launch"" which is from the launch to infinity. I still recommend the game, but in the future, we should be cautious about this developers and the promises they make.

This is a surprisingly great game. Aesthetics and ambiance are top notch. The soundtrack is intriguing, definitely. Some of the mechanics are novel to this genre, like looting everything from drawers by a telekinesis suction - quite satisfying.

But be aware that there are of course quite a bit of cons to this game - you can get stuck in places quite often, and since you can only save at special stations, this can throw you back quite a bit, so save often. Also there are some cringey moments in the story, be prepared.

But this - in my opinion at least - is heavily outweighed by the pros, overall game impressions are very good.",1677807117,1678326610,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Highly recommended. Immersion, world building, concept, and sound design are pushing the envelope to further reaches. Cool psychic abilities combined with guns are fun to use. Are you willing to overlook it not being a billion dollar Assassins Creed reskin? Might you want to enjoy some innovative and aesthetically fascinating world immersion designed by passionate and creative PC up-and-comers? Are you interested in games that really test around the limits of what is possible in this medium? Check it out.

I personally loved it. Played through it, not perfect but still enjoyed it more than most things. Some people say it's janky garbage, too talky. I'm going to just kind of let my hair down and say... yeah... big disagree buddies. Big disagree. Kinda seems ""tasteless tier."" I loved the art, the sound design, and found the gameplay got a LOT more fun once I had some more polymer skills unlocked a few hours into it. There really aren't many games like it... Metro? Bioshock? This game is operating on a large, outdoors+indoors scale. Bioshock aint. Metro is great, but it's extremely on-rails.

I can't help but already feel a sort of nostalgia for my first time roaming around the outdoors... the sounds of the robots... the bizarre flower cameras... just trying to see if I'd survive to the next area. So much mystery around every corner. It really is one of those ""man, I wish I could experience again for the first time"" things. What I'm saying is, don't take it for granted. The FUD around this game seems to be very amplified and overstated - don't listen to it. It's a great game and if you're enjoying it, let yourself go all out with it. Explore, take your time, and recognize that you're playing something pretty special.

Seriously, I can still feel that feeling I first had going outdoors and hearing the bizarre sounds of the robots in the distance. There's nothing quite like it. Bioshock, System Shock 2, Prey, Deus Ex, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Thief 2, Fallout NV, Half Life 2, Far Cry 1-5... I'm seeing Atom Heart contrasted (often negatively) with some of these. These comparisons are fair, but missing the mark and selling Atomic Heart down the river. 

What I'm trying to get at, is that Atomic Heart is something just a lil-bit new. Sure, it's no genre revolution. That said, it ain't no copy-paste. It's more of an evo-lution. And that's a fact.

OK, Dying Light is a solid comparison. But Atomic Heart is intricately and passionately designed in every detail. Dying Light is a solid if not excellent series, but I do think it suffers from ""Far Cry Syndrome."" Atomic Heart has more in common with the Half Life philosophy than the Far Cry philosophy. And that's a really, really good thing.

Overall the entire experience is pretty grand. It's kind of like the film Children of Men, or 28 Days Later, for reference. You go through a large world, facility to facility. Much of it is indoors, much outdoors, but all tied together very well. You grow to be very IMMERSED in the experience and the design of the environment and world-building becomes somewhat unparalleled.

That said, I do have a big personal soft spot for this kind of aestheticism, as well as for the immersive sim genre overall. Atomic Heart is a mid immersive sim in terms of the game mechanics, but it's overall world building and atmosphere is so well thought out and executed that it somehow catapults it into the upper echelon of the genre.

If you are the sort of person who doesn't care if something is ""muh janky"" so long as it excels in certain other areas - particularly immersion and world building - and you love a good bit of futuristic science fiction ... what are you even waiting for, man...

*that said, it is flawed. there are some parts that actually kind of suck, a lot like parts of Half Life 1 that suck, and pretty much every classic game. I'd say the parts of this game that suck are the ""doggone"" hallucination climbing sections toward the end. No fan. The story falls off slightly at times (the ending is ok), but overall the first 2/3rds of the game are significantly better. The open world is somewhat under-used but I don't really care... it's kind of like linear.5, if you know what I mean. The game opens up into large areas that you can explore, but its ultimately linear. the ending is too abrupt. gameplay gets a touch repetitive in areas toward the ending. Those are my primary criticisms. I actually like that the game is streamlined and not bloated open world crap, though. Better that way.

Sometimes stressful.

I have very few complaints really, Story was alright, bit confusing at time. Mostly due to during hectic moments my focus was not on the very calm dialog the main protagonist was having but rather the horde of enemies I was facing.
Some mechanics seems a bit unclear how to use and had to google to see how to do it, even then I just ended up simply not using some mechanics. But that could just be me being stupid or simply overthinking.

Music is great, however in more than one occasion I've killed off all the enemies and then triggered the music that was supposed to be accompanying the battle just after, making for a very intense and metal soundtrack-ed looting of corpses.
And lastly, some minor glitches in the HUD, be it quest marker, subtitles not synced, at some point it switched from English to Russian

Feels like Bioshock if you enjoyed those games you will likely enjoy this as well.

Graphics, good 8/10, 10/10 for the aesthetic.

Plot, good but at times hard to follow. 7/10 

Gun play, easy 9/10 functionally interesting paired with game play mechanics and the guns feel like guns not toys.

Difficulty, I enjoy a challenge so the harder difficulty was perfect for me however some might find it too easy on the lower difficulty and too hard on the higher end. 6/10 for the difficulty scale.

Gameplay, 8/10 enjoyable but sometimes janky. will likely be fixed in updates. optional grinding to get better things/new ways to play, not required to beat the game. voice lines are a little broken at times but mostly are fine.

And while I stand on the side of ""Play what you want"", I do understand the concerns surrounding the developers, and their (reported) involvement with political factions.

That is all I will comment regarding that, however; I've come here to review a game, not bicker and bitch about politics.

Atomic Heart, at it's core, is VERY similar to games like Bioshock and Prey, with the mixture of aesthetics, setting, technologies and other such gameplay implementations being a crossover between the two. And this isn't a gripe at all, I enjoy the fusion they've made here.

The gameplay loop is immaculately crafted I'll just say, allowing for playstyles of all fields while still building into high-octane gameplay; forcing the player to dodge and avoid hostile attacks at will, while using their arsenal to deal with their foes. It's a breath of fresh air, and I enjoy it thoroughly.

I'll also say, the game does, oddly enough, have some Portal feels in it with the Testing Ground Dungeons players can get into for extra loot, upgrades and materials. I can't say I'm a massive fan of how the Testing Grounds are constructed, and they all feel the exact same after a while, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.

I have seen people clowning on the English voice acting, and while I can agree it isn't top-notch, it *certainly* isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Of course, if you understand Russian, go ahead and use that for your language option, but don't worry about bad English performances either.

Now, getting down to my favourite part of this game; the setting and aesthetics. Atomic Heart is, dare I say, *very* innovative in it's style, design and atmosphere. I genuinely cannot name any other games that use the Atomic-Era as a backdrop, and it's amazing how they set AH in the ideal Soviet future (in a purely cosmetic sense, of course). While I do believe the atmosphere can get drab at times, it's never in an insufferable way.

Down to the plot, I haven't finished the game yet, but thus far it's very enjoyable. There's a good variety of missions, and it never just sticks to one single thing throughout the entire line. The characters are fairly enjoyable as well, though P-3 isn't *really* my overall favourite, since he seems to ping-pong between being a battle-forged warlord, and a noble, calm soldier who just exists to carry out orders. It's an odd way to do it for sure, but not horrid.

I really don't have much else to comment on it, however. I'd say it's worth the $60, given the quality and playtime, but I can totally understand wanting to wait for a sale.

EDIT: So after finishing (both endings), I must say I really liked the narrative. The game managed to trick and deceive me, using charismatic and demanding characters as it's vessel to do so. The bad ending genuinely made me feel, well, bad. And the good ending, though anticlimactic and fairly underwhelming if I'm honest, was a good wrap-up

Once in awhile I could tolerate, but the lousy save system ensures hours of repeating game play due to these crashes to desktop, which always seem to happen deep into a mission and far from any save location. Game play on dx11 is choppy and the game stutters but there is no choice, the game will not stay running at any graphics setting with dx12.

I finally got frustrated and quit the game attempting to get the AK weapon blueprint, I fell thru the world and restarted again, replaying a half hour of game play, only for the game to repeatedly crash at the same point on the map. I'm already in medium graphics settings and dx11 on a system capable of maxing out this game graphically, there is nothing I can do to keep this game running.

Don't buy this game YET, it will only frustrate you when you have to castrate the game graphically to play it. Like just about every title released to PC in the last two years, its buggy, unfinished, and not ready for release.

In a game like this that is massively melee based on the higher difficulty due to lack of ammo drops, the dodge mechanic getting you caught on walls in crowded spaces without iframes and getting you killed sending you back to the last checkpoint (however long ago that was) sucks.

Pros:
+ scenes are impressive and can look visually stunning at times
+ music is very variated and with lots of olds soviet/russian classic pieces.
+ interesting concepts and ideas for gameplay
+ attention to detail, lots of levels are beautifully crafted

Cons:
- Combat feels clunky, unfair and not engaging at all. You sort of have to try it to know it, everything feels off.
- Constantly out of ammo while being stormed by enemies, you never feel like you have a fair fight and often end up avoiding or trying to run away from enemies because your out of ways to fight back.
- Lackluster enemies, that white android robot you see - you will be killing waaaay to many of these.
- Feels very unpolished, I got stuck in the environment forcing me to restart a few times. Sometimes you spawn in to the game only to be instantly attacked by some enemy. Other weird bugs happen quite frequently.
- Weapons are given way to slowly to keep it interesting, 9 hours in and Im still using that laser gun and a shotgun (most the time I cant use the shotgun because Im out of ammo).
- The main character (the one you play) the game feels like a total douchebag, he talks constantly and always has the moste cringe stuff to say.
- HUD/GUI is poorly made, its all white blending in to the environment making it hard to see where your suppose to go and what abilities you have selected.
- Weird movement with controller - when you sidestep you move at a different speed as to when you move forward.
- Lighting in the game is very hit and miss, mostly it looks quite bad and un-natural.

I’m a big sucker for old soviet stuff, but this unfortunately is just not good enough despite the cool setting of soviet era. The absolute worst thing is that the combat is so down right boring. Constantly under powered and unable to fight your enemies in a fun way.

Pros:
* Story and setting are amazing and crafted beautifully
* Crafting and skills are unique and fun to test out different combinations. Since there is no penalty it allows you to try everything and find your niche.
* Doesn't get grindy-- if you take you time to find the loot you pass by you will have enough mats to craft what you need.
* Combat is fun and requires skill. Its not dark souls but is still something you need to learn
* The level design and scenery are amazing. Spent a lot of time admiring my surroundings


Cons:
* Would like to face more difficult enemies, maybe I spent to much time exploring and was over-leveled, but it felt easy enough I set the difficult to armegeddon and still was pretty much invincible by the end.

After all of these things I can safely say this game is not worth it. Not $90 dollars, not $60 dollars, not even $30 dollars.

The story is boring, scant, and confusing. Characters are introduced poorly and killed off quickly. Back story and explanation on people is scarce and when the big reveals start happening you already know. Partially because of the most obvious telegraphing ever and partially because you are not stupid and can see it coming. The ending I got was terrible and without spoiling anything it was terrible because it made no sense and ended suddenly.

The environment is pretty enough but lacking any real depth, it quickly becomes old and irritating. The over-world in particular felt empty except for sparse pockets of robots that would quickly overwhelm you. Most boss fights are terrible with exception of Left, not Right and Left, just Left. The former was fun enough and the latter just immediately recycled itself into pure boredom. Usually a boss can only be beat with melee weapons as the guns do precious little damage until the late stages of the game. Maybe you were supposed to really want those upgrades but without them you are well and truly fu.c.k.e.d. Especially when they randomly put you in a room with 3! plyush. F.U.C.K. THAT! One was bad enough.

The gun play and movement is stiff and clunky without any real sense of snap that is cruscial to shooters and to be clear this game is barely a shooter.

All too often you end up having to stand still and listen to Charles exposit his endless wisdom because if you walk ahead too far the game just auto skips the background dialogue. Dialogue which can't be heard half the time because the voice audio either cuts off abruptly or is drown out by the overwhelmingly bad audio balancing and NO adjusting the music volume will not fix it entirely as some scenes have baked in music louder than the second coming of Christ, almighty, himself.

Writing is poor and character motivations are not always plain as the main character flip-flops back and forth on being stupid, being smart, being pro communism, and two seconds later being pro anarchy.

When I think back I feel it is just forgettable and disappointing and little is worse in media than being forgettable. Atomic Heart, you weren't even bad enough to be remembered. Sub-par in every way.

It runs well on Steam Deck at least.

Where Atomic Heart fell short for me were its very awkward writing choices and dialogue, and a mediocre handling of exploration and progression. Scanning my environment is not fun and slows everything down. Sucking up loot is slow and very fiddly. The abilities and weapons are very cut-and-dry shooter stuff; scopes, extended magazines, ice powers, shock powers...and I found myself neglecting their usefulness because I simply didn't need them, even on the hardest difficulty. Finally, the dialogue. I did not enjoy being the protagonist. Their personality and speech felt juvenile. The conversations between Charles and you (and the horny vending machine) carry on for long bouts, often repeating plot information immediately after receiving it. It was funny, and then eventually stopped being fun, and started really getting in the way of my ability to enjoy the otherwise fantastic tone and atmosphere of Facility 3826.

Yes, it's a very cringe filled experience sometimes intentional, most time quite the opposite but there is a solid and interesting story peeking from under all of it and it touches some very interesting themes along the way. True, it starts off with some Half-life vibes, then feels like Bioshock and Wolfenstein a bit before settling into just being it's own self and when it does, it really kicks in. Gameplay wise it's the exact same stuff, familiar but not to the point of feeling like a lazy rip-off of any of those titles....more of a melee brawler than a shooter, with some light platforming and puzzles to fill in the gaps.  Unfortunately, you will encounter quite a handful of nasty bugs, from desktop crashes to being stuck in the environment, to key presses not being properly registered to plain ugly animations even on max details (busted out laughing when seeing a few characters going down stairs a la Daikatana). 

Addressing the elephant in the room, after playing the whole game I can safely say it contains no russian war propaganda and to be frank, given the themes it touches and the immense sarcasm dosages infused into them, the whole affair is filled to the brim with backhanded and subtle criticism. That's not to mention the fact that the no.1 song you'll end up stuck with in your head (and it's awesome remix) and which was featured in the promos belongs to a singer quite famous for her anti-war/Putin views (to the point that her husband, which fled the country, was designated as a ""foreign agent"").

All in all, 41h on Armageddon difficulty leaving no stone unturned (didn't found it as being a difficult game, nor one with scarce resources as others claimed).

In deeper dept. First of all I am impressed by how optimized this game really is. I used a mid-low PC to run the game, specs were the following:
Intel Core I3-7100
16GB DDR4 RAM
GT1030
The game was ran from a HDD.
With all the settings on the lowest, and screen resolution is lowered to 1280 ✕ 720 the game performed at a stable 60 frames per second on the enclosed space environments. On the open world sections the frames per second was between 30-40. Even with the lowest setting the game was very much enjoyable and graphically beautiful.

The gun play of the game with all the modifications feels good to play. The combat system is simple to pick up, yet it is well balanced on normal difficulty.
The open world sections contain fights, which may feel punishing, when not your arsenal is not yet upgraded, but this can be fixed by doing side missions (testing grounds). During your game I would suggest looting everything that is possible, as few bosses may require your whole inventory worth of ammunition to defeat. 
The game also contains puzzles and parkour parts, which I was personally a fan of as it broke the never ending chaotic battles, that the game can provide. Even if some of the puzzles could be broken or skipped by doing a bit of a parkour.

The games world is absolutely beautiful and well crafted, everywhere you look the scenery gives back the feeling of a atom punk Soviet Union, this is paired with the nice sound tracks and music. Apart from the main story line you can pick up certain background story or few little stories during you exploration, which could give you a much broader perspective about the games world.

The story line is one of the best I've seen in a long time. I will not go into details as I would not want to spoiler any pun/twist/core information that this game can provide. The overall story completion on normal difficulty with all the side missions took me roughly 23 hours.

The overall problem that I have ran into multiple times was few doors like elevators or scripted doors didn't opened, when they should have. This could be fixed by restarting the game, which could be easily done since the game has safe zones almost every corner with save point in it.

Over all, I think that even if this game is one the more cost heavy side of games that steam could offer, I feel like that the game and the story that you will receive, very much worth it and I could only recommend it to anyone.",1678223604,1678223604,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The presentation for this game is absolutely breathtaking.  The graphics, art-style, sound design, music, and voice acting are all top notch.  The opening hour in particular was probably the most jawdropping visual experience i've ever had in a video-game and puts other great openings like that of Bioshock Infinite to shame by comparison.

The primary problems i'm seeing right now is the UI, while pretty, feels cumbersome and the story's reliance on exposition dumps can feel somewhat overwhelming.  Often times i'll find myself listening to someone for upwards to a minute straight only to get pulled into combat and miss out on important information.

I'm also not a fan of the manual save/load locations.  I felt it worked in games like bioshock where your progress was saved regardless and so save spots just changed where the game dropped you when you die.  Comparatively, it's annoying to die in Atomic Heart and have to reloot multiple rooms before progressing forward.

Also, while I suspect the protagonist may go through some sort of character development, his generally dismissive and entitled attitude is a major turn off and makes me dislike him.  This isn't inherently a problem.  If it's intentional then I actually applaud the bold decision.

Story 7/10:
I found it interesting but knowing that at certain points the choice placement of dialogue made it feel like your character was solidly refusing to learn from the evidence around him I can't review it any higher. However for the third act, while I don't believe the writing improved in any meaningful way, I felt HIGHLY invested. I was pumped up for the finale and it felt gooooooood. 9/10 for that moment.

Gameplay 8/10:
Played on Armageddon. Frenetic, fast-paced action that absolutely requires you to be on your toes at all times. Boss fights were bloody incredible, some of the best I've seen in a shooter. Abilities were powerful enough to switch the tide of combat entirely if properly used and quite a bit of fun. Melee felt pretty useless and risky, low damage and leaves you vulnerable. It didn't make sense to have more than 1 melee weapon. If you actively explore the open world you will find more than enough ammo.

Open world 6/10:
Honestly this is likely somewhat just cynicism on my part due to Ubisoft titles but does everything need to be an open world? I think Atomic Heart would've been just fine without it.

Atomic Heart about smart heads and cold hearts.

I'm already waiting for the DLC and the sequel :) It's especially cool if the story of the twins is revealed there, who has completed the game knows what I'm talking about.

Pros:
+ Beautiful visual, very nice picture and beautiful characters.
+ Quality sound, ambient sounds, soundtracks and voice acting, especially Russian voice acting. Yes, yes, the voice for babushka Zina is actually suitable.
+ An interesting story, the plot is passed in one breath. *SPOILER* thought out to such trifles as music from the future.
+ Hardcore game, or rather the strength of even simple ""Vovchick"" makes casual players cry.
+ Large variation of weapons and skills.
+ Quite interesting ""side quests"" that help the game interact with the game world, although it may seem to someone that it is bring - give it. This is an RPG game.
+ Twin robots.
+ There are no stupid Western agendas of the 21st century in this game.
+ There is humor with different overtones. 18+ game.
Cons:
- The main character has a hairstyle that is not typical for 1955 in the USSR - this makes the look at the character not entirely authentic.
- Bosses are actually quite easy.
- **** Pie"" - the protagonist's redundancy.
- Manual saves are already too much, sometimes they can roll back the game progress by 30 minutes back, due to the oversight of the player who *died*.

For Mundfish's first game, this is a very good result. This gives hope that game developers know how to make games. Note to other AAA game developers.
We are proud that our Russian guys were able to do such a miracle, thanks again to Mundfish!",1678181738,1678181738,True,44,0,0.572063565254211426,5,True,False,False

Here's the fix for this exact problem. Go to the main menu and change the in game voice language to Russian. BOOM.

No, you should buy this game because it's beautiful and the story is, as best I can tell, fantastic.  That said...I'll probably never finish it.  The reason why is simple: infinite repair drones.

In Atomic Heart, every area you enter has a certain number of hostile robots, and every area is beautiful.  Every zone is filled with things you'll want to read, listen to, or just plain gawk at.  It's also full of cameras, called Dandelions.  The good news is that you can one-shot these cameras and continue gawking in peace.  The bad news is that the game will spawn INFINITE - and I mean literally never ending, because I've shot down 30+ waves of them all trying to repair the same damn camera - repair drones.  These drones pose almost no threat and can be dispatched with 2 shots from your energy pistol.  They'll even give you some resources, so a useful hack for farming common resources is to shoot a camera in an area without robot patrols, then farm the repair drones for parts for as long as you can tolerate it.  The thing is, the game will continue to send repair drones, and nothing else (okay, OCCASIONALLY it'll spawn a repair drone with a very weak laser attack too, woooo) until one fixes the camera.  Once it finally does, then the camera will spot you and call in infinite waves of very angry, very lethal robots until you either die, or leave the area.

What this means is that you can never just take it all in.  You can't clear an area of hostiles, then calmly enjoy the beautiful world the developers clearly poured their hearts into.  I've played maybe four games, total, where I even WANTED to just have a look around, and I love this one more than the other three.  It's too bad the game itself won't let me.

I am going to look into modding this game and see if I can figure out how to limit how many waves of repair drones the game will spawn.  If I can, then I am absolutely going to finish this.  If I can't...then it's just going to eat space in my library for eternity I guess.  As-is, it's not unplayable, but it's unenjoyable.",1678169730,1678169730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics? Good.

The story? Actually really good.

The combat? Uninspired, nothing ground-breaking here. But it feels solid and at moments is amazing.

The world? Crafted quite well, but isn't really open, you never feel like you are able to explore the world, it's pretty much linear. I hope mods change that a bit, but probably not.

The art? AMAZING

The Music? Again, AMAZING

The English voices? A little strange, the timing is off at times, But I didn't mind it too much. You character seems rather grumpy all the time. But I found it relatable and funny. I mean how would YOU feel if you couldn't remember most of your life, everything is going wrong, people are criticizing your hero and seem kinda right, you don't know who to trust, and all of these robots, puzzles, and mutants courtesy of scientists that don't think of consequences keep getting in your way? Yeah, probably a bit testy.

The overall gameplay? Eh, it feels outdated as all hell. If this game would have released 10 years ago, it would have been revolutionary. But now it is outdated from the get-go. Like a Russian game it takes aspects from other great titles of the time and improves or puts a twist on them. But the problem is that the aspects it's using as a base themselves are OLD.
There is not much fresh to be found here besides the world and design, because art doesn't age like gameplay.

The enemies are fantastic in animation and design, the problem is that you don't really care what enemy grunt you fight. Which would've been fine if the game came out 5-7 YEARS AGO. But since then games have evolved and left the games that Atomic Heart borrows from, in the dust.

In short, this game is a victim of its own ambition. For the devs' first game it is done amazingly well and I respect them for taking the time they needed to make the game they wanted. The problem is, that in the process of making the game, the world moved on, leaving their once inspired ideas tasting stale.

I'd watch out for a second game from this developer. With the majority of the groundwork laid with this game, A second shouldn't take nearly as long and should feel much more fresh.

Should you buy it? Yes, for $60? No. Wait for a sale, I'd say this feels like a $45 game.

Politically speaking should you buy it? Yeah, don't let the actions of some old people in some office somewhere inform YOUR decisions. They already control the world enough. It's a good game, the devs put hard work into it, if you appreciate their work, then buy it. No need for politics in the world of gamers.",1678140304,1678141278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, I'm enjoying the game - but there are a fair few bugs that require you to reload.

Sometimes, when simply walking or jumping, your player model will get stuck in a random bit of the environment. Their feet still moving as if they're running, but completely unable to move.

The difficulty also resets every save. I started on ""armageddon"" - which for my skill level was tough. I dropped it to local malfunction and started a new game for my first playthrough. Every time I launch/load the game, the difficulty resets to armageddon.

These points will, undoubtedly, get patched soon. Overall, the game is fun. I'm loving it - bar the few tiny bugs - and the story is genuinely interesting, with hilarious characters such as the Nymphomaniac fridge...",1678115871,1678115871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's quite refreshing, honestly.

So why the negative review? Frankly speaking, it doesn't give a good first impression. 
The opening segment is too damn long, it drags you around for God knows how much time just to show you the worldbuilding. I admit, it's amazing, the graphics of it are amazing but guys, I've bought the game to shoot things not to watch an interactive benchmark.

And speaking of shooting things, I feel like Mundfish tried their best to make the ""shooting"" part at the beginning unfun as hard as they could.

First of all in my opinion, weapons and abilities are a bit too nerfed at the beginning, hitting 1 mob robot with a hammer like a million times to destroy it sucks fun out of the game for me. Maybe I'm picky here but honestly there are more creative ways to make the game more challenging in this aspect than just making your enemies bullet (hammer?) sponges, especially when you have all those cool robots around that could show their abilities in more various ways.

The game has also a weird fetish for lackluster puzzles and platform segments. Some of those are creative but most of them are a boring chore that just slow your progress down.

The open world segments were also just bad. They lacked content to keep me interested in it as a player, I wouldn't mind if they didn't even exist.

Voice directing sucks. I've played in both of my languages and in both of versions it felt like the voice actors (talented imo) had to think up how they should perform just from the lines they were reading.

Phew that's a lot of complaints, so lemme get to the positives real quickly.

As I stated before, graphics and worldbuilding are amazing. In connection with the soundtrack (that absolutely slaps and nails it) they create a great atmosphere of alternative Soviet reality.
The story is decent and that is enough to make me interested to finish the game.
If you improve your weapons, the shooting is actually fun. It has been too long since I've played a decent slow-paced FPS singleplayer game, so thank you for that. 

So in short, the game didn't really lift the potential it had but was enjoyable netherless. I have faith that Mundfish will address the issues in (hopefully) next production, with all the love they've poured into this game I'm sure they will make something even better next time.

A kick-ass soundtrack, a simple but fun and easy to fine-tune weapon/ability upgrade system in which you are frequently incentivised to perfect your arsenal without any downside or loss in resources. Incredible graphics and aesthetic. I'd say about the only place it falls short is on the story. It's just kind of average for an immersive sim game. It sets up a lot of intrigue, hits a lot of cliche's for the genre at this point but it kind of falls flat trying to explain the polemic and outlandish dialogue, characters and events. Still, the bioshock styled exploration, the frenetic combat switching between weapons based on weaknesses, synergies, range and priority targets accompanied by an unforgettable soundtrack completely carry any issues with narrative beats or conclusions.

Main complaints not tied to the experience itself is the price tag (just a bit too high despite how high quality the product is) and kind of a big one but how the fuck do you make an FPS game without an FOV slider????

Let's redo this redo this review a bit, having just finished the game. I'll conditionally change it to thumbs up, but the taste is still sour about still unfixed kb/m issues and their pathetic groveling at the altar of SJWs. I had lots of fun and I might consider DLCs in the future, so it feels wrong to give it a negative review.

Anyway, the good things:

- IMHO excellent engine optimization overall; the game could in most areas cap 120hz and 144hz easily, even without DLSS; with DLSS you can take it for granted; also plenty of options to adjust the performance for owners of weaker GPUs

- absolutely badass OST

- superb stylization, attention to details good logical progress across the game, wtf world

- decent amount weapons and ""powers"" to use; you can melee enjoyably most/all of the game as well

- sexy robots (later)

- bdsm horny fridge, pity not so many lines from her

the mediocre:

- game is too easy, even on the ""armageddon"" difficulty
- related to the above - game pacing is out of whack - MC becomes overpowered too fast too quickly - especially if you diligently loot stuff
- some ""powers"" really need a nerfstick (or rather a nerfMACE)
- people are experiencing a lot of bugs; achievements are still somewhat broken

the ugly:

- developers (whether themselves or forced by the publisher) sacrificed themselves on the alter of SJW ""muh rassissmuss"" censorship only because few imbeciles from retardera/twatter/pcgamer complained about few frames in one of Nu Pogodi episodes

- KB/M support - for a fps - is a catastrophe [b]if you try to move away from wasd[/b]; a lot of keys are hardcoded (menu/inventory, iteraction, QTE, swim up/down, cartridge swapping, car left/right), some other are both hardcoded and bugged (rebinding doesn't work - weapon cycling, car forward/backward) - hardware-level rebindable keyboard recommended/mandatory

- Filatova - a blatant western AAA-like product - hair colored side shaved androgynous wahmen: https://i.imgur.com/EcNeM2c.png ; makes you wonder if it was Mundfish's original vision or FI's pressure at some point in development

- ""crispy critters"" ? what the fuck ? just say ""fucking hell"" or something similar

okay so I have officially completed Atomic Heart... I will not lie the story was interesting but i also found it a little lacklustre. I think some variety in enemies would've been nice, i think I VS'd like 5 bosses all up story wise and that is with doing side shit too. 
Combat otherwise feels pretty fun and there is a variety of weapons you can use... but i felt like some of the upgrades provided different benefits but made not much of a difference. The abilities are also cool but it sucked you could only have 2 at a time. 
A lot of the open world part is somewhat boring and doesn't force you to explore as the extra shit is easier to get to by car and is in these designated areas. some puzzles are hard just because there a bit finicky as well. 
The soundtrack was really good though and enjoyed that. 
The crafting system was also somewhat a nuisance, the most common crafting materials was also like the hardest thing to come buy it felt like. That was usually the hardest thing for me to keep stocked. There was a dissemble menu too which you could dissemble certain shit for crafting material. There is a few other bits and pieces you can sue in combat but i found them to be a bit whatever as they did not feel needed and just clogged inventory space. 
They tried to put some form of emphasis on type match up but in reality it felt like i could still mow down shit with no issues. 
Looting was also kinda broken at times. It would show that it could be looted and give the indicator to press F for it, then would not loot or it would also miss a little bit and show a lootable but not allow me to. You also get stuck on weird bits of geometry sometimes or can soft lock your self in certain places if you dash jump weirdly.

""Physics puzzles"" play poorly.

Dungeons are super tedious.

Throw mechanic can be bugged easily.

Every enemy knocks you down regardless how maxed out your character is.

Every enemy defaults to the knock down every other attack.

Enemies respawn constantly and the repair drones never stop respawning.

Enemies are sponges.

The CCTV system is hard to see but they see you all the time.

You get attacked when you're talking to people and it locks you in until you die or stop the dialogue.

No mosin nagants in a 1950s Russian science facility is like a cowboy movie without Winchesters or revolvers.

The scan function doesn't help because it doesn't update the lore. 

Can't put down map markers

Map bugs out and have to reload every time this happens and it happens alot.

Enemies crowd you instantly with their knock downs to the point of being stuck against a box because they bugged you.

Can't jump while holding items in a game where you have to hold items for puzzles and platform.

Игра- шедевр. К сожалению это уже стало редкостью что игра в первый же день работает без мини игры в патчи. На Линуксе все работает идеально без просадок без доп. Настроек, в первый раз такой уровень оптимизации за последние лет 5-10 (даже дум этернал на релизе работал хуже). Разработчикам мое почтение, я вообще не фанат такого рода игр, но захотелось попробовать и честно говоря очень рад. Все на высоте, начиная от технического исполнения заканчивая музыкой и стилистикой, уровень в театре это нечто. Если какие замечания и имеются то это по части языка, после покупки на стиме на русский, на момент прохождения, переключить не получится, а английский в таком сеттинге смотрится инородно, так что готовьтесь комрады-мажоры :) В общем очень рекомендую.

The game is a masterpiece. Works on Linux without any additional tweaking. First time in a long time I see that level of optimization on release. This is a good precedent to set for other developers, no over hyped release dates, no delays (maybe I was out of the loop) just solid performance on day one, without “early betas” and so on. Imo developers managed to take every advantage of the video game medium as an art form, there is no way it would be possible to realize such a vision in a movie or a book. The music, the assets, overall styling is 10\10 my personal favorite being the theater level. The only issues I had was with language switching.

- [b]Absolutely amazing OST with huge variety[/b]

- [b]Great gameplay:[/b] The glove abilities are all powerful and fun to use, the gunplay is good, all weapons have their own strengths and several upgrade paths, some of which significantly alter how you use the weapon, for example turning a regular pistol into a high power revolver that shoots 4 bullets at once. Almost all the boss fights were awesome spectacles.

- [b]A good PC port:[/b] I feel like I need to highlight this because so many AAA developers nowadays seem incapable of delivering functional PC ports and an unknown Russian studio just comes out of nowhere and shows how it's done. 

- [b]Best looting animation in a video game ever[/b]

- [b]Ballerinas[/b]

- [b]Stunning art direction:[/b] Facility 3826 and it's robots/mutants are impressive and a joy to explore. The world is beautifully realized and this combined with the music is what makes this game a truly unique experience that will stay in my memory.

[h1]NEGATIVE[/h1]
- [b]Too much downtime sometimes:[/b] If you did every testing ground in the game to unlock all the weapon upgrade blueprints you will find yourself spending more time solving puzzles than in combat. You could say it depends on your preferences whether you think this is good or bad but it certainly did start mentally exhausting me at some point. I think a better balance between combat and puzzle solving would have benefited the game.

- [b]The story and dialogue:[/b] While I wouldn't call the story outright bad it is nothing special. It is perfectly serviceable until the last stretch where it flubs it, the endings are quite bad. It felt like they ran out of time and/or budget. What exasperates the issue is the dialogue. P-3 and CHAR-LES like to talk; they like to talk [b]A LOT.[/b] And most of it is just banter or quips. Some of it did make me chuckle or even laugh but it doesn't feel fitting for the situation you're in. I think the world of Atomic Heart is far more interesting than it's story, therefore I would have preferred if they just let the world speak for itself rather than having my main character constantly talking to his glove.",1678024574,1678028275,True,2,1,0.459940642118453979,0,True,False,False

Eventually you get to a pretty open area that you can freely explore, but the game has almost no checkpoints anywhere. They're almost entirely fixed locations that are too far spread out, so dying means replaying 20 or so minutes of the game all over again. This wouldn't be such a big deal to me if I wasn't constantly dying to things that are out of my control such as getting stuck on the environment. This happens a lot. Try to climb a crate or over a rock? Get stuck in mid air and have to reload that checkpoint that was 20 minutes ago. Fighting enemies can cause similar issues. They can either pin you somewhere that you can't get out of or they can knock you into a pile of chairs where you get stuck in mid air again and then have to reload or die. It didn't feel so bad in the early game because the manual save stations are close enough. It becomes so much worse in the open world sections. Atomic Heart has other issues as well such as the main character and pretty much most of the dialogue being painful to listen to. It feels like if Bullet Storm tried to take itself seriously at all. That's this games script. Just immature, cringe worthy garbage written by toddlers, but expected to be taken seriously in most cases. Only positive things I can say about Atomic heart is that while the game isn't being annoying, the combat is pretty fun. Also, it's super well optimized. This game just runs with no issue at all.

The writing feels very ""written in Russian and then put through a translator"" rather than having a fresh script written in English. On top of the awkwardness and stilted dialog that causes, the dialog is also very DUDE BRO, if that makes sense, like Duke Nukem taken seriously. I don't think the actual plot is very well presented either, and thus you have little motivation as a player outside of pure gameplay.

The gameplay is... fine. It's strange in that it mixes Bioshock style indoor areas with Far Cry style outdoor areas with some Doom bosses thrown in for good measure. It doesn't feel focused, and since it took 6 years to develop I'm guessing the team were pulling themselves in lots of different directions rather than focusing on being the best at A or B. It also has that janky feel, you know what I mean, which does it no favors. Last but not least, no video game player in this world likes respawning enemies. None, zero, zip.

Art design is cool and yet also feels repetitive, like once you've seen some whacky alt-future Soviet robotic stuff you've kind of seen the rest of it? The lighting can look pretty simplistic and flat a lot of the time too, robbing the game of a richness it needs. This is especially true in the outdoor areas, where building interior lighting straight-up looks like a 15 year old game (Crysis for example).

Anyway... those are my best guesses as to why I don't enjoy this as much as I should. I'll probably finish it eventually. It's not BAD really, just... meh.",1677996709,1677996709,False,3,0,0.523675382137298584,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack was god-tier, easily one of the best parts of the game, and the art direction was absolutely incredible. 

I'd say that the story got a little incoherent but was overall competent. The voice acting and dialogue was slightly odd but I got used to it, its what happens when you have a foreign dev and things don't quite translate correctly. Also, the open world was absolutely point less, I didn't interact with it at all and just went towards where I was supposed to go. I never even noticed it really. Just drove to my destinations.

Some of these things was the implementation of a couple of mechanics that you had to figure out was there by your self, and while that isn't it is self a bad thing, its the fact that these mechanics are sometimes only used 3 times right after each other, and then you never see that mechanics again.
The dialog felt so bad and stiff most of the times, the banter would be fine, if it would actually develop through the game, but it honestly don't contribute anything to the game.
Your own character, seems smart and thought full at the beginning of the game, but the further you get it, it is almost like he becomes stupider, and more like a mindless meathead, that only know how to shoot guns.

Now the weapons and ""powers"" of the game, you use the melee weapon the first 60-70% of the game, even on higher difficulties, since the guns are really underwhelming compared to the use of melee abilities, even if you fully upgrade them, and most mobs are just a sponge.
Most bosses, debuff and use fire, kite and dodge, your guns will not hurt them that much, just use the glove.

The game had a overwhelming amount of sexual undertones, and in most cases, the developer is as subtle as a sledgehammer with it, especially since in one cases your literally sticking your feelers into a keyhole that's shaped vagina and decorated with a clit and a surrounding ""sun""pattern that looks like pubic hair.

Its borderline impossible to backtrack if you missed a weapon upgrade earlier, so you might as well forget all about that if you didn't get it on your way past it or you forgot it.

Once you get to a certain point of the game, for some strange reason, its like the developers thought they were making Doom, and I don't understand why, the combat music after the 70% mark suddenly goes up to eleven, even if there is only 1-3 normal enemies.

TL;DR: Over all rating, its not worth the full 60€, wait for it to drop around 35-40€ instead, the developers tried to put too many different things into the game all at once, and it became a mediocre mess, they had a great model, but the deviated from it, and something that could have been great, became something forgettable.

I took a moment to realize I couldn't play the open world game the way I would have preferred and continued onward with the story.

No online connection needed, No pay to win, No plethora of worthless cosmetics to buy with IRL money that sums well over the actual game price. Its just a work of masterful work crafting and interesting story telling. Fun weapons and view point of an Alternate reality in the Soviet Union during the mid 50s. 
Love the futuristic/ sci fi look of the Science the world has, but still reminds you its the 50's and its gonna be a big leap and change for humanity. 
A few little complaints that can be remedied via updates soon I hope, Dialog skipping seems to be a bit buggy skipping too much or to little. Certain angles or positions to looting items in the world becomes annoying or impossible (normally not big loot). Completing some mini steps to unlock the training rooms can be buggy and not register until reloading the game (which is easy plenty of save points but pls fix that). Some main character dialogue can be missed/ skipped unintentionally by walking into certain areas, or using NORA (pls fix that). 

Overall this game is a breath of fresh air, in a game industry of 2023 that would trough out shitty pay to win or broken and buggy games full of broken promises and lackluster content, Rather than release a game that has been loved on since day one developing. This Game does not do any of that. Just a plain ole fashioned shoot em up, loot em up, power yourself up, and conquer enemies in any way you wish! Characters are fun, serious, or straight up mental (some of em) and good comedy at times.

Its as bad if not worse than many other games recently slapping on the rinse and repeat no thought put into it battle royale modes. There is very little original in concept, they attempted very poorly to slap on a GTA most wanted system, making playing the game in anyway other than a failed attempt at being ghost recon stealth simulator knock off without getting swarmed by numerous rinse and repeat enemies that all feel incredibly feature-empty.

Overall I cannot recommend this game, simpy for this part of it.

Games were never meant to be political tools for stuff and war, and its very saddening to see a highly anticipated game be tainted weeks before release. maybe im biased seeing that i've waited for release since 2020, or maybe its a coping mechanism since the allegations  all that are tainting the game. whatever you please, its your own choice. Overall great game with intricate story and customiztion of weapons, its not much but better simple, beautiful designs and the nickname ""soviet bioshock"" really fits. 

However there are some thing i do not like:

no sprinting: dashing only makes it a lot unnatural to the character, instead of running you just sidestep like a smash bro player.

The dialogues: dubs are mid, better put it in the native russian with subtitles, hell, maybe you'll learn some russian words beside cyka blyat. Its enought they have dubs for other players to enjoy, but clashes with the soviet aesthetic.

Gameplay: it has RPG mechanics that i hate, for example, some bosses have elemental weakneses, but that is better going off the game, since this essentially means that 1/4 into the fight, you already chug all your ammo and you are forced going melee the rest of the fight. and melee to save ammo is a nice mechanic given the situation the main area puts you into, with you scraping the scrap of the robots to craft, but some enemies are not made to be encountered into melee distance, essentially making you play sneakily, which another thing the game does not nail well. too many cameras and dandelions, every 4 step into the open I am met with a camera alerting me, and whe i get alreted, they send way to many enemies.

Character: agent P-3 is another classic instance of a character that goofs around for the game, and yes while he starts to change as the game progresses towards the end, gaining a serious grasp of the situation and reality he lives in. making him as related to the main characters from forspoken or Hi-Fi Rush is a bad idea, moreso related to the main character in forspoken. however, I believe they toned it down just a few notches, too many one liners and WHO THE F*CK THOUGHT ""crispy critters"" IS A CATCH FRASE?!. maybe as dlc goes on they fix this

But do not fret! do not let this pull you aside from the game, this is a full fledge story based game of ""what if?"" for a good price and no micro transactions for stuff, planned stuff for dlc and much. this game has a bright future, do not let its grim background affect your perception of the game.

An Outer Worlds, Fallout, Destiny symphony well worthy of its popularity. As is my usual format, Ill break down aspects of the game and leave it to you to decide if you want to play. This will contain NO spoilers, just general information about the game and my opinions.

Gameplay and Story-
Atomic Heart is a rather short, yet extensive game, with a plethora of dialogue, endings, and choice when going about your playthrough. The game took me a little over 15 hours to complete without doing much exploring, but could easily be done in 10 hours or shorter if one sat down and grinded the game (which i don't recommend). The story is complex, with many characters, bosses, monsters, and various robot types. The endings are incredibly complex, and the story itself is full of twists and turns, and leaves you constantly trying to figure it out. Ill comment on the protagonist in its own piece, as i think he could get a paragraph to himself. The game didn't feel repetitive, although, I do wish you could skip cutscenes... only in a few instances did i find myself replaying a boss (the first twin) and dreading that the save was right before a cutscene. Outside of that, the story kept my attention and was well worth trying to figure out. Just try not to overthink the hallucination stuff... In terms of powers and weapons, some definitely stand out as being much better than others, but all in all, you do get variety in how you want to play and defeat enemies. I found myself mostly sticking to the shotgun and the AK, but if you wanted to pursue the other weapons, or tackle a melee run, you absolutely could. Just don't forget to stock up on elemental charges! This game looks unique, and has a beautiful aesthetic, mirroring on the Outer Worlds or occasionally Destiny/Fallout. With a massive open-world map and a decent looting mechanic, there is lots of exploring potential. This game falls short on actually giving you a reason to explore though, as there is no waypoint mechanic beyond main objective waypoints, and no real side quests. You can explore other facilities at your leisure, and can come across weapon upgrades and perhaps be able to upgrade your weapons to the max- but this is by no means essential unless you're playing the hardest difficulty. You can beat all of the bosses with the unupgraded shotgun and the axe if you want to, it may take you a little bit longer but its absolutely doable. All-n-all, i found myself most dissapointed by the large abyss of a map- if i could change one thing, it'd be to give players a reason to explore the massive map youve clearly put time into creating. Give it substance, a sidequest or an easter egg, something.

The Characters, Protagonist, Antagonists and Bosses -
This game was a fantastic example of the more the merrier. A ton of different kinds of robots, monsters, and enemies are available in the game to face at different points, and the variation in the bosses and how to beat them is just incredible. The game had several bosses, majority of them being robots, and majority of them being fun, interesting, and challenging to fight. Id actually argue that the final boss fight isn't as tough as some of the previous ones (but this REALLY depends on your difficulty and playstyle... in the hardest gamemode, i'm SURE this is much different)... The medium difficulty is definitely a recommended place to start, as some enemies will be incredibly easy, but some bosses may take a few tries to nail. The PROTAGONIST is one of the most unique characters i've ever seen, as he is one of the most entertaining, yet braindead characters ever made. He has a lot of funny and interesting dialogue, especially with CHAR-LES and NORA, but falls short on the brains aspect. He is a 1-trick. Hes funny, and badass, but that's about it. Hes clueless majority of the game, very naive, makes very questionable decisions majority of the game out of the players control, and is all-n-all, unpredictable. I found myself gasping at some of his decisions and his thought process. Lets just say, hes not the brightest. The game is full of antagonists and bosses, and they're all rather interesting. Having this portrayed in the USSR, you can tell the game is trying to play the sides of both the Capitalist and the Communist, and the banter between which is better. This plays a role to some extent as to why decisions are made by the Protagonist/Antagonist, but can easily be ignored. The Antagonists are genuinely unpredictable, and the bosses are all unique, with different fighting styles and different appearances/purposes. 

Music -
The music choice for this game was flawless... I love the variation, as you had some ""Fallout"" esq music, but then some ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" music. The game is full of Soviet classics, while also being covered by heavy metal. I tell you what, when you're going on a ""Killing Floor"" style rampage late game and that heavy metals kicks in, nothing beats it.

Achievement Hunting -
I'm sorry to break it to yall, but this game is not achievement huntable as of release. A reasonable chunk of the achievements are broken, most frustratingly. I pray the developers will fix them soon, but would say, as someone who likes to 100% games, this one was sad to see uncompletable. 

Ill be completely honest, i did genuinely enjoy this game, and think as its one of the studios earliest creations, that it makes me excited to see what they'll make in the future. The NORA scenes especially stand out to me, as they were my absolute favorites. I wish there was more with NORA throughout the story, but im just glad they had the idea in the first place. Anyways, i loved this game, and think you should give it ago if you have $60 and 15 hours to spare!",1677970899,1677970899,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is a one of the most uniquely bizarre and yet cookie cutter games I've ever played. Gameplay wise it doesn't really do anything new. Sort of like Bioshock meets Far Cry with a bunch of other added mechanics we've all seen before. Basically throwing crap at a wall and seeing what sticks. Surprisingly a lot of it works and it makes for a decently enjoyable action shooter. Defiantly has that slavejank feel buried under a pretty AAA presentation. Bugs, some half baked ideas, clunky controls, iffy writing, overly ambitious design, crazy story, etc. 

The art design and presentation is fantastic. There is an insane amount of detail put into almost every aspect of the in game world. You can defiantly see where the devs took their inspiration from but there are enough new things added that give this game a unique look and feel. The music is excellent too, if a bit all over the place. A mix of argent metal, industrial, Eastern European techno, synthwave, licensed tracks, old timey Soviet music and remixes. Boss and arena fights always have a cool track picked for them. One of the best video game soundtracks I've heard in a while. Unfortunately there is almost no in game world interaction. Everything aside from a few props is nailed down. Pretty to look at, but you can't really touch it. Also the sound effects for the weapons and powers just don't sound punchy. It drags the combat experience down a little because of this. This is in stark contrast to the really well done animations for both the player and the enemies.

The voice acting is... rough. You can tell that this game was translated. The VAs do a okay job but I think some parts were lost in translation because the way some of the characters speak is a little off. This is especially present in the main character. One second P-3 is serious, then joking about, followed by raging and yelling. He also talks way to much. The writing isn't quite MCU levels of cringe but the tonal shifts, excessive and strange use of profanity with odd phrasing just hits the ear wrong. I can't comment on the Russian voice acting as I don't speak Russian.

The story is alright. I won't spoil anything but you can more or less see the twists coming from a mile away. It's easy to follow and carries you through the game. The tone is strange. It goes back and forth between serious high stakes sci-fi and wacky fever dream. It does a good job at reflecting the main character's questionable mental state throughout the game. The other characters have understandable motives but they all seem pretty one dimensional. The setting is the interesting part. There was a lot of effort in creating the lore for world and it's worth your time to search for it. It compliments the main story pretty well.

On the technical side the game runs well. I've got a slightly above average rig and it ran with a consistent frame rate at max settings. A few stutters hear and there but it never crashed. There are however some bugs. Nothing game breaking. Just the occasional wonky animation, pop in, physics related shenanigan, enemies hitting you through a wall and occasionally getting stuck on level geometry. It defiantly feels jankey at times.

Another thing; no inappropriate political messages, virtue signaling or writer self inserts to talk down to the player. I cannot overstate how refreshing it is when a AAA game is released that does not comment on, mention, pander to or reflect on the current state of cultural affairs. There are politics discussed in the game but they are only relevant to the setting. Considering this is a 1950s retro-futuristic USSR setting you can imagine what they are. But, again, it's only brought up in relevant context to the story.

Overall pretty fun. I don't feel like I wasted my money so that's good I suppose. It didn't blow me away, I wouldn't say it's mediocre, but not a masterpiece. It defiantly has a unique look and feel.

My biggest problem with the game is without a doubt the detection system, where if you are spotted on a security camera in the open world, robots spawn on your position and overwhelm you. It feels like an unnecessary punishment in a game that encourages exploration and resource collection. And then, on top of that, when you kill a robot, it doesn't stay dead because a repair robot comes along and fixes it right up. So fights never feel WON. You're always running away from fights instead of winning them. 

And then there's the puzzles. This game is filled with far too many puzzles. Why, in a game that features traditional Skyrim-style lockpicking are there ALSO doors that have complicated locking mechanisms on them? Just pick one and stick with it. It's completely unnecessary, and makes me not want to explore entire levels because of the hassle of getting from point A to B. 

Finally, there's the dialogue and the story, which is so wordy (with clumsy, awkward, bad words too) and techno-babbly, it's completely unengaging. And the protagonist is just a complete jerk, all the time, everywhere. I've never liked a protagonist less. I wish he would just shut up.

Even though I'm running a PC damn near a decade old, even on potato graphics, the world is beautiful. I loved the story, and the titbits of lore around the world. I'm currently on my second play-through and I still get excited when I find something new. The game play is fun and enjoyable, more en-depth than a typical FPS which is nice. I hear a lot of people call this ""Soviet Bioshock"" but that's not the case. Although I can see the inspiration and influences of said game; Atomic Heart truly is a game that stands on its' own uniqueness.  

I wish they added a couple more variants of enemies to spice things up. Or maybe an extra weapon or two. I think it would've been neat to see what they could've done with an SKS, and have that as a DMR. I the game could've benefited from having a med-to-long range weapon, but balance it with smaller ammo capacity. I also would've liked it if say the characters didn't wear such similar uniforms. Since all the garrison troops you find all wear the same (no different ranks, no officers or specialists), and the main character wears a very similar jumpsuit to all the others jumpsuits wearers. Some distinction and variety would've helped to make things feel less... samey? Perhaps when DLC and mods start coming in, things will change up, but I digress.

Haven't finished the game yet, so story might be worth it. So far the story line isn't god-tier, but it is entertaining enough to keep me playing. 
The English dub is painful to listen to and ruined the immersion for me. You can change the settings so the voice lines are in Russian and the subtitles are in English, but the subtitles are very small and it's hard to read them during combat. Also, any dialog outside of the character, the glove, and direct intractables do not provide a subtitle for translation. 
I really enjoy the mechanics in the game. It was like they took pieces from all my favorite games and put them into one. I also like that there is an option for aim assist AND auto aim on controller. It is a personal preference, but I like to play games for their stories and can be deterred by their combat. This games has options so that there is still combat, but it is not the bread and butter of the game. That being said, for those who crave a heavy combat game, you can change the difficulty and settings to meet your preference.
Overall I would give the game a 7/10.

the open world is bland and full of nothing and didn't feel worth exploring besides going between the rather easy  weapon upgrade puzzle dungeons

the story was incredibly predictable

most of the weapons and abilities sucked especially the electric weapons beat most of the game with one melee weapon(the fox) and only started shooting things because i had so much ammo. the final boss fight swapping to a different melee weapon and making short work of that as well

the achievements at this time do not track properly found and cleared 3/8 testing grounds even though i did 7 found 12 out of 24 lootygains when i had 21, and if i only found 3 testing ground it should be 9 not 12

that being said the combat is incredibly good and felt really satisfying

As long as the devs learn from the mistakes made in this game, I'm sure the next games will be even better. The visuals and sound are great. The combat system is a bit lackluster, but doesn't ruin the experience. If you're planning on the hardest available difficulty, then the game will constantly punish you for exploring the world by having infinite enemies (unless you do something about this, but even then the measure is temporary). The writing is... a bit cringey. Especially when you consider the dev's obvious political agenda. But even if you put that side, some of dialogues are just weird.

Forewarning!
FOV is kind of jank. You will loose enemies in fights and they attack quite fast
Trophies seem to reset every session. Not sure if it really is resetting, or just the number on the progression.
Playing on the hardest difficulty and I've noticed enemies WILL rubber-band to you during their mid air attack. 
TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TATALKALK <-- Last one is one conversation overlapping another conversation. 

Game just needs some TLC patches. You fix the above, you got my... (Atomic)... heart. ;) 

In Summary!
Game still fun, vending machine is still bae, excited to see more. 

After Completion 
The game thumps! The music as you fight a robot is top notch! It set the mood perfectly! Have some headphones ready or a good sound system. Mix matching the powers made me feel like a walking talking badazz jigsaw with these enemies. Story wasn't hard to sort out. But I will say two things did happen I didn't see coming. Both threw me off a bit. Only one made me kind of salty (elevator ride that fads to white right towards the end). However, besides that, A MASSIVE good job Devs! I enjoyed it quite a bit! (You can tell with how much I'm ""!"" everything! <- Even here!)

PS
It is NOT pro bad ideas.

The game is very stable since day one but still some incomplete or un-optimized aspects of the game creep up. The most annoying parts is when the game softlocks--when an elevator wasn't programmed to come back up so you cannot revisit a training facility or standing between two wooden boxes and falling in-place forever. The game crashed once on me when I was repeatedly electrifying an enemy. Also, the game slows down when using scanner mode and you're close to anything of interest. The most mindless neglect from the developers is the inability to craft the shotgun due to the lack of a recipe for it: you either have to keep it in storage the whole game or use it as the primary ballistic gun. I've also observed a lack of subtitling near the end of the game or lack of translating the last document of the game (not sure if that was intentional).

Gameplay loop is above average but not spectacular. Very Bioshock, System Shock, Fallout inspired weaponry and combat. The best part of the combat is the 5 melee weapons which offer a number of interesting mods (besides Fox) to dictate how you're supposed to play. Then you have 4 ballistic weapons to use against organic and robotic enemies--each weapon being valid in their own right and having a purpose. Then there are 3 energy weapons that range from weak, medium and strong--most likely stick to medium unless you go through the training grounds for the mods for the weak energy weapon. Luckily, all resources are in a close pool so disassembly the guns will give all the resources back. Plasmids too.

The idea and setting of the world is great and reading through the documents from terminal and chirpers fleshes it out a lot. Main complaint is that the testing grounds are not really exciting to explore even if they make sense in the world. Definite bizarre moments and cringe dialogue choices and strange moral/philosophical ramblings throughout the game to keep me engaged. English dub is lacking (and cringey most times) but after knowing the story once the game should be played in the native language. 

Good game with way to much to type out in one review but very much recommend for anyone already interested in the game. Excited for the sequel!",1677939403,1677939403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I saw a first trailer I immediately got hooked with the unique vision, style and design of this game. What happens with me really not often, especially last 7-8 years. 

I said to myself ""this is daym awesome, I WANT to play it!"". 

But next 5 years of development turned out to be really complicated as for a developers, so do for all the people who've been waiting: many scandals, rumors, provocations, disappointments, attempts to accuse this game in propaganda and even BAN this game just because it was made by russian developers. 
At the same time those dumb people didn't even try to think how long the team and main author was working on this project. Since 2008! Long time before this ""war"".
But really-really dumb people don't care. 
And even now trying to accuse, complain, and even prophesying this game to repeat a destiny of cyberbug 2077.

Even through this I didn't stopped believing and waiting for this game.

Eventually the game was released.
I pre-ordered it, finished it.
And now I feel pity. 
I feel pity that this game ended.
During whole my walkthrough I didn't want this game to end. No way.
I visited every single polygon, visited every single location, found every single upgrade for every single weapon.
And I want more.
The design, the art-style, the music, the attention to details are mind-blowing! (many music tracks went to my playlist even)
Fighting robots and mutants is fun and SO satisfying.
Exploring is addictive. This unique style and details were keeping my interest during WHOLE walkthrough. I was always wondering ""what will be next, what will be further"". 
An interesting ""semi-open-world"" game in 2023?! Is that possible?! YES and YES!

And don't forget this: NO LGBT-crap propaganda, FINALLY feminine characters that emphasize female beauty, NO diversity!
The only disadvantage is a terrible, ugly hairstyle and hair colour of Filatova, like a crap from a modern world. But it can be fixed by mod soon, I suppose. And it doesn't ruin the experience.

For a first project of developers it's a truly fantastic job.
I'm extremily happy that games like Atomic Heart are still exist... among this idealess pile of neverending ""AAA-""bulls**t.

You're one of the reason I'm still interested in videogames industry, Mundfish.
Please, don't stop making such a unique games with unique worlds.
And I'm sure I will definitely get back in this world again soon.

As for dialog, use this tip: set the Audio Dialogue to Russian and use English subtitles. Personally, P3's Russian voice just fits him better and the game feels so much more immersive, and it fixes any VO pacing issues in English.

Finally, how's the story? It's crazy, it's over the top, and it's weird...which honestly is perfectly fine and fits the insane atmosphere of the game. The game knows exactly what it is, and it's not trying to be something it isn't.

Very well-balanced, which is super hard to find these days. Some people say ""Oh the enemies are bullet sponges"" don't be those people. Those people are dumb. Use to tools the game gives you to think more than the desk your computer sits on and figure out enemy weaknesses. You get just enough ammo to always have it, but not enough to not worry about it. First few ""bosses"" feel like mini bosses, but that first real boss is good. I found myself going ""Oh snap, I don't think I'm ready for this"" and after getting beat up for a minute I was like ""ohhhhhhhh, that's what I'm supposed to do"" That's kind of how the whole game is at least up to where I'm at. The difficulty is good on normal. You feel challenged and engaged, but don't really die unless you mess up. I've died twice in 11 hours for those counting. Overall, I was pretty hyped seeing the trailers for this game but didn't get to play it for like a week after it came out. I started seeing reviews and had mixed expectations going in. I want to say wholeheartedly that this game is worth the money and time. If you like RPG's, a moderate and fair challenge, and interesting worlds that peak your intrigue this is the game for you. I only have two negative things to say about the game. 1. Sometimes the parkour mechanics are dumb and unintuitive. You may find yourself going ""NO NO DO NOT GRAB THAT LEDGE FFS LET GO"" and 2. The protagonist is a little annoyingly cynical. Like why are you so mad bruh? Who hurt you? Why do you gotta take it out on everyone around you? It's ok to feel other feelings sometimes.

General thoughts: I thought the twist was obvious very early on but I really didn't see the ending being that way. Played both endings and I'm a little disappointed with no true good ending. Also, it would be nice to have the option to do Russian voice with English subs (like Metro) (still learning Russian, not quite that proficient, but I did love reading things and then being able to check for accuracy by walking up to them for the English translation; I would even correct some of them.) Jumping mechanic is wack, to just suddenly generate momentum in some direction while in mid-air. Story overall was pretty engaging and wildly relevant to some of the patterns in today's world. Even in the alternate present portrayed by this game, one can see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The minds of the world seldom follow with the technology utilized by them. I feel like the endings also left room for another game potentially; I would be fine either way if it was left as is or there was some sort of follow-up. Maybe not even a full game but an add-on DLC. I would like to be able to change the radio in the cars. I think something should be gained from each major complex's research.

Cons: A little buggy still but not to the point of being unplayable. Some things would rainbow until I walked close/on them. About 3/4 of the way through the game, achievements stopped popping but I don't know if that is the game's fault or Steams's. And there were a lot of lit up corpses and loot boxes that I could not interact with no matter the angle. Also there are some chests that are inside of mountains and therefore inaccessible unless I am just missing something. Maybe it's just my time in Elden Ring but bosses felt a little easy if I just ran circles and dodged occasionally. The only enemies that really gave me trouble are the Plyush since they just won't die and often caught me in their quick time combo. The electro pistol should have the option to aim down the sights and assign the special attack to another button. I think all glove powers should be assignable at the same time because Jet is situationally useful but it relies on other elements (Shok, lasers, or freeze) to be used which unless you only use Shok, limits you to not using the shield and/or telekinesis (I didn't find out how good those were until late game). Elevator times were too long.

Eroticism: Can't wait for the robophilia update/DLC so I can give NORA all the polymer she really deserves. The scenes with the Twins are somehow erotic despite the actions they perform, very graceful in what they do always. And those little grenade launcher robots that waddle the streets... I'd overheat their coils in a private room.

Pros: By far the best game I have ever had for picking things up but not having to worry about inventory management. No one-by-one searching and all extras get sent to storage is definitely something I'd like to see in other games, some even retroactively. Weapon variety was good and I tried almost all of them (except every melee) but some seemed like they were only meant for early game even when fully upgraded. The different upgrade paths for each weapon were nice along with the more cosmetic functions like optics. I think the only thing missing is a DMR/sniper. The glove powers are really nice, remind me a lot of older games that emphasize ""video-gamey"" powers. I only realized in later game how well they can be tailored to your playstyle, shield is very nice for melee whereas the freeze with jet is nice to stop enemies from flooding you while you shoot the others. Variety of enemies was nice. Having robots and the run-off from failed projects (mutants) was nice, although I did not feel the need to specialize my weapons for mutants ever since I could deal with them more easily. It was also cool that they generally went about their primary purpose while not killing humans like sawing logs, tending fields, etc. Granny Zina's little Baba Yaga hut chicken was pretty cool.

Political Bit: I am happy to have gotten this game at full price with the pre-order bonuses. I will make sure to only get Stalker 2 after a few years on a Steam winter sale at 80% discount. ;",1677902523,1677902523,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the best games I have ever played, followed closely by Dying Light, it has a very open but a very constructed story line with little choices but still overall a very good game. The game is enough of a challenge where you wont get bored, and at most a heavily packed area, or a boss fight, should only take you a few attempts to beat, which keeps the game engaging. During my entire play through of the game, there was so much more to explore than just what the campaign leads you to do. Overall a very good game. To mention also, that the game was ""canceled"" for being pro Russian and anti-Ukraine, I saw nothing that was pro anyone in the game, despite the setting of the game being Russian, if anything they should be praised for what they have done, and the way they set it, call me a crazy person, but this game has meaning.

Its a good idea to keep in mind that there is no level system, but there is a progression system, in which you are rewarded certain weapons, for exploring certain places. Which leads into scavenging, a very important part of the game, which without, makes the game very difficult, as its the main way to get good weapons, and a variety of resources to craft upgrades, bullets, weapons, canisters and much more.

Atomic Heart's setting
The setting that is used in Atomic Heart is INCREDIBLE to say the least, their attention to detail is top notch, and unmatched, they have easter eggs hidden everywhere, and every detail is to the finest quality. They, unlike many other games, don't go for a grand huge approach, but a tight and cramped, dystopian feel. It is a good point to mention that it is not necessary to play this game on maximum quality for the game to have the same level of detail and immersion, as most of the changeable setting effect the shading, and other small details, like blades of grass. Another fair point to mention is that as you progress on in the game, that the level of detail only increases, and never decreases, unlike Disney movies.

Click bait in ATOMIC HEART
When recommending this game to friends, many of them inquired about the twins, Left and Right, and their appearance in the game, without trying to spoil, the twins don't show up all that much in comparison to the amount of time that the game takes to complete. Although the twins have a lower screen time than other robots, they were still heavily advertised.

Action in Atomic Heart
I was at first hesitant to spend money on the game as I saw the ads, and some other people playing the game and I didn't know if I would like close quarters combat, but in the end it turned out to provide a level of difficulty that is very different from other games that I am used to playing. A very important to combat in this game is resistances and weaknesses, every enemy that you fight will take more damage from specific weapons or skills, and less from others. Which leads into the next point, which is Charles, your custom glove, that has lightning powers, and many others, like freezing, shields, levitating enemies, and more. Its also a good point to mention that as you install mods (or upgrades) on weapons, they change their appearance, damage, recoil, aim speed, fire rate, plus some.

They are easy once you figure them out, its just a lot of trial and error, but each one is made very well, although the same type of puzzle is used multiple times, its a new adventure after and every puzzle.

After words
I highly suggest that you should but this game, streamer or not, this is one of the best games that I have played and the threat of being ""canceled"" is not worth skipping out on this game. If we want more games to be this real, and immersive, then we need to support the people that make games like it. This is a masterpiece of a game that I had been following for quite some time. This game is one that hits different, and is one of the only fps games that have what I see to be meaning, even in both of the two endings.

+ The combat is lots of fun. Don't listen to people saying enemies are bullet sponges. If you upgrade your weapons, use the right combinations of gloves powers n guns any enemy can do down in a reasonable amount of time. So basically... use the tools the game provides. Dodging is well designed, timing it to attacks and punishing enemies works great and creates a good flow in combat. 
+ Great setting and environment, very cool enemy design (even though you could ask for a bit more variety in enemy types, I thought it was acceptable) 
+ Absolute banger of a soundtrack but of course with Mr. Gordon's name attached to it it's pretty obvious 
+ Unapologetic and does what it wants. Yeah, it makes some dumb jokes. Yeah, there's fridge sex. Yeah, the main character is a grumpy asshole. But the game doesn't give a shit and just goes for it, and I appreciated that. 

- I really wish it was more polished. None of the bugs are gamebreaking enough to make you stop playing. I got stuck in environment and had to reload a previous save twice in 22 hours of gameplay. Whilst arguably that's something that should never happen, it's really pretty damn rare... There are other small bugs that are a bit disappointing and the game would be a smashing 8-9/10 without them. Enemy AI is really not great, especially in terms of pathing, they get stuck running against fences very easily. There's also a strange animation bug where when they get knocked down, you will see one single frame of them standing upright (literally one frame) before getting up. Again, small polishing details that are a bit of a shame. 
- The story isn't a masterpiece, but it's good enough in my opinion. The ending however... I won't go into details but I thought it was pretty damn bad. Just a mess and overall quite disappointing. 
- Play it in Russian, seriously. The English VA isn't necessarily Tommy Wiseau level of bad acting, it's just the WRONG voice and acting for the character. He's supposed to be a grumpy asshole with a crappy life who's generally mad at the world. Might not be the most appealing main character quality but I found it refreshing to see in a game: a main character who doesn't try to be likeable. And for the record, grumpy assholes who are mad at life like him exist in real life, so I found it believable. The English voice actor is the most boring, vanilla, normal sounding dude you can imagine. Like the Farcry 4 character but much more boring and vanilla. It's all wrong. He's not supposed to be a fratboy on holiday, he's a veteran spetnaz amnesiac...

A truly unique experience!! This is more than just a game inspired by BioShock, it's way, way more than that!

The only problems ive found are that the main character is kind of annoying and an asshole, the re-spawning enemies are annoying but you can stop them from re-spawning for about 10 mins IRL if you take down a balloon thing which is very easy to do and is repeatable, and there are a prevalent amount of bugs (Ive had to reload 2 times due to getting stuck on things that you should not get stuck on. Oh and another thing the combat is too easy for it to be considered challenging even on the hardest difficulty, which is unfortunate.

Edit: There are more bugs the further ive gone, ive had to reload over a dozen times now. Fun game but wait till more patches are released.

Final edit: After finishing the game the final score out of 100 would be a 65. The game play is decent and the story was better than decent but left me disappointed and the ending sucked, as there is no true ""Good"" ending. Overall it is exceptionally average and has nothing noteworthy in it other than the hot ballerinas. I would wait for hot fixes to come out and then I would wait for it to go on sale.

The game launched without the widely advertised RT features. This is was a disappointment for me and caught me off guard. I didn't really research this beforehand so it was a bit of a kick in the teeth when I opened the game and RT is entirely missing. One of the reasons why I became interested in the game in the first place was that it would support RT. The first RT thing I ran on my RT capable GPU was, in fact, one of the Atomic Heart feature demoes from 2019-ish. Despite this I tried to grin and bear and I started playing the game anyway, but it definitely left a sour taste in the mouth from the get go for me.

You start off touring through this soviet era utopian world. It is beautiful, it's also quite a unique environment. Then everything is kinda derailed when the fancy robots start going bad. Not exactly the most... umm original idea ever. I mean, they can get some points for the world it is huge and beautiful, but that's about it.

So that sounds pretty good so far, what gives, you ask? Well... the first thing that is sorta not for me is the constant bickering between the protagonist and his companion glove thingy. Why do people think this is an interesting narrative device? It's just a constant barrage of verbal diarrhea that I have to tune out in order to play. It adds nothing of value to the experience. Add to that the fact that the game pauses with tutorials or information on enemies etc. in the middle of this bickering and it is almost like the designers were like yeah fuck it we don't really care about these conversations either. I don't know, I'm wondering why even bother adding it in in the first place!? The game is trying so bloody hard to be edgy with all the characters it added and it is painful to witness tbh. I don't know, maybe this is just an issue for me, but I cannot stand it. Definitely minus points from me here.

The combat is alright, but my character sometimes does the sprint dodge thing without me even having pressed shift or double tapped a key and it's just odd. The axe is no fun to swing either, it just sorta passes through the enemies like there is no weight behind it. It's awkward at best. Wait for the game to tell you when to dodge the strong attack. :D (Also a prevalent thing in modern games) Anyway... the combat is fine, but nothing in the time I played seemed standout to me.

Another pain point for me is the audio. In contrast to the visuals which are very good, it's almost like half the sounds are either muted, quiet or entirely missing and it just sours the experience overall. One point someone is firing a gun right up next to me and then stuff are exploding nearby and flying close to my head and all I can basically hear is faint pops and then music is suddenly drowning everything out. I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to audio and this game's audio is just bad... very little else to be said on that topic.

Performance! The game performs really good, but I had a crash and some occasional stutters in weird places here and there. Nothing too serious, the game is very well optimized overall and the visuals are really good.

Coming to the end of this review now, some people will probably like the game, but overall this just doesn't seem like my kind of game.

Notes:
- Game starts very slow in a sub area and it takes at least a good 2 hours or so before you can leave and involves some annoying locate and grab missions.
- Open world is not necessary beyond the tutorial, the game has upgrades and different weapons out there, but by the time I made it to the final boss it wasn't necessary.
- The game is very hard, but in a bad way. Higher difficulty just means enemies have more health and do more damage. Your shotgun takes 3 shots to kill the basic robot and ammo is scarce, especially in the first 3/4 of the game. In hard mode your melee, usually your only weapon, is almost useless. Medium is beatable, but easy provided me with the most fun : grind ratio. (I started on hard and got around 40% through on it)
- Story ends stupidly, feels like they needed one more boss fight. Maybe they are setting up a sequel, but idk.
- Great soundtrack, the entire time I enjoyed the music
- Gunplay was really fun when I had ammo
- Dismemberment was also really fun to play with
- Stages had some annoying parkour, but otherwise was well thought out
- The elemental aspect was basically useless, but was interesting regardless
- Mini bosses were really fun

Great aesthetics, attention to details and incidental music that will most likely be overlooked by the majority of the western audience that are clueless about the everyday life of the Soviet people.
Satisfying ARPG combat that rewards acumen, but doesn't try to overpower you and force you into meta gameplay. Bonus: no predatory time wasting crafting/farming mechanics, the game doesn't rob you of resources for trying out different weapons.
A collection of proven gameplay ideas, most of which fit great together.
For once, an ending that subverts your expectations that's done right.
An open world that's completely 100% optional and never tries to interfere into your campaign playthrough.
Decent graphics and wonderful optimization that runs smoothly on GPU from 2019.

Few negatives are as follows:
a couple parts of the campaign really do drag for longer than they should;
audio may get confusing at some places where the game tries to play music, background NPC dialogue and the main character's dialogue all at the same time, especially early on;
the music playing on radios and loudspeakers, as cool as it is, tends to get tiresome after a couple loops.",1677867417,1677867417,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Puzzles are sprinkled here and there but integrated in a intelligent manner than co-insides with whatever you may be doing in the game at this time.

This game is so Bioshock that the correct way to play is the same as Bioshock:
A remaster 9 years later on a machine that can run rings around whatever this game was originally targeted at.
---------

It's days like this you wish Steam had a ""mixed"" button.
The first hurdle you make as a new developer is technical. They blew it out the park. The second is learning just how hard game design is.

The art is fantastic. The world is amazing. The (Russian) voices tickle me just right. The soundtrack made me pregnant. The twins don't actually have the biggest cake in the game, Dr Larisa does. Anyway, time to spend the rest of this review ripping it apart.

This game's problem is Bioshock 1. They took a lot of pages out of 2K book. Now I have no problem with the idea of sticking to a legendary title like that for guidance, my problem is that it's Bioshock's book. Graphics aside, this game would be a killer competitor to Bioshock. In 2007. With its 2007 combat, and its 2007 level design.

The world puzzles don't feel immersive at all, they feel more like Portal test chambers where everything is designed FOR YOU, as a player.
The combat doesn't feel worth it most of the time; I'm not excited to fight like I am in Elden Ring.
The questmarker makes no sense. I won't get into it, but at one point there's a quest marker that says ""go to the second floor"". You can clearly see the second floor. You can clearly see the quest marker up there. There's a 30-second video on youtube that someone made to point out you need a press a button to crash a submarine attached to the ceiling to make a bridge. How was I supposed to know that?
Huge parts of the missions are ""this door needs 5 keys but the 5 keys are all in different places and take like 30 minutes to get each"", which is the most Bioshock thing I've ever heard (not in a good way)

If you want to make an AAA game these days, it needs to stand shoulder to shoulder with other AAA TODAY. Not 2007.
Cyberpunk 2077 absolutely flies at everything this game stumbled with.
To be fair, the opposite is also true (as in this game actually runs lmao)",1677861466,1677861466,True,3,0,0.508353233337402344,0,True,False,False

Music is on point both on roaming and the combat.
Gameplay is nice, and enjoyed all of the boss fights, but enjoyed, not loved, because the highest difficulty increases the boss health and lowers the damage you deal. In my opinion, different levels of difficulty should add new types of boss attacks, which would be interesting in my opinion. 
Story, mwah, ""konfetka"", I've heard complaints from different people about the voice acting, but personally played with Russian voice over and my god, it was good...

For this who think that this game glorifies USSR, it does not, it just shows that there are conspiracies and power hunger people, which actually really reflects well on real Soviet Union.

I went in a little cautious given the mixed reviews at launch but if you don't go in expecting a revolutionary Bioshock experience, you should have a decent time with this. The combat is fast and frantic. I had a lot of fun smacking these iRobots and other robot variations throughout the game. I think the issues start coming in when you get overwhelmed by so many enemies and how fast that can happen. I felt super pressured in the open world parts to just book it to the next linear area instead of taking my time and exploring the world because again, unfortunately, you get swarmed very easily in this game. You also don't move very fast and even with the upgrade later on, you still move relatively slow compared to all the iRobots running after you. Thank God for the dash.

Also, some of the puzzles kinda suck. I admit, I'm not great at puzzles but the laser ones and the door locks where you need to match up the colors and you have to rotate the lock around to get them right took me forever....

Update - So the game looks gorgeous considering it runs on UE 4. The game is really fun. Love the fact that you can respec and change up your style anytime without paying a fee or getting punished, don't know why more games don't allow this. I don't have time to replay your game 10 times... 
The soundtrack goes HARD holy shit. A good soundtrack can really make or break an experience.
The game wasn't perfect tho. Some bugs in the inventory which, in general, could have been a lil more user friendly but it was not tooo bad either. There was one point where I got stuck on a piece of the environment and had to re load. 
A super unfortunate thing is no manual save slots so if I gotta replay a section I like I gotta restart the game.
A lot of people are saying the story is basic but I enjoyed the multiple twists so maybe i'm just a smooth brain who is easily entertained.
Loved the references to Bioshock (which has very clearly inspired this game) one of my favorite game series. The references to both rapture and columbia are brilliant.
Love this style as well. We have explored the retro futuristic American vision a bunch of times so I was happy to see a new take on this idea.
I don't know how I feel about being sexually harassed by a fridge tho lmao.
The antagonist was super aggressive but it wasn't annoying or anything. Hell sometimes I even agreed with his impatience. I'm excited to see what they do with the DLC.

A solid first person action RPG that delivers a weird and dangerous soviet era playground full of deadly robots & mutants and comparing it to games like BioShock is something one will naturally do. I’ve been following the game’s development for years now and at one point i even doubted it would see the light of day at all but here we are. It’s not a perfect product and there are some issues but after a rather slow start and once you crafted some nice weapons and have upgraded them you start to have fun very quickly in my opinion. This is the first game by Mundfish and from the second the opening prologue starts you can see the love and details they put into this world immediately. One of the highlights is definitely the upgrade machine „Nora“ who want’s to have sex with you for some reason and seems to be horny all the time. And yes, the twins are….nice too haha. It’s a fantastic game and was worth the price for me. It took me a little over 27 hours to complete the story on normal difficulty. The side content in it's open world next to the main missions consist of testing grounds that are underground puzzle laboratories  where you can find blueprints to unlock upgrades for your arsenal of weapons. And yes there’s a talking glove that kind of never shuts up but that’s ok, and i admit i kind of liked it. He can also be upgraded at „Nora“ to give your elemental powers that extra kick. I’m not going to talk about everything you can do and see in Atomic Heart but i do highly recommend this game not only for the love that was put into it but also for the outstanding collection of licensed music and composed tracks by legends like Mick Gordon which make some of the Boss fights and combat scenes absolutely kick ass. 9/10",1676955808,1677830394,True,4,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Do yourself a favor and only play this game with the original Russian voice acting. A lot of people listed the English voice acting as a reason to not play the game, and I think it's unreasonable to judge a Russian game on its English VA quality. Thats not what this game was designed around. Altough yes, i'll admit, even in Russian the dialogue can be a bit rough to listen to at times.

It's a pretty fun game and i had a good time. Gameplay is for sure the bread and butter. Its solid with very fast paced and tense combat. The game makes you feel like your'e the badass without any compromise. Visuals are amazingly creative that pair nicely with the bright flashing lights which add shock and awe to the environment. There's lots of puzzles throughout the game that lower the tempo in between combat areas. They are refreshing to get lost in and also can be challenging at times, but nothing that you will break your brain over.

What i didn't like was the writing/dialog for the game. P-3, the person you play as, really just sounds like a teenager who thinks they need to cuss in every sentence to make themselves sound funny or gritty. He also says a lot of cringe lines that make you wish he would stop talking. Story kept me playing but its nothing ground breaking. It gets a little dry at points but the gameplay is what keeps you in. The ending however was odd and left me confused, i feel like i definitely have questions but it may be answered in the coming dlc's. 

Check it out when more dlc comes out and hopefully that will help tie a bow to the story. 7/10.",1677816517,1677816517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It wears its bioshock inspiration on its face. Def a good game imo. Worth 60, probably if your a diehard bioshock fan. 100% worth it on sale. Id even say 40 or less and its worth the price. Ita very VERY clear that they are directly targeting the bioshock fans. Through gameplay and dialog as well as some random easter eggs. Story wise? Its really hard to beat bioshock 1. I mean the ""would you kindly"" twist is infamous in gaming at this point. Imho i think they assume you know that and kinda string you along thinking its just going to be a slightly different take. They pull their own stuff but its not the best story, not the worst either. Semi open world aspect is... alright i guess, could be better but thankfully its not like a ubisoft, go to 1000 places and touch a thing, compleatly optional. Combat, is solid but ppl can argue combat wasnt the selling point of bioshock either. Overall i would personally rate it an 8/10. Maybe 7.75ish.

First off, for the roughly two hours I played, I got maybe 45 minutes of actual gameplay. TOPS. The rest, control was taken from me for some poorly animated cutscene or some expository crap. There's literally a part in the opening where you fly around (you're not in control) and a robot just starts telling you history of the stuff you're flying over for over 5 minutes. I'm sitting there, going on a historical landmark tour for NO REASON.

LET ME FIND IT OUT MYSELF, I DON'T NEED YOU TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM ME TO FILL ME IN ON THE HISTORY OF YOUR UNIVERSE.

On top of that, the writing and voice acting, or rather the fact that that the voice acting JUST WON'T STOP. When you meet the crafting station (yes you meet it), I'm not exaggerating when I tell you there was over two minutes of completely useless dialogue I had to sit through. It was probably closer to 5 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. I know that may not sound like very long reading this, but imagine sitting there trying to get on with the game and you have to sit and listen to two people pointlessly bicker back and forth for five minutes with a sexually charged refrigerator. 

Every five minutes the MC's will start bickering with one another (YES THE TWO OF THEM WILL ACTUALLY JUST ARGUE FOR 2 MINUTES WHILE YOU EXPLORE), or the MC will constantly mention about something in the environment, or he'll tell some crappy joke. WHY WON'T THEY JUST SHUT UP, I DON'T NEED COMMENTARY OR FILLER DIALOGUE EVERY FIVE MINUTES (yes I genuinely mean every five minutes), JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME!

It may be bearable for some, but I felt like I was going insane. The bad voice acting, on top of the terrible writing, and how constant it is, it's just maddening. (It's not funny bad writing either. These writers were taking everything VERY seriously, they just suck at writing) If you think you can bear it, then go for it but me personally, I just can't recommend this. At this point I'd rather guzzle a gallon of gasoline and swallow a lit match. If you do buy this, I recommend turning the dialogue all the way down, because the characters literally don't shut up.",1677808417,1677808784,False,6,0,0.444566220045089722,0,True,False,False

Game runs well although given its recent release there some bugs. nothing Major or game breaking or that cant be solved with a simple restart. However especially toward the end some very minor textures would turn into clown vomit and prompt a restart. Game-play wise the game felt EXTREMELY fun to play especially as you progressed in the upgrade tree and EARNED an OP feel. One of my favorite things to do was to use TK and destroy everything nearby. On the flip side, there was one aspect I'm still not sure of how I feel about and that is the enemy respawn. I mean sure you can disable it by overloading, but once you do so you trapped in that area as lasers lock you in and sometimes don't turn back off after the 15 mins it takes to come back up. Apart from all that, I will dare say that through and through playing this felt like the first time I ever played BIOSHOCK while still being different enough that it would be remembered as its own game with unique mechanics instead of a clone. The game was very forgiving and encouraging of you switching up or trying new play-styles too which should be given massive kudos for.

Story wise, it was pretty thorough and straight forward so I can't complain. Plenty of witty lines and caught myself chuckling rather than rolling my eyes. Was kind of worried if the game was just going to turn into communist propaganda and was rather glad it did no such thing and highlighted the flaws of ideology mostly without bias. 

In summary, to anyone who wished Bioshock had a straightforward plot and more of a fun approach instead of serious, you'll have enjoy playing this. I'd pay 60-70 for this but given Inflation rates and the attempt of a reset by the WEF and the Brandon administration, I wholeheartedly vibe with those who would wait until it comes down to a solid $45",1677807564,1677807564,True,11,0,0.589317739009857178,0,True,False,False

Atomic Hearts is a game that takes elements from several popular titles and blends them together in a unique way. While it isn't worth the initial $60 investment, I'd say if you can get it for $30 or $40, go for it, but the game begins to lose its luster as you progress further. The lack of innovation and originality is noticeable, and there are no real surprises or moments that leave you on the edge of your seat.

The game mechanics borrow heavily from Dead Island Riptide and Bioshock, while the gameplay itself feels like a mix between Dishonored with a hint of Skyrim lockpicking and some Fallout 4 robot design thrown in. This combination makes for a somewhat disjointed experience that never quite hits its stride.

The weapons are unbalanced, and the abilities feel a bit awkward with an energy meter for the weapons and a cooldown for the abilities. This can make combat feel tedious and repetitive, especially as you get further into the game.

Additionally, the lack of challenge is disappointing, as everything is presented to you right away, and there are no real curve balls to keep you on your toes. By the time you reach the end, the game begins to feel drawn out and lacks any real sense of satisfaction.

Overall, Atomic Hearts is an okay game that's worth playing through, but it's not one that you'll be dying to come back to. While the initial mechanics may seem promising, the lack of originality and balance make for a game that falls short of its potential.

I am happy to see how much more optimized this game is compared to a few other AAA new releases that contain game breaking bugs and visuals. The soundtrack is spot on for the game and the atmosphere that goes with it is fantastic.

 However, I do feel the melee combat could use some minor adjustments to feel like you have more contact with the robots/mutants, the real-time damage done to the robots and mutants with each swing of the axe is satisfying to look at. The gunplay is very pleasing and done right, enemies also don’t feel too bullet spongy which is nice. The English voice acting especially for the main character is not the best but far from the worst I’ve heard. I do recommend playing with the Russian voices and use subtitles as it is more audibly pleasing. 

In closing, I think anyone looking for an alternate history game (ex. Fallout, bioshock, etc.) will also enjoy this title. It is definitely a unique experience for sure but It is an experience worth having.

But if you give the game enough time, you will get tha action going. Open world isnt really definition of open world, or atleast for me. There are some dungeons you can explore (and they are worth the exploring for gear) and some nice places to see but thats pretty much it. Gameplay isnt revolutionary, just classic CoD type of gunplay. You can carry as much weapons as there is and have 3 abilities to use. I enjoyed the story especially at the end but main character has some flaws like some cringy jokes and sometimes acting like complete brainwashed soldier by the regime. 

PROS:
- Universe and art design is really nice, liked it a lot. Its certanly not any kind of propaganda on the soviet regime. 

- Various weapons and abilities, you can switch and refound ability points anytime you visit the weapon ""vendor""

- The story is also very good, if you want, you can read all the notes and get some more details on the characters to understand the story a bit more, but if not, you wont miss anything important.  

- Graphics and optimilazations are great. With DLSS and low-med computer zou can run this game very smooth in every are in the game.

- Gameplay doesnt provide anything new you never saw but its not boring. With 12 weapons too choose from and many builds for the weapons, you have a lot of variety for quite a short game. 

- Game is trying to send you a message at the end of the story. Or atleast it seemed like this to me. Things are not what they seem to be and its not really that predictable. 

CONS:
- Main character is sometimes too cringy and acts stupid. Way to stupid. Dont know if devs wanted him to look like brainwashed and infinitly loayal soldier, but it gets really annoying sometimes.

- Not many types of enemies. There is legit only 1 model for mutant ""dead"" human enemies in the game and everyone looks the same, looks lazy to me. 

- Some dungeons in open world get repetetive and there is not much more to do except them.

- No FOV slider

great atmosphere
amazing soundtrack
very well crafted world and enviroments
combat is fun
guns and abilities feel satysfing to use and generally have good upgrades
good optimization
unigue puzzles that you dont solve in 5 seconds

- :
the open world is very empty and theres nothing much to do other than the testing grounds
enemies get fixed too quickly (i get that its supposed to be an open world but the speed they get fixed is too fast for my liking)
lots of minor bugs as of right now (they dont break the game or anything and only occur sometimes but when they do they are really annoying, most of them will probably be fixed in future patches anyways)
the inventory system is kinda annoying to use
i just dont like the personality of the main character at all he just acts like an arsehole most of the time

50/50 :
the story isnt bad but its not great either i just feel like they could have done more with it and make it more interesting
dialogues in this game are also a mixed bag sometimes they are just plain cringe and sometimes they are kinda funny
the voice acting isnt bad its actually pretty good but some lines are just delivered so poorly

so to sum this up the developers did a very good job with this game taking into account this is the fist game they published
the game was a mixed bag for me but it was more of a positive experience than a negative one

First of all i wanna start with the good parts, the game looks very nice and runs very well which is the first game that released this year i played that actually did (Dead Space and Hogwarts both had pretty big performance issues). The gameplay itself is fun, at least for me, i know some people find it repetitive but for me it does capture the feeling of the old bioshock games rather well. That being said i do have to mention that the only gripe i have with the gameplay itself are the plethora of jumping puzzles and the checkpoint system because both of them are GOD AWFUL especially in combination with each other, make sure that you save often and use every save station you find.

Something i have no problems with at all however is the music and overall design of the game, mike gordon and the rest of the music team did a fantastic job creating wonderfully fitting tracks for combat and the over all environment. Same goes for the artstyle of the game, its very atmospheric and immersive, really nailing that future soviet union look. 

Now if the gameplay and design are fine for the most part what about the story? Its not terrible but also not great, just very very average, predictable, full of cliche and tropes with a rather unsatisfying ending. The voice acting can be hit or miss, personally i did not find the main character as annoying as some people claim him to be but other voiced characters could definitely need some more work alongside the cutscenes which often seem stiff and a bit unpolished at times. 

Now i certainly had fun with the game but even going around trying to explore everything and grabbing as many achievements on the way as i could, it took me roughly 24 hours for my first run, ive heard some people say it took them between 12-15 hours to finish a run when just doing the story so i dont think its worth the 60 dollars asking price, if you can grab it on sale i would recommend it and even more so if you are a bioshock fan.

Bosses either shoot easy to dodge laser or try to melee which usually don't land because character is (can be) immune when dodging. Dungeon progression is tedious a repetition of finding a key or parts of key set to open the next gate, reminds me of darksider2. Obviously, a desperate attempt to elongate the game play. I did some test grounds and both endings, took only 22 hours. Not to mention I am definitely one of the slower player. With a re-imagined soviet society and such a superb artistic style, I do expect a bit more expression from this open world.

- The Atmosphere & almost utopic Soviet Union.
- The Combat, got some heavily Dying Light vibes. 
- Crafting & upgrade system, the best part of it is that you need to visit Nora, to get your gear top notch. [spoiler] Nora best girl, change my mind [/spoiler]

However this particular bug really annoys me, the quintet formation dome- cable connectors on each hanging platforms, whenever MC jumps into their congregation too far, there are fat chances he will get stuck, locked and vibrates forever, and there is no means of escape but reload your save

Puzzles can get really annoying, especially the one at the pesticide facility, to get back and forth multiple times (and had to deal with the buggy hanging platforms) can really stoke some nerves",1677740673,1677751041,False,4,0,0.502283096313476563,0,True,False,False

It opens with a very scenic opening that shows you the kind of culture of the world your character is in and allows you to walk around and explore it... at least up until the robots destroy everything in which case at that point everyone's dead so yeah.... make sure you look around before that happens.

There's multiple enemies and various ways to combat those enemies as well as a selection of weapons to pick and choose from and pick your choices well because each enemy has it's own weakness. 

There are some stealth options allowing you to crouch walk behind an enemy and preform a sneak attack which brings up a prompt where you have to mash a certain key on your keyboard in order to be successful in a take down which is annoying to deal with since nobody likes abusing their keyboard. The graphics are very good and I have only encountered two glitches/bugs and one crash during my entire play through of the game which is very good.

The game has overcome the problem of never having anything to shoot at in an area you're returning to because you've already killed all the enemies by implementing a repair system that allows drones to repair destroyed robots which adds a more challenging level to the player particularly if you have an objective to complete in the area. There are a number of ways to deal with this by either figuring out how to disable the HAWK rendering all robots in that area to be put in stand by mode for a time or by destroying all robots and all drones to the point where it would take some time to reconstruct the drones and for the drones to then repair all the robots you've destroyed.

One thing I really like is how they've put a lot of thought into their puzzles and how they not all the same. There are different locks and different puzzles and they continue to change throughout the game so that they remain interesting instead of becoming a bore to deal with. The developers came up with funny dialogue about the character hating locks that plays though out the game obviously trolling players that hate puzzles and such things.

The developers have also obviously thought about how big the map is and as such put in cars so that you don't have to walk everywhere and put in optional testing grounds that you can complete to receive different blueprints and attachments for your various guns.

The pros: 
The game delivered what it promised (Minimum of 30 hours of game play)
Good graphics
Diverse ways to play and range of weapons
Very few bugs/glitches
Different puzzles that continue to challenge you throughout the game

The cons:
I'm not really a fan of mashing a key on my keyboard repeatedly in rapid succession in order to disable a robot that I've already gone to the bother to sneak up on.

I think I kept getting it mixed up with Redfall or something else that was also way off down the road. And I had this anticipation despite the fact that I was doubtful they would give me anything like what the short teaser trailers looked like. 

Well I wasn't disappointed in the least. The gameplay was solid, the graphics were great, and though it did crash a couple of times, I have come to accept that as part of PC life in new games. I don't know if I will play it again without new content but I did finish it with both endings. 

There are flaws though. Not having fast travel is one of them. There were things i did not do because I was so terrible at driving and fast travel wasn't available. And it is either stealth or Armageddon fighting for huge distances between zones. The ideal fix would be side missions to repair rail lines or other transport services so you can visit places after the main story is over. 

Overall, I am glad to have this addition to a dying genre. All of the people reaching way back to Bioshock as a comparison point do so because we aren't getting as many games that are meant to be played through for their story once and maybe some achievements. And all that probably has to do with money. Deathloop is probably the only game from the past couple of years I would put in this sub genre and even it has multiplayer features.

But after playing two games so close together where the protagonist has ongoing conversations with their glove, even knowing the eventual outcome of both gloves, I still stand behind the basic point that most people would be nicer to their ever present constantly life saving hand garment.",1677743806,1677743806,True,1,0,0.50088953971862793,0,True,False,False

It's a strong start to 2023, and I look forward to seeing what Mundfish does next. If Atomic Heart is a disappointment to anyone, they probably came in expecting way too much, because this is an enjoyable destruct-a-thon through a Soviet dystopia filled with the bodies of people deceived by promises of an easy AI-run life and a few powerful men.

Combat in this game takes some getting used to, but once you understand how to mix dodging, shooting, powers, and healing it becomes a cakewalk.  Gunplay feels really good with the pistols and shotgun; less so with the machine guns, which feel weightless. Once you start getting upgrades the game really stops being scary and becomes a lot more fun. 

While hunting upgrades through the open world was at times frustrating, when you finally understand the rhythm of the combat and the ways you can stealth around and away from enemies it becomes pretty enjoyable. The puzzle rooms, while visually very reminiscent of Portal 2, are much simpler than the testing chambers and are rather boring. They're best used as a way to tone down the intensity of the open world and get a breather between story sections.

If there is a problem with the combat it's that very few enemies ever evolve or have variants, meaning you fight the same enemies the same way in the same environments over and over again. While initially quite fun, it did become a bit wearisome by the last third of the game, and I just lowered the difficulty so I wouldn't have to waste more time on them during my last 4 hours.

Atomic Heart makes it very easy to experiment with different abilities and upgrades, which I appreciated. All the powers are useful for specific playstyles, and thankfully there aren't that many puzzles that require using them; when you do need a specific power, there's usually a conveniently-located NORA nearby. Mass Telekinesis is probably the most useful though; there's no easier way to kill the hordes of enemies you fight in the lategame. 

The story is a bit of a mess. It felt like there were two or three writers who weren't speaking to each other. Whoever wrote the actual in-game dialogue should be sent to the gulag; it's not funny or endearing. Conversely, the main plot and the events in the cutscenes come together pretty well and culminate in a pair of endings that feel thematically appropriate, if somewhat hollow and unearned. Most of that hollowness is, again, due to the in-game dialogue of both P-3 and the various corpses you find around the facility, which doesn't add at all to the worldbuilding in the terminals or expand on any of the secrets revealed about the facility and the experiments that went on there. There's very little sense that what happens in the cutscenes is related to what you're discovering as you play through the game's levels.

I strongly recommend playing the game in Russian with English subtitles. While native speakers may notice sub-par voice acting, it's infinitely better than playing the English dub. Unfortunately, the protagonist sounds far too young and unseasoned, and it makes bad dialogue worse. At least in Russian  it sounds less silly, and the emotional moments in the cutscenes hit a little stronger. 

The biggest flaw of Atomic Heart is that it really does not know what to do with the time it's given. The first 2/3rds of the game are fun, satisfying, and full of mystery; however, when you find yourself chasing after the same pair of NPCs again to yet another creepy underground bunker, the whole sequence feels a little too repetitive. Instead of revealing aspects of some of your characters as you reach new labs or uncover the next atrocity, Atomic Heart crams everything into a 30 minute dialogue just before the endgame. If you read all the terminals you come across, things become more fulfilling, but it's frustrating that things the player figured out 5 hours into the game aren't confirmed to the oblivious, idiot, wilfully blind protagonist for another 20 hours.

Atomic Heart would be a real great game if it were only 20 hours long, or if the story revelations were better paced throughout its levels and the characters were a little more polished. Still, it's a very fun shooter with some cool worldbuilding that's definitely worth a buy.

A lot of the dialogue is satire and will fly right over people's heads, but I didn't mind the constant chatter between the protagonist and his glove, or the rather erotic refrigerators.

However, some of the puzzles are downright obnoxious to figure out, destinations and objectives aren't well explained, and while there are plenty of side quests, it's really up to you to waste resources trying to finish them, often with subpar rewards. Side quests felt soulless in that regard.

I had to keep abandoning the game for a few days and coming back to enjoy it again, as the checkpoint/save system is atrocious. There were times in the story I'd spent 20 minutes just getting to an objective with very minimal, if any combat, only to die during the main objective, and roll back 20 minutes to the last save room. For the love of god, increase the number of save rooms (without loot) or give me a 1-time save here and there.

While the game is visually breathtaking, the dialogue and story entertaining and intriguing, it's the gameplay that will often fall flat on its face. Tack on the inability to modify your FOV without running third party applications like Flawless Widescreen, which shouldn't even be a thing in this day and age, and the lack of RTX support (which I personally don't care about but the game is advertised as having it), kinda add salt to the wound.

The whole thing seems like a stylistic Bioshock ripoff that's entertaining at points and incredibly frustrating the rest of the time with a cracked foundation. I want to love it, but simply can't. It's like no one on the dev team truly playtested it from start to finish. 

I'll still recommend the game as it draws me back in every 3 or 4 days, but I wish Steam didn't give such a Yes/No rating - I'd give atomic heat 3/5 stars, for example, were a real rating system implemented. 

Oh - performance wise, zero issues both underground and in the open world. R7 5800X, 64gb of DDR4-3600, a PCI-E 4.0 M.2, RTX 3080, everything fully maxed at 1440p.

The game wears its inspirations on its sleeve, Bioshock being the first and most prominent influence. I enjoyed the setting but after the first few hours, the gameplay comes to a crawl. In general the game can be described as a worse version of every game it takes inspiration from. The setting and world is interesting at a glance, but its never well fleshed out, the melee hits feel floaty and unresponsive, the powers are lackluster and too few to allow diverse builds, and the lack of enemy types makes combat in general feel boring. On top of the previous problems by far the worst aspect of this game has to be the dialogue. The characters are constantly talking and blabbing on about every insignificant detail in the map, there's no way to make them shut up and the characters will often cut each other off, voicelines will randomly replay, and the writing of the characters feels inconsistent. The number one worst offender is your character P-3, imagine if someone took only the worst aspects of Iron-man, Duke Nukem, and Sokka as mashed them together into the goofiest guy you've ever met. All of his lines are weird and don't make sense he keeps trying to push a catchphrase, and he's oddly combative to everyone. This isn't even to mention the message of the game itself. Mundfish, the game's developer has proven ties to Russian oligarchs and the message of the game isn't a critic of the USSR. Every other game in this genre uses their setting to critic and comment on the belief system, but Atomic Heart doesn't ever attempt to do that, I was holding out until the end, hoping that there would be some slight criticism of Soviet Russia, but there is nothing. In general, don't waste your money on this, instead buy a game that Atomic Heart takes inspiration from like Bioshock, Prey, or Dishonored.

Pros:
1. Polish - Man, it feels good to play a game in 2023 that releases complete and polished from the start that I don't have to wait months for it to be finished. While the game shouldn't necessarily be receiving praise for this (Since it should be the expected minimum when buying a $60 title) I think that, in today's standard, it should be recognized among all of the crap we typically get.
2. The world - I haven't played many games that manage to blow me away with the beauty of their environment design, but this game really hit the nail on the head.
3. Optimization - With how beautiful this game is, I was fully expecting it to torch my relatively mid level PC build. I was utterly blown away to find I can run this game on Ultra settings and still pull nearly typically 70-90fps while using a GTX 1080 and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600. Without a doubt, this is the most optimized game I think I've ever played to run such a beautiful game so smoothly. Hat's off to them for this one.
4. The story - I'll talk about some of the cons of the story (without spoilers of course) in the cons section, but I still think, overall, that the story was largely interesting, had some great plot twists, and was well paced. I was more than intrigued to find out how it ended and I was more than pleased with the initial ending I played. All in all, as far as video game stories go, I'd give the story a solid 8.5/10
5. The crafting/progression - They have a simple, yet effective way of fathering resources that you then use to craft unique weapons, ammo, consumables, and upgrades for your character's glove abilities and weapons. Blue prints can be found for specific upgrades in sites located all around the map. These sites typically are giant spacial puzzles that get harder in difficulty as you progress through them.
6. Puzzles - When I came into this game I wasn't expecting it to be a very prevalent portion of the game, and while it's not anything comparable to something like Portal, it still does have a good amount of spacial puzzles to be solved. The beginning few are just to introduce you to the concept of they work, but they do become a bit more challenging later in the game. I never felt like I wasn't able to not figure them out though. The complexity level is what I would describe as beginner friendly to intermediate.
7. Combat - The gun play is smooth and feels good. Utilizing your dash to dodge incoming attacks is a must and enemies are pinged with a red pulse when they are about to do a major attack that needs to be dodged or you will be knocked to the ground. It's a big step up from the mundane combat typically found in most FPS RPGs.

Cons:
1. Dialogue/Story - While I largely enjoyed the story of the game, and I thought that a vast majority of the voice acting was actually superb for a game being translated from its native language, I just can't get over the translation of the main protagonist's dialogue. It can grow to be a bit tiresome and predictable over the course of the game. I'm not sure if this is due to a bad casting for the lead protagonist's English version, or if it's simply the product of translating the game from Russian to English. I can only Hear ""Crispy Critters"" or him complain about nearly everything in an impatient manner so many times. The story beats can often feel a bit forced to try and tie narrative together, using a lot of exposition to try and help make sure that the player isn't completely lost in the slightly more cerebral parts of the narrative.

2. Endings (no spoilers) - There are two endings in this game depending on a final major decision you make. One of them  was superb (luckily for me the initial one I played) and was executed in a manner that truly made the game shine. The other ends the game rather abruptly, doesn't answer many question the player might have at the moment, and largely isn't rewarding in the slightest. It blows my mind how drastically different the payoff of this decision they give 10 seconds to make is. (Option #2 is good, Option #1 was disappointing). I honestly can't believe they were okay with a large portion of players selecting that first option and thinking that's all there was to the game. I don't think it's hard to imagine a player completely despising the story if that's their first and only play through of the ending of the game.

3. Traveling - It's a good thing the world is beautiful, because that saves traversing the open world. Cars are frustratingly useless since there is more often than not, something blocking the path that your car will hit. THERE IS NO SPRINTING IN THIS GAME!!! I genuinely believe that this game could have benefited from a dedicated sprint action ontop of the quick dash. Luckily, most of the game is spent underground in the facilities rather than running around the open world, but still... Travelling wasn't the most engaging part of the game.

4. Look but don't touch - While the game is breathtakingly beautiful, it does have a bit of a feeling that you're not allowed to interact with it in a manner that you would likely come to expect in a modern RPG. Most of the buildings spread out throughout the open world simply have the same desks/trunks/cabinets to quickly loot through and I feel like they missed a bit of an opportunity to really fill the environment with interesting things like they do with the spacial puzzles in the facilities and testing grounds.

5. Repair drones - These little guys just get annoying after a while in the open world. Everything that you kill only stays dead for so long because repair drones will infinitely spawn over and over again to come and repair what you've recently killed. There are some ways to disable the spawning of them in specific areas, however it's usually more work than it's worth. It just becomes tiresome after a while.

Personal Cons: These aren't a big deal, just things I found strange that I think are largely fine.

1. Saving - I'm personally more of a fan of saving my game anywhere at any time like in a standard Bethesda title, however, they opted for saving checkpoints that you use in game. I found a few times while playing, I wanted to get off at that moment but had to keep playing for another 3-5 minutes to get to a save checkpoint.
2. This one's not a big deal at all really, but I found myself struggling as an American to remember a lot of character names throughout the beginning of the game because Russian names are all similar sounding to me. They really do throw a lot of names at you I forgot who was who for a good portion of the game. Luckily the game really begins to hone in on a select few characters in the latter half of the narrative.

Final score: 8.5/10 - Great FPS RPG

Atomic Heart is the lovechild of Fallout, Bioshock, and a little bit of Farcry. And honestly, I think with all the shit this game tries to do it does them very well. Definitely not perfectly by any means but very well indeed.

WHAT I LOVED
1. Gameplay is very fun and fast-paced. It is more akin to Bioshock Infinite than anything else in my opinion. You are constantly rewarded for killing enemies and using all of your arsenal to your advantage. Picking up items quickly with your glove telekinesis is also very satisfying and should be in more games. Taking forty minutes to open every drawer in a room is not fun game design. It's crazy this has just occurred to people.
2. The soundtrack is criminally underrated for this game. There were many times when I just had to stop and appreciate the music this game brings to the table. You've got a whole mix of funk, rock, and even a little hip-hop. In Soviet Russia. Shit was insane. I especially loved NORA's theme/upgrading theme. It's such a simple tune, but it made me look forward to upgrading my gear even more.
3. Story was surprisingly intelligent for having a rapist fridge in it. It is basically if you took two geniuses who had vastly different opinions on what humanity's evolution would be like and put them at odds with one another, with you at the center of it.
4. Worldbuilding is just excellent. You can tell they were passionate about every aspect of this crazy, wacky Russia.
5. Upgrading weapons and abilities was always fun and NORA just made it even better.

WHAT I LIKED
1. Voice acting is really good for everyone. I know how people bash the English translation and it is a bit messy at times, but the main character grows on you. I'm not gonna lie, the first time he said ""Crispy Critters"" I almost died from cringe. But after a few dozen hours he started to grow on me, and his relationship with Charles is actually quite endearing towards the end.
2. The Testing Grounds was a cool idea executed... okay. There were some I really liked, and others that were just annoying. They did give me Portal vibes, which I also didn't expect from a game like this.
3. Open world was pretty fun. It was just large enough to feel large but not too large to where it felt like a bunch of empty space.

WHAT I HATED
1. Hives. Holy shit Hives. And Pchelas. These things make so many combat situations in the open world annoying as hell. You don't even have time to loot enemies you kill because in two seconds they are already fixed. I think Hives should either be destructible or should not work when you're not detected.
2. Stealth. This game needed an actual stealth system. I don't understand why there are cameras, an alarm system, and stealth takedowns when this game doesn't even have a detection bar like in Farcry. It just doesn't make sense and doesn't play very well.
3. The Electro. The Electro needs to be nerfed. I suppose you could just not use it, but it saves so much ammo and the EMP blast is really the only AOE attack you have in the game. It just detracted from the experimental mindset the game tries to push you toward. The same is true for Polymeric Shield. Fully upgraded, it basically makes you invincible.
4. Some minor bugs that need to be patched out. I didn't really run into any until halfway through the game, then I encountered several that made me lose progress because I had to reload a save to fix my game.

SCORE: 8/10
I really enjoyed Atomic Heart. It has some kinks and lacks a bit of polish, but it reminded me of the glory days of FPS games, when developers actually had some amount of creativity and wanted to create interesting worlds. Looking forward to the DLC and whatever their next project ends up being.

The short answer: yes.

Long answer:
It's worth trying though I can tell that first quarter of the game it's kinda hard and somewhat boring at some moments. The funny thing is that this game tries to be scary sometimes too, you can expect some sort of robot jump scares if you don't scan all the space ahead. But I think it's only relevant for the beginning of the game and at the end of it.

I really liked aesthetics of the game, it's really interesting to see all these robots and architecture variations that have never existed. Devs worked well on characters and I can't tell that they're plain, it's quite opposite. I had only one problem with the voice actress for Granny Zina - when I heard her voice in English I was like ""wtf it is much better than the Russian one"", in Russian she sounds like a 40yo woman trying to impersonate an old woman. Total miscast. 

What else didn't I like?
- The huge influence of Bioshock Infinite on the plot of this game. It's really noticeable.
Neptune/Rapture underwater bases, flying cities, the lighthouse, connection between the protagonist and the main villain, abilities of the hero.
- Bees and their bases. I understand that they can spawn again and again. What I can't understand - why fat boy can't destroy their hive. It's awful gaming experience when your fallen enemies revive again and again. On the other hand - it's a great opportunity to farm some resources. Though I'd prefer to have an ability to destroy hives.
- The first encounter of Plyush. This thing should be balanced in that scenario. I didn't have fat boy atm and I spend around 300 kalash bullets on it, 3 fire polymer thingy and some time fighting with Zvezdochka or Pashtet. It was hell. I managed to kill that thing on the third try. Also combo thing to get out of its tentacles is BULLSHIT. Especially on the easiest mode - there is no room for a mistake and the given time is really short to react.
- Steamdeck bugs: abilities don't have videos, Ну погоди! cartoons don't play anywhere, cutscenes after finishing the game show only the black screen.

I won't be waiting for DLC, I'm not gonna buy them, I'm fine with spending 19 hours to finish this game. It's worth trying and finishing once, but no more than that.",1677711851,1677712028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Jokes aside, honestly one of the best single player games I have played in YEARS. The melee combat is strange to get used to, but quite fun and responsive once you get a handle on it. The abilities Charles gives you are few in number, but all of them are viable and fun to use, some more than others( Mass Telekinesis is OP). The story is long enough to really sell the world and the environment, but not so long that it drags on and becomes unenjoyable. Story is quite nice, and has some interesting moral implications.

Enemy design is fantastic, both visually and from a gameplay standpoint. Some boss fights are fantastic, while some are lackluster. For example, Hedgie, the Twins, and Dewdrop are very fun bosses. However, Belyash and Natasha fall short. Plyusch is fun but overused, by the 3rd or even 4th time fighting it you will be sick and tired of seeing it.

The puzzles in the game are brilliant, and perfect for my room-temperature IQ. Some are difficult, but none difficult enough to require me to look up the solution. All are fun and don't last longer than they are welcome, something I quite appreciate as someone who typically isn't very good at puzzles.

Admittedly, the game suffers from some pretty bad issues that I feel I should list here. For one, you will get stuck. I got stuck on random bits of environment and was forced to reload at least a dozen separate times. For two, and this could just be a personal issue, but towards the end of the game( Last 3-4 hours), the game would just lock up every now and then, freezing for 10-20 seconds before it fixed itself. I also had a quite annoying bug that made me have to restart an entire save file 7 hours in due to a door not opening when it should have.

In summary, Atomic Heart is a fantastic game that I would give a 9/10. It shines in its world design, storytelling, and enemy design. It has its drawbacks, such as lack of weapon/ability choices, and some bad bugs, but I think the gameplay overcomes all the shortcomings there. Worth a pickup, especially since the Devs have plans for 4 DLC in the future.",1677710368,1677710368,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

On the other hand the world looks very well made, with various graphical level of details. 
The story so far is not something wow, it lacks in some areas, a lot, but I think it's ok. The characters are cool enough to keep the player going.
The weapons and combat system are very good, and satisfying, also the looting system is awesome. 
I believe this game has poor sound design, at least the voice acting is bad; and some of the foot sounds don't match up with the surface the player walks on. The game score is cool though, Mick Gordon soundtracks.

The story was  interesting and engaging, but I feel like we're left in the dark for too long about what's going on.  The combat and gun play feels good and smooth and the animations just add to the charm, also you can choose what abilities and guns you want to use. You will have to use most of your abilities and guns to outplay situations, and this game is filled with puzzles that require thinking.

Cons:
-oppressive game design: IE constant respawning enemies on the overworld but fixed loot spawns. You get a lot of ammo, but not unlimited.
-Enemies are bullet sponges. even when combining abilities to make enemies more vulnerable they still eat a lot of ammo from most firearms.

This was enough time for me to complete the introduction and get to the quirky upgrading kink bot. Besides the initial interaction with the upgrade machine I have to warn that the voice acting is a bit too much for me to bear for a full story run of this game.

Let me explain. I feel as though the voice actors themselves had the chops to deliver the lines well but whomever the director was didn't sit down and evaluate the delivery of the lines and think ""Okay the person is stating the line clearly but it doesn't feel like they are selling the actual emotion of the line stated."" P-3, your character will call someone an ""a**hole"" but it feels like he simply read the line from a script as opposed to trying to sell the line. I don't expect 5 star above and beyond effort but it's jarring when that's the delivery throughout the whole game. This was the only thing that made me refund the game for now since it's pretty taxing to deal with it throughout my whole potential play-through.

The positive is that if you are a huge Bioshock fan (Like myself) then this game is right up your alley. They have the adorable preview animations of special abilities, the ability to do a dedicated melee build in a first person adventure and an decently paced combat system. It's just that the voice lines which also serve to dispense plot is delivered in such a way that's annoying is all.",1677690812,1677690812,False,2,2,0.463157892227172852,0,True,False,False

It had an amazing presentation at the start. My jaw literally hit the floor during the floating car sequence.
But then the rest of the game happened.

The level designs got progressively amateurish
The enemy types were boring and repetitive.
I hated the alert system that threw 100 generic bots at you the moment it caught a whiff of your fart
The cutscenes were really goofy
I didn't like the main protagonist. They should have made him mute the the Bioshock guy.
There were some other things I didn't like about the game, but were pretty minor

I will still recommend and support this game tho.
Because the devs were not afraid to get edgy with character designs and story concepts. You could tell they didn't care about censorship, and I love that. We need more AAA devs that don't give a crap about SJWs. 
I think it's kinda funny how the games that came out when I was a teen were way more mature than majority of the games that come out now that I'm a grown ass adult lol

Unfortunately, God of War & Dark Souls have forever broken my combat mechanics expectations. I am no longer sold on the first person combat. To make matters worse, the game invests seemingly zero effort into training the player how to play the game. Don't even think of being a champ and trying to start on the highest difficulty. You'll quickly get dissatisfied with what Mundfish has created here.

Overall, the game is not anywhere near as spectacular a flop as Cyberpunk 2077, but it's nowher close to the hype that built up around it.

In terms of pure FPS gameplay, I think Atomic Heart does a fantastic job. I got alot of enjoyment figuring out the best ways to handle combat with my powers, how to farm up robot parts by using certain systems within the game, and overall I think its moment-to-moment gameplay is rock solid. 

The puzzles in this game are incredibly complex and unique, and are on par with some of the most interesting ones i've ever seen in a game. Doing all the research stations introduces you to a huge variety of puzzles that are all pretty difficult and satisfying to solve, and the payoff is generally well worth the hassle. Very well done.

But, Atomic Heart isnt all sunshine and rainbows. The writing in this game is quite poor, with a really mean and aggressive protagonist, hyper-sexualized side characters, and some really ham-fisted quests that any high school student could have came up with.

By the end of the game, I was really happy with this game and how things ended up in the story, until I reached the end. For me, the endings (i did both) were unbelievably bad and really brought down my overall happiness with the product. I was on track to giving this like an 8.5/10 until i did the endings, which dropped it down to like a 7/10.

This game is infuriating. I can kill any enemy I can encounter on Armageddon difficulty, it is hard, but I can do it. But what's the fucking point of doing that when the enemy just gets revived in less than 20 seconds in Open World sections? Ammo is most certainly not plentiful, so using it sparingly would be the wise thing to do... that is if you weren't constantly swarmed with flying enemies, just out of harm's reach of your melee. And it doesn't help that resources needed for crafting (the more advanced resources at least) are not common enough to make upgrading weapons AND crafting ammo viable. And why so few resources? Am I playing the original Resident Evil's?
Guns are fine, just not enough ammo for the spongy enemies, and melee kinda sucks like most games, so that doesn't bother me too much. Powers are kinda meh.
The movement kinda sucks. You are restricted to a decent jogging pace, so if you enjoy the freedom of movement, stay away. The closest you will get to running are the dashes that are meant for dodging attacks, or cheesing the parkour (if you can call it that?) system.
I read the Digital Artbook at the very start when the game was compiling shaders, so I kinda knew why the player character acted the way he does before I got into the game, which probably helped me from hating him.
There is no FOV slider, so if that's a thing you want, you will have to wait for the next update.

The Premise and setting of the game are fantastic though, everywhere looks beautiful... However it is ruined in my opinion by Temporal Anti-Aliasing. I don't know why developers are moving towards this system, is it cheaper? easier? or uses less computer resources? Either way it makes all movement blurry as shit, and I have motion blur turned off. And turning it off makes the textures of everything look like shit, so leaving it off doesn't help either.

I would say try the game and refund it at the very least if you don't like it. But the enemies getting revived extremely quick, causing swarms is what made me stop. Shit's just too infuriating.",1677653868,1677653868,False,4,0,0.480784177780151367,0,True,False,False

This game is awesome (but not ideal of course).

I don’t believe that I’m telling this about the game from Russian developers, but “Atomic heart” is really impressive. Visual and art style is perfect, sound design is incredible. 
I forgot that time when starting a new game, I said: “Wow! It is amazingly gorgeous”.
But more than that game is optimized perfectly! PERFECTLY, Carl! On PC, Carl!
Turn on and get fun, no struggle with bugs, stutters and glitches.

Pros: 
- Gorgeous visual with a lot of stunning details, interesting soviet-technology robot design.
- Strong atmosphere
- Good optimization, really good optimization. 
- Robot Ballerinas twins.
- Not a bad story with a nice background.

Cons:
- Clunky melee battle system.
- Not all cutscenes look good, some animated really cheap (or looks like it).
- Frustrating “never ending” enemies on the openworld. 
- And personally for me a small number of bosses.

Hard to believe, but “Atomic heart”, in my opinion, shows how the AAA-game must look like in 2023.

Wait for it to go on sale or get it on gamepass, just don't pay full price. Very repetitive, a lot of highs, a lot of lows, messy pacing, but enough interesting things to keep you going. Paints both communism and capitalism as bad if you cared about that. There's actually quite a bit of robot girls.

Beat the game on normal in a little over 13 hours. See literally no reason to replay unless I want to just look at stuff. You can easily extend this time by really exploring the overworld. If you find value or enjoyment in the overworld gameplay loop, then you'll probably enjoy going through it. I however, did not find value.

The good:
- The music is definitely the highlight. At its best its really good and exciting, at its worst its still interesting. Which is better than forgettable imo
- Very well optimized. I had very steady frames and only encountered a single glitch that required a restart. But that only happened once and I was jumping in a spot I wan't meant to.
- Great setting and visuals
- Story is decent, nothing mindblowing. There are a few things that don't make sense, but there is still setup and payoff within the narrative
- I felt the difficulty was fine throughout. I was never on autopilot when in combat and would still find myself making mistakes and dying. There are certain perks that are a must have and you definitely feel the progression. I found myself wanting to avoid combat near the start, but not at all near the end.
- I liked every side character/robot. There was a certain red robot that I wish had more screen time. It was fun whenever I saw it. I've seen that some people HATED this character, but I personally like it. 
- There is a mission/dungeon with what I thought was a 10/10 subplot in the readable records and audio recordings.
- Very small and isolated moments throughout the I absolutely loved. Like some character interaction or world building moments. 


The bad:
- Probably the biggest issue: pacing pacing pacing. It made no sense. They tried to do what Bioshock Infinite did with seeing columbia all nice and pretty and happy before things go wrong, except not as well both thematically and in execution. You sit through what is basically an interactive cut scene with really on-the-nose exposition and a lot of NPCs going ""wow, it sure is amazing that we have such amazing science in [city name] thanks to [name] and their [invention] that recently came out."" After this you, you arrive in the open world to go to the first mission/dungeon. I then spent 4 hours on this first mission. Then back to the open world for 10 minutes to get to the next story mission. Then another 2-3 hours on that. Then everything gets shorter on average afterwards. The first half of the game has so many puzzles that you would think it was a puzzle game first before a FPS, but then the last half of the game has literally no puzzles so idk. Its a mess.
- The game has an ""open world"" tag, but is only ""open world"" in that there is an overworld that you can explore (kinda). However, there isn't really anything to do other than collect weapon blueprints and kill robots. The overworld only stands as a set piece to get from story mission to story mission. I spent maybe an 1.5 hours total in the overworld, and I was really trying to find interesting things to do. There was a point in which I wanted to travel to get an upgrade for a weapon only to find that the entire section of the map was cut off and I had to progress through the story to open it. There wasn't even any indication that it opened when it did. And by the time it did, I didn't need the upgrade. The combat cycle for the overworld can just be ignored. There are sometimes just too many enemies in a given location. Like, you will scan the area and there's 30 things on your screen with lines connecting them and then they just keep adding more and more as you progress through the story. 
- There are lines of dialog that are just bad. Not even like ""oh that could have been better"". More like ""I wish i didn't have to listen to that"". You kinda get used to it though. Or maybe it just improved a bit over the course of the game
- Voice acting is good, but the direction is often terrible. The MC will say a line and deliver it well, but in a tone and inflection that does not fit the situation at all. I found this happening a lot. I'm told the Russian VA is the best option.
- Unbelievably repetitive. Very little enemy variety. Only (one)? dead soldier model. You will spend hours collecting things to put into other things to open doors and then open some variation of three lock types on a door to again collect things to open another door and then talk to an unmoving dead body. Each time you fight some amount of the 6 or so enemy types. (eidt:I looked this up, there are 9 normal types. 3 have variants. The rest are boss types. You see one type way more than the rest). The game also tries to be cute with it by having the MC say something sarcastic like ""Wow, another lock on the door. Who would have seen that coming?"", or ""Yeah, of course I have to go collect more capsules. What else could it have possibly been?"". As though that makes this type of game design excusable. 
- The first boss fight blew my mind away. Like probably the best moment of the game. Then all other boss fights are boring.


EDIT:
lmao people got heated in the comments, which is fine. At the end of the day, it is a negative review for something they may have enjoyed. In regards to my point on the price of the game; It's not a matter of being able to afford it, but rather that the game is simply not worth full price. If you are ok with paying $60 for 10-12 hours of content, go for it. If you can find it cheaper, you should probably do that instead. If the asking price was lower, it would arguably decrease quality expectations and the game's issues would be more excusable. But instead, they want a AAA price so I will expect AAA quality and will judge it so. My other criticisms still stand, regardless of the price. I don't hate the game, I just don't recommend it as it currently is. Also I've never bought any COD of FIFA games. I don't know where that point's coming form.

Like many of the reviews, I thought the game would follow maybe Fallout 4 with some Outer Worlds in the mix.  Wow, was I wrong....this game is quite...umm, unusual...BUT Fun!

Firstly, the graphics are amazing with really good frame rates, even playing at ultra (running a 2080 RTX Ti Founders Edition).  However, not unlike many PC based games, I find some of the movement a bit off and unresponsive.  I am even using Razer accessories and a wired mouse.  Jumping is a bit of a learning experience and getting caught behind objects without a way out....usual mouse and keyboard stuff.

The story is a bit hard to follow as it takes odd twists in theory.  Also, some of the language and story telling seems like bad translation from the original language.  Some aspects are actually quite annoying.  I am also not a fan of puzzle and fight scenes where you have to spend 20 minutes trying, through trial and error, and then having to replay the scene if you fail.

I'm going to do this using games like Bioshock and System Shock 2 as pieces to compare with. This will have spoilers that will be marked throughout. I'd like to start by making a broad statement that this game feels as if it were created on game play and the story was secondary and rushed, despite this I, for the most part enjoyed the story as it felt like it was heavily influenced by Bioshock to the point where certain things feel copied almost. I have little qualms with this however because the environment is in stark contrast to Bioshock politico-economically. Bioshock was placed in a purely laissez faire capitalist society, we watch it crumble from the inside. In Atomic Heart we see this story arc applied to an early stage communist dictatorship, I find this to be very interesting as it shows the differences in the political systems, but how the same results can come from such polarizing yet extreme opposites. In Bioshock we find the perils of money and an uncontrollable economy based on Adam. In Atomic Heart we find the perils of a few people being in power under an all adoring public. This comparison to Bioshock does not comprise the entirety of Atomic Hearts story as there are sub plots that attribute to the main story. However in the sense of moving the plot the game utilizes the Bioshock formula and sprinkles its own incredible lore in, as well as creating new character dynamics not quite seen in Bioshock. However most characters are clearly identifiable with their Bioshock counter parts [spoiler] (Granny Zina = Tennenbaum, Chariton/Charles = Fontaine, Sechenov = Ryan) [/spoiler] , but again I found this to be intriguing with the difference in socioeconomic stances the games take and how the characters interact with their world. One thing that starkly differs from Bioshock and SS2 is the voicing of the protagonist, I'm sure this has been stated plenty of times, but the voicing of the main character is downright annoying at times. His catch phrase of ""Crispy Critters"" is said so many times that it looses any meaning and dissolves into a useless chant from the protag whenever he feels slightly annoyed or inconvenienced by anything. If the man could just shut the heck up the game would be like 10% better. There are artsy cut scenes that feel as if they're trying to capture some whimsical essence of godliness or at least constructed faith on the robots end. The robots at times perform ritualistic acts and this feels almost comparative to a religious moment with a good chunk of the odd cutscenes including some one dying or robots sacrificially stabbing each other.",1677640996,1677640996,True,0,0,0.499265789985656738,0,True,False,False

I've been looking at this game ever since the first demos and other videos came out (Yes, the twins enforced the interest). It took me about 20 hours to beat on the highest difficulty, just for rushing through the main path, no exploring or doing anything else. So there's content, that's for sure.

Gameplay is pretty good, feels great crushing metal and flesh to pieces with melee weapons, but at higher difficulty it's just better to save as much ammo as possible and learn to dodge, a lot. There are times when you get surrounded and i got myself killed in a blink for that. Looting is pretty unique, you use your glove as a vacuum to empty desks and lockers, and even on the hardest difficulty it's easy to get stocks of ammo and materials if you take your time to loot.

Now, if you expect a great story well...yeah it's decent i guess. It's an average Bioshock type of story (the game even makes a little reference to Bioshock at one point). My problem is mostly some ofthe dialogue and the way the twists and info are delivered. The story isn't anything special, and i wish it was handled different.

The one thing this game delivers very well is on style tho. Goddamn those are some awesome robot designs in action, from the moustache guys to Natasha and the Belyash (Yes, the twins are hot asf). The game puts all its heart on its robot designs and the way they fight (even if some are incredibly annoying).

I just wish they put their heart on the story and characters, because other than the concepts and goals i just couldn't care less for anyone, even the main character.

If you expect to stay in the Vavilov-Complex at the beginning, the transition to a more open world-style map later on might be somewhat disorienting, and feels like a different game. The soviet styling of the game is fresh and hasn't been done that much, but the unfitting english voiceover kind of destroys the immersive ""I'm in an alternate reality soviet russia"" feeling immediately. 

They could have done a bit more here, maybe let the main character speak heavily accented, even if its kind of a cliche by now. The NPC assets (mostly corpses) are recycled way too often, and it feels as if the soviets did not just master robotics but also cloning.  The same russian soldier-corpse over and over again can be a bit boring over time. Battles are ok, but lack a certain amount of punch.

Сеттинг, мир и сама история - отличные. В игре имеются мелкие косяки и какие-то технические мелочи, но я ничего критичного не встретил, а то, что встречал, решалось загрузкой предыдущего сейва. Нареканий никаких нет. 

Темп у игры, правда, разный. Первая третья более медленная и вдумчивая, прям коридорная, дальше только быстрее, динамичнее и масштабнее. Чувствуется, что на разных этапах пытались копировать какие-то механики из других игр. Тут и от DOOM / Wolfenstein есть (в основном в последней трете), и от Bioshock / Prey (в первой половине), есть интересные находки с головоломками, замками, полигонами. Игра не заходит в полной мере на сторону иммерсив-симов (не хватает этого), но где-то рядом топчется, периодически залетая в чистый экшен и шутер. Тут даже нашлось место Ubisoft-вышкам, которые никакой пользы, кроме как получение чертежей для крафта не несут. Стелса, при этом, нет, он просто отсутствует как данность.

Its possible you should use russian w/ subs if you care about purity. The story is fine. Above average. 

Heres the real issue:
Its the above ground combat thats destroying this game. The game itself plays a lot like Bioshock and Prey mixed together. The gameplay has a mixture of combat and puzzles, but the only way i can really be immersed in it is when im in the underground levels. Above ground its entirely pointless as the small robots repair the large ones infinitely w/o end. There is no point. Its like an entirely different game that destroys my desire to want to explore and is there only for padding. Its really clear that the design of this game is off.

Combat isn't bad. Its really basic and the NORA storage system is too silly to constantly have to get into. The UI could use an overhaul too. It really should be redesigned. 

ITs like they added the above ground for no good reason.  There are no quests to complete, just bunkers to move towards in poorly rendered vehicles or on foot with random houses scattered here and there. And of course robots everywhere that are perpetually repaired. Stealth is also non existent where robots can see you through bushes for no good reason. And CCTV cameras can be disabled but as this is only temporary the game forces you to destroy it and, like the others, it gets repaired. So combat situations have to be calculated to get kills. You collect parts after and then have to move on because you can't stop the endless waves of repair bots from fully repairing all robots you just downed. It makes high alert battles frustrating and pointless as every robot you kill gets repaired. You have no choice but to run. ITs just not fun.

Underground the battle are smaller and much more manageable. I feel like they should have just scrapped the above ground sections all together. The UG sections have much better story elements that mean something and make you feel like you're progressing the story. The AG sections feel like they are just glorified loading screens to the next section and dont do much to make the game enjoyable. Just padding for exploration of a pointless environment that you dont need to explore  because it all looks the same and resources are so abundant everywhere else that you dont need to worry about it (you can just run to the next section). Its like if bioshock had AG sections between each level that existed for the sole purpose of moving to the waypoint that starts the next level.

IF you like Prey a lot and bioshock, youll probably like this fine. Its a good game at its base, but it has lots of hang ups that keep it from reaching its full potential.

I wish there were more abilities and weapons to use and I also wish there were more enemy variety. Game glitches here and there but with so many save areas its not that bad. Puzzles are fun. Not too hard but not easy. The world around you looks gorgeous and unique. It's both open world and linear. You never get lost or don't know what to do. Over all, I'm having a blast. Once you get a few upgrades and the shotgun, the game is pretty easy. Just freeze, shoot repeat.
