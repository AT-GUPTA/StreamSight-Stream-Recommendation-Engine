The game is just another vestige of Crapcom dark ages these days, with everything checking up: bad DLC practices, a badly directed John Mctiernan low tier mashup of action sequences, and a backward policy of appealing to the supposed West audience that appealed to an imaginary public instead.

Story was somewhat decent, the gunplay/combat was also really innovative to the series at the time of original release, and the characters also ended alright, but that basically ends there with a counter part to each of them: The story was destroyed by the terrible pacing and the huge amount of unnecessary action sequences and explosions, the gunplay and combat were ruined by enemies with huuuge mercy windows that would put grounded fighting game characters to shame, and the somewhat non bland characters were victims of mary sues and obvious plot armor.

On the topic of the Extra game modes, normal Mercenaries was trash, but the No Mercy version, the one that includes the L4Dead colab, man, that was a real blast, one which i'm seeing myself playing for a good while post 100%. 
The rest is not worth mentioning, Capcom to this day still didn't learn the basic concept of m.p. loop engagement and dedicated servers.

An overall safe and skippable chapter of Biohazard if you're not a big enjoyer of the series. One that may or may not warrant a remake.

I'd rather play this game again than ever run through Resident Evil 7 and it's super Bullet Absorbing enemies known as the molded. My reasoning is because I think way too many people throw shade at this game for the wrong reasons, One of the reason's I can absolutely agree with is that it is too damn long for an RE Game, usually you are looking at about 8-12 hours of gameplay with a typical RE Game, Unless you are playing RE1 Classic or RE3 Classic those were quite short clocking in at maybe 3-5 hours. But RE6 is maybe 20-28 hours thanks too the fact that the stories are split into 4 different campaigns, that last maybe 5-7 hours each, It really does overstay it's welcome especially with there being a lot of quicktime events in the game, which is another big reason this game got hate. I think the people who bitch about the story are overreacting, Has there ever really been a Resident Evil game that has had a good story? None of them really had an amazing narrative, not even the newer ones and don't try lying to yourself. The gameplay can honestly be real stupid fun, not to mention with a friend in coop.

Some situations/parts and certain things(which seem to be only bad programmed) I just hate in that game and don't even want to proceed further in the game and then there are some situations and certain things where I absolutely like that game.
And to be fully honest, I got so pissed off during a certain part in the game that I not only was about to rage quit, uninstall that game and never play it again, but also give that game definitely a thumbs down..
[h3]AI Character[/h3]
There’s one super annoying thing I really hate about the AI in this game and that’s the fact that you have to play babysitter but what does that mean?
If you are at a certain spot where you have to press “V”(on PC) to perform an action like opening doors or to boost the AI onto something and as soon as you pressed “V”, you’re stuck in this action until the AI is with you to perform this action but what makes this so annoying? 
It’s simply the fact that you cannot cancel this action by yourself which means that if the AI is miles away from you, it takes forever for the AI to come to you.
The only way this action will be cancelled is if you’re attacked by an enemy which is imo the most dumbest thing I have ever seen.
I mean there are other spots where you have to perform QTE(Quick-Time-Events) in the game where you have to spin a Valve Wheel by quickly pressing “WASD”(on PC) and this action you can cancel by pressing “Space”(on PC), why the hell isn’t that possible with the other actions where you have to wait for the AI?
[h3]Inventory[/h3]
I cannot tell how long it took me to understand and get used to this inventory system.
(This is a little “Guide” to demonstrate this “special” inventory system) 
Combining herbs and selecting any utility is so stupid weird..
For combining herbs you have to press “E” to open the main inventory, scroll to the green herb, press “Space” to select it, press again “Space” to select the second green or red herb and then press again “Space” to combine it – if you want to store the combined herb, you have press again “Space” to select the herb and then press again “Space to store it in the “tablet case”.
See, absolutely dumb and super laborious…
To select any utility you have to press “Shift” to open the “sub-inventory” and then you have all your utilities.
… just don’t ask me, why, ok x) 
I have never seen a more dumb and laborious inventory system in any other game!
[h3]Tutorial[/h3]
Yep, this Resident Evil Part does have a Tutorial which you have to play first before playing the actual game but spoiler alert; [spoiler]the entire tutorial is also a Part in the final Chapter of the Leon Campaign.[/spoiler]
[h3]Controls[/h3]
This game has a completely different controls compared to all other Resident Evil Part’s!
Usually you press and hold “Shift” to sprint in almost every game but in this game you have to press and hold “Space” to sprint..
For example; there was a Part in Chris' Campaign - Chapter 3, where I got so pissed off, that I not only was about to rage quit and uninstall the game, but also definitely would've given that game a thumbs down because there was a Part in this Chapter where I thought to be stuck(I died 44 times in this Part) and only a comment in a other f*cking Steam discussion(from 10 years ago) helped me to proceed because the game itself didn't tell me anything, during the entire play through and at first I thought it was a bug but it wasn't, it was only the very first time in the game where I had to use “Space” to sprint which I apparently didn’t needed before.
As I already have written in my Resident Evil 4 2005 Review, the QTE happen at least on PC sooo stupid fast where you have literally a time window of max 1 second to react with a weird combination of keys on the keyboard whereas you have all buttons on the controller directly ready to hand – as much as I have seen in videos on YouTube, you have a react time window of about 3 seconds with controller, like?? x)

There’s nothing to complain about her, she’s the real boss in the entire Resident Evil Franchise(you can say what you want) and she knows exactly what she is doing – oh and her love for Leon(and vice versa of course) is so special, especially the scene of those two on the Quad Tower in Lanshiang!
[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The way the gameplay is in this Resident Evil Part is how I imagine it as a typical Resident Evil gameplay. 
But this game had also it’s few situations again where too much happen at ones - my biggest complaign especially in this game would be that it's quite unnecessary to fight besides the boss also the regular zombies as it was already in Resident Evil 3 Remake(penultimate Nemesis Boss fight).
[h3]Bosse[/h3]
A few bosses were really easy whereas other bosses where just annoying and kinda hard to beat.
Those who have played Resident Evil 7 before this Resident Evil here, will definitely recognize a certain boss fight again ;)
[h3]Game Length[/h3]
For my personal taste, this game has a wayyy too long story length and honestly it felt like I was playing 4 Resident Evil Parts because each Campaign took me about 9 hours to beat, only the Ada Campaign took me about 6 hours.
[h3]Graphics[/h3]
Honestly? For a Game which was released back in 2012, this game looks really good!
[h3]Rating[/h3]
As I have said at the beginning of this review, I was about to give this game definitely a thumbs down but later on I really began to enjoy and like this game. I'd give that game a 7/10!

Resident Evil 6 is a 2012 third-person shooter video game developed and published by Capcom. A major installment in the Resident Evil series, Players control Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong as they confront the force behind a worldwide bio-terrorist attack.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 6 has such a mix set of graphics. First I have to say that the UI is actual torture. Whoever made the UI in this game hates you and wants you to truly suffer. Wanna pause the game and change settings? F*ck you, basically. You can pause the game with a big PAUSE in the middle of the screen, but changing audio settings or controls while playing is a nightmare. Having to navigate through your game phone “no joke” is comical at best. I guess it’s cool that every character’s story has a different style UI? It would have been better if the UI was easy to navigate. Also switching weapons is a huge pain too so have fun with that. The lighting is pretty good in some sections (especially Leon’s campaign), while others look so washed out and depressing. The world textures are disgusting if you get close to them. The character models and cinematics do look really good though.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Okay the gameplay is pretty average on a good day. Now the movement is the best in the franchise. Being able to roll and dive around during some cool dodges is pretty addicting. I really enjoyed the movement in this game. The shooting not so much. I can’t put my finger on it but the shooting feels so stiff and hard to aim. Playing RE4 and RE5 was day and night different in terms of gunplay compared to RE6. It’s not good here I will say, the gunplay is pretty awful. Speaking of awful, for a game that focuses on actions and a ton of enemies, sure hates giving you ammo. Breaking a grate or killing an enemy sometimes gives you ammo, but most of the time you will get skill points. The skills in this game don’t really make a huge deal here from my experience. Only a few are worth using, so most are just filler. The drop rates are horrible, most of the time you will get skill points and no ammo so good luck. I don’t see why they added the skills in this game, they don’t play a big role here. Honestly you can play without them and your gameplay will barely change at all. The map design is trash. Jakes snow mission is torture, chris’s helicopter chase section is a pain at best, and much more. Also this game feels like an action flick with a taste of michael bay. I swear they have a love for explosions here. It's pretty comical. Oh and if you enjoy QTE’s, this is the game for you. Literally you will be doing QTE’s for the most pointless reason, like finding keys in a car for example. It’s hard to find something good here. I guess the Co-op is fun, if you don’t crash a lot. Oh and the enemy design is heartbreaking (they have half human/half grasshopper enemies). That says enough.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is actually pretty interesting I will say. Playing through it, not so much. I just didn’t have a good time with some sections of the game. Chris was fun, Leon was good, Jake was meh, and Ada’s was the worst. This game is canon so if you are wanting to dive deeper into the Resident Evil Universe, you will learn a lot here from the story. It just felt kinda weak and forgettable from my experience.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]In terms of co-op, it’s pretty fun. As fun as it gets for this game I guess. I would totally prefer company while playing this game since the co-op is actually really well implemented here (well kinda). I have experienced crashes on co-op and lost of connection sadly. It’s not rapid, but it can happen. The PVP is trash. Just get a friend and get the achievements since it’s so bland and a bore fest (also no one plays it).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]To beat all the stories it takes around 20+ hours (depending on difficulty). If you focused on getting 100% it will take you around 60-70+ hours.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]I will say that the voice acting is actually pretty good. I really enjoyed the cutscenes a lot here. The music is a no no sadly. The soundtrack feels like an afterthought. Prepare to hear a lot of generic action music, also has the weakest safe theme in the franchise (from my experience).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I didn’t notice any game breaking bugs or weird glitches from my experience. Besides the loss of connection while playing co-op at times.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]RE6 runs really well on my system. Being able to play max settings with a solid 60fps, it looked really smooth with no stutters or glitches.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 6 to me left a mark on the franchise and not for the good reasons. With the QTE spams, horrible pacing, confusing/forgettable story, horrible mechanics and game design, etc. So many issues this game possesses that it’s hard to give it a thumbs up. I didn’t follow the hate train mainly because I got into RE way after release (not counting my first experience with Outbreak on the PS2, amazing game btw). I came to this game with open arms and it spat me right in the face. I thought I would somewhat enjoy it, ignoring all the hate and bs, but my god was I wrong. This was the Franchise's worst time in its history, with RE7 saving the franchise and I can see why it did. I would skip this atrocity of a game. If you are wanting to learn the lore of RE or are collecting all the games, get this on a huge discount.[/td]

Sadly, the reason I really can't recommend this game is solely because Crapcom has decided to put in a Russian DRM that's so easily compromised, you'd be less exposed walking into a snowstorm in your underwear. This is to say nothing of Capcom openly banning certain mods across most of their games. Like a number of AAA gaming companies, both here and overseas, it has become anti-consumer, and seems like it may continue to be in the near future.

I know Resident Evil 5 gets a lot of hate but I gotta say the game-play in that was like butter compared to what I have experienced in the few hours of playing Resident Evil 6. If you're looking at buying this game in the future do not unless its cheap. I am not happy playing this game again and do not recommend it. If you're looking to play this game for the story just watch someones play-through. 

To expand on my review I didn't like the dodge mechanics mixed with the camera view made it very hard to play. The fact that playing on normal even with all the ammo I had, enemies seem to take so much damage it made me wonder what is the point of head shots when it doesn't work. The melee system in the game is kinda cool but the range of it working is lacking, such as when you're close enough to damage an enemy it would miss the melee (haha). There would be zombies with weapons attached to them and you would have to damage the zombie enough to use the ""insta kill"" on it when it should just be the first option not 99 damage and then we get the ""insta kill"" . Would also like to add the skill system in the game is kinda of garbage. Adding skills to the game to make up for the lack of good game-play is just sad. I know this game came out in 2013 but comparing it to Resident Evil 4 and 5 which came out before why change the mechanics now.

RE5 story was the funny kind of bad, but this one is the boring kind of bad. Besides, there's basically no story at all, just excuses to change scenarios and keep killing zombies.

On the zombies topic, the physical combat is good, I liked that addition, but guns feel bad, there's little to no feedback when shooting. Am I hitting a weak point? Am I doing no damage at all? I have no idea.
Boss fights are eternal, and not the epic kind of long bosses you might be thinking of, they really drag on and are interrupted so much. 

Same with the campaign. 4 campaigns of (I assume) 5-6 hs of length, but they all revolve around the same (terrible) plot so once you finish one, the rest is the same from other perspectives. At around the 3hs mark it already starts dragging on, and out of boredom and wanting to finish them already, at the end of these campaigns I would just start running past all enemies and discovered that they literally don't attack you if you're running, even if you pass right by their side, I started ignoring all enemies and they wouldn't even pursue me most of the time.

Ambience is terrible as well, most generic soundtrack that almost seems to disappear at times, really doesn't help with immersion, same with the huge amount of scripted events, at times it makes you question if you should even shoot the enemies because it might as well be a scripted event",1706279486,1706284498,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 6 is a must-Play game in my opinion, but not for the reasons you would think. Or let me rephrase that: Not for the reasons you would hope for your game to be called a must-Play. It's common knowledge by now that this game is an absolute shit Show of different design choices and the prime example of what happens when a game diverges too far from its roots.
Resident Evil 1 was a slow, atmospheric and, for the time, terrifying experience (I think, I haven't actually played it myself). Even the over the top hack'n'slasher Devil May Cry, which was originally being developed as RE 4, showed some of those characteristics like the slow start before any action happend and at times very atmospheric levels. Well take that shit and throw it out the window, RE 6 is here leveling bridges and crashing helicopters into buildings in the fucking prologue.
Resident Evil 6 had the potential to be something great, but it isn't. And it's all the better for it, because this game is fucking hilarious. Grab a friend and play this with them and I guarantee you will have a great time.
What did you expect me to actually review this game? No, this game is so blood crazy it doesn't deserve a proper review. It has transcended normal games where reviews require metrics like gameplay and story. There is only one metric that applies to this game and that is how fucking insane is it and on a scale of 1 to 10 it's OVER 9000.
Some bad games or movies, etc. are often called, so bad it's good, but that doesn't apply to the game. I think a more fitting sentence would be such a clusterfuck it's hilarious. I encourage you to put down your hard earned cash for this game, just to experience the batshit insane nature of it and to subsequently question what kind of drugs Capcom's employees were on to think this was an acceptable mainline entry for Resident Evil.

This one though, despite being the fan least favorite, kept me hooked and I still play it regularly. Joining a random coop session or whatever.
If you are looking solely for a RE game, you'll be disappointed indeed, as it is far different from the holy trinity (RE1/2/3).
I think what I really like about the game is the rythm, and the balance between action/shooting/QTE/escape scenes, etc...
Maybe if you have an ADHD brain like mine, you'll like it, as you never linger too much in one thing and everything is so various and flashy. The game is also linear and straightforward, there is no frustrating labyrinth or anything to waste your time. Pure packed action, little time to get bored, nothing too difficult or nerve-wracking. A frustration free game.
The story is often criticized, however I did find it interesting. We always love to see the ever stoic Ada and her character being explored in more depth, Leon is still himself, altruistic with his peculiar sense of humor. Chris is also himself, and we can see some interesting character development in his campaign. Finally, it is nice to see grown up Sherry and her dynamic with Jake is interesting.
It is all very subjective of course, but RE6 became one of my favorite game, one that I can play multiple times without being bored.

I'm sorry I have to do this but:

Good game but sadly now I gotta add a bad review because Capcom added a shady DRM to an old game and declaring war against modders. honestly capcom go eat a D***....

************OLD REVIEW**************
this game is fun period and that's the idea of playing a game. If you can't get past the hardcore fanboyism (yes the originals were great I love them too) don't buy it but If you want to play a fun and challenging 3rd person shooter with a lot of action, one of the best netcodes there is and that has a lot of game modes then I fully recommend this game.

F.Y.I. If you love left 4 dead 2 you'll enjoy playing mercenaries mode which features playable Ellis, Nick, Coach and Rochelle as well as the witch, tank and other enemies in this game mode. :D",1420521153,1705367803,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Importante: Não comprem nenhum jogo da Capcom!

A Capcom esta intalando em seus jogos o DRM para impedir Mods, o que esta atrapalhando o desempenho do jogo, junto com o DENUVO, que também atrapalha o desempenho.
O DRM é uma prática de instalação que não tem nenhum sentido e nenhuma razão, além de ser perigoso para os PC's e deveria ser considerado uma prática criminosa.
Mods nunca atrapalharam em nada (nenhum jogo), pelo contrario, eles sempre ajudaram os jogos a nunca serem esquecidos, por exemplo, Skyrim ta ai para mostrar; outro bom exemplo, olha o que CD Projekt RED faz com seus jogos (a comunidade de Moders de Cyberpunk 2077 e The Witcher 3 é incrivel). Mods não são pirataria!

Resident Evil 6 lets you choose out of four available campaigns, each accompanied by a different pair of protagonists. The story was meant to intertwine between these campaigns, but sadly the result is pretty confusing. Apparently story isn't that important in RE6 - you find yourself in a city overrun by zombies and that's basically all you need to know.
In contrast to its survival horror predecessors, Resident Evil 6 is a full-bloodied shooter. You have unlimited inventory space, the game is automatically saved on checkpoints, there is no map and puzzles are reduced to zero. Along with these ""improvements"", the game is now insanely linear - most of the times you can't even return to the room you visited just moments ago. If that wasn't bad enough, real-time events are sure to put the nail in the coffin. Every now and then, the gameplay is chopped by a real-time event in which you are forced to press a certain button combination or do something quickly (otherwise you'll die in most cases). This literally happens around every other corner and it's really irritating. The only good thing about RE6 is the presentation. Despite the game being rather dark, the interiors are full of details and look very realistic. Zombies have been animated excellently and voice acting in cut-scenes is top-notch. Thanks to that, the creepy atmosphere characteristic to Resident Evil games is still present in RE6.

If you're thinking about buying Resident Evil 6, just don't. You won't miss out on anything, story-related or otherwise. This game is just another horror shooter and there are lots of better horror shooters out there.

Former positive review:
You know what? No. This game isn't ass. This game isn't ass at all, and I want to give a sincere ""screw you"" to everyone who told me it was and stopped me from playing this game earlier. This is one of the best third-person shooters I've ever played bar none. 

RE6's gameplay is very in-depth, though almost to a fault. Those who go in blind will likely struggle a lot with it, but after learning the game and how its mechanics work, I can say with full certainty that it has some of the smoothest, most understated gameplay I've seen in a game like this. Quick shots allow you to quickly put an enemy in a daze if they're getting a little too close, dash attacks allow you to quickly take a small group out, sliding allows you to get through large groups relatively unscathed, and diving basically replaces the QTEs of RE4 and 5 with a mechanic that makes you feel much more in control of what your player character does. The game didn't tell you ""press X to dodge"", you had to input the dodge [i]yourself[/i]. It makes for a game where you feel much more in control of what your player character is doing. If the game had explained these mechanics better, a lot of the ""enemies don't react to my shots"" comments would go away. They don't react to your shots because you're [i]not supposed to just be shooting them blindly[/i]. It puts great focus on choosing what method of attacking is best for the given situation, be it shooting, quick shooting, meleeing, sliding, whatever it may be, and once you get used to it, it's extremely fun to play with. 

My main issues with the game lie with other problems. Some smaller, like I'm not a big fan of Leon's VA around this time. Others larger; for example, the Nintendo Switch version added support for gyro aiming, while the PC version is still missing this feature. PC definitely has a rockier situation when it comes to implementation of features not found in the basic Xbox 360 controller, but given Capcom also made Okami, which has proper Steam Input integration (including support for gyro input), they totally know how to implement stuff like that properly, and it's disappointing that they don't. Also the bosses just kinda suck. I won't defend those. They may LOOK cool, a giant flech-mecha t-rex is metal as hell, but they're rarely fun to fight.

TL;DR, Capcom should make this gameplay into a spinoff series for Resident Evil. It's too good to just be left in one game. The RE series in general may have moved past its action phase, which is probably for the best, but that doesn't mean this needs to be completely forgotten. I will die on this hill: RE6 is NOT a bad game, I wouldn't even call it mediocre. While it has its bad moments, all and all I found the game extremely enjoyable once I got used to its unorthodox gameplay mechanics.. I recommend trying this game. Definitely not as an introduction to the series GOD no, but for those who are already experienced with the rest of the RE franchise, it's a fun change of pace, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",1701299811,1705014722,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Capcom's ambitious attempt to blend various gameplay styles results in a game that's both exhilarating and occasionally bewildering.

From a technical standpoint, Resident Evil 6 is a visual spectacle. The environments are detailed, character models are lifelike, and the sound design is top-notch. The action sequences are intense, and the game's scope is undeniably grand. The variety of locales, ranging from urban landscapes to dark, eerie caverns, keeps the visuals engaging throughout.

However, the departure from the series' survival horror roots might leave purists feeling a bit disoriented. Resident Evil 6 leans heavily into the action genre, with fast-paced combat, spectacular set pieces, and a relentless onslaught of enemies. The inclusion of multiple playable characters (each with their own unique campaign) adds replay value but contributes to a somewhat disjointed narrative.

One standout feature is the cooperative gameplay, which allows you to team up with a friend for a more enjoyable experience. The synergy between characters can lead to some epic moments, and the shared sense of dread amplifies the horror elements.

The game's biggest flaw lies in its occasionally convoluted plot and an overabundance of quick-time events (QTEs). The narrative jumps between different characters and locations, making it challenging to fully immerse yourself in the unfolding story. The QTEs, while adding cinematic flair, can sometimes feel like a distraction from the core gameplay.

Despite its flaws, Resident Evil 6 delivers a satisfying action experience for those willing to embrace the departure from the series' roots. It's a game that's best enjoyed with a friend, where the chaos becomes part of the fun. If you can overlook the narrative hiccups and embrace the change in direction, Resident Evil 6 offers an intense and visually stunning journey through the darker corners of the Resident Evil universe.

I'm one of the yahoos that likes this game. RE 4 was okay if disappointing in how little connection anything had to the original titles. RE 5 was just painful for me and made worse by the early-woke demands that a game in [i]Africa[/i] was ""racist"" because the enemies were all African (with Capcom caving in and adding white enemies). But this one was enjoyable because it actually felt like a real [i]Resident Evil[/i] title with the dark environments and settings that hearkened back to the originals. Chris's story I didn't enjoy because, again, it didn't feel like a true RE entry. But the others certainly did, including Ada's.

My greatest complaint is how much grinding is involved in unlocking the Mastery skills even after you've unlocked the unlimited ammo skills. A lesser but still significant gripe is that some missions take place during the day; that's not scary. Finally, why is there another chainsaw enemy?

ada's route is meant to be singleplayer, but if you choose to play co-op, the 2P character is named ""Agent"". Agent cannot interact with anything (cannot open doors, pick up keys, solve puzzles, etc.) it makes the route very boring to play during co-op, as you just basically kill enemies instead of do anything of value. you also get teleported around if the player goes to different sections of the map

I've always remembered the survival horror of Resident Evil games where the scarce bullets and herbs had to be properly managed if you wanted to survive.

I don't believe you will find the suvival feel in this one, however this is not exactly a bad thing. If you see this as an action packed game with plenty of explosions, quick time events and some bullet sponges bosses then you will enjoy Resident Evil 6. If you forgive (and forget) about what made Resident Evil past games so tense and unique, you can even grab a friend and play the entire game in co-op sharing all the action paced chapters. However, even if you get past all these nostalgia things you can't avoid to feel of how the little things that made these games what they are today are gone. You will miss the calming music when entering a safe room, you will miss the risk-reward in getting a slot in your inventory filled with herbs instead of more ammo. If you're just in for the action, then the game will deliver plenty to shoot, plenty ammo to find and plenty ways of how you want to upgrade yourself. Looking to find more items and ammo? Upgrade that skill. Faster reload? You got it. You want your AI co-op partner to not help you when you need the most? Well, you can upgrade it that way too. 

In 20 hours you will be done with all the chapters the game has to offer. More if you choose to go to higher difficulties or looking for every possible crate to smash or collectible to shoot. Then, of course, there's more game in the mercenaries mode that may feel similar if you played Resident Evil 5. In the end, you will get your moneys' worth if you adjust your Resident Evil sensitivity to a minimum and pretend this is an action game. 

Turn off your brain just like the ones you're fighting and the game will be fun. Expect a true Resident Evil game and be left with sadness. Nevertheless there's good content if action is what you're looking for in the series.",1703958210,1703958210,True,6,0,0.616382002830505371,0,True,False,False

But back to the game, RE6 is a very fun action/""horror"" game but it is not really horror when you play as three super soldiers who are Chris, Jake and Leon (also Helena is basically Wesker she dodges every single bullet that comes her way in survivors) story may be weak here with Simmons being a big let down from the previous instalment's villain Albert Wesker (although you cannot really top Wesker I still have no idea why Capcom decided to kill him off so early in the story. Capcom please clone Wesker for RE9).

The only good thing about the story is that the character writing is still pretty good here and dare I say better than RE5 in terms of Chris' development with Piers. Capcom did fumble the bag with this entry and they certainly could have written the game better for example Jill should have been in it, but we could have gotten a lot worse than what we got. The combat is by far the most fluid in the series leaning into full action but is a blast when you play in the online modes. 

It really baffles that we went from RE5 to RE6 then to RE7, the quality in overall game design has just nose dived, I think the only way to fix the Resident Evil Franchise now is to have some games be pure horror and some be action, you cannot do both anymore.

I don’t like how it completely shreds its roots in the survival horror. The prior games were all fun to play. But starting with Resident Evil 5 the franchise was at a low point that relied on action over horror because it was during the “decline of survival horror”  that occurred towards the end of the Xbox 360/PS3 era.

This reliance on action, insane story events, and online co-op is not synonymous with Resident Evil. The strong environments, puzzles, and interesting characters associated with the prior games is not present in any way in Resident Evil 6, and the intertwining narratives it is trying to tell get lost in the terrible writing and story. We get a shell of its former self. One that tries to cater to broad appeal and one that tries to jump the shark in numerous ways, but it ends up being a game that doesn’t really excel in anything and one that doesn’t really appeal to anyone.

If its gameplay was good I could be a bit more positive but Resident Evil 6 is also a poorly designed game as well. I was thrown around during gameplay, the enemy AI is inconsistent, and your partner AI is awful (I often saw both my partner and enemies just chilling out together before shooting at each when I catch them). The cover based shooting is awful, there is an overreliance on unfair QTEs, and enemies soak up a lot of bullets. Every combat encounter was a joyless slog and combined with being thrown around, the overwhelming action set pieces, and QTEs it made me feel unwell whilst I was playing it. I really tried to finish it and I really tried to find the positives in it, but I can’t find anything good to say about it.

I don’t personally agree with the idea that this is a good game if you take away the fact that it’s a Resident Evil entry. That sounds like copium, because even if it wasn’t a Resident Evil game it would still be terrible and no-one would remember it. This game was a dead end and Capcom knew this as well. It would have killed the franchise if they didn’t reboot it with RE7. 

Resident Evil 6 is not Resident Evil in the slightest. It’s a game that chases trends and high levels of action, but also one that disregards its legacy and franchise history in the worst way possible. As such I do not recommend it, not even during a sale. Please play any of the other mainline games instead.",1701352921,1703801067,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fight zombies while enjoying various playground equipments after a long day preventing viral outbreaks. Action and absurdity make for an enjoyable, if cheesy romp through colorful locales from Tall Oaks to lush Chinese metropolis.

With four interconnected campaigns, you can laugh at the over-the-top antics with friends. Hop online for zany co-op and unleash combo attacks on the hordes.

While no horror masterpiece, RE6 is a popcorn flick that knows not to take itself too seriously. The plot jumps the shark more often than the zombies, but the tongue-in-cheek tone lets you enjoy the thrill ride.

[h1]AI | Co-Op[/h1]
The partner AI in this game is the most detrimental and distress you can control than Sheva from RE5. First of all, they don't intend to help the player and always no tension to save you. In fact, they just stand anywhere and watch you die, no matter what weapon they carry, they had no intention of using it, so screw them.

[h1]Controls | Camera System[/h1]
The controls are fine and modifiable, but It feels so sluggish and awkward to get the hang of it. Not to mention the camera makes me sick and dizzy 'cause I cannot change its FOV which really infuriates me a lot.

[h1]Enemies | Boss Fights[/h1]
My god Capcom, this feels like the previous sequels which I want to smack my controller to you. Aren't you getting tired of these bullet-spongey thing when you hit an zombie? Normally, they'll be dead in one or two shots, even you let to have a button appear to counterattack them. It's laughable. Especially boss fights which this is the most extreme painful for me to defeat them one-by-one.

[h1]QTE: Quick-Time Events[/h1]
Jesus Christ Capcom! This is another death nail at the coffin to your RE franchise. Do you think it's a good idea to apply every QTE for every actions, especially at cutscenes? You'd probably like to insult your fans like ""Hey let's add more hardcore challenges like QTE"" thing to mash up every single buttons we have, ultimately result of giving us injuries to our fingers.

[h1]Unbelievable Crisis[/h1]
Wow! Do I need to explain it out what is ""Resident Evil"" to you Capcom, it's a zombie survival-horror game, not an hardcore zombie action-pack. Words cannot express what did I just witnessed inside while playing of this Resident Evil thingy. We could call this ""Resident Duty"" instead.

Nonsensical story even by Resident Evil standard. Who the hell are half of these people? Don't tell me. I don't care.

 Abysmal inventory management. I feel it's pretty bad over Resident Evil games overall really, but this one takes the biscuit. It's this weird mess of basic scrolling, but it scrolls both ways and you can fast swap weapons, but when you have a lot of weapons it make it so you're back and forth. The game also decided to pack your inventory out by giving you way too many throwables, but makes them a chore to use. Every so often you're best off just stopping and clearing them from your inventory.

 Controls are garbage. It has this weird cover system that's a mix of something like Gears and Army of Two, but instead of copying one or the other and improving them, it takes the worst aspects from both of them. Dreadful.

Vehicle sections are uniformly terrible. They even know this themselves because when you die it gives you full health from the check point.

Game constantly has points where it wrestles the camera from you, or even anchors your view to something while you are in the action. The action doesn't pause. You will die because of this. It also has a weird habit of not letting you see what you need to see.

Some parts are impossible if you are playing as a specific character in some hosting situations. You can become soft locked.

When a player gets downed, the game takes control away from you while it stun grenades your eyes with a negative flash. You can receive damage during this time, just like when it does the cinematic pans or focuses your camera on whatever it's doing.

FOV feels like it's inside my eyeballs. Why does it have to be like this?

No auto reloads when a magazine is empty meaning that you're often caught with your pants down.

Terrible AI. Even in co-op you're stuck with AI doing stuff that will just get hung up and cause you fails.

 ""Puzzles"". Generally you're only going to get stuck because the geography of the level is horrendous in parts. In fact there's a part in every single campaign where you have to do three of whatever in an area and these parts suck so much.

Health system is garbage. Damaged received is inconsistent across the game. You can get stunlocked in certain areas of the game.

The item drop rates are skewed as to be a bit of a headache. This is tied to the bad inventory I think, because you can get 100's of pistol bullets and can't use them fast enough to negate more pistol bullets dropping, but not getting anything for other weapons or vice versa. My co-op partner regularly has run completely out of ammo, sometimes through her own gung-ho nature, but sometimes just because the game insist on giving you xp. I hate it.

XP is pointless. The perks are pointless. I feel like some of them might as well be a placebo effect they aid you so little. There's so many situational ones that provide so little value there's no point in them existing. So many of them require you to kill 1000 enemies or whatever with a specific weapon. No thanks. Only someone with brain damage would want to play this game more than once. 

It's never 100% clear what an area wants from you in some instances. Is it to survive? Is it to get the keys and escape? Do I need to do a puzzle to stop the waves? Is it a combination of all of the above?

In instances of where the players get split up and must do something to progress the parts, it's barely clear on what needs doing, especially when you are at a whim of the co-op partner. Like, do I just stand and defend? Do I have urgency to do the objective to get them out of trouble? Also these parts are utterly awful to play when its you waiting on them.

On said parts, holding to view what they are doing so you can see what they see only works part of the time. Why. Because they don't care about this awful game.

The characters are terrible. Leon and his sidekick are fine in isolation, but the rest of them are truly the worst of the worst. Jake in particular is to Resident Evil 6 as to what Poochie was to the Itchy and Scratchy show. They make the people on Love Island seem like fantastic filled out people with something to give the world.

The running away sections are a travesty. All of them. All of them are hampered with spinning the camera around and generally making them as unpleasant to experience as possible. 

Boss fights are atrocious. Boss fights in RE games have never been it strong suite, but they somehow managed to make them at best tedious and at worst agonising. Rubbish design throughout, such as bosses getting toppled out of reach where you cannot continue the attack that is needed to finish them.

Constant QTE's. All the time. I'm surprised I'm not asked to complete a QTE to post this review.

Ada campaign is for one player only, making it so that the co-op player is just there to be dragged along. Why make a game that's intended for 2 players and then do this? Baffling.

Instances of where you can be instakilled through no fault of your own by standing in the wrong position are too frequent. You could argue once is enough, but this game does it a lot. Ambulances, cars, trains, helicopters, floors collapsing, you name it, there's probably some nonsense there that will cause a kill screen before you even knew it was going to be there. Not even QTE failures, just BAM and you're looking at a you died screen.

This game was released in 2012, the same as Borderlands 2, Sleeping Dogs, Far Cry 3, Dishonoured, Journey, Hotline Miami, Dragons Dogma, Diablo 3, Fez, Mark of the Ninja, The Walking Dead, Super Hexagon, Okami HD, X-Com, Dear Esther, Binary Domain, Anomaly, Super Brothers, Sniper Elite 2, Plague Inc, LEGO Batman, Spec Ops: The Line, Spelunky, Orcs Must Die 2, CS:GO, FTL, Torchlight II, Euro Truck 2, Halo 4 and Thomas Was Alone. 

I played all of these way after release, with only some being played on or thereabouts on release, and without a doubt Resident Evil 6 is easily the worst game. By a country mile. There's so many issues it faces or just gets wrong.

I cannot think of any good things to say about Resident Evil 6. Maybe it made us laugh at how bad it is, but not in a kitschy way, just in a ""This is absolutely shockingly terrible"" way. It's a complete embarrassment from Capcom. It's absolute silage. There's not a single aspect from this game that I can go ""You know what, it did x or y well"". It's fumbled its way throughout the runtime at best and at worst it's being absolutely diabolical. Even games that I've hated there's usually some aspect that I can admire, but this? Not a snowballs chance in hell.

The funny thing is I went into this game thinking that there's literally no way it can be as bad as people say it is, there has to be some hyperbole there. No. Not at all. This game is a complete void of quality. If I was to make a list of the 10 worst games I've ever played, this would take a spot.

In sort, don't waste your time on it. No matter what the price. It's not worth your time and I cannot fathom why anyone would think this was a good game. It's an abhorrent waste of time and money. Consider this review a warning as to what awaits you should you even bother with this turd.",1703313611,1703313611,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

-Xbox 360 era netcode so be prepared to have your coop partner disconnect
-Dog shit controls, probably some of the worst controls of its generation

-2/3rds of the game is a shitty Xbox 360 generation third person shooter and 1/3rd is action horror
-The only good feature this game introduced, which is cross-over CO-OP with the other characters when they meet in story which makes the game 4 player CO-OP for a few boss fights in game. However since this game is dead you'll be stuck with braindead AI who happily stand in their own explosions.

Resident Evil 6 is Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Chris' campaign revolves around a veteran BOW specialist (Chris) that is isolated until he meets a new recruit (Piers) that he thinks can take up his role. The first few episodes of Madoka Magica revolve around a veteran magical girl (Mami) that is isolated until she meets a new potential magical girl (Madoka) that she thinks can take up her role. Both end with one being killed on a mission after a powerful enemy that they thought had been defeated returns and catches them off guard.

I liked some campaigns more than others. For example this is my favourite portrayal of Ada in any of the RE Games. Chris's Campaign is the blandest i'd say. I like the story, even tough it is convoluted and confusing at parts. 

I liked the melee and movement that feels pretty dynamic and is pretty context sensitive which is cool.

I liked the idea of the 4 intertwined campaigns, but this was a bit diminished as it was used to be able to recycle assets. This did not hurt as much tough, because the set pieces were interesting like China and Eastern Europe.

The effects and models still look nice to date, but many textures are pretty low res (sadly). The color filters used over the whole thing suck ass, but this was pretty common at that time i think.

The Game is fun and all, but still keep in mind, that this is like the fast and furious of the RE Series and it tops even RE5 in the overblown action department.


EARLIER REVIEW:
Halfway in my second campaign (out of 4) I have to say:
IT IS HELLA AWESOME!!

I was very hesitant to buy this game because of it's controversity in the RE franchise and I can see why, BUT this game in itself is very fun and delivers on everything it promises.
It is the most stupidest, most unhinged game I've ever played.
I love the addition of proper melee combat and the ridiculous dialogue and cutscenes.

I recommend.

The game features a vast ensemble of characters, each with their own campaigns, intertwining in a sprawling narrative that attempts to cater to diverse player preferences.

The characters showcase a range of gameplay styles and perspectives, offering variety but at the cost of a cohesive narrative. While series veterans like Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield return, their arcs can feel disjointed, and the sheer number of protagonists may dilute the emotional impact. Newcomers like Jake Muller and Helena Harper bring fresh faces but may struggle to resonate with players as strongly as iconic characters from previous entries.

The game's focus on action and set pieces is evident, providing a fast-paced, cinematic experience. However, this shift in tone sacrifices the atmospheric tension and survival horror elements that defined earlier Resident Evil titles. The abundance of quick-time events and explosive action may polarize fans looking for a more restrained and suspenseful horror experience.

On a positive note, Resident Evil 6 does offer a robust cooperative experience, allowing players to team up and face the mutated horrors together. The varied gameplay styles across campaigns provide diversity but may also lead to inconsistency in pacing and quality.

In summary, Resident Evil 6 introduces an ambitious but divisive approach, emphasizing action over horror. The multitude of characters and campaigns adds variety but may sacrifice the tight storytelling and atmosphere the series is known for. While the cooperative gameplay and set pieces are engaging, the departure from the franchise's roots may leave fans yearning for the classic Resident Evil experience.

The story is split between 4 campaigns with 5 overlapping missions each. Every campaign has something different to offer:

The Reisdent Leon 2 campaign probably feels the most like Resident Evil games before 4. Especially the first mission feels very Resident Evil 2.

Chris of Duty: Zombie Warfare feels like playing a third person Call of Duty game for the most part.

The Jake Bandicoot campaign has a lot of plattforming straight out of Crash Bandicoot.

And the Ada Gear Solid campaign has a lot of stealthy bits and a grappling hook, but essentially it only fills in the missing gaps in the other storylines.

Throughout the campaign you also get to ride a wild variation of vehicles, from motorbikes, to humvees, to helicopters and even a fucking jet.

As you can see, the game offers a lot of different mechanics and action filled set pieces throughout the world. That makes it a crazy ride to the end.

Where it dropped the ball is removing that addictive weapon upgrading system. You can still unlock a lot of cool upgrades and infinite ammo, but it just felt way better to upgrade your guns slowly throughout your playthrough in the previous two games.

he had already played for over 28 hours. This was terrible for me,
as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son,
as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok.
So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him.
I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.
I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.
This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.
This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything,
and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
Thank You Capcom. ♥

While its ambitious scope, high production values, and cooperative gameplay appeal to some, its disjointed narrative, inconsistent pacing, over-reliance on QTEs, and departure from survival horror roots have disappointed others.

For fans seeking a more action-oriented experience with cooperative multiplayer, Resident Evil 6 may provide some enjoyment. However, those who prefer the traditional survival horror elements of the franchise may find this installment to be less satisfying.

I can appreciate the game's ambitious scope and high production values, but I also acknowledge the criticisms regarding its narrative, pacing, and reliance on QTEs.

terrible use of the camera. boss fights are mostly bullshit, poorly explained gimmicks that have long unskippable portions that need to be replayed over and over. lots of RNG reliance for ammo drops, as you may just get useless skill points over and over. the movement is unbelievably bad as sprinting forces the camera to center, which makes it very difficult to manuever around an area. 

thematically as over the top as RE has been. the story is silly fun but not like RE has ever been anything other than corny and campy. voice acting is actually kinda good. the scenery is cool and the characters do have some interesting and artisitc designs to them. soundtrack is not really worth mentioning.

[list]
[*][b]Mixed Bag of Criticisms: Look, I know this game divided the RE community, but hear me out. It's like that pizza with unconventional toppings - not everyone's taste, but it's got its unique charm.[/b]

[*][b]Action-Packed Thrill Ride: Forget the naysayers; RE 6 is a rollercoaster of action. It's like a heart-pounding blockbuster movie, with explosions, zombies, and adrenaline-pumping moments around every corner.[/b]

[*][b]Unique Storytelling: People say it's a jumbled mess, but I say it's a narrative marvel. The way the story unfolds from multiple character perspectives is like fitting together a twisted puzzle. Flawless? Maybe not, but definitely intriguing.[/b]

[*][b]Character-Centric Awesomeness: The different character storylines offer variety. It's like playing different genres within one game. From Leon's horror-style segments to Chris's all-out action, it keeps things fresh.[/b]

[*][b]Flawed Beauty: Some say it's flawed, but hey, that's part of its beauty. It's like those charmingly imperfect movies you love for their quirks.[/b]

[*][b]Multiplayer Madness: The co-op is where the fun skyrockets. Team up with a buddy, and the chaos becomes twice as enjoyable. It's like surviving a zombie apocalypse with your partner-in-crime.[/b]

[*][b]Hardcore RE Fan's Delight: I don't care what people say about this game. I LOVE IT! For hardcore RE fans, diving into RE 6 is like revisiting familiar places and characters while exploring new horizons.[/b]

[b]In conclusion, Resident Evil 6 might not be everyone's cup of T-Virus, but for those who crave action-packed thrills and enjoy the different storytelling approaches, it's a hidden gem. So, if you're a hardcore RE fan who doesn't mind a little controversy, give this one a shot. It might surprise you![/b]",1572627640,1700573944,True,6,0,0.543665409088134766,0,True,True,False

As an RE game, aside from some recurring characters and one specific enemy, it feels nothing like RE. All the horror or creepiness from the previous games (aside from RE5) is gone, the survival horror gameplay is gone. Now it's just a mindless shooting gallery with flashing lights and explosions every 5 seconds. And even the recurring characters are horrible. Leon is a complete fucking idiot. He lets a woman who has killed and infected thousands, if not millions go, just because he thought that she was Ada (not even gonna get into how much I hate Ada and the Leon and Ada love story in general). Chris is boring, and so is Sherry.

Edit: Forgot to mention Helena, Piers and Jake. Goes to show how forgettable all three of them are.

As an action game, it's a shitty clunky mess. Aiming feels like shit. Weapons feel like they shoot pebbles because their sound design is horrible and enemies are bullet sponges. Movement feels like shit. The inventory system is shit. The weapon upgrade systems from the previous two mainline games are gone, being replaced by skills that you can buy with skill points, but the skill point requirements to buy and upgrade them are so fucking insane that by the end of the 20+ hour game, you'll only have 3 skills at level 2 out of the 3 levels, and they're not even that useful in the first place, aside from the infinite ammo skills you can get after beating the game once, and what's worse is that if you plan on 100%ing the game, one of the achievement require you to buy and upgrade every single skill in the game. And don't get me started on the countless number of useless QTEs that are shoved in your faces every time the developers get a chance. Enemies are annoying. Bosses are even worse. I kid you not, there are two different villains in this game that get a fake out death at least five separate fucking times and each time they come back you have to have a long, boring, drawn out, worthless boss fight with them. One out of those two villains turn into a FUCKING DINOSAUR WITH A MACHINE GUN ON IT'S BACK.

In total, the game is 21 hours...

21 hours of pure brain numbing pain.

Playing with a friend didn't even save the experience. In fact, the friend I was playing with stopped mid way through because of how bad it was, and I had to push on through the rest of it by myself (on console).

If you haven't played this game yet, save yourself and don't waste ANY money on this game. It is not worth the money or time.

One of, if not, the worst game I've ever played in my life.

It's a tad janky on PC with Mouse/Keyboard, but to be fair it's still miles better than the RE5 dumpster fire of a PC port (the original RE5, not a remake that is so desperately needed).

RE6 in 2023 still holds up visually and the story is top notch, but the gameplay veers too far away from what I expect in a resident evil game. Too many quick-time events and fail-able action scenes with janky camera angles and horrible ""space bar does everything"" controls. I lost count of the number of times I died trying to sprint but instead jumped backwards over an obstacle into danger. 90% of the challenge in this game is overcoming the bad controls.

En esta sexta entrega tendremos personajes jugables  , que no pensamos que estarían y nuevos personajes protagonistas : Leon S. Kennedy,  Chris Redfield , Jake Muller, Ada Wong, Helena Harper, Piers Nivans y Sherry Birkin, estos son los protagonistas principales.

La jugabilidad de este residente vil es increíble la mejor de todas ósea no existe manera lo digo porque he jugado los anteriores residente vil y me sorprende el gran cambio y si era el que esperaba no como los anteriores que carecías de movilidad y eso te limitaba mucho a la hora de escapar.

Gráficamente se ve espectacular sé que muchos dirán que no hay mucho  cambio en las texturas pero Capcom hizo un gran
trabajo con este juego pero he detectado alguna que otra textura de baja resolución en ciertos mapas pero casi ni
se notan  pero su estilo visual me encanta es muy agradable a la vista se siente genial.

But don't get me wrong here, despite all of these issues, I really had fun playing with my friend.

Both storyline and characters are very generic and you won't feel immersed or interested throughout the game. There'll be a lot of sections where you'll just want to rush through and be done with it due to the amount of retarded enemies (e.g., flying bugs with assault rifles, dilophosaurus, and so on.) But on the other hand, the combo system is very sick: watching Chris carrying enemies around as if they were made of cardboard and throwing them onto the floor was downright awesome. 

Me and my friend reached a consensus that this is not a Resident Evil game, so If you're coming into this game expecting this or anything else, don't.

Now, I'd recommend this game if you meet this criteria:
-You ran out of games (heavily recommend to play with a friend, otherwise you'll find yourself losing the will to continue)

[b] (Parody for Resident Evil 6)

🧟‍♂️ Memories shattered, the plotlines all tattered  
I've even forgotten my aim  
I don't know the season or the why for the treason  
I'm standing here, calling for brains  

🌌 A zombie-filled space (space)  
Without a clear case (case)  
It's only the groans that I hear  
It's me that I fear as I blast through the smear  
The only thing I know is clear  

💉 There will be blood (blood) spread (spread)  
The undead all nod their heads  
The only one (one) left (left)  
Will stumble with a vacant stare  
Because the zombies don't give back the life they take  
Oh no, there will be blood (blood) spread (spread)  
It's the only thing I've ever known  

🧠 Losing my sanity  
Wondering, ""Have I gone undead?""  
To find the cure in front of me, I must blast through this monster bed  
Looking downward from this broken world, and never realizing why I fight 🎮 [/b]

INT. MEGAS GARAGE - NIGHT

Coop, Jamie, and Kiva are gathered around the gaming console, each with a controller in hand. On the screen, Resident Evil 6 is ready to roll.

COOP
(leaning back in his gaming chair, a big grin on his face)
Alright, team! Get ready to dive into the zombie madness of Resident Evil 6! 🎮🧟

JAMIE
(smiling)
I hope there's a level where we can ride giant robots. That'd be epic.

KIVA
(raising an eyebrow)
Giant robots? Seriously, Jamie? You're taking your MEGAS obsession too far.

COOP
(focused on the game)
Let's not get sidetracked, folks. Leon, Chris, and the gang need our help!

JAMIE
(teasing)
Of course, Coop gets to be the hero.

KIVA
(rolling her eyes)
Just start the game already.

They dive into the zombie-infested streets of Tall Oaks.

INT. DIGITAL CITY - NIGHT (GAME SCREEN)

LEON (Coop's character) encounters SHERRY, HELENA, and ADA, who join the team.

COOP
(looking at the screen, a sly grin)
Hey, ladies! Looks like Leon's got some backup. 💪👩‍🚀

JAMIE
(nudging Coop)
Look at you, Mr. Smooth Operator.

COOP
(grinning)
Just trying to survive the apocalypse with style, my friends.

As they progress through the game, Coop can't help but express his admiration for the female characters.

COOP
(while playing, with a playful tone)
You know, Sherry's pretty cool. Smart, resourceful, the whole package. 👌

JAMIE
(teasingly)
Are you seriously simping for a video game character?

COOP
(defensive)
Hey, it's just appreciation for well-developed characters! 😅

KIVA
(rolling her eyes)
Sure, Coop. Whatever you say.

Coop, navigating the game, encounters a particularly tough section with Helena and Ada.

COOP
(whistling)
Helena, you're handling those zombies like a pro! 👏

JAMIE
(smirking)
Looks like Coop's got a crush on a virtual character.

COOP
(grinning)
Can you blame me? Helena's a badass!

As they traverse the digital nightmare, they stumble upon another challenging boss battle.

COOP
(looking at the screen)
And Ada, you've got some serious skills. The way you dodge those attacks is mesmerizing. 💃

KIVA
(teasing)
Coop, are you flirting with a video game character now?

COOP
(jokingly)
Hey, if I can't impress real ladies, at least I can charm the pixels.

JAMIE
(smirking)
Speaking of real ladies, Kiva, you're just as kickass as these game characters. Maybe even more.

KIVA
(raising an eyebrow)
Oh, really?

JAMIE
(nodding)
Yeah, you'd give these Resident Evil ladies a run for their money.

COOP
(grinning)
Absolutely. Kiva, you're our real-life action hero.

They continue playing, laughter and banter filling the MEGAS garage, turning the intense zombie apocalypse into a hilarious adventure for the MEGAS XLR crew.

it's the best because
* enemy stagger animations are present
* enemy hit verifications are present
* it's clear if you hit an enemy
* the camera's control (on controller as far as i know) is the best out of the 4/5/6 RE game play DNA game design strain 
* gun variation is uniquely split between characters
* there's multiple characters with character specific animations
* characterization is a 3/5 (dunkey rating system used by me) 
* the story has ONE powerful moment compared to the other REs which either pull punchers or don't go full corny
* enemy variation has 3 types which break off into sub types 
* the control of the character is better than RE2-make as when you do a turn around in that game the character has to do the Red Dead Redemption 2 thing where their model can't shift exact degrees as stated by the camera so they just have to walk slightly left or right. WHILE RE6's control allows for proper degree movement
* story objectives 4/5 times are fun to complete. 

peak leon = the gun shop
peak chris = the Haos fight + the big lad and artillery co-op
peak jake = the Unstanak fight + the big lad and artillery co-op
peak ada = the puzzle at the beginning (Ada's campaign sucks) 

i played this as a kid so my opinioni is skewed
yet this has possibility to be a C teir Esports game as dictated by the complexity of it's mechanics

if i were god. i'd make them make a game like this but make it so the game wasn't a on the story rails type game RE4 came from. It would be intro mission into selection of levels menu with VERY SLIM loading time which effected the story. i'd keep the  aspect of the sacrifice of environment detail for character detail and just rebuild the character specific guns and animations.

Highly frustrated after playing the initial campaign, it grew on me as the whole plot line unfolded. There are some great cinematic events in here but the game is marred by some terrible game design decisions. These include unpredictable quick time events which you learn about through instant death, areas of limited ammo but unlimited enemies and THAT boat jumping scene (You'll know when you get there!). There 4 sizeable campaigns here which is impressive enough, each around 80% as long as RE5 in their own right, took me around 40 hours to complete. Frustratingly, Some of the best bits of the game (Leon's early jump scares and Ada's 1st stealth mission) are short lived in favour of lots of action shooter.

Metacritic scores RE6 in the 60% range.. I think that's harsh, it more like an 80% game but with a handful of really frustrating moments, usually caused by unavoidable death and your inability to predict the future.
The first 10 hours frustrated, but after all campaigns where complete, I'd had an enjoyable experience of sorts. There a lot to like, if you can turn to a blind eye to the frustrations.

Additionally: I frequently suffered a strange stuttering / freezing bug during both gameplay and cut scenes. Some reference to this online online, but no solution found - PC more than capable of handling the game [2013 Game Played in 2023] - Disabling Steam Overlay seemed to really reduce this.",1698427237,1698629209,True,2,0,0.518953680992126465,0,True,False,False

Controls for this game are extremely wacky, some of the weirdest I have played, but has a unique feel to them I suppose.

There are a couple mild and game crashing bugs though which is likely due to newer hardware, windows version, and gfx drivers over time and I wouldn't expect this to be fixed due to its age.

The game has bugs with alt-tabbing and wants to blackscreen the pc (can't even view task manager, that kind of bug) leaving me with no option but to manually shut down with the physical button.

I'm not suggesting that a game should be all about fear and lack action, but where is the thrill in pressing a single keyboard or controller button repeatedly? Even the vehicle sections and snowmobile sequences are subpar compared to Call of Duty. The game's camera angle, in certain scenes, leads to multiple frustrating deaths, leaving you exasperated. What's the point of this frustration? Has the game director not even played the game once to see the problems with the camera angle that suddenly becomes a hindrance or the abrupt button mashing during gameplay?

However, I can't say the game is bad; it's not a great game either. Its strong point is the story, but it gets lost beneath helicopter rides, tank battles, and skiing down mountains. The DLC section, meant for online play, is virtually deserted, and I haven't come across a single player there, at least not in my experience. But within the game itself, you can still find people to team up with for co-op play.

Resident Evil 6 is a mediocre game with fantastic gameplay mechanics.

The combat is a lot of fun with mostly smooth character movements and controls and a lot of great animation work.

Sadly, everything else about the game sucks. Enemies are all designed with the 'swarm the player in as a many numbers as possible mentality', the game is super linear with next to zero exploration, all of the scripted sections are annoying QTE inputs for stuff like starting a bloody car or have fixed cameras which makes navigating them a nightmare, there's a lot of gimmicky vehicle sections with floaty controls, the game goes on for too long (after two campaigns, I wanted it to be over), boss fights don't take advantage of the combat mechanics and instead are just bullet sponges, and as a whole it's a game that you have to fight with to get any enjoyment out of.

Mercenaries is a lot of fun since it's just the combat mechanics, but even then there's still problems such as the sprint and action button being tied to the same key which causes your character to interact with objects you didn't intend.

Overall, I can only recommend this game if either:

A. You want a CO-OP game to play with a friend.

B. You want to play the mercenaries.

C. You hate yourself.

I don't think the game is complete garbage as some people say. A lot of work clearly went into making the game and as I said, you can still get fun out of it. But I also disagree with the mentality that the game is 'underappreciated' or 'hated too much'. Every problem that critics had with this game are all correct.",1693235591,1698245994,False,0,1,0.490196079015731812,0,True,False,False

Much like RE4 and 5, 6 is an action game and not a survival horror like the older entries. Going in after enjoying 4 and 5, I was expecting a game that was ""so bad it's good"" and that's pretty much what I got. What I didn't get was a game so bad that it deserves the title of ""a game that killed the franchise."" Because honestly? 6 is the natural evolution of everything 4 and 5 had to offer, and I am baffled that people like those two games (or at least 4), but hate this one. And after the success of 4 and 5, I really don't know what people were expecting, and I say this as someone who very much prefers the classic RE titles. 

Now that I've played it, I can confirm people overreacted to this game an absurd amount. ""It isn't survival horror!"" Neither was 4 or 5, and 4 is practically worshiped as the best RE game to the point where its influence can be found in every subsequent RE title. ""It has too much action and it can't be taken seriously."" Again, such was the case with 4 and 5 - Leon roundhouse kicked BOWs in 4 and was a one man army, while in 5 Chris punches a boulder. Even in the older entries, RE always had an element of ridiculousness and being over the top, and this game is no exception. So in all honesty, I find the vast majority of complaints people have with this game to be, frankly, invalid.

That said, it does have some issues, but one glaring one in particular: Holding space bar is your run key and your ""action"" key most of the time. What this means is that you'll be running, and without meaning to, you'll vault over an object, which gets pretty annoying pretty quickly. This problem is further highlighted during the game's chase sequences, where you'll be running away from something, only to be slowed down because your character vaulted over an object unintentionally, and because of that, you fail the sequence and die. Changing the key won't make a difference either as you'll still encounter the same problems. Additionally, there's also a ""skill system"" with skill points, which is just...not needed and feels really out of place. Oh, and there's also QTEs and a bad cover system, but that's just peak early 2010s gaming, and for the QTEs in particular, again: 4 and 5 did that too.

Aside from all that though, this game is a fun time, especially if you bring a friend to sit back and laugh at it with. I personally find it fun and I'd say it has the smoother gameplay compared to the original RE4 and 5, although it still is a bit jank, mostly for what I just mentioned. I think at the very least, this game deserves praise for making knife/close quarters combat feel good, as you can now execute special moves after knifing enemies or just punch them a lot and doing the same. Close combat/the knife feels like an alternative to your guns, instead of something to fall back on as a last resort. It's definitely worth it on sale, even if you're just playing solo like I was. If you like 4 and 5, this game is more of the same, albeit turned up to 11.",1698176510,1698176768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mainly intend to cover the individual campaigns with minimal spoilers but to give my general feelings for all the campaigns.
This is the most irritating mainline RE game, not necessarily the worst.
-Enemies feel cheap with how they can lunge at you, take literal chunks off your health no matter how big or small they might be, some can just straight up instakill you, some have guns which just feels boring, and with how some animations play out it just makes certain hits feel unearned.
-Skills are a terrible addition, as not only does it remove the merchant/upgrade system from 4 & 5, but it straight up affects loot drops, sometimes you'll be struggling on ammo just because the game keeps giving you absolutely worthless +50 skill point drops at random. And without buff skills, lowly enemies can take several headshots and just never die.
The fact that alot of enemies have second forms means that you're using far more ammo than any other RE game, and potentially you get no drops to compensate this despite the continued action gameplay.
-Bosses are kinda bad, I can never tell if I'm actually hurting them, or if I should save my bullets and wait for the scripted moments to happen so I can get to the part of the fight where I can ACTUALLY hurt the boss.
-Cutscenes are here with a vengeance, so much of this game feels scripted and sometimes that scripting messes with ya.
From having a large amount of hallways where you walk slowly with exposition that doesn't matter, to exiting a cutscene only to get hit, or being shot because the camera REALLY wants to focus on a setpiece, the cinematics get in the way of gameplay.
-Item management feels bad compared to basically any other RE game, since they have both removed item boxes and the option to sell excess ammo, with weapons being free to pick up, you'll naturally want to carry some ammo for all of them, but with no way to deposit excess ammo, chances are you'll end up leaving a lot of ammo laying around, never to be used.
-The controls are never really properly explained, for example, the game never teaches you how to crouch without a prompt. I think there's tips in the loading screens but if you have an SSD you will most likely be unable to get consistent information out of these, either way there's parts of this control scheme which are absolutely unconventional even if they work well under certain circumstances.

I do have other issues such as an excess of QTEs or absurd gun recoil, but overall these are my main issues.
To me, these ruin what could've been an otherwise cool action game, as I just kept coming into contact with irritations instead of a fun experience similar to RE4.

[h1]I will say that there are some major improvements from RE5.[/h1]
The environments are way more varied and despite some low resolution textures and high usage of bloom, look pretty great!
The AI is no longer a major hindrance, as they no longer need to share their ammo with you, and have unlimited health. They are debatably less deadly compared to what they're capable of in RE5, but they no longer require babysitting which is quite nice.
The multiplayer too has a bit more merit (outside of one of the campaigns) as players are split up more often with their specific paths. For the most part you stick together, but having actual specific content designed for ya is pretty alright, even if other times it can end up pretty dull.

The enemy variety if we look at everything the game has to offer, is pretty nice.
The enemies themselves are mostly separated to be used depending on the campaign, but it could be worse.

And lastly the return of four campaigns is something I appreciate, especially since they're pretty different from one another compared to the multiple campaigns in RE1/RE2.

Speaking of which, time to cover the campaign starting off with
[h1]Leon's Campaign[/h1]
This is the one that has the most effort, and definitely wants to feel as close as possible to a RE4.
It has the return of classic zombies and some of the games slower moments, aswell as the most broad story, but the problems I have are with how cinematic it is, and how little story there is.
Most of its story just feels like it's setup to make you want to play the other campaigns, it's OK but not great.

[h1]Chris's Campaign[/h1]
This campaign feels more like a standard shooter campaign, and narratively I think it's the least necessary.
Minor spoilers but mainly just a premise, [spoiler]Chris suffering from PTSD feels odd after how much he's lost from his journey starting off in RE1, all the way up to his closing statement in RE5.[/spoiler]
The enemies in this also just felt super dull as you're mostly just dealing with guys with guns, and usually they're pretty tanky, this was the campaign where I had the most issues with ammo depletion.
Honestly I think the game would be better without this campaign but taste is subjective, for co-op I can see this being fun in the same way RE5 was.

[h1]Jake's Campaign[/h1]
The gimmicky campaign, featuring more QTEs and vehicle segments than any other, and surprisingly I actually had fun with this one.
Featuring the return of Sherry from RE2, better melee and a good mix of high action spectacle, standard gunplay and some real absurd moments, excluding some cheap deaths this was pretty painless.
If the rest of the game was like this I'd say it would be more fun due to giving the player more control to go with the absurdity.

Finally, we have 
[h1]Ada's Campaign[/h1]
This was my least favourite one sadly, as it reveals NOTHING important about the main plot, and the gameplay was the lamest.
No partner to go with you in single player (though one will be introduced if you play co-op), and gameplay that just involves you waiting on protagonists from the other campaigns to do things for you to progress the plot, along with the shortest overall runtime out of all these campaigns.
This campaign just feels like wasted potential, nowhere near as good as Seperate Ways.

[h1]This could've been the fix to all my problems with RE5, but it's one step forward and who knows how many more back[/h1]
It's not the worst of the RE games, that goes to RE 0, but it should've been so much better than this.
I would only recommend this if you're desperate for a co-op game and liked RE5 already, or if you're too invested in the series and need to see everything it has to offer.",1697610999,1697613974,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Resident Evil 6[/b] serves as a sequel to Resident Evil 5, arriving three years later. Much like its predecessor, [b]Resident Evil 6[/b] falls victim to some significant flaws in its gameplay. During development, Capcom had promised fans a return to the franchise's survival horror roots, and while this rings true for the one campaign, the other campaigns lean more towards action.

In [b]Resident Evil 6[/b], several major characters are both present and playable, thanks to the game's unique approach. Instead of featuring just one or two campaigns, [b]Resident Evil 6[/b] introduces four different campaigns that follow seven different characters. This concept adds an interesting layer to the game, with each campaign having its own storyline and goals while being interconnected at various points. The first campaign features Leon, a long-time fan favorite, and Helena as they attempt to unravel the murder of the US President. Chris and Piers' campaign focuses on capturing the mastermind behind a bioterrorist attack, while Sherry and Jake's campaign revolves around escorting Jake to create a cure for a new virus. The last campaign, Ada's, is best played last, as it ties up any remaining mysteries from the other campaigns. Overall, the story is enjoyable and fun to experience.

In terms of combat, [b]Resident Evil 6[/b] feels more fluid and dynamic, allowing players to engage in gun-fu and perform various moves such as rolling and aiming while lying on the ground. These moves, while making the game more action-oriented, come in handy when dealing with enemies that get too close or if you want to conserve ammo. The game offers a wide variety of weapons, and every type is available to the player, allowing for experimentation and personalization of gameplay.

Similar to Resident Evil 5, [b]Resident Evil 6[/b] can be played cooperatively with a friend. The co-op system has been improved in this installment, allowing players to drop in and out at any time, with no host system. If one player disconnects, the other can continue, with the partner being controlled by the CPU. This improvement makes cooperative play more engaging.

However, [b]Resident Evil 6[/b] is often considered the weakest entry in the mainline series, and there are valid reasons for this assessment. The game ditches the merchant system found in previous titles in favor of a skill and XP system. Players can earn XP from defeating zombies or destroying boxes and then spend it to purchase skills for their characters. This new system feels out of place in [b]Resident Evil 6[/b], and the skills are quite expensive, with limited slots (only three in total). This imbalance in XP gain and skill cost can make the system feel unrewarding.

The horror aspect of the game is virtually abandoned after Leon's campaign concludes. While Leon faces traditional zombies in eerie environments, other campaigns predominantly involve combat with human soldiers who have a mutating virus in their bodies. These enemies can use firearms and display basic intelligence, shifting the game's focus further towards action. When playing solo, your partner feels nearly invulnerable, as they have infinite ammo and health, diminishing the horror aspect even more. Additionally, you can't interact with your partner's inventory, and they won't pick up items on their own since they don't need them. While this setup can be beneficial in some ways, such as not worrying about ammo conservation or dying, it also has its drawbacks.

Despite its shortcomings, I don't consider [b]Resident Evil 6[/b] the worst game in the series. I believe it offers a degree of enjoyment and fun that surpasses Resident Evil 5. The co-op play, in particular, can be chaotic and immersive, as you and your partner may take different actions and routes.

The game departed significantly from the series' traditional roots, opting for a more action-oriented approach. Here's a review of Resident Evil 6, taking into account the game's strengths and weaknesses.

Resident Evil 6 offered a diverse gameplay experience, with four intertwining campaigns featuring different characters. These characters included series veterans like Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield, each with their own unique style and gameplay mechanics. The game's controls and movement were more fluid than previous entries, allowing for better combat mechanics. However, the increased focus on action and fast-paced combat detracted from the series' survival horror origins, leaving fans divided on the direction Capcom took.

The story in Resident Evil 6 was complex and featured a convoluted plot with multiple perspectives and intertwining storylines. It expanded upon the series' lore but often felt disjointed, and some players found it difficult to follow. The game also struggled to maintain the tense atmosphere and horror elements that the earlier entries in the series were known for.

Resident Evil 6 featured impressive visuals and detailed environments. The character models were well-rendered, and the game's locations were varied and visually appealing. However, some criticized the overuse of quick-time events (QTEs) and cutscenes that took control away from the player, which disrupted the overall flow of the game.

While the sound design and voice acting were solid, Resident Evil 6 failed to capture the atmospheric and terrifying ambiance that the series was originally known for. The constant action sequences and explosions left little room for the quiet, suspenseful moments that made the earlier games in the series so iconic.

The game's multiple campaigns, each offering a distinct gameplay experience, added to its replayability. Co-op play was also a significant feature, allowing players to team up with a friend. This made the game more enjoyable when played in co-op mode, as it could be less frustrating and more enjoyable to tackle the challenging encounters with a partner.

Resident Evil 6 was a departure from the series' roots, with a greater emphasis on action and a more cinematic experience. It's a game that polarized the Resident Evil fan base; some appreciated the change, while others felt it strayed too far from what made the series great. If you're looking for a more action-oriented game with moments of horror and don't mind a convoluted story, Resident Evil 6 may provide an enjoyable experience. However, if you're a die-hard fan of the earlier, more survival horror-focused entries, you might find this one a bit of a departure from what you love about the franchise.",1697366350,1697366350,False,3,0,0.520233452320098877,0,True,False,False

As a longtime Resident Evil fan, there's been one game in the series I've avoided for almost a decade: Resident Evil 6. Back when it was released, it garnered mixed reviews from both fans and critics. It was a dramatic shift from the series' survival horror roots, with multiple campaigns that often felt uneven, a co-op system that made solo play feel like an afterthought, and the abandonment of classic features like a merchant or inventory management. But this Halloween, I decided to finally give it a shot.

From the start, Resident Evil 6 doesn't inspire much confidence. Its sparse main menu feels like something out of an early 2000s multiplayer game. You soon realize that the only way to pause the game is by playing in offline mode, making you feel quite alone, despite having an AI partner always ready to revive you.

The fear factor takes a hit when the game encourages you to holster your gun and engage in frenetic Street Fighter-style melee attacks on the undead. Melee becomes your go-to strategy against hordes of enemies, further diminishing the horror elements.

Resident Evil 6 abandons the survival horror genre. It dabbles in creepiness during Leon's campaign, but the scares are largely absent. The new J'avo enemies, for instance, feel more like regular gun-toting foes with a zombie twist. While the game features some horror-themed missions in catacombs, sewers, and labs, it's primarily an action shooter with grotesque monsters. This departure from the series' roots is likely why Capcom veered back to pure horror with Resident Evil 7.

Looking back now, after Resident Evil's return to survival horror with Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village, it's easier to appreciate Resident Evil 6 for what it truly is: a highly enjoyable action game. The enemy designs are inventive and challenging, and the game sometimes borrows a page from Dead Space by making headshots counterproductive, occasionally causing standard enemies to transform into far more powerful creatures. While it might lack survival horror, it retains Resident Evil's trademark outlandish puzzles.

The game's diverse encounters and settings are perhaps the most exciting in the series, ranging from rooftop chases through apocalyptic cityscapes to Ada Wong's dramatic escape from a sinking submarine. There's even a thrilling sequence where you sink an aircraft carrier using a fighter jet. While the four campaigns occasionally intersect, they mainly tell separate stories in vastly different locations. Admittedly, the narrative is a bit of a mess. I'm not invested in whatchamacallit's sister who's a plant or Ada Wong's murderous clone. It's unfocused, and the broader story strokes are forgettable, but there are enough memorable set pieces and wacky moments to keep you entertained.

So, is it worth revisiting Resident Evil 6 in the wake of Resident Evil Village or checking it out if you've never played it? Absolutely, but think of it as an action game. While it might not live up to its predecessors in terms of its original format, it's a fun Resident Evil game in its own right. The cinematic presentation, filled with action movie clichés, over-the-top dialogue, and tense Quick Time Events, creates an engaging experience during the campaign. However, it might not leave a lasting impression after the credits roll.

Resident Evil 6 is not a perfect game, but it's an enjoyable one, especially if you're looking for action-packed zombie mayhem. It may have divided fans, but it's worth giving it a try for its own unique take on the series.",1697189796,1697189796,True,39,2,0.787217617034912109,0,True,True,False

EDIT: Meh. Finally finished it years later as I wanted a mindless action game to occupy my mind in-between hard mental work sessions. Since I have played the entire series before, it was somehow interesting to play these characters again, but gameplay-wise the game is quite a mess. 

My main problems with this game are the incoherent game design, the repetitive gameplay and the fixed (and very bad) camera during a lot of action sequences. 

The game has a complete lack of coherence when it comes to establishing and following its own gameplay rules. For example, a certain button is pressed for a certain type of action (i.e. opening a door) but half the time another button will have to be pressed instead. Or a certain height of objects can be jumped over, but half the time an object of exact same height cannot be jumped over. Or you should be able to add an Herb to your quick-button ""Case"", but you can't despite available room. These are a very few examples, but those kind of things happen ALL the time. Add to this the very poor controls of vehicle sections, and it's obvious game design was, at the very best, rushed without consideration. 

Repetitive gameplay is self-explanatory, and the camera has a very frustrating tendency to auto-lock on ""important"" things in the worst possible way, forcing you to avoid enemies you can't look at, or move to an interactive point without the ability to actually see the path you're walking. Things like that. I'm trying to keep this short, but suffice to say you need a lot of patience and detachment to enjoy this game!

Review from 2018: 

Nope. Nope. Nope. 

If you're unsure, buy it on sale and try the opening scene, you could always ask for a refund after this. The intro is a clear statement of what the game will be in terms of mechanics, design and overall mood. You'll know after 10 minutes if this game is for you. It's a chaotic, illogical and aggressively ridiculous mess, but maybe you'll like it.",1533784819,1696778536,False,3,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

If you can't play with a friend or find anyone online, AI cannot die and they're competent at events, but don't cover your back well.

Aiming is easier with keyboard & mouse, but the menus and rest of the controls are very much designed for controller. Some campaigns are better than others (Leon's being strongest) and there are some sections that are near-impossible to do without controller (e.g. Chris chapter 5-3), however the game lets you switch seamlessly.

Kind of like playing Time Crisis than RE. If I'm being honest, I enjoyed the action packed play style at first, but it gets old REAL quick. After you get tired of it, you're just left feeling frustrated since you still have more boring content to go through just to see the ending of the lackluster storyline.

The UI of this game is poorly designed and confusing. Oh, and don't get me started on the split-screen co-op mode. The guy who designed and decided not to utilize 40% of your TV's screen real estate in split-screen mode should be fired. Yeah, I get it's aspect ratio related, but can't they have implemented something better? It just feels like the developers got lazy and released it the fastest and easiest way possible.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game to casual players and as an introductory game to the RE franchise. It's such a bad representation of what the franchise is.",1694839281,1694839281,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Camera work is very bad. 
it'll hide your escape route, 
block your sights,

AI will block your way while you are trying to move narrow area

Game is heavily based on random drop because of the infinite monster spawns.

It wasn't very fun experience tho.

Sniper monster will insta stuns you and they usually spawn infinitely. VERY ANNOYING

The title is extremely misleading ; this is NOT an RE game.

pros : Good stand-alone action packed and fun combat game. Cool characters, pretty colorful visuals (most of the time), eargasm inducing music, lots of achievements and collectibles.

cons : BEYOND ATROCIOUS ""RESIDENT EVIL"" GAME. 99% scripted events and QTE's, next to ZERO documents, terrible save mechanic, ridiculous plot armor (it's very known to exist in RE games but this...) An abomination of an interface ; extremely confusing inventory system, very disappointing graphics and sound effects for the guns, compared to RE5, it makes them sound like plastic toys. Cutscenes that are extremely long, boring and unskippable (such as the first person car scene in chapter 5 of Leon's campaign) Overall really, really bad story telling and writing. It's actually hilariously terrible. Will 100% give you a headache with the explosions and flashes 24/7. The boss fights are extremely boring and take an unnecessarily long amount of time. (Perhaps a skill issue...we shall never know.)

 I'd also like to add in these minor cons which still made me and other fans pretty pissed :
- There are no alternative costumes for the campaigns, which is a huge shame.
- Ada basically changed race lol. They used a white facemodel for an asian character...really? - Honestly no one really cares about this one, but i'd like to mention how weird Sherry's ""sexy"" school uniform mercenary outfit from RE2 is. I dont fw it
- No ""RESIDENT EVIL....SIX!"" voiceline when you launch the game. 

""But then, YOU, as an RE fan, why do you play this game?""

Because it's actually relatively fun! I believe this game was developed by a different team than the one that worked on RE 0-5, which might explain the sudden piece of shit released in the franchise.

As an action co-op game with surprisingly depth combat system....hell yeah!

Like with Resident Evil 5, but more so with game, you should try to play this game with anexpectation that it's an action focused game that isn't in anyway artistic but something like a B-movie that is just fun to watch, even if you can see the flaws.


Here are some points to consider in order to get the best possible experience with RE6:

* Watch a combat tutorial on Youtube, so you would get a better idea how combat works. The game has a awful tutorial (that you have to complete before starting the actual game) that only tells you very basics that anyone would understand, except maybe the healing which can be confusing for beginners. Basically, try to use melee, dodge and counter actions, and start experimenting. There is more to combat than just shooting and kicking.
* All characters have their own unique moves and starting loadouts. Your partner will have different attacks and guns at the beginning. 
* Skill system can be confusing but know this; you can only use one skill slot at the time (three skills each slot) but you can actually change them in-game at any point using your F1-F9 keys (slot 1 = F1, slot 2 for F2 and so on). You can buy skills between chapters, using skill points you acquired throughout the game
* Do not expect any horror. While this game has a few moments that could qualify as ""horror"" but there isn't anything that would really increase your anxiety levels compared to average horror game. And I'm saying this as someone who can get easily scared with any horror that has jumpscares.
* Leon's campaign has an awful opening, a walking simulator section, where game disables most of your abilities and forces you to walk slowly. But do not throw this game away that quickly, it's only for the first section of that chapter and the rest of the game isn't anything like that. It's annoying but it will be over quickly.
* RE6 has co-op, therefore you should absolutely play it with your friend. Like with RE5, it makes the experience so much more fun and hilarious. Also healing affects the other player too, if you are close to each other, so keep that in mind before using those sprays and herbs.
* Item and ammo drops are client-side, which means that players see different drops and do not have to worry about sharing ammo. Some item spawns are in fixed spots but it will show up for both players and each player can grab it on their end (if you see a first aid spray on a table, it could mean that there is another one for co-op partner). If you play alone however, you do not need to worry about AI partner wasting resources, they have infinite ammo. (those who played RE5 alone, you'll be relieved with RE6)
* There is no manual saving in RE6, instead there are two types of auto-saves; checkpoints (pin icon) and typewriter saves (typewriter icon). Checkpoint loads only when you fail or die, while typewriter one does that too AND saves your level progress. If you wish to take a break, only do so when you get the latter.
* There's two settings for aiming: crosshair and laser sight. Take your preferred choice.
* And if you happen to love combat of this game, like I do, check out ""mercenaries"". Can also be played in co-op.

Now indeed, Resident Evil 6 is a polarizing game for all the reasons that have been stated by others. For every weird/bad game design choice, there is one that is really good. Resident Evil 6 can be a lot of fun under the right circumstances, which is why I wanted to write this for anyone who has doubts about buying it.

Introduction:
Resident Evil 6, developed and published by Capcom, is the sixth main installment in the iconic survival horror game series. Released in 2012, this highly anticipated title aimed to continue the legacy of its predecessors while introducing some ambitious changes to the gameplay formula. With a bigger focus on action and a multi-layered storyline, Resident Evil 6 received both critical acclaim and some backlash from the fan base. In this review, we will explore the game's strengths, weaknesses, and overall gaming experience.

Gameplay:
One of the most noticeable aspects of Resident Evil 6 is its departure from the series' traditional survival horror roots. The game takes a more action-oriented approach, featuring fast-paced combat, abundant ammunition, and intense set pieces. The gameplay revolves around four distinct campaigns, each following a pair of characters, and their paths intertwine throughout the story.

The third-person shooter mechanics are solid and refined, making the gunplay feel smooth and satisfying. The controls have improved significantly compared to previous titles, allowing players to perform evasive maneuvers, rolling, and quick-time events seamlessly. However, some purist fans of the series were disappointed by the emphasis on action, which led to the sacrifice of the atmospheric tension that made the earlier Resident Evil games memorable.

Storyline:
Resident Evil 6 boasts an intricate narrative, intertwining the fates of iconic characters such as Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, and Ada Wong, among others. Each campaign offers a unique perspective on the global bio-terrorist threat plaguing the world. The plot is ambitious, with political intrigue, conspiracies, and global implications, but it can become convoluted and challenging to follow, particularly for newcomers to the series.

The attempt to blend different themes and storylines sometimes results in an inconsistent tone, making it difficult for players to immerse themselves fully in the game's universe. Nonetheless, the characters' individual arcs, especially Leon's campaign, manage to deliver compelling moments that will resonate with long-time fans of the franchise.

Graphics and Sound:
Visually, Resident Evil 6 delivers impressive graphics, character models, and environments. The game features highly detailed character designs, realistic animations, and a diverse range of locations, from urban settings to underground laboratories. However, despite these advancements, some areas feel lacking in detail and can appear bland or uninspired.

The sound design is a standout aspect of the game, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that enhances the overall experience. The game's audio effects, from the eerie ambiance to the spine-chilling roars of enemies, contribute to creating a tense atmosphere during intense moments.

Replay Value:
Resident Evil 6 offers significant replay value due to its multiple campaigns, each providing a different gameplay experience and perspective on the story. Additionally, there are various unlockable content, collectibles, and hidden secrets that encourage players to revisit the game. Moreover, the inclusion of co-op gameplay makes it a highly enjoyable experience to play with friends, adding to its longevity.

Conclusion:
Resident Evil 6 is undoubtedly a divisive entry in the Resident Evil series. While it strays from the traditional survival horror formula, it still manages to deliver an enjoyable and action-packed gaming experience. The improved gameplay mechanics and visually stunning graphics are commendable, but the convoluted storyline and departure from the series' roots received mixed reactions from fans.

If you are a fan of the series looking for an action-packed adventure with some engaging moments, Resident Evil 6 might be worth exploring. However, those seeking the classic survival horror experience might find it somewhat lacking in the atmospheric tension that characterized earlier installments. In the end, it boils down to personal preferences, and players should approach Resident Evil 6 with an open mind to appreciate its unique blend of action and horror elements.",1691351865,1691351865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I knew going into 6 that it had a bad rep as an over-the-top, action focused mess. I also had a very bad time attempting to play 5. All odds stacked against it then.

But for what it has turned out to be, it's actually a lot of fun. Don't get me wrong, this is nothing like the best that the series has to offer. The story-line is ... insane, the action elements totally undermine any hope of ""survival horror"" and half the game occurs in cut-scenes. 

However, it's just ... fun. Stupid, but fun. The mechanics are sufficiently tight, and not at odds with the rest of the gameplay like I found to be the case in 5. Quick time events are most unwelcome and are probably my biggest gripe with the game, but when it just lets you loose on a bunch of enemies it's a great time. Particularly if you're playing with a friend, as I am. The game is very easy unfortunately, but you can create some interesting and tense scenarios by being a bit creative and silly. For instance, at the start of Chris's chapter, I decided that we would crank the difficulty to max, and I'd attempt to play knife only. This created a fun dynamic with my friend having to conserve ammo to take down the enemies I couldn't overcome with the knife, and me trying to outmaneuver the enemies, getting in close enough to knife them down. Silly, but fun. 

Hence my conclusion: Take this game seriously and you'll be left with a bad taste in your mouth, particularly in comparison to the best of the series. Approach the game with a sense of ""playfulness"" and it's really quite enjoyable. Whether or not this warrants a recommendation of the game I leave up to the discretion of the reader, but for one, I can't help but tick the ""thumbs up"", because what is a game supposed to be if not fun?",1690708963,1690708963,True,1,0,0.508928537368774414,0,True,False,False

Believe all of the negative feedback. I was soft-locked in two different playthroughs, two different story arcs, because I ran out of ammo with no resupply. It will pathetically attempt to spawn ammo, but you wont get enough, frequently enough, to defeat some timed loop bosses. What I mean by that is, some bosses you need to shoot them repeatedly at certain times or they regenerate.

Aside from that massive design flaw, the game is just bad. Leon's campaign was okay, but when you start playing the others you realize it's a linear corridor shooter with zero brainpower.

Review Date: July 26, 2023

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

As I delved into the world of Resident Evil 6, I found myself captivated by its heart-pounding gameplay, stunning visuals, and engaging storyline. Developed by Capcom, this action-packed survival horror game truly left a lasting impression during my 105-minute playthrough in my attempt to reach the Cathedral, I stopped after the bus crash before reaching the Cathedral to write this review, and I can confidently say that it stands as a must-play for any fan of the genre.

One of the standout features that impressed me was the seamless integration of partners into the story. Unlike some games where companions feel like mere NPCs, Resident Evil 6 focused on cooperative gameplay and camaraderie. With its three interconnected campaigns, the game allowed me to experience the enthralling narrative from different perspectives, each character showcasing their unique skills and playstyle. This emphasis on dynamic partnerships not only elevated the gameplay experience but also deepened the overall storytelling.

The graphics in Resident Evil 6 were nothing short of breathtaking awesome, even by today's standards. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and horrifying creatures was awe-inspiring, the fear of the monsters is palpable. Every dark corner and eerie alley felt masterfully crafted, immersing me in a hauntingly atmospheric world where danger lurked around every turn. The remastered version, offering a superb 1080p60 experience, took full advantage of current-gen systems and further heightened the visual spectacle. 

What truly set Resident Evil 6 apart for me was its unparalleled immersive nature and fighting side by side with a partner. From the very beginning, I was drawn into a gripping narrative that kept me on the edge of my seat and trembling fingers on the key board. The game's pacing struck a perfect balance between heart-pounding action sequences and suspenseful exploration, ensuring that I remained fully invested in the story and the characters throughout the entire journey.

An aspect I greatly appreciated was the game's lack of punishment for exploring and making choices. Resident Evil 6 embraced player agency and encouraged me to explore every nook and cranny of its world without fear of being penalized for choosing the wrong path. This level of freedom enhanced the overall enjoyment and immersive nature of the game, so, I could play the game with confidence and actually enjoy the story without too much frustration and it made the experience feel incredibly rewarding and player-centric; thank you. 

I've been a Resident evil fan form the start, to include the first and early games. Resident Evil 6 is a triumphant addition to the iconic series and it's come a long way, successfully blending action and horror elements into an immersive and unforgettable gaming experience. Its emphasis on cooperative gameplay, stunning graphics, and captivating storytelling make it a standout title that deserves the attention of both longtime fans and newcomers alike. For anyone seeking an intense, heart-pounding action with a touch of survival horror, Resident Evil 6 is an absolute must-play.

There are 4 campaigns in Resident Evil 6, each 6-7 hours long and to get the full story you need to play them all. The problem is that there is so much repetition in these campaigns - You fight through a street and then have to kill a boss at the end from one character's POV, and then in another campaign you have to do the same thing from another character's POV. The first time this happened I thought it was cool, but then it kept happening again and again.. so much so that it just felt like filler. 

The HUD/GUI is so overly-stylised that it ends up not being stylish at all; It's loud, distracting, and antsy. The QTES are so flashy and they sometimes appear too quick to respond to. 

Saying all that, I liked that a lot of the famous RE characters were playable in this game, and I liked the newcomers too. I just wish the storylines were a bit more cohesive and easier to digest.

4 neat story lines so it has a pretty long game time (4x5hrs roughly)

The series started as a slow, methodical, combat light, puzzle heavy series of games, and Resident Evil 6 is a fast paced, explosive game with classic RE puzzles being completely absent. This by no means makes it a bad game. People tend to group RE6 and RE5 as the worst in the series for being ""non-horror"" games. I have played 5, and while it really can't be called a horror game, anyone who says that 6 is not a horror game is dead wrong. I'd argue that 6's strongest moments of horror even rival RE1 Remake, though others will disagree. History lesson on how RE6 came to be: 1996, Resident Evil 1 literally establishes survival horror as a genre. 1998, RE2, another major hit. 1999 & the 2000s bring RE3 and Code Veronica, both really good games, but the formula was a little stale, so in 2005, Resident Evil 4 came along, considered one of the greatest games of all time. Capcom saw the love for the new over-the-shoulder style of gameplay, and from that came RE5, the best selling Resident Evil of all time. And thats how RE6 came along. RE5 had action, and Capcom took the sales as the fans wanting more action, which new fans loved, and old fans less so. I like this game not because I want more classic Resident Evil, I like this game for the characters. After playing 4 and 5, I was genuinely invested in the stories of Chris Redfeild, Ada Wong, and of course mah boi, Leon S. Kennedy. If you are a newcomer to the series, DO NOT START WITH THIS GAME. I cannot stress enough how fast this game throws you in. However, if you are someone who has played 1, 2, Code Veronica, 4, and/ or 5, and have not checked out this game, I would recommend it (I specifically left 3 out because Jill unfortunately is not in this game and I must say Capcom she totally should have been). Back to story elements, I think people who say that the game is too action packed miss a key detail: This series has always been about the characters becoming more experienced. Jill, for starters, is much more versatile in 3 than in 1. Leon is a rookie cop who can do some basic maneuvers in 2, and by 4 is able to do high kicks and roundhouse kicks. Chris in RE1 could do basic maneuvers. In CV, he had a bad encounter with Wesker, which is why he trained so much so that in 5 one punch knocked a majini out cold. RE6 is the next logical step in these evolutions. So, how does the game play? For starters, the inventory is completely different from 5, which is probably the biggest downside. Quickturn is absent, but considering how fast you can turn, it's not really needed. Most other gameplay bits are the same as 5. The best way I can describe this game in kind of like a playable version of the animated Resident Evil movies. This is a good game, but also an unfortunate reminder for Resident Evil fans that we most likely won't see a sequel that has RE7/ Village slow methodical horror starring Leon or Chris. The strengths they've acquired are too powerful for a game to be genuinely scary. Jill could be a good candidate, as we haven't seen as much development from her (Capcom, please make another game with Jill). Overall, Resident Evil 6 is not the Resident Evil experience we have come to expect, but it is a good game.

If each campaign was a little shorter and didn't reuse as much locations from the others, and the story was less of a confusing mess, id think this would be one of the best games in the series, especially the cutscenes and performances.

It also has an insane amount of content. 4 campaigns with 8 different playable characters, each campaign lasts around 4-5 hours. 10 mercenaries map with 9 playable characters and 7 unlockable stupid sexy alt costumes with unique loadouts. Each character has unique takedown animations and there are also more than 20 different weapons.

Shooting feels like it has no impact, plot is allover the place and most your deaths will be cheap because you had no idea you were not supposed to stand somewhere.

Skill system instead of weapon upgrading and a separate option to unlock infinite ammo was also poorly thought out. You pretty much have to choose firearm/defence and then decide melee/zombie or J'avo killer. Or gimp yourself because piercing looks cool.

The gameplay is unique from all other titles and, although weapons are imbalanced, is good if you don't play this like any other Resident Evil you had. Well, it's similar in concept combat wise but still has to be learned. If you went into this from OG 4, 5, or the 4 remake, you'll definitely find it feels dramatically different and what you learned combat wise definitely isn't the same. The story, writing, and voice directed writing, is all also hilarious. It takes itself way too seriously and also doesn't at the same time which was a breath of fresh air. Some might be mad at this as it's kind of the ""conclusion"" of the Resident Evil series after going down the wrong direction. However, if you play it just for the fun co-op or just it by itself, it's really fun. Don't judge this solely by the identity of them ruining the perfection of their atmosphere and narrative. This was a double-downed display of ""We are stupid action silly hehe"" which was much more enjoyable than RE 5 which held itself back from being way too serious and action in a enjoyably bad/dumb way.

This is fun, play and enjoy it for what it is. Not just because the co-op is extremely fun, not just because it's an over-the-top action packed comedy sketch, but also as a testament to one of the couple of Resident Evil games in the past that are shining examples as to what they should NEVER  do again if they want their rebooted series to continue being good. Resident Evil 4 was fantastic but also the harbinger of what terror was to come. Resident Evil 5 was the true face of being out of touch with both their audience as well as what made the series good. Resident Evil 6 was hilariously an understanding of how they messed up, realized their mistake, and decided to crank the action up by 10x while going back to the laughable campy and silly of oldschool. Yet, if we want to avoid a travesty like Raccoon City Operations again, we have to remember what EXACTLY went wrong. Acknowledge it. Do better.

It doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game, it feels more like a Call of Duty campaign with mutants.
You can't ""corpse check"" the guys on the ground by shooting them ahead of time, you have to walk up right next to them so that they basically are guaranteed to hit you.
Keyboard controls are complete trash, with 4 different dodge buttons for 4 directions instead of one button that dodges in the direction you're moving.
The story is really forced.
Everything is way too over the top. Usually in these games, you have a couple massive enemies, of course. But they have always been overgrown bugs or test-tube babies. The main bad guy is a HUMAN who turns into a giant DOG and then a T-REX and then a massive HOUSEFLY. It's too much. It's too over the top for a Resident Evil game.
Some parts of the story were cool, but for the most part I really just can't think of this as anything except a massive disappointment.

- better AI than in RE5 (although that doesn't say much)
- lots of potential with new characters Sherry and Jake

Con:
- very bad controls which will be your death multiple times (especially in Chris' campaign)
- too much COD like action, not enough survival horror for RE
- 4 campains are 2 too many
- repetitive locations and boss battles at cross-over sections
- story is really messy and often badly written

Developed by the guy who made the original RE4 (2005) and tried to take a swing at making a new RE5 with RE6. What we got is an over-complicated control game with many different stories/campaigns (RE1x2).

Every level takes around 2-3 hours to complete. There are checkpoints, but unlike previous games those aren't save states. Those come very seldom, just to be able to quit and take a break to get back in later.

If you attempt to play the game like the RE4 and RE5, you will hate RE6 and think it’s a slog. I know I did as my first two playthroughs were a complete chore and I jumped on the hate bandwagon. It’s much more melee focused with the aiming for specific body parts downplayed in favor of various types of stuns as well as counters and dodges. Of course to discover this shift in focus you have to do the research yourself, since there is no advanced tutorial to speak of, and I don’t blame anyone for not understanding it and not going out of their way to watch/read combat guides. It is its biggest failure and borders on self-sabotage.

I can't help but be in awe at RE6's epic scope and ambition, with all of the campaigns and plot threads intertwining with each other, cutscenes shown from different perspectives depending on the campaign you are playing (one of the most epic cutscenes is the Tatchi missile attack). All of this effort for a plot that is bad even for Resident Evil standards. Each campaign is so long, it could've been its separate game. They even have unique looking UIs. I believe each of them had a completely separate team of developers whom communicated with each other whenever necessary. Must have cost a pretty penny to develop such a monster.

Each campaign tries to be different:[list]
[*]Leon’s is slower, more horror focused with a few minor puzzles… until it’s not, and turns into an escalating series of events which end in an increasingly ridiculous sequence of fights with the same constantly transforming boss. Ironically, it becomes more over the top than Chris’ campaign: Leon survives a car crash, bus crash, helicopter crash, airplane crash, basically a train crash, and jeep crash all in one game. Total identity crisis. Also has awful swimming section with a giant mutated shark. The “horror” parts restrict your movement and force you to walk in linear corridors. Adding zombies and trying to pretend that Tall Oaks is “Raccoon City all over again”, doesn’t make it good. What’s more, Leon seems superfluous to the story in his own campaign as it’s almost entirely centered around Helena. Good voice acting from Laura Bailey (Helena).
[*]Chris’ drops all pretenses and embraces being a full on action game. It makes the best use of the controls and mechanics, it’s the most consistent, and has the fewest QTEs (outside of combat Chris has fewer than 10 QTEs, dunno about Piers). The brief car chase does suck, however. As for the relationship between Chris and Piers, it’s the most developed. Chris’ PTSD and amnesia seem farfetched, but they’re not, if you take previous games into account. The ending is surprisingly touching for a Resident Evil game. Very good voice acting on Roger Craig Smith’s part (Chris).
[*]Jake’s is more like an adventure/Uncharted type game focused on cinematic set pieces with the most scripted sequences (and instant death chases), the most annoying QTEs, and the worst level in the game: it has running around in a snow storm, with possible ice sliding hindrance, snow mobile vehicle and several braindead stealth sections, and ends with an annoying series of QTEs. Additionally, Jake has a lot more to do at specific parts compared to Sherry, e.g. in the bike chase Jake has to weave and dodge vehicles and projectiles (with a few QTEs for good measure) while maintaining proper speed, meanwhile Sherry only has to shoot at some enemies from time to time. This bike chase is also the worst vehicle section in the game, as it feels and looks amateurish: the game force switches the direction your facing constantly to ready you up for upcoming obstacles and it looks very jarring. The final nail in the coffin is that the partner AI is at its worst here due to the nature of the scripted sequences... and Sherry’s sometimes shrill voice (JaAaAaAaAkEeeee…!!!). Even Jake’s melee focused build can’t save this campaign. Overall this one is very experimental, a mishmash of various mechanics, the chapters are much shorter, but at least it has the most variety. Voice acting wise Jake is played by Troy Baker, and Troy Baker is Troy Baker.
[*]Ada’s is supposed to be the piece that ties the whole puzzle together. Has a few poorly explained puzzles with obnoxious solutions. Fortunately, aside from that, it has the least bullcrap, some semi-decent stealth sections, and it’s blissfully short.
[*]Each campaign has a chapter with one of the most annoying enemies in Resident Evil history: Rasklapanje. Those parts the worst.[/list]

During your first playthrough you will most likely like Leon’s campaign the most with Chris’ the least. However, if you look at what the campaigns ARE, instead of what some wish they were, it’s obvious: Chris > Ada > Leon > Jake.

I haven’t tried the multiplayer modes, since none of them seems much fun. Might try them out with bots to get achievements for completionism sake. Agent Hunt appears to be there to purely troll people in their campaigns. Story Intersections are a good idea, but poorly implemented and almost never occurred with all characters being controlled by players as they have too many fixed requirements: two pairs of players at a specific section of their specific campaign in their specific region of the world they’re playing in at that specific time.

Mid mechanics that I couldn’t stand:[list]
[*]Default keybindings are awful, thankfully you can change them.
[*]New inventory system is a shadow of what it once was. Instead of the quick and snappy RE5 one, we have a new XMB (Playstation dashboard) one, which requires a lot of time getting used to.
[*]Brief cutscenes showing e.g. a door opening, do not stop enemies from moving. While you do not take damage during their duration, you will regularly find yourself on the receiving end of a zombie grab or melee attack once they’re finished.
[*]Sections where you cannot evoke any menu be it inventory, menu, or even pause.
[*]Chase sequences during which the camera is in front of you instead of behind you.[/list]

Minor mechanics that I couldn’t stand:[list]
[*]Tripping over corpses, which interrupts combat.
[*]Stumbling during “the place is falling apart” sections.
[*]Hitboxes for context sensitive traversals are way too big: you try to dash past a ladder - you climb the ladder, you try to dash past a chest high wall - you vault the wall etc.[/list]

Do not misconstrue me, this isn’t some misunderstood masterpiece: the complete lack of focus, scatterbrained design that goes everywhere and nowhere at the same time, way too ambitious, so much so that I don’t think more time in the oven would have helped etc. It has high highs and very low lows. Still, RE6 is fascinating to me: it’s a snapshot of the entire industry of the early 2010’s in a single game, with all of the trends of that time. I imagine someone writing an entire dissertation about each chapter of every campaign and analyzing all design decisions. It’s also really fun once you learn all of the combat mechanics and play Mercenaries... but I cannot recommend it with a clear conscience.",1685996246,1685996549,False,6,0,0.540530622005462646,0,True,False,False

In Capcom's attempt to simplify the already streamlined gameplay of the previous titles, they just failed to create a game worthy of your time.

Don't let the positive reviews fool you, people. Skip this one! It truly, absolutely sucks! 

...

Okay, so, for its time: it looks, sounds and feels good enough. But then you start to realize how the overall focus on multiplayer basically ruined the game design in this title. Not only that, but oftentimes combat encounters are just mindless farming, without any reason for a tactical approach. 

Also, reality check: there is nothing confusing about having a Use button and a Reload button. Capcom, however, in its infinite wisdom, decided that this is just too much. So it tried to make the Space button do all possible contextual actions.

And that, while not perfect, is functional. Until the moment it stops being true. Because Pick Up and Reload are a different, separate button just for these two functions. Then, this becomes even more complicated, because actions involving other players or NPCs require their own button too. 

Just when you start thinking that it can't possibly get any worse, you see how Evade is mapped -- by default -- to a numerical key. If this doesn't get you to question your motives for continuing to play, then you are one tough cookie.

Oh, wait: it can get worse too: there is literally no way to pause this game, even when playing alone. You are at the mercy of the autosave system and only after the game is done saving may you exit the game. RE6 basically assumes that you live on your own, in a cave.

So what, if my SO or my kid need something, I am to just ignore them, because Resident Evil 6 -- with its extremely strategic gameplay and deeply philosophical plot -- expects my full, undivided and absolute attention? 

This is absurdity incarnate. 

Then there are the little things like menu navigation being confusing or the XP system going against most of what we learned from the 90s, and all of this totals up to a complete mess of a package. And I, personally, value my time way too much to waste it on... Whatever attempt of inovation this is. 

I gave it an honest chance, though. I struggled for three hours and became absolutely fine with the idea of Resident Evil 6 being the only entry in the franchise that I haven't completed. Maybe I'll try again in a decade or two, but as of now -- not a chance in hell. 

Resident Evil 6 sucks. And no amount of new-age positive reviews should convince you otherwise. And that sucks! Because there are genuinely cool ideas here and... I'll end it off like this: if there was ever a game that needs a remake, it is this one.",1685815955,1685815955,False,1,0,0.49824562668800354,0,True,False,False

It has big amount of attempts at doing things that no horror fan cares about, much less RE fans, which I'm supposing is the main reason this title is the red haired step child of the bunch. The mechanics of combat can be interesting if you learn to master them, but the rest of the game will feel awkward to matter how good you get.

Cons vary from melee parries (what) to constant QTEs (why), passing through car chases (unnecessary) and ridiculous and weirdly angled chases (is this really resident evil) where running away feels like you're running straight AT the camera or when the angle keeps flipping and the control becomes really unintuitive leaving the players feeling like they've no clue where you're going so you die a few times and then some, restarting that sequence over and over again can be frustrating.

Why am I recommending it? Co-op! I've really enjoyed 5 and 6, even though not many liked them. Same for Dead Space 3, even though it's considered to be the worst of the series. That's why. Sure, the game has flaws, not many people will enjoy the wonky feel of it of the game where you may die 5 or 6 times before you figure out ''that's where or what I'm supposed to do?!'', and then proceed to keep playing until the next ''wait, what?''. But it all becomes bearable with a bud. Do I think it saves them from being the worse in the series? Yeeeeaaaah, no. But do I think game with coop campaign need to stay alive? Yeah. 

So it got my 5$ when on sales (as an RE bundle) and me and me friend enjoyed it. Ain't the best, but it's still fun. 4 campaigns in one game is still a lot of content!

While it undoubtedly has its flaws, Resident Evil 6 manages to deliver an intense and thrilling experience, albeit one that may not satisfy purists of the earlier games.

One of the most notable aspects of Resident Evil 6 is its ambitious scope. The game features four intertwined campaigns, each following a different set of characters and taking place in various locations around the world. This diversity injects a refreshing variety into the gameplay, showcasing different perspectives and intertwining storylines. Whether it's Leon S. Kennedy's traditional survival horror scenario, Chris Redfield's military-style action sequences, Jake Muller's intense chase sequences, or Ada Wong's stealth-focused missions, there's no shortage of content to explore.

The gameplay itself leans heavily towards an action-oriented approach, offering fast-paced gunfights, intense set pieces, and dynamic encounters with hordes of enemies. The controls have been refined, providing smooth movement and a wide range of combat options. However, the increased focus on action detracts from the survival horror elements that defined earlier entries in the series. The game relies heavily on quick-time events and scripted sequences, leaving little room for strategic planning or genuine tension.

Another divisive aspect of Resident Evil 6 is its convoluted and overstuffed narrative. The attempt to tell a grand-scale story spanning multiple campaigns is admirable, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The plot often feels disjointed and confusing, with a plethora of characters, twists, and conspiracies that can be difficult to follow. While it does offer some interesting moments and ties up loose ends from previous games, the storytelling lacks the cohesive and atmospheric charm that fans of the series have come to expect.

Visually, Resident Evil 6 is a mixed bag. The game boasts impressive graphics, detailed environments, and excellent character models. The different locations are beautifully rendered, and the attention to detail is commendable. However, the dark, brooding atmosphere of earlier entries is largely absent, replaced by a more action-oriented and explosive visual style. This departure may disappoint fans of the series' signature creepy and atmospheric settings.

Despite its flaws, Resident Evil 6 manages to deliver an entertaining and action-packed experience. It offers a substantial amount of content, providing hours of gameplay and variety. The cooperative multiplayer mode adds another layer of fun, allowing players to team up and face the challenges together. It may not be the traditional survival horror experience that fans expected, but as a standalone action game, it can be an enjoyable and thrilling ride.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 6 is a game that divides the fan base due to its departure from the series' roots. It sacrifices the atmospheric tension and strategic gameplay of its predecessors in favor of an action-oriented approach. While it falls short in capturing the essence of the earlier games, it still manages to provide an engaging experience, especially for those who enjoy fast-paced action and cooperative play. If you can embrace its differences and approach it with an open mind, Resident Evil 6 offers an exciting and adrenaline-fueled adventure.",1685234257,1685234257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i bought this game to be in storyline of RE series and to find out what happened with Leon, Ada, Chris, Sherry after RE5 and before RE7, didn`t regret at all

plot was good and bad at the same time: amazing connections between 4 campaigns, the most interesting campaign was Ada`s

gameplay is too boring, is what makes this game most hateful and worst Resident Evil: shooting was too boring, it just doesn`t feel like you are shooting with real weapon but plastic. No riddles/mazes at all. They are what makes RE interesting, but RE6 had only one interesting riddle (with dead bodies and doors) in Ada`s campaign. This game became more shooterish as horror. It was really not scary at all, just felt like Hollywood action film or like another Call Of Duty game. The best thing here is fightings, I really liked punching combinations etc.

graphics look amazing, nothing to mention, just amazing. probably capcom`s forte

3) Each character story happened in multiple locations. 
4) Full of Michael Bay's elements such as pyrotechnic and mind blowing actions.

Returning characters facing off against each other, badass kaiju sized bioweapons that can turn into anything based on pure Rule of Cool and level entire buildings. Unfortunately, they spent so much time wondering what they could do that they never considered if they should make such a game. So much danger, destruction and action setpieces are thrown at you, that you ironically don't feel like you are under any real threat.

The inventory, currency, skill/weapon upgrade systems are a MASSIVE step down from RE5 and the sheer volume of familiar Resident Evil characters and number of campaigns they include doesn't make up for a pretty hollow quasi-rail shooter with few horror elements. It's like they were still riding the high of Resident Evil 4 and doubled down on the least interesting parts.

On the flip side, the campaign design is great for co-op play as I've had the most fun playing with friends and making fun of the game. Playing with a friend also improves a familiar issue from RE5 around the friendly AI being more of a liability in combat.

I played the whole game Solo, but I can only think it's gonna be better than it already is if you play it Co-op.

The game Improved on the AI partner having Infinite Ammo and Health, and you don't need to manage its Inventory. The Controls are righteous for an Action game, as the Controls of RE5 Just didn't fit with the Game Style, tho having to Push A to open a door but B with a Partner, or Crush a Zombie with RT but Helping a Partner with B, it's super weird but Manageable. Also Loved the Different Enemies and Bosses all the Campaigns had, Really make them more Distinguishable and Great. I liked the QTEs, I Heard there were too many in this game, and I don't think so, I liked them. 

I Love the HUD of this game, every Character has a Different HUD to fit their Style and in Jakes/Rebeccas Campaign the game changes the Hud mid-game, I LOVE IT. 

RE6 is Split into 4Campaigns and it took me 24 hours to complete those on Normal, so this RE game is Probably one with the most content you likely get, + the DLC (that I didn't play) u have such a good game with great content in here. 

now I won't get too much into the story because it's not that great. We have 4 Campaigns all with 5 Chapters, so 20 Chapters. The Campaigns are Leon/Helena, Chris/Piers, Jake/Sherry, and Ada/Random Guy.

Leon/Helena Campaign: I think this is with Ada's Campaign the Worst, it's Okay but I get the feeling this campaign doesn't know what it wants to be, a Horror game or Action game, that somehow really got on my Nerves. Helena is Alright but I think Claire or Jill would've been better here. Simmons was a cool Boss, and even tho this is the Horror Survival Campaign in this game (or it wants to be that) you don't have any Ammo Problems in this one. 

Chris/Piers: Chris is in a bar and just Drinking, Piers comes and says they all waiting for him, and Bam he is back, Doesn't seem to be that much of a problem that he has if just one Person has to come and say ''Come back'' so he does LMAO. 
Otherwise, I loved this Campaign it's With Jakes My Favorite, I loved that this Campaign just wants to be an Action game, and it works great, I loved the Characters that were Introduced and the Emotions from Chris to his Comrades, I like Piers and Finn. Well-made Boss and ammo Problems, even tho this is the ACTION campaign LMAO.

Jake/Sherry: This is my Favorite Campaign of the Game, I Like jake, I love the Stealth actions of this Campaign, and The Locations are Interesting, Like the Lab or the Snowy Open Area, This was just Great. also had Great Boss fight, but the end was A bit weird with the Fist Fight. This Campaign did Right what Leon's Campaign Tried to do IMO.

Ada: The Worst Campaign imo, it's just there to tie the Story Together, every Chapter it has is Pretty Short, and it just Reuses about Every Location of the Game again, But this doesn't mean it's bad. But WTH is all the Ada Obsession, Simmons Loves her, Leon Loves her (which we already know)[spoiler] and the Doppelganger, I still don't know why She exists[/spoiler]. Otherwise, idk how this Campaign Works in Co-op ig you just get a random army guy to Help. 

Generally speaking, you will do some Fights and Areas 2 times because the Campaigns Overlap each other, I don't mind that tho. 

I Liked this game, it's not perfect but it has its right to exist, and it's fun ( not like RE5 ). I still have to Play the DLC's im Probably doing that Later.

The part where you have to find 3 pieces of data in the middle of a snowstorm was one of the worst gaming experience I have ever had. Those stealthing sections are boring and frustrating, and I hate how they handled Sherry as a character. I was expected to shoot the baddies during a bumpy motorbike ride as Sherry but suddenly in the final fight she couldn't hold her gun properly so Jake had to hold the gun with her? All for the sake of cheap romance. Great.

I'm currently playing Chris's campaign, and the way the camera moves and shakes in ch2 literally hurts my brain. If Leon wasn't in this game I wouldn't even have bought it bc of all the negative reviews, and yeah I agree with those criticisms. This game has some of the worst UI and controls that I have ever seen. Whoever did the UI in this game needs to be banned from the industry

Everything is just too much... Too much action, too many fights, too many enemies, way toooo many QTEs.

Leon's campaign is by far the best, although Jake's not bad either.  Wish they have focused on these 2. With some adjustments it has potential.

I think this game deserves a remake for us to be able to finally have a worthy RE6 game. A more focused story, much less action, using the same environments, which were fine, could really work. Also scrap ADA and Chris campaigns. As much as I love Chris Redfield his campaign is just not worst than Ada's.

Well, I'm here to tell you that they're wrong. I avoided both RE5 and RE6 for a long time because of their reputation, but RE6 ended up being a bit of a treat. The biggest understandable complaint is that this game completely ditches the survival horror aspect, but that's ok. With a great story of 4 separate campaigns that all ingeniously cross over into each other seamlessly and polished action gameplay, RE6 is a solid action game that I feel is worthy of being remembered and part of the RE universe. Although it certainly has a handful of flaws that must be addressed. The main one is the overabundance of QTEs which are anything but fun in any videogame especially this one, I also have some gripes with the awkward control schemes which has SPACE used for basically everything from sprinting to mantling. This is especially awkward when attempting to sprint near any interact-able object which will most definitely cause you to either slide across a car or drop down from a ledge you probably don't want to, also reload and pickup are the same as well which isn't super annoying but using R to pickup items is super weird.

There are some good ideas here but almost all of them are poorly executed. Overlapping campaigns between characters and players potentially resulting in boss fights with 4 people is a cool idea but poorly executed as the fights and objectives are somewhat confusing in some cases.

I like the idea of the 4 campaigns where some of it is supposed to overlap. However in reality it results in a lot of re-used maps and sections and even video sequences where there isn't really any surprise anymore after you've finished 2 campaigns as you already know the intersections and where you will encounter the various characters. So you will know where the journey goes in campaign 3 and 4.

In addition the campaigns are all the same in structure regarding the various chapters. Each campaign has 5 chapters. Each  chapter on first playthrough will be about 1 hour long resulting in an overall campaign of around 20 hours. Each chapter is basically structured with some videosequences, sections where you fight some normal enemies, then you fight some harder enemies and then the chapter will have a boss as a finale and another small section afterwards to go to the next chapter.

Some of the bosses will re-appear multiple times throughout the campaigns which results in these ""will you finally die?"" moments because it just feels like groundhog day. You fight a boss in chapter one and then again in chapter 3 to then have him again in chapter 4 or 5. And when that boss that chases you doesn't even have any backstory or explanation on where it is coming from that makes the whole thing just really boring and obnoxious.

The story in terms of writing is also really weak. The character of Leon has been completely changed compared to RE2 and RE4. He still sometimes gets a cool oneliner. But overall he feels like a different character and a side kick in his own campaign. He also apparently has forgotten how the whole zombie stuff works. I can't explain his stupid decisions otherwise. In terms of the other characters and campaigns nothing really stood out in a positive way. I somewhat liked Jake at the start as he's closer to what Leon was in the previous games. But he also gets annoying in the later chapters of his campaign.

Let also mention the constant shark jumping the game does. This game is packed with heavily cliched over the top stupid dialogue and video sequences. Something like can be fun. Unfortunately the game takes itself way to serious which results in it not really being fun.

From a technical perspective the game looks good but it has way to many loading screens. Especially the Chris Redfield campaign often has situations where after a loading screen you go down a corridor, open a door, go another corridor without any fights just to then open another door and have another loading screen. Whoever thought this was good design has lost their mind. The character controls are sometimes okay and sometimes really make me rage. When you have multiple functions on the same key and they interfere with each other then I just want to strangle the designer who did this. Spacebare for example is used for running as well as climbing and various other actions. When I run along a corridor and then have to climb on a box I might actually turn around and climb down the box again if I immediately try to run again after climbin up. This can also result in deaths in high pressure situations.

The multiplayer functions seem to be fine from what I've seen but the game is mostly dead online. If you do not have a friend to play in co-op you're unlikely to get partners past Leon's campaign. The agent hunt mode can be fun but the creatures are extremely difficult to control.

Something else to finish this review off. The game still has an obnoxiously high number of QTEs and I HATE THEM!",1683402896,1683402896,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

If you're coming here, to RE6, you should be looking for a fun time with a friend, not necessarily a good one. As bad as the plot is, it's *funny* to poke fun at. The gameplay is polarizing. Either pretty fun (my opinion, due to being able to dodge, being able to just hit them with melee combat to stagger, and it feels like the character is actually remotely competent at fighting hordes of B.O.W's, knowing how to dodge, melee with anything and not exclusively a knife, escape grapples without using a knife or grenade, and perform finishing moves without exclusively using a knife. You know, stomp head into mush).
Or you hate it with the fury of a thousand stars. And you're a hypocrite because you like the original RE4 in which Leon is unable to avoid a chainsaw because he needs to slowly turn around and *then* begin hopping away.
RE2make had the elevator with a flaming tyrant and a minigun. Survival horror game btw.
RE3make had nemesis with a flamethrower, running over nemesis, a rocket shot at nemesis, many explosions, nemesis turning into a giant fish dog and running in circles, nemesis turning into half a room and you used a gigantic minigun. Survival horror game btw.
RE4make had the kid with the wig, shooting during a monologue, and throw a gold egg at a boss to kneecap his health. You shoot one dude in a foot and only then can you do any form of melee attack other than a knife, such as a roundhouse kick throwing five separate spaniards twirling through the air. ""Best survival horror game ever"" btw.
RE5 had chris punch a boulder. Survival horror franchise btw.
RE7 was more survival horror than any of the remakes so far.
RE8 had a tank mech with a chainsaw that you used to parry the megazord of a dude whose parasite gave him magneto powers and lifted you up into a tornado of magnetism. Survival horror franchise btw.
RE6 isn't RE4 part 3. It's a clusterfuck. It's a game that's been titled with the words Resident Evil.
Don't go into RE6 looking for running around spain without being able to strafe even a little bit. Go into RE6 expecting it to be a action B-movie with far too high a budget for its own good. Take a shot every time someone points a gun threateningly at something that clearly doesn't care about a pistol that shoots 9mil bullets. Take a shot every time the characters *should* die in a cutscene, or every time they get injured by something with the kinetic energy limited to the capabilities of a toddler.

It's very RE in grand schemes (bioweapons, lots of slow zombies, shoot leg, weakspot, important characters become supermutants instead of basic zombies, finding random stuff in random places, no common sense), but the minutae of the plot is not even close to the structure of other entries which is probably why it's so jarring and thus hated. It's so over-the-top.
The gameplay itself, after you make sure your bindings are yours (if you don't look at keybindings when you play a game you deserve to have misery with controlling it), can work well.
The dodge mechanic works great for just hitting a button and naturally avoiding a lunge, or acid, or a thrown shovel.
You can actually just hit zombies with a kick or your gun, instead of *having* to pull out a knife which might have durability.
Or you can quick shot to just *hit* them and stagger. And you regain stamina faster when laying on the ground.
RE6 will be a very polarizing game to play with your hands on the control inputs. You either hate the animation based tank-like movement when just walking around (you liked it in RE4 so shut up), or you figure out how to push the X button on your keyboard and nullify almost every single direct basic attack each enemy can deal. Or just use one of the sideways rolls to avoid even more.

Don't expect grand machinations of writing. Expect something as stupid as RE4. Great with a buddy. I just like being able to run around, shoot the enemies, dodge some attacks, laugh at how dumb the plot is.
Also, play it with a friend. It's much more palatable when you can laugh at it with somebody instead of just at a stream chat or a webcam or your own empty room. It's probably so fucking bad without anybody.
Any game is more fun with a friend. Investment in the decisions made is probably misery, just invest in the action-movie gameplay.",1683271896,1683271896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Leon's story is by far the best story where it's the closest to classic RE you will get in this game. Classic zombies and large boss fights. Player 1 is Leon and player 2 is Helena who is really only there for co-op purposes and to fill Leon's story out longer. 

Chris' story is the worst by far game-play wise. Every enemy is incredibly tanky even on normal mode. The bosses were lame in Chris' story and most of it feels like filler. The best part of Chris' story is Chris and Piers I won't spoil anything about them but its a very interesting story between the both of them.

Jake's story is filler. It is only there just to fill the gaps between parts of the story that the above mentioned story's don't explain. Jake's story is worth playing however since Sherry and Jake are both fun to watch develop ,and the game-play is really good for Jake's story.

Ada's Story is very good but not meant for co-op. The option is there for co-op but you're friend will be playing as a nameless nobody who will not be able to interact with any puzzles or doors and will vanish in cut-scenes/teleport in and out of the game. However Ada's part of the game is important to the story and understanding it if you really care about this games story. She is very fun to play as with stealth,puzzles,and combat. 

Overall its a pretty tedious game with tanky enemies that wont die and for the most part bad boss fights, Puzzles for the most part that is just you searching for 3 items to unlock a door. These segments of collecting 3 of something all play the same where they send an immortal monster after you (that makes really annoying sounds) follows you until the game allows you to kill them.

I'm well aware of all its faults technically, storywise (the Ada plotline is just a damn headache) and it feels like they hardly learned a lesson from RE5's mistakes. But hey, if there is anything I admire in a company like Capcom is its willingness to experiment with different styles of gameplay, coop, take on the backlash for doing so and eventually learn (RE7) . But that's just me, I don't mind sticking your guns to your OG style but RE6 took some chances.

The coop, which is why I recommend this mostly, is good fun and its heartwarming to know there are people who are interested in experiencing this action packed Hollywood adventure that is best experienced in the medium that is videogames. I don't know why but I love to help random people power through the campaign so they can see the badassery of all our favorite characters.

Hot take: RE6 is a great introduction to the series because it allows normies to be introduced to the universe through a more exciting perspective and those who want more of the story might actually be happy to find out the older games are not as cinematic, but rather more narrative driven. I think this viewpoint is forgotten by most oldschool gamers like me. We forget not everyone played the series from RE1 and have the luxury of playing it now in the modern day. Exciting!

Yes their are 4 different story campaigns to choose from and the story can get a bit convoluted and messy but it's one big roller-coaster of action and that's why I love Resident Evil 6 so much. I've just about completed Sherry and Jake's campaign and it's been one action set piece after another. I have played Resident Evil 6 before and completed Leon's, Chris's and Jake's campaigns but i never got round to doing Ada's campaign back in the Xbox 360 days. I forgot just how action packed this game is. So like I say if you prefer a more action orientated horror game rather than the usual survival horror game then your going to enjoy this. To say this game is around 11 years old now, some of the environments look spectacular. There is one thing I should bring to attention about this port of Resident Evil 6 on Steam and that is the stuttering. I'm playing on a Steam Deck and for some reason when a cut scene plays it starts to go choppy and stutters. I have tried numerous graphical options to see if I can sort the problem out and I've had no look so far. So if you like your games fast paced, action packed, with a grand story, then i highly recommend this game to you. Also if you've got a friend to play? You can either play Resident Evil 6 in local split screen co-op or in online co-op and this is where the game really shines in my opinion being able to play in co-op with a friend.

221040,137214348,76561199075106664,0,2,9665,0,5580,1700455955,"I know this is going to tick a lot of people off but Resident Evil 6 is actually my favorite RE title, with 4 close behind.  This game is a vast improvement over its predecessor, Resident Evil 5, with better controls, smoother gameplay, smarter AI, wider enemy variety and enough content to make its rather steep price, shared with RE7, worth it.

This is the most maligned RE game out there but I think most of the hate is unwarranted.  Is it a bad game?  Absolutely not.  Is it a bad survival horror game?  Yes, but so are 4 and 5, 4 less so but still not great.  Is it a bad Resident Evil game?  Yes, but only by old Resident Evil rules.  The thing is, those rules don't apply to all Resident Evil games forever.  RE4 did not jump the shark by going for action over horror: it evolved the series into something new for the new generation.  RE6 is the culmination of that evolution, the ultimate outbreak/disaster that every player of the original Resident Evil envisioned when they saw the horrific monstrosities infesting the Spencer mansion.

I played through all four campaigns without being too frustrated or quitting for ages at a time as I did with the previous game.  And, I have to say, they're all good in their own ways.  Leon's reeks of classic Resident Evil horror, Chris' feels more like a typical action monster movie, Jake's brings back the terror of having Mr. X hunting you in RE2 with the fearsome Ustanak on your tail, and Ada's campaign, while the least fun, does tie all of them together quite nicely.

The AI is much smarter and more useful than Sheva was in RE5 and is less of a liability.  I've had my skin saved far more times by Piers, Helena or Sherry than I ever was by Sheva.  Weapons and commands are better and the AI just seems more coordinated.  However, this game is also a blast with a friend.

The story is a little confusing, but it's not hard to piece together if you've played the game enough.  The J'avo seen here are far more threatening than the Ganado of RE4 or the Majini of RE5 with their ability to spontaneously mutate into terrifying new forms, and the C-Virus Zombies, while slower and less intelligent, are no joke either.  The only reason they're not as dangerous in-game is because you're stronger, with the ability to melee without shooting enemies and perform dodges and dives.

And the Mercenaries mode... OH MY GOD, the Mercenaries mode... easily the best in the series, tied with the RE4 Remake of 2023.  I have almost 100 hours in this game from this mode alone with how astoundingly entertaining it is.  I never thought just cracking zombie skulls and disintegrating J'avo for a few minutes could be so damn fun!  Not to mention, RE5's Mercenaries has to be unlocked by playing the main game through to the end, while the Mercenaries mode in this game is unlocked from the get-go.

People say RE6 is bad, but I say nay nay, not unless you were looking for an old-school Resident Evil game, because this is new school Resident Evil and that honestly makes it more fun.  I played this after playing RE5 for a while, and had so much fun with it that I actually beat it before coming back to RE5.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, definitely.  For a game that's over 10 years old, it's still quite fresh and a helluva good time!

Edit:  I think the story could have been a little better if Albert Wesker had survived RE5 and been the villain again, then he could have faced off against Jake in his campaign and have Jake call him out for being a bad father and an all-round psycho.  I also think the QTEs are a little excessive but at least the game added a counterattack option, which this series has needed for a while.  I really love how each encounter with the enemies is like its own mini-puzzle and how each B.O.W. you face has their own way of taking them down, which is pretty good for pretty much all of them.  Except the Lepoticas.  (Le-Poh-Tits-Ah)  Those things can just f*** right off.

I also understand the lack of an upgrade screen or Merchant and just starting with fully upgraded weapons because the campaigns take place over multiple countries in a short span of time, so I think Capcom can get a bit of leeway there.  I really love that this game has a sprint mechanic that actually lets you sprint, instead of the lame-as-hell jogging from Resident Evil 5, and even lets you perform some kick-ass sprinting melees so you can pull off devastating combos.

I think most of this game's horror comes not from how the B.O.W.s seen in it affect you, the protagonist, but knowing how they must be affecting the populace, who aren't trained or equipped to deal with them at all.  This is a horror game if you think about it, just not in the direct or traditional sense.",1682319684,1682711532,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Order of campaigns in my opinion in terms of quality from best to worst is Jake/Sherry, Chris/Piers, Leon/Helena, Ada/Agent.

It also features quite unresponsive controls and clunky movement which make the experience even more frustrating.

So after more time with the game I still feel it is awful, but it can be quite fun at times. The combat system can definitely be quite entertaining with all the options in mobility and melee combat, but the game communicates so many mechanics so poorly that learning all the ins and outs of it that it somehow makes all the gameplay feel half baked. The game has some of the worst scripted sequences I’ve ever played in a game, they somehow feel more akin to a low budget game, there is one in particular when you drive on some snowmobile and my god is just awful. Also, the amount of QTEs are horrid, most of them with terrible timing and foreshadowing, but thankfully, you can turn them off, which I highly recommend. Also, while the game doesn’t look bad for its age, the quality of the assets, geometry, texture and lighting is inferior to the one in Resident Evil 5, the main character models look decent, but the environments can be incredibly dull and on close up just straight up ugly. 

I will now say some more positive things. As previously stated, combat can be fun, and there are some places where this element shines and as a consequence of this, there are some truly fun boss fights here and there. The game also runs smoothly as hell, aside from a weird bug that would tab out of the game, I had no problem with running the game. The story is also a highlight, it’s insane and stupid in all the right ways and I loved it. Also, if you have a friend who is willing to turn off their brain a little and not take the game too seriously it can be a blast in certain parts and you can laugh at everything wrong and dumb about the game.

In general is a game with ups and downs, but the issue is that the downs are by far the worst the mainline series has seen. If you have someone to play it with and go with the mentality that you will play a dump game and then turn off the QTEs, maybe I would be able to recommend it, otherwise, just don’t. While fun at times it’s a miserable experience for the most of it, especially playing alone and I consider it to be the worst of the numbered RE games.

The game is 5/10 for me.



Previous Review:

Clunky controls, terrible camera, too many QTEs, awful level design and terrible pacing. It even looks worse than RE5. I don’t know how Capcom produced this garbage, played it on PS3 back in the day and tried it now to see if maybe I was too harsh in the past with it, but no, I wasn’t. Just one hour of Leon's campaign reminded me how god awful this game is.

RE6 is the worst mainline Resident Evil game thanks to several reasons:
- It's 3rd person action shooting game and there's absolutely zero horror in it.
- Co-op mechanic makes the game WAY too easy, even on harder difficulties.
- 4 overlapping campaigns sound cool on paper, but in this case they are extremely short and the story is poorly paced. It just jumps around from one location (and country even) to another.
- Explosions, explosions, explosions... Did Michael Bay direct this game?

RE6 should have never existed imo.

When I played this game I was going through a Resident Evil marathon and I almost dreaded getting to this game because of its reputation but when I got to it I tried to keep an open mind as I am somewhat of an unwilling contrarian and Resident Evil 5 (the closes game to this) is one of my favorite games in the franchise. However I just can't bring myself to like this game.
Defenders of this game will often bring up the mechanics of the game such as the movement, the gunplay and the melee moves (which have been greatly expanded upon since 5) and I agree that the mechanics in this game are really good, the big problem is that the game is often more interested in showing you its lackluster setpieces, drowning you in qte or waiting for something to happen in the game so you can progress and when the game isn't doing this you have to bear its less than stellar level design. 
The enemies is in this game are also much less fun to fight against than the enemies in 4 and 5. Enemies in general feel more tanky and are less responsive to your attacks when compared to 4 and 5 which I feel is a great flaw in this game as the most fun part in those games was settting the enemies up for a melee follow through. Another gripe I have with the enemies in this game is that infected with guns are much more common and they are particularly unfun to go up against. 
Finally, a lot of the boss fights in this game are quite unbereable. To me Resident Evil as a franchise has never had outstanding bossfights but they feel like more of a nuissance here than in other entries as they tend to be very drawn and are particularly bad when it comes to the aforementioned setpieces and quick time events. 
Overall I can't really recommend this game unless you play it with a friend or are a big fan of RE and want to follow the story threads between this and following entries.

This game already was garbage; ragdolling camera, enemies appearing out of thin air like a random encounter in RPGs, unending QTEs that I stopped doing because they WILL break your controller(s). And of course the partner AI that will lead you to contant instant death moments. This was the Resident Evil game for those that didn't like Resident Evil games. But now add the magnificent glory of contant framedrops. Did I say frames? I mean seconds.

Geforce Experience, as always, puts this game on highest settings but it runs HORRIBLE. I put everything to the lowest settings possible and it still runs horrible. Even though I don't have a ""4K"" monitor I can run games in ""4K"" fine, but I can't even run this game on 720p lol. Maybe it's Windows 11, maybe the game has issues with the newest drivers <shrugs>

So if you get the game and you have frame drops, turn OFF Anti Alias as for some THAT worked. If it doesn't work for you.. you probably will stop playing after an hour or 2 because the ragdoll camera REALLY becomes annoying when infected with frame drops.",1680870475,1680870475,False,0,0,0.498623132705688477,0,True,False,False

RE6 is basically your average summer blockbuster action movie, but in the worst way possible. There's no substance to any of it, it's just dumb set piece after dumb set piece. It's a trial in seeing just how crazy it can get and what kind of situations it can push the characters into to have them try to survive. It has some good ideas here and there and they clearly PACKED this thing full of content but most agree that the content you get here isn't quite up to par with any of the previous games in the series. RE6 killed the franchise for a reason.

As said before, this game has tons of content. It's easily the longest RE game even now with 4 different campaigns and one of the most extensive Mercenaries modes in the series. Each campaign revolves around different characters and they usually intertwine at certain moments. This sounds pretty awesome on paper but it doesn't feel as developed as say when Leon and Claire meet in RE2 at various points in the campaign. Usually you run into the other characters during a segment and they are just kinda there to help you fight then leave right after. I think Leon and Chris's campaign clearly had the most work done with them with Jake's being slightly worse and Ada being by far the worst of the four. Not all campaigns have the same amount of effort put into them unfortunately.

RE6 doesn't have much in the way of story. Sure there's plenty of cutscenes and attempts at a story but a lot of it feels like rehashes of previous games, there's this dude called Ustanak who is literally a carbon copy of Nemesis in Jake's campaign for example. I think Chris and Piers had a lot of potential though, and Jake as a concept is pretty cool but I think they could have been executed better.

Now there is one thing that RE6 does pretty well, and that's the gameplay. It's definitely a far cry from the Resident Evil that everyone knows but it's a very well made combat system focused around action, doing dodge rolls and performing take downs that feel like something out of a John Wick movie. I find the Mercenaries mode to be especially fun because of this, mainly because it's just pure gameplay without any boring story/annoying set pieces to get in the way.

I don't think RE6 is terrible but by the franchise's standards it's definitely the worst numbered title in the series. If you're looking for some dumb fun with a buddy, RE5 is a lot better for that but this is here as a backup option as well.

Well, the story itself isn't even that bad but it kinda drags on because you have to finish the story with 4 different characters. I guess you can say it also has the most story related content of any main game of the series but this isn't even the problem with the game.

The problem is the gameplay and the controls. The gameplay just feels like garbage and mostly consists out of button mashing and making stunts. And then the controls, whoever programmed these on PC has NEVER played any PC game. Luckily you can change some of them but others are hardlocked and ultimately the control scheme on Keyboard/Mouse is horrible. But wait, there is more. Sometimes the camera is really annoying and takes the control from the player even to a point where some sections like that boat parcour part in Chris' campaign is one of the most vile Resident Evil parts I remember. They even added annoying enemies that basically block your way but you have to ignore them since the time is REALLY short. If you get stuck once while sprinting or your character makes the wrong move because of the bad control scheme, you can basically redo the parcour because you died. Its just awfully bad game design. Oh, and did I mention you CANNOT skip the credits and are forced to watch them 4 times for each campaign and it always goes like 10 minutes? Even if you watched it already once, you still cant skip it. What were they thinking when they made this game? I guess I dont even need to mention that it has no ultrawide support, like almost all of Capcom's awful PC ports. Oh, there is btw also no pause in this game. If you want to go to toilet or whatever, bad luck, you have to keep the game running or restart from checkpoint. Marvelous game design.

Anyway, if I were you, just skip the game since its easily the worst main Resident Evil game. Story is alright but I wouldn't play it more than once, also because it really drags on with the 4 characters. Maybe they can make a decent game out of it if they remake it in ~10 years lmao.",1680802644,1680802859,False,3,0,0.51890033483505249,0,True,False,False

It features chris, leon, ada, Sherry (from Re2), and new characters helena, jake, piers. 

Just be aware that It's going to be vastly different from all the previous entries. Lots of cinematic scenes, qte and gameplay made with coop in mind, 4 campaigns that are connected. 

Some maps from re6 were copied and used in revelations 2 raid mode, so if you played it first you might experiance deja vu. 

At first this game didn't reel me in, once I completed my first chapter 5 I was hooked. Each campaign ends with an epic boss fight. 

Leon's campaign provides an experiance that is more on the horror side. Has locations like cementary, church, [spoiler] sewers [/spoiler] 

Jake's campaign provides the most challenge. The chemistry between jake and Sherry was wholesome. 

Chris had the best campaign in my opinion. Both in terms of gameplay and story.

Ada's campaign is meant to be played last as it ties all the loose ends together.

Overall it might not be the best resident evil title, and it left me with some mixed feelings, however it was a fun game.",1680741615,1680741615,True,47,3,0.79475933313369751,0,True,False,False

It seems Capcom tried to please every kind of player by making one campaign for horror (Leon's), one for action (Chris - this one looks like Call of Duty) and one mixed (Jake's).

It's nice to finally be able to move normally, and it lets the enemies have more aggressive tendencies besides ""walk at player"" and ""Walk at player but a little faster."" The updated melee system really feels like an evolution of the systems introduced in Resident Evil 4, and the options on offer allow you to change even how bullets are spawned from your position, allowing you to experience the game in a more classic way with a laser that shows you a perfect bullet trajectory and allows for faster followup shots (RE4 and 5) or something more akin to the modern RE-Releases, with a crosshair and center dot, with bullets spawning from the center of your screen rather than your gun's barrel. Each has its own ups and downs, pros and cons, and it can be fun to experience the game with both types of aiming. It's legitimately something really small, but really well implemented that adds extra avenues for replayability, and player comfort.

RE6, and Resident evil Outbreak/File #2 are the only three games that really made me feel like the developers appreciated the players and wanted to make as deep of an experience as mechanically possible, and it shows in the sheer amount of mobility and options the player has at any given time.",1680673534,1680673534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have completed the Leon quest line and can comfortably say this game is absolutely Garbage... abundance over substance for sure, in the final chapter you battle the same F*cking boss 6 times in different encounters or different forms.. you kill him.. kill him and kill him some more but he keeps some how reappearing.. wtf seriously, the game is basically one large quick time or cut scene... f*cking boring and no a horror action at all... just terrible all around I think its a 3/10 now that I beat a full run...

ORIGINAL POST

Resident Evil 6

Rather get munched by a zombie!!!

This game didn't capture me like the previous great games of old, so far nothing beat RE4

The shooting feels very fast paced now and ammo is more freely found, takes away the feeling of every shot counts and survival over killing everything.

Overall I got as far as I could before throwing in the towel, I have completed every RE game.. even RE5 and just could not find the energy to keep going.

I hate this game. If you like this game, that's fine, more power to ya, but I don't. Now, I hate this game for one specific reason. If Capcom miraculously fixed this issue, I would rate this game similarly to RE5. 

RE6 LOVES to constantly take control away from the player. 

For example, you'll be playing with a friend in say, Leon's campaign. You'll be fighting monsters, doing your thing, when suddenly the game jumpcuts to a scene of a door opening, or a monster appearing or something flying through a window or a car crashing or a building blowing up. It's constantly doing this, like every few minutes and it unironically gives me a migraine.

I can put up with the dumb story, and the bad voice acting, and the repetitive gameplay, but this seriously is one of the only games in my library that succeeds in making me feel physically ill. I would equate it to the type of nausea people feel when they're having a bad experience in VR. To add insult to injury, the game is LOOOONNNNNG. Like 30 hours long.

To be fair, there's some stuff that's cool here. I like the movement quite a bit. Being able to manually dodge attacks is pretty fun and I wish this feature made its way into other games in the future. But good god, I'm so tired of forcing myself to take a Tylenol before firing this up.",1528003777,1679515203,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- Leon and Helena (Easy)

- Chris and Piers (Easy - Normal)

- Sherry and Jake (Normal - Hard)

Well, I think this game was kinda acceptable at the release time. But now, when remakes of the classic PS1 games are out, it just looks and feels like garbage.

Inventory. It's size is small and this is OK since it's an action game. You don't need to store several key items or burn corpses so they wouldn't revive. But accessing it is inconvenient. When you mix herbs and use them, you create pills. Each one of them restores 1 point of health out of 6. If you want to heal for, let's say, 5 points, you need to push the healing button 5 times and wait for the animation to complete. That's quite annoying, especially in the middle of a fight with a crowd (which happens often in this game). Why couldn't it be like in the earlier games? The only way to restore full health is to use a medical spray. And you have to choose it by scrolling the item menu. The same is with weapons and grenades. You waste too much time while going through all the stuff to choose one specific item. This often gets you damaged and knocked or even killed. I got taken down many times trying to choose a grenade to erase a whole enemy pack. No quick access or at least a pause menu access. No real pause at all because this game is cooperative.

Controls. Camera and movement are clunky. The character turns like he doesn't really want to. It's substantial during some chasing episodes (for example, the one in China with Chris and Piers). When you dodge in the rear direction, you character stays on the ground and doesn't get up automatically which confused shit out of me a couple of times. Dodging is stiff and somewhat hard to use, I don't even know why.

Campaigns. I've seen only two of them and fully completed only the one with Leon and Helena. It's first half feels like an average Resident Evil game with slow zombies, some puzzles here and and there, exploring the laboratoies and traversing the ancient catacombs below the church with a graveyard. Of course it's not like in the earlier games because this is a linear shooter, but it's decent. Then goes the absurd festival. Leon and Helena cannot even take a break during the second half of the campaign. Anytime they try to use an elevator, a transport, anything, it explodes and makes them run. After they escape the danger, there is another rushed segment with crushes and explosions or several stages of a bossfight (and all of that with several annoying QTEs that the most of players will fail multiple times). Yeah, all Resident Evil games ended up with a countdown when everything exploded and the final fight took place, but not in such prolonged and exaggerated manner. The second half of the campaign literally resembles an indian movie.

As for the Chris and Piers campaign, I couldn't endure much of it. It's an utterly boring shooting ground with uninteresting enemies. Some of them are total bullet sponges and the only thing you need to defeat them is to throw your entire inventory at them. This gameplay is repetitive as hell, there is no gunplay like in RE 2 Remake or RE 3 Remake where different enemies are better to kill with one weapon rather than another. Many times the game will make you stay on the position and fight flooding waves of enemies. But it won't give you enough ammo for all of them. I ended up helpless plenty of times during these segments. And even if I managed to find a breakable box, there would be no ammo, only points. Yeah, experience points to buy perks. What is this? A tabletop RPG? These perks contribute almost nothing to your gameplay and it takes huge amount of time to obtain some of them. I don't need those point, I just want to complete the game. But the segment that made me drop the game is the chasing section in China. It was so hard to move there with such clumsy controls. I failed it many times. The one single time I almost succeded, the bot companion failed it LOL. It seems the game itself suffers to pass its own shit LOL.

Is this a good action game? No. Is this a good Resident Evil installment? Well, there's been worse. If you are interested in the plot, just watch it on YouTube. Several times I tried to complete this game and didn't finish it. And I'm not going to. I just wanted to play it while waiting for Resident Evil 4 Remake.

I like this game, the controls feel fantastic, its very responsive and its extremely fun without breaking the flow of the game. As a fan of older titles, the story is.... Its quite funny, it tries so hard to take itself seriously, and expects you to as well, I genuinely cannot, and I don't think you can either, fan or not.

The best way I can describe how the controls feel, is it feels like a mix between Resident Evil and Devil May Cry, I tend to call it Devil May Evil, or Resident May Cry.  Grab this on a sale, well worth the mercenaries experience, and if you have a friend the story is fun to play too.

I can't really compare this game to any other game in the series because of how much it feels disconnected, but I cannot deny how much fun I had playing it.

Normally, I wouldn't recommend an experience like this based on its name and what I see ""Resident Evil"" as, but ultimately, its a fun little romp through a funny story that tries so hard and fails at every turn.",1679080599,1679080599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 6 places you in the usual apocalyptic situation our protagonists somehow find themselves in. Unlike previous games, you have four separate stories to play through, all of which are intertwined in some way with each other.

I'll start with the negatives, as there are quite a few. First, the game's story is completely ridiculous at times. It has its good moments every now and then (especially at the end of Chris' campaign), but most of the time it feels confusing and really weird. It can get hard to follow as well. This is most likely because the game attempted to lean on action instead of horror while also trying to do horror, leaving it a muddled mess.

Second, the actual campaign flow for each campaign is horrendous. Large quiet sections often drag the game on while action sections come one after another, never really letting up (this is actually a positive which I will get into later). This is probably because they focused on making four separate campaigns instead of just one really good one, making each campaign feel half-baked in a sense (this is not the fault of the developers, more the fault of the people who actually set the deadlines).

Finally going back to the story, it doesn't really end on a single note. Thanks to it being split into multiple campaigns, the game relies on the final one to tie everything together. This results in the final campaign feeling really awkward and ending on a ""okay, so what?"" kind of note.

Okay so me saying all of this and still giving it a positive review must tell you that there's something else this game has going for it. And there is.

The gameplay.

Of any Resident Evil game, RE6 has the most engaging combat I've seen. From RE4 and RE5, the characters can still shoot enemies in their weakpoints and use melee attacks to deal extra damage. However there are so many more controls in RE6. You can dash and ram into enemies to stagger them. You can melee enemies to deliver a second blow with a powerful melee attack. You can slide into enemies to stagger them. You can dodge-roll to the side or backwards to evade attacks. You can even counter enemy attacks to deal heavy damage, often out-right killing the enemy. And there are far more controls than that that would take a long time to list out. There's a reason this game is said to have the best mercenaries mode. In fact, the game is best played foregoing your gun in favour of melee attacks against regular enemies (even on the highest difficulty and with infinite ammo).

This is why I believe the best way to play this game is not treat it as a Resident Evil game at all. Sure, as one it's terrible. But as a stand-alone game, it is a fantastic action game with a decent action-based story to go with it. There are still those really slow moments, sure, but when the game gets going, it gets going.

This is especially true on the highest difficulty, where the game pulls no punches. On Professional or No Hope, you are expected to display constant mastery of the game's controls or else you WILL be annihilated. It's an exhilarating experience to complete a chapter on one of the highest difficulties, especially with someone else helping out.

All in all, Resident Evil 6 fails hard as a Resident Evil game. It lacks the horror, resource management, and good story-telling that made the foundations of far better Resident Evil games like RE4 and RE7. However as its own thing, RE6 is a brilliant action game which shows you that when there's a zombie ahead and you have a gun, the best solution is to punch it in the face and break its spine. The game has a semi-decent story, and the difficulties allow both casual and experienced players to have a challenge to measure themselves up to.

First off, let's talk about the gameplay. Yes, it's true that Resident Evil 6 is more action-oriented than previous entries in the franchise, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The combat is fast-paced and satisfying, with a wide variety of weapons and moves at your disposal. Each of the three campaigns has its own unique gameplay style, which keeps things fresh and interesting throughout the game. Now, let's talk about the story. I'll admit, it's not the most coherent or well-written story out there, but it's still a fun ride. The game ties together multiple plotlines and characters in a way that's ambitious and impressive, even if it doesn't always make complete sense. And let's not forget about the iconic Resident Evil villains, who make their return in memorable ways.

One thing that's often overlooked about Resident Evil 6 is its production values. The game looks fantastic, with detailed and immersive environments that are a joy to explore. The voice acting is also top-notch, with some truly standout performances from the cast. But perhaps the most underrated aspect of Resident Evil 6 is its replay value. With multiple campaigns to play through and a wide variety of unlockables and collectibles, there's plenty of content here to keep you coming back for more. And let's not forget about the game's multiplayer modes, which offer even more opportunities for fun and mayhem.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 6 may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's a game that deserves more credit than it gets. With its fast-paced combat, ambitious storyline, and impressive production values, this is a game that's well worth your time.

Compared to other RE titles, Resident Evil 6 is the one I have the most mixed feelings with. While RE6 is a [b]highly[/b] entertaining action-based game with high replay value, it is plagued by a mediocre plot, aggravating UI + set pieces, and an overly action-saturated atmosphere with meek attempts at horror in which I would find it hard-pressed to call this game the ""dramatic horror experience of 2013.""

[u]Story + Characters (Possible Spoilers!)[/u]

Oh man, the story. Resident Evil plots aren't known for being the best, but this has be one of the most convoluted and ridiculous plots I have ever seen.

The entire plotline of RE6 can be described as follows: [spoiler]A leader of an Illuminati-like organization becomes a simp for Ada after a brief business relationship and clones her using one of his staff. Fake Ada is created and gets pissed at him for using her as an experiment, seeking revenge and setting the world on fire as a bonus.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]This entire story is not only generic but it is irrelevant to the entire storyline of Resident Evil. None of the villains, Carla and Simmons, are really mentioned at all before this game and after. They just show up as if we're supposed to know them and care. Regarding the separate campaigns, it's a mixed bag. Leon's campaign is irrelevant, Chris' campaign is okay, Jake's campaign is pretty good, and Ada's campaign feels like it's there to just point out why all this insanity happens. If you wanna understand the whole plot, Ada's story does the best at telling it.[/spoiler]

[u]Gameplay[/u]

RE6's strongest point is definitely the gameplay. Compared to other action titles, RE6 is almost always fun thanks to the amount of fluidity you're given with your movement. Sprinting, dashing, sliding, countering, melee attacks, quick shooting - there are an insane amount of ways to move about and play this game. Capcom really went all out with making as many possible mechanics with how the player can move and attack. It can take a good amount of time to master RE6's movement system, but it's a joy to feel in absolute control when you do. 

Among the three action-era RE games, I would say I have the most fun playing RE6. It's also the best one to play Co-op online or split-screen.

Each character has a unique mechanic they have so none of them feel the same even if it's pretty minor. Leon can dual wield, Helena has a unique shotgun which has unique quick shot animations, Chris has ample firepower at the beginning despite being among the most generic, Piers has the best starting weapon set among everyone with his MP-AF and Anti-Material Rifle, Jake's Hand-to-Hand is among the most fun to use, Sherry has access to a Stun Rod and a burst-fire pistol, and Ada can use her crossbow along with unique dashing and quick shot animations.

There are still some serious problems here though: first, the camera is atrociously bad because not only is it slow and hampered by terrible angles, the game will sometimes wring control of the camera to hyperfocus on an event happening which gets tiring really quick. These moments are most prominent in the Chris and Jake campaigns. Second, the QTEs. It's already been said, but there really are too many of them in this game; it feels like 40% of the game is just QTEs, some of which aren't even deadly if you fail. Third, the design of the set pieces; for some reason, there are so many parts in this game where all you do is run/sprint forward or you die - it happens so often, you will die more from these than actual enemies taking your health down. Again, these are found most in either Chris' or Jake's campaign. Lastly, the UI is not that great since it feels like you're supposed to use the interface while multitasking on the move which adds more burden to the lightning fast pace at which this game makes you play at.

[u]Graphics & Sound[/u]

I found the music in RE6 to be serviceable, but not groundbreaking. It is just there and the differences in music between the campaigns is trivial. They tried to get some kind of horror-like feeling from the main theme but that sort of contradicts with the action-saturated environment of the game. All in all, mildly average.

Comparing this with RE5, it seems like RE6 downgraded in graphics compared to past titles and it's a shame that some of the details of this game are average at best even for a 2013 game. Outside of cutscenes, much of the graphics of the game feel second-rate.

[u]Conclusion[/u]

When it comes to any game, the most important part for me is that it's fun to play. If it's not, what's the point? In that area, RE6 succeeds. It's among the most entertaining Resident Evil games I've played and even more so when you play it with a friend. That being said, the mishmash of problems from the story to some of the gameplay properties mark it as a ""black sheep"" among Resident Evil major titles.

I would only recommend this game if you're the kind of RE fan who prefers action horror over survival horror and can enjoy the fast-paced gameplay without being ticked off by its flaws.

This game has some of the most fun and intense sequences out of any game I've ever played. The co-op is genuinely fun and engaging. Capcom really needs to bring back co-op into the franchise, it became so synonymous with it and then it just disappeared. 

Don't get me wrong, this game is uneven, that's what happens when there's a whole 3 separate teams working on the project. But when everything falls into the right place, which does happen frequently, Resident Evil 6 really excels. Your move-list and options is so expansive, the best of players will go through the game looking like John Wick. The crossover missions were genuinely so exciting when this game first came out, almost turning into Monster Hunter with how epic things got.

AND THE MERCENARIES OH MY SWEET LORD. Mercenaries is so good in this game that they could just sell it standalone and it'd be so awesome. Mercenaries is so underappreciated, it literally is infinite playtime. Mercs sucked so bad in RE8 and it had no reason to, like just look at the foundation this game made. The only problem with Mercs in this one is they should have really let you play with 4 people, especially on No Mercy mode.  

Resident Evil 6 is a great game plagued by a horrible reputation for no good reason. This isn't a hindsight thing either, I've played this game since it first came out in 2012. I had it on PS3, then on Xbox 360, then finally got it here. I probably have like a thousand hours combined for this game across all platforms. 

This game is insane value from a modern standpoint. This game really has it all, even an actually fun PvP suite. This game got it right a decade ago when Capcom nowadays always fumbles and fails with modern attempts to make a competitive Resident Evil game. Survivors, Onslaught, Siege, and Predator are all dumb fun and none of the RE: Verse or Resistance crap hold a candle to them. 

Do yourself a favor. Buy this game, play it for yourself. Hell, get some of your friends to get it too and I guarantee you all will have so much fun you will keep coming back to this game over the years like I do.

It's a great co-op game because it handles well; the controls are actually really good in my opinion. Many sections require you to coordinate with your partner, so you have a good amount of interactions that keeps the game entertaining. The plot in general is over-the-top in just the right way so that it's fun to witness its absurdity with someone else. It's true that [i]everything[/i] is more fun with friends, but this is one of the more fun games I've played with friends.

Now, the issue with this game is that it was designed exactly for that: co-op. Single-player turns your partner into an invincible AI that never misses any inputs that otherwise plays decently well. You have to make very few decisions; you get every weapon and the only time you have to do any inventory management is when you have too much ammo. Upgrades are dumbed down to having three level 1-3 skills equipped, with each skill doing something like generally raising the damage with your guns, reduce damage taken, raising damage versus zombies, etc. which is drastically different from even RE5. The plot isn't particularly interesting and gets more confusing than anything; the confusion worked fine in co-op because we're focused on the co-op experience but it's not very entertaining alone (although, I will say that some of the cutscenes are still iconic in a good way)

The flaws that make this a mediocre single-player game at best is also what makes it a good co-op game.",1677425352,1677425352,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]Resident Evil 6[/i] is a shooter action game. To tell the story of this game, we'll assume that the first half of the Jake-Sherry and Chris-Piers campaigns chronicle the incidents of Neo-Umbrella. The plot takes place in Edonia. Sherry Birkin is sent for the extraction of Jake Muller, whose blood from him will grant the preparation of a vaccine against the C virus. Meanwhile, Chris Redfield and Piers Nivans are sent to region where a civil war has broken out, since locals are using bio-organic weapons. For all four characters, Carla Radames —or blue Ada— will be involved in both events: the capture of Jake and Sherry as well as the death of the BSSA members of Chris's team. 

[i]Six months will pass[/i]. Adam Benford, the President of the United States, is infected and becomes a zombie. He wanted to reveal the true events of Raccoon City so The Family conspired against him. Leon S. Kennedy and Helena Harper are blamed for his death. They'll investigate the wrongdoer is Derek Simmons. While the real Ada Wong —or red Ada— will clear her name. Now the conclusion of each of the stories in couples will take place in China. Each one will hand over the antagonist the deserved outcome.

Perhaps combination of parallel stories is not a bad idea. Only screenwriters should know how to weave cross paths applying knowledge of narrative time. This Resident Evil tries to go further in the usual narrative by rummaging for an innovative story. A different way of relating shared events to break the traditional scheme of how to tell a story. On this occasion there are four stories that intertwine with each other. The game's problem was tightly weaving four stories with seven characters: New and well-known, without giving the new ones a possibility to grow narratively. We have that gap of six months, a meaningless abyss. There is an obligation to appear in those moments where stories intersect, it offers a forced scenario for four characters. 

By having that abyss in story, as well as the characters change their temperament due to time elapsed, that's how visual art unfolded. On the one hand, the locations were created before six months. There the urban landscape of Edonia sunk in war and winter predominates. So white scale with illumination is displayed. After a certain time, the locations are opposite, with that impression that something bad happened. The urban landscape is recommenced but is set in the dark. It offers an urban air through common sites that goes to skyscrapers. However, design and photography are poor and vague. Skyscrapers look dull or blurry. It doesn't have a good treatment of textures in the objects. Few places predominate by level of design, quality and appealing detail. Not forgetting the design of the enemies, new and strange, some are colossal.

[b]Playability[/b] 7/10

If narrative wants to break with typical scheme, it happens in same way with the gameplay. The purpose of this game is to keep the player focused on the action without missing a beat. Quick time events will be involved. For those who don't know: it is an interactive cinematic. It consists of pressing certain buttons at a certain time to avoid instant death. Although there are actions with more button combinations. To this is added the change of involuntary camera or involuntary views. The player will look at the scene from a different perspective —although sometimes it tends to confuse perspective for movement, for example, the forward button is overridden to use the walk back button.

The game emphasizes teamwork. It's recommended to play with a friend. There are certain moments in the plot it requires the help of the partner, so we'll temporarily separate into small [i]separate paths[/i]. The purpose: to help each other to continue progressing in story. Something new that is added is stamina for melee attacks. These attacks also allow interaction with the weak points of enemies in order to finish them off. However, depending on our way of playing, the game offers the possibility of choosing skills. We can choose three of them, with which they will give us certain advantages in the game: such as greater stamina, damage, resistance and others. Some skills can be upgraded by points. The enemies will drop [i]chess pieces[/i] — as well herb, ammo, c4 and grenades— that have point value. Finally, each duo- character will find and use different weapons than the other pairs. The combination of herbs prevails. There are constant checkpoints. The player will have more movement options: roll, slide, crouch, cover and the variety of combination melee attack; inasmuch as game is saturated with constant action.

[b]Music and FX[/b] 8/10

The game's soundtrack is interesting, long and distinct. The music reinforces drama of the game. The musical pieces are composed in the form of a suite. What is different is that representative drama of the music expresses action instead of terror. It's a soundtrack with many pieces of music based on melodies and openings of action movies. So we'll listen to musical pieces accentuating the characters and their development in form of clash and raid. Each of them will have a different rhythm and tempo; but in the end, listening to the substance of melody, it becomes continuous whose harmony leans more towards bright tones than rejects dark tones. Although over time it becomes repetitive, exhausting and irksome.

The soundtrack was composed by: Wataru Hachisako, Akihiko Narita, Thomas Parisch, Laurent Zilian, just to mention a few. The main soundtrack that we'll perceive in the story is composed of orchestral music. Although segment of strings, percussions and trumpets frequently stands out. The musical compositions express energy, impetus and vigour. But it lacks emotions and feelings, forcing this music only for the incessant combat. The music avoids sympathy with the characters. Its purpose is to give a shove to continue with the story. Perhaps there are some minimal, barely perceptible contrasts, such as slowness and adagios. Since the rest of the music corresponds to a soundtrack for a movie dominated with verve of action. The music wants to give us a breather in appearance, but suddenly changes to be immersive in action.

[b]Duration[/b] 8/10

As the game seems to have narrative conflicts, one might think that one should start with Leon's campaign. Which offers a tutorial on how to play it. There was no need to add a prologue. It's a good idea start with some introductory steps, but it leads to temporary narrative confusion about how it all started. However, this keeps us tied to the game to learn a little more about the story. It forces us to play each campaign in order to intertwine the narrative.

The game features four campaigns. Each one with 5 chapters. As it is action game, some chapters are played nippily, and others are unappetizing. It's suitable to play it with someone, since that way the game becomes more interactive. It's re-playable, each new game the skills that we choose just like weapons are saved. Or, we can play in different difficulties. The game contains two modes of mercenary. As a rarely played versus mode is also included. If you like action and are curious about this game, I recommend playing it with a friend. That way you will feel constant action at every moment.

The UI is terrible, in fact it might be the worst UI I've ever encountered. This is especially true because you can't pause the game when accessing the menu which is moronic. The QTE nonsense quickly becomes tiresome as well as the constant cutscenes.

The controls/gameplay just feel stiff and clunky for the type of game it's trying to be. There are plenty of action FPS games which are far more fluid and enjoyable to play so I'm not sure what they were thinking with this sequel. The camera angles are terrible, the levels linear, and the pacing is awful. Either it's unbearably slow such as in the beginning where you are forced to walk or wait on others, or you're being rushed through area after area.

The artificial difficulty is beyond irritating. The aiming sucks and you have to purchase 'skills' for it as well as weapon damage and other things which cost a lot of skill points and can only be purchased between chapters. There's no reason it should take 10+ headshots to down a normal zombie AFTER I already blew it up with a damn fire extinguisher while others can go down with a few, or that an enemy outside of a building can lunge and instead of hitting the side of the building manage to fly through a window and grab you when you're standing a few feet away. The melee sucks and I got sick of kicking air instead of stomping on a downed zombie's head, and of course afterwards you get grabbed and fall to the ground. Dropped items will disappear on you as well. In the graveyard there are multiple pits dug in the ground and scattered about, if you walk near them you magically slide into them even if you're 1-2 feet away. Granted once you realize that it's not too hard to avoid but that was the final straw for me as I was already irritated. 

The game freezes up when exiting and won't display anything else besides the black screen even when alt+tabing or bringing up the task manager, so you have to blindly use the arrow keys and the delete button to end the task for the game in the task manager after selecting it, while it stays behind the black screen.",1676547353,1676548007,False,16,5,0.618093430995941162,7,True,False,False

Which is a completely valid critique, but it doesn't make this game itself a bad game. RE6 is really neat for introducing a more controllable melee mechanic, stamina to go with it, and just a ton of cool stuff for the player to do. Keyboard controls don't feel too great when you sprint around because the camera freaks out with it, but aside from that once you hit the flow with the controls you're all set. There's slightly more analysis on characters and how their past may be affecting them, or how they may be spiraling downwards because of outside forces which is an interesting take and a slight change from what we normally get from RE protags. Leon's campaign is the overarching campaign that fits basically the whole story and the others fill in the gaps.

The mechanics of this game is more or less identical to re5, but worse. We had encountered so many problems with doors and the game just shitting itself that we had to reinstall 3 times. There were times when the player hosting had to be the one that opened and interacted with all the objects or else the game would soft lock. An absolutely horrendous experience and these problems caused us to take a month break before completing the game.

Other problems include the default key mapping and the controls. Who in the right mind would put interact and sprint on the same key? The mouse and character movement was also horrible. The overall movement felt clunky even with a controller, mostly due to insanely wide turning radius and extremely slow character movement. And when using mouse there were times where the cursor would snap behind you after an interaction and cause a death.

Next is the story and how fast paced and boring it was. The characters were so flat and predictable and the action sequences was something my 14 year old sister would be able to think up. Me and my friend started betting on what action sequence would happen next and we would get it right every single time. The story was so repetitive and stereotypical that it showcases what little thought was put into these multiple story modes.

The Ada campaign especially was so hastily put together and barley works with co-op play that there were parts where it would literally crash the game due to the second player begin in front of Ada in the load sequences. The Sherry campaign was literally the most boring and contained basically nothing new story or gameplay wise. The Leon campaign wasn't that bad but it felt especially slow, and the Chris campaign (honestly the best one) started off slow and ended way too fast. 

To conclude, the writing is weirdly paced and gameplay is clunky. The only memorable part of the game is the Chris campaign and that is mostly due to the relationship between Piers and Chris which both me and my friend felt was the most genuine and heartfelt. Still a fairly fun game, but its probably not worth completing more than two story lines. And since I didn't play solo I can't imagine how bad the AI partner would be if its anything like re5.",1675721957,1675721957,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Game starts directly without going into the main menu first. I hate that.

- FOV is adjustable (yay!) but the value ranges from 0 to 15. What is that? Can't they write it properly? Presumably it means something like 60-80.

- Brightness adjustment is impossible, since the '6' in the adjustment screen is always visible even when the game itself stops being visible. This setting needs to be maxed. (In all other games the default middle value works best for me.)

- Every action in ingame cutscenes needs to be approved of by pressing a button with the most pointless QTEs (no danger, just opening a door needs timed button press).

- Terrible ingame options menu with non-sense icons where you need to hover over to know what it is. Icons can be clicked but value is only adjustable via keyboard.

- Bright light flashes with cheap SFX when QTE is performed, not very immersive.

- Aiming unprecise and wobbly, mouse acceleration can't be turned off.

- Bad acting, embarrassing writing, non-sense story. (Leon talks to the zombie-president like he doesn't know what a zombie is.)

- Zombies don't die from headshot, Kung-Fu-Fighting is more effective and makes their heads explode. They also side-step to dodge bullets.

!!! SPOILERS AHEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!

So far I've played only Leon's and Chris's routes but this game already got me head over heels for it. It's one of the best older RE games for me. Controls are a bit wonky but you get used to it really quickly with fast-paced action and combat shooting at you from every fucking angle...
Leon's route was great, I really loved seeing him once again older and with new priorities. But this review will be mostly about Chris's route - which is the main reason you should play the game.
His story was just breathtaking !!! I love how he changed thanks to Piers <best boi and best ship lemme tell ya!>. I enjoyed combat with my best friend, thanks to remote play. Pro-tip: grab yourself a friend and play it together - it's really fun ! 
Story-wise the game was awesome and made me freakin' cry again.... Also, gotta love the playground easter egg iykyk.
So far so good, the gameplay and graphics may be a little outdated but this doesn't make the game bad - just a bit more challenging. I feel like the difficulty here was really high <i've played only on normal/veteran and it was hell, literally> and well... I'm not complaining ig-
So yeah ! The game's freakin awesome, totally recommend it <3

SPOILERS START HERE !!!

Goddamn Capcom if you don't bring Piers back- 
He was literally the best character I've witnessed in this game. I loved how he and Chris were always helping eachother out. I wish Piers would've went with Chris, fr I feel like BSAA would have a vaccine or sth to help our boy :c

[h1] THE GOOD (BUT NOT THE BEST): [/h1]

- STORY: due to me not interested that much in horror and gore, this is actually okay. Yeah it deviated so much from the RE DNA, but this game is purposely made to continue the story of every character. Maybe u don't agree with me, but that's what I experience for myself. I will hold to an argument that this game is just a carbon copy of Michael Bay films still.

- PERFORMANCE: Game is made in MT Framework, which is a flawed engine from 1990s, texture and env is low-res, but credit to characters textures, bcos that looks good!!! I am able to play this game on AMD Ryzen 6600H, with sometimes small dips in fps, even that is because I'm recording my gameplay.

- TIMELINE: In timeline panel, you can actually see which character and which date in-story is their cutscene, which is GOOD. It's like flowchart but it's linear and character splitted.

[h1] THE BAD: [/h1]

- ACCESSIBILITY: This game is an accessibility NIGHTMARE. Settings DON'T pause the game!!! Who decided to do this crap??? If u want to pause, you need to press START. Like WTH man!!??

- ACCESSIBILITY_2: Settings icon on UI, but description on the subtitle??? I had to move my eyes frequently to see what every settings do. And the icon is not the one which widely used and recognised by the world, its their custom made one, which is BS at its best. A perspectively-PDA style of settings is stylish and all, but it is hard to see. Make UI as plain and easy to see and read PLEASE!!!

- QTE and Interact: QTE UI is bullcrap for this game. Interaction is not shown until you came near interactibles, which is an A-hole design at its best.

- DIRECTIONS: Maps man, maps. People use maps for navigation. Why do it in PDA super hi-tech style??? Make me nauseous and add unnecessary animations.

 high variety of weapons that are forced into your inventory means you're constantly out of space, shotguns feel very underwhelming, you're showered in ammo in a campaign that's supposed to be more survival-horror, and have no ammo in a campaign that's supposed to be more action shooter focused. Jake's campaign where melee is supposed to be the main theme majority of enemies are ranged and close range attacks don't feel comfortable to use. ""puzzles"" in this game are basically ""collect 3 of these things that are randomly scattered"". bosses are almost always underwhelming.

Columbo then aired less frequently on ABC from 1989 to 2003.

Columbo is a shrewd but inelegant blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat, unassuming demeanor, cigar, old Peugeot 403 car,[4][5][6] love of chili con carne, and unseen wife (whom he mentions frequently). He often leaves a room only to return with the catchphrase ""Just one more thing"" to ask a critical question.

The character and show, created by Richard Levinson and William Link, popularized the inverted detective story format (sometimes referred to as a ""howcatchem""). This genre begins by showing the commission of the crime and its perpetrator; the plot therefore usually has no ""whodunit"" element of determining which of several suspects committed the crime. It instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed.

The series' homicide suspects are often affluent members of high society; it has led some critics to see class conflict as an element of each story.[7] Suspects carefully cover their tracks and are initially dismissive of Columbo's circumstantial speech and apparent ineptitude. They become increasingly unsettled as his superficially pestering behavior teases out incriminating evidence.[7] His relentless approach often leads to self-incrimination or outright confession.

Episodes of Columbo are between 70 and 98 minutes long, and have been broadcast in 44 countries. The show has been described by the BBC as ""timeless"" and remains popular today.[8]",1674888660,1674888660,True,2,0,0.511945366859436035,0,True,False,False

This game gets a lot of hate from die-hard fans for a good reason. no, it doesn't feel like a resident evil game. It's supposed to be dark, a lingering fear of what's around the corner, anxiety inducing from lack of ammunition, and music that makes you feel eerie.

Resident Evil 6 has none of that. The game has 4 total campaigns and Leon's story is the closest you get to that feeling.

However, it's one of my most favorite Co-op experiences that you're gonna make great memories with a friend.

Each story offers a different flavor but ultimately tie into each other:
Leon's campaign: The darkest of the bunch. Offers a great story of finding the cause of the bio-terrorist attack.
Chris's Campaign: Your typical run & gun 3rd-person military shooter. Chris is tasked with eliminating the BOW's of the attack. If you want action, this is it!
Jake's Campaign: This mode is meant for people with Scopophobia (The fear of being stalked). Jake's story takes him on a mission to cure the virus, but is relentlessly hunted by a HULK looking brute monster that's been tasked with killing him.
Ada's Campaign: Unlocked after completing all the campaigns. This story just a filler that ties up unanswered questions gives more back story.

I also wanna mention how awesome the boss fights are in this game. Very intense and cinematic.

The developers tried to satisfy old fans, bring in new fans, and appeal to shooter fanatics. It didn't make a true resident evil game. But if you can get past the RE mindset, your gonna have a fantastic time playing this game with a friend.

The story sucks,it's just fanfic level of writing with so many dumb decisions,so many wasted ideas and just overall it feels like it keeps draggin on and on and refuses to end.

So yeah don't buy this game unless yer like me and want to own every resident evil game,even then just buy it on a discount or a key site,not worth the money.",1673693987,1673693987,False,1,2,0.5,0,True,False,False

I think the worst Resident Evil game is 5, hands down. If you got through that one, I think this one is better in every way. Better story, better gameplay, and better set pieces for sure.

I played it on Easy to minimize deaths because I hate having to repeat parts in shooters, and for me at least that ended up being a good call.

Pros
- 4 ~5 hour long campaigns that play like self contained stories
- Story is not amazing, but I found it pretty interesting
- Really cool set pieces
- Sections with different styles of gameplay (vehicles, for example)

Cons
- The default FOV made me motion sick (I have only felt this way in playing VR games with low frame rates and don’t normally get motion sick in any other games) and it can only be changed at the main menu, not in-game
- Even with “fixing” the FOV, the camera jerks around quite a bit through each campaign and at times I found myself still feeling a little dizzy
- Some fights feel really long
- Lots of quick time events that will end up killing you if you miss them
- Some segments where you die if you don’t move fast enough, and you end up dying excessively trying to memorize these parts
- Little to know horror or atmospheric stuff
- Very few puzzles (maybe 1 or 2 good ones in 20 hours)

While there is a lot to forgive, and this game doesn’t provide the survival horror that I love about the series, it really has a lot of fun moments. The four campaigns overlap some, which leads to the story being told in fragments which is kind of fun to piece together. It may not be the best Resident Evil game, but it is a good game, and it is definitely fun.

But after finishing all the campaign and definitely not feeling wasted any time, guess it's fair that I give it a praise.
Overall speaking:
Story 9/10
Gameplay 5/10
Control 2.5/10
Music 5/10
Graphic 7/10 

As you may have seen, story is almost the sole reason I recommend this game, but it's really worth it.
I completed the remastered version of RE2 and RE3, watched the gameplay of RE0 and RE1, played RE7 half-way, and I say the story of this is WAY better than any other story experience I have in other games in the same series. In fact it's been a long time since I got really absorbed into a game story.
There are four campaigns, same story from 4 perspective. If you only play one campaign you might feel ah that's how the story plays, but then you play another campaign you're suddenly very puzzled by the apparent total contradiction in the plot. Each story (except Ada's, which you should definitely play last) contains some mysteries and some solutions to the other campaigns, wonderfully fit into each other. Really well written.

Now come the shitty part-the gameplay. I don't know why it makes you so hard to simply save the game. ""Checkpoints"" save nothing, and you CANNOT pause the game, like wtf. Once I opened the keybind screen, and since the game doesn't stop some monsters came out of nowhere to attack me but I cannot leave the screen because ""there are keys not bind yet"" like wtf. If I want a game that I simply cannot pause I would find a PvP online game. Despite it's from a 1st person perspective most of the time, sometimes it gets your angle fixed, in order to let you see the stuff in the background--most of the time this happens when you have to RUN AWAY from a threat. So now you have to run for your life, but then the last second you were pressing W to run forward, 5 seconds later you gotta press A to run forward, and then another 5 seconds later you press S---are you fkin kidding me.

Music itself is barely passable, nothing bad but nothing impressive either.

Its one of those games that if you go in with low expectations, you'll probably enjoy it. The game feels like it was supposed to be the epic finale of the series as its tie-ing up all the loose ends from prior games, four separate campaigns showing different perspectives and events with fan favorite characters,  a coop experience with your friends or  family,  a revamped inventory system designed for convenience,  cutscenes galore , tons of zombie types,  high stakes action, and also trying to setup a sequel for jake.  And while it does deliver on some of this, all the different elements tend to strech the game and story a bit thin and makes the game a 'on the rails resident evil experience' like you would find at an arcade.  The co-op feature (which is heavily emphasized) is laughably bad as two people need to press 'v' to open a door, or one has to turn a lever while the other runs around, or easy to mess up confusing quick time events ; and while those things aren't all that bad.. the game will also randomly change camera angles causing you to die,  or the areas are so small and limited there isn't much for more than one person to do.  The inventory system is sorta convenient... once you figure out how to use it.  The best elements of the games are the cutscenes, getting to know all the characters a little more with their individual stories, and the over the top corny action.  If you don't mind a janky game,  best way to play this is solo on amateur level (so that your companion ai doesnt die to stupid stuff and it makes the quicktime events easier).   As for the four campaigns  chris's  was the best , leons second (first half was confusing and boring), jakes third  ( lot of 'quick time/maze/puzzle events' that are easy to mess up and die to) , and lastly Adas  campaign ( simply because she is in all the other campaigns so there is not much new and her individual story is pretty short and has some annoying puzzles) .

RE6 returns absolutely iconic characters Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, and Ada Wong. It also introduces one new main character, Jake Muller, and 2 partner characters to Leon & Chris!

RE6 does an absolutely great job with the characters themselves, which is an amazing thing in this game considering every other thing this game suffers from immensely.

If you've played any other mainline Resident Evil game, you should know the charm & feel that RE Environments give off. They just feel like Resident Evil, y'know? Yeah, well, throw all of that charm out because RE6 does that for you already. Not a single environment in this game gives off that great feel that other entries always do. This game mainly takes place in 2 cities, and it feels as if they dropped Leon or Chris into the environment of an action-zombie movie with tons of neon lights & random explosions. Not only are the environments themselves bad, you ever like that environmental storytelling in other entries? Y'know, the notes and stuff you find lying around when you explore? Yeah, well, say goodbye to that amazing thing too. RE6 rips it away from you. ""Hope you're okay with that!"", I'm sure Capcom was saying.

RE6 contains 4 campaigns which all round out to about 5 hours long each, and I only played 2. Leon & Chris'. I could not allow myself to play the other 2 (Jake, Ada) as I seriously feel like I would go insane. This game is horrific to play with it's weird obsession of sending unnecessarily long hordes at you that seem like they are never going to end. They send random hordes that last so extremely long you don't think you will see the end of them, and when you finally do reach the end of one, you might as well prepare because another one is right around the corner.

Leon's hordes consist of casual zombies, similar to the Raccoon City Incident of RE2, but also zombies that regenerate into a new form after their death. This wouldn't be so bad, if they weren't constantly in hordes that seem to never end. Oh, yeah, try body-armored zombies too. So you're going against constant hordes with casual zombies, some of which regen into a stronger, new body, and also body-armored zombies. Sick, right?

And if that doesn't sound super bad to you, then I'm sorry if your a Chris Redfield fan who chose to play him first, because instead of that already annoying stuff Leon goes against, Chris is put in literal shootouts. Any encounter you find yourself in, it consists of you firing a gun at your enemy who is also firing a gun. They put that in hordes, too! So, you'll find yourself in a horde but instead of dealing with regeneration or body-armor, you are literally getting hit with gunfire. Fun, right? No. It's not. It sucks.

The stories themselves (atleast Leon & Chris) aren't ... that bad. Leon's is extremely forgettable, I barely remember what his plot even was, to be honest. Chris' on the other hand though, it's not forgettable. It's actually really sad, and it really shows that he has been through some bad stuff, and that doesn't stop as he's constantly going through more stuff during his campaign. It's sad and really gives you a new outlook on the ""Great Chris Redfield!"".

Other games in RE, such as 5, or even the side-series Revelations are really action-heavy, but somehow managed to hold onto that flare that Resident Evil always gives off. RE6 is action-heavy as well, but on a completely different level and shows no flare of Resident Evil. Such a disappointment.

You like good performance in your games, right? You know, smooth framerates, but also with some good looking graphics. Sorry to tell ya, this game isn't great in that category. Throughout both Leon & Chris' campaigns, I was dealing with constant stutters, and even full-on freezes at times. This game is from 2013.
This means: RE6 is a 2013 game running on a high-end PC from 2020(being mine, of course) and still stuttering to all hell with some actual freezes at times, and the game isn't even graphically insane. It looks okay of course, but it's not anything groundbreaking. Even the games made in RE Engine in recent years don't have this issue, so 6 must have really bad optimization.

The overall events of RE6 aren't very memorable, and it seems Capcom agrees as (atleast afaik) neither 7 or Village mention any of the events that occur in 6, which is a little odd as 6 does have some big events.

It's clear Capcom was trying to go for a big action-zombie movie type feel, and while they may have hit that mark a little bit, it completely ruins Resident Evil and had the franchise continued down this route, I am sure it would have met it's end. Thankfully, RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard came and fixed this whole mess and brought the franchise back to it's horror roots.

Capcom made an attempt at making Resident Evil something it's not, and they seem to have succeeded in that with RE6. As a newcomer to RE who has been playing thru all the games in a row, I have enjoyed them all up until this, and I feel this is a big spit in the face to the fans. Whatever this monstrosity was, never do it again Capcom. Thanks.

While the game can be fun, it strays far from the series' survival horror origins, while most other aspects of the game remain, sadly, average. Like with the previous few titles, the game features third-person gunplay combat, peppered with quick time events, mutant creatures, and monster infested locales. While the gameplay appears to be like other third-person entries in the series, it diverges in tone and design. I struggled with whether to give it a thumbs up or down, which is perhaps the most telling.

As a game on its own, RE6 is not terrible. While it has its frustrating aspects, it is not devoid of interesting moments, and entertaining gameplay. However, as a Resident Evil game, RE6 is demonstrably poor, forgetting almost entirely the aspects which made former titles great, and which typified the series as a whole. Resident Evil itself coined the term 'Survival Horror' to describe the nature of its first title in 1996. This game focused on horror, limited resources, fight or flight choices, and a foreboding and mysterious atmosphere which came while investigating. RE6 is a plain action title, with the horror aspect relegated to set dressing. While the series has always had its cheezy moments, with B-movie schlock, RE6 instead feels like it is trying to be like every other action title that came out around the same time.

This trend in the series was already present in RE5, which in turn was responding to the success of RE4, which first introduced the third-person gameplay used in proceeding titles. RE6 triples down on this action aspect, expanding the 'partners co-op' style gameplay of RE5 into an absurd, convoluted, quasi-multiplayer experience. Not only do players have the option of co-op, but they will encounter other teams where missions 'cross'. While interesting theoretically, it further kills much of the horror survival vibe. Further, players can also opt to control a zombie, invading another player's game. If this all seems redolent of Left 4 Dead, you are right, as RE6 had cross over content with that franchise, and obviously took cues from it.

As a long time fan of the series, RE6 is a disappointment to me for all these reasons. But, I feel it would be unfair to wholly damn RE6 simply for being different. Indeed, L4D and the other action style games RE6 draws influence from are not bad games. For those considering playing RE6, just be aware that if you are looking for a survival horror experience or are a returning fan, you will be far better served with any title in the series other than this.

Resident Evil 6 (A Post Rant Review):
Resident Evil 6, it also has a number of smaller changes differentiating it from RE4 and 5. Firstly, all weapons are found in the game world. Weapons cannot be upgraded as in other games, but instead the player buys and equips 'skills'. These range from general damage, to increases drop rates, to more health or stammina.

Skills are bought with 'experience' which is dropped from enemies or found. This is, in esscence, the same as money in 4 & 5, though with more limited uses. With this being the case, I would have preferred if exp was acquired more like other games, given on defeating enemies or completing missions, as opposed to a pick-up. This would also insentivise players to beat levels with speed and flair. This seems to mostly be used to maintain a certain level of player power at all times through out the game.

For those players who do wish to upgrade their skills, they can replay previous missions taking their weapons along with them. There are a total of 4 main stories to play through featuring different characters fighting through a worldwide plot to infect the planet with the C-Virus. Stories 1-3 are done in pairs, each featuring a returning character from previous games. These are Leon, Chris, a grown-up Sherry Birkin, and Ada Wong. Jill is presumably on sabbatical.

Leon, Chris, and Sherry also have a new character to act as their partner. Leon gets Helena, a fellow government Agent who knows more about the outbreak than she lets on. Chris gets Piers, BSAA super sniper, and in some ways a reflection of Chris's early incarnation in STARS. Sherry gets Jake, a mercenary, whose unique genetic origin grants him immunity to the C-Virus. A reasonable effort is made to make each pair have some contrast.

Leon is earnest, but tired of the horror. Helena is desperate and fueled by a need for vengeance. Chris, having fallen into a amnesiac depression, has forgotten that he's a hero, a fact which Piers will try to correct with his own selfless devotion to the cause and to the BSAA. Sherry Birkin takes after Claire, being caring, brave, and determined. She and Jake develop a quick chemistry as Jakes devil-may-care attitude and mercenary position clash against her sincerity. They may honestly be the best pair, if only because they have been given the most space to be individuals, unhindered by previous games. Ada is her usual aloof self.

Each campaign is 5 missions, with each taking just over an hour, rounding out to just over 20 hours total. While some have praised the game's increased length compared to RE5, the split in stories and the multitude of characters makes much of the game a mess. Indeed, everything seems to be a hurry in RE5. The disaster is always in progress, with players desperately trying to act as quickly as possible. While this is not always true, the tone is present, and on many occasions it seems enemies continue to drizzle into the area, preventing the player form feeling safe enough to full explore.

The enemies themselves have some good designs, though I would have like to see more consistency for the C-Virus mutations. While most enemies have fairly solid designs, they feel somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes the C-Virus makes regular zombies, sometimes L4D style mutant infected, sometimes lizards, and sometimes bug mutants. The insectoid mutations really should have been the most prevalent. The game's frequent use of cocoons and other insect imagery would have fit a lot more. But sadly the game want to show you as many designs as it can with little thought, further preventing any consistent design through line.

The stories themselves are half-way self contained. Playing in order, Leo and Helena know the least, with Ada knowing the most about the whole incident. While an interesting concept, I often felt like I was re-treading old ground, and by the second campaign had already guessed one or two of the major secrets revealed in Ada's campaign. Overall, the stories are individually ok, and could even serve as decent RE plotlines on their own, but are ultimately made weaker by placing them interconnectedly in one game.

What remains, after all this, is the gameplay itself which is serviceable. Gun play is fun and fast. Melee is functions while the stamina bar keeps you from simply pounding the enemies into dust. Where it fails, it fails in the details. Small moments where the greater 'coolness' of the moment never gave way to player's perspective. This is where its impossible to tell if your damaging a boss, or where a camera angle gets in the way of the player. I found one of the most frustrating early examples of this was the fact that I could shoot or stab zombies prior to them re-animating, only for them to lunge at me when I passed.

These moments, while small, can add up over 20 or-so hours. Overall the gameplay is serviceable fun, and the plot can be entertaining. In fact, if RE6 were its own game, not part of the series, I would probably have praised it for its ambition. As it stands it is an ok game, and a bad Resident Evil game. It has my recommendation only for the former, and with a heavy grain of salt.",1671849645,1671849645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Game runs fine
- Entire game can be done coop
- I personally like the 4 distinct campaigns each with their own characters / themes and how they overlap with key parts.

Cons:
- Quick Time Events everywhere. Literally opening a door can be a QTE
- It constantly takes control of your camera to make you look at something. 
- - This make it very hard to control if not impossible to fight.
- - It will change from 3rd person  to a remote fixed camera angle like the original RE 1 / 2
- - You'll be in a chase scene and it will have the camera behind you. This is fine and you're holding up to run normally. Suddenly its in front of you and you have to be holding down or you just killed yourself. 5 seconds later you need to be holding left or right. Its seriously infuriating as it will kill you if you don't know the camera change is coming and what direction to hold.
- Controls are janky and tank like. You'll stick to things a lot. The run button is same as vault so sometimes you try and run and they'll just vault over random things, sometimes even in reverse over a table you were trying to run past.

Prior to playing I was looking forward to writing my 8th straight positive Resident Evil review and calling out the obsessive naysayers for who they are and for being stuck in some Resident Evil template.  I can't do it.  They were right and on multiple fronts.  They deserve your respect.

The story so far is within the bounds of Resident Evil stories and like many of the previous games the story evolves so slowly.  The Resident Evil moniker or any semblance ends there.

The environments are the only redeeming value and the game looks AAA but it's a cluster f**k and I don't use that term lightly.   Horrendous controls to start, ridiculous game mechanics, amateur GUI design, QTE hell and monster closets galore making the game more like Rebellion's Zombie Army series.  

Again, apparently FOV was not a thing in 2013 having to be fixed by community utilities such as Flawless Widescreen saving us from arrogant game designers who adamantly refuse to provide choice and treat consumers as atomic lemmings.  

I approached ready to forgive any Resident Evil transgressions however I just can't do it anymore.   Yes, I've read the game has a boat load of content.  Four campaigns to sail away on.  To immerse yourself in Zombie blood and saliva.  To vomit on the cadaverous odors of the undead.  To experience the tension of what may lurk around the corner.  To see what the creative Capcom minds have unleashed upon unsuspecting players.  No, it wasn't to be.

- Figur szachowych, szefie?
- Tak. Figury szachowe są zajebiste i gracze będą się jarać, że mogą je podnosić szaleńczym wciskaniem R, R, R, R w samym środku strzelaniny!

Tak mogło wyglądać jedno ze spotkań koncepcyjnych zespołu pracującego nad Resident Evil 6. W końcu to, czego oczekują fani serii, to hollywoodzka akcja w stylu filmów bohaterskich, masa quick-time eventów oraz niespójna i nielogiczna fabuła. Prawda?

O ile byłem w stanie przełknąć RE5 i nawet mi się podobało, to w szóstce mamy już pełne Call of Duty mode zmiksowane z szalonymi grami akcji, w których bohaterowie po wypadnięciu z samolotu czy stratowaniu przez lawinę po prostu otrzepują się i idą dalej. W tej nijakiej i momentami po prostu źle zaprojektowanej grze, szkoda mi tylko Ustanaka. Gość jest jak dobry aktor w słabym filmie. Sam tego nie pociągnie. Nie uratuje też wizerunku złoli. Zwłaszcza że do kompanii ma człowieka-jelenia-tyranozaura-muchę i wielkiego gluta. Serio, w żadnym innym Residentcie pomysły na przeciwników (w tym bossów) nie były tak żenujące i sztampowe.

The combat system is genuinely deep, with a firearm-melee combination that flows well together once you get used to it. It's a solid evolution of 4 and 5's, as melee can be used anytime instead of exclusively through contextual button prompts. And there are lots of different kill animations depending on the character, the weapon equipped, the type of attack, and the location of the enemy.

The problem is that the game is very light on tutorials and doesn't teach you about the mechanics much at all. I think the idea was that players could discover the combat system for themselves, but what ends up happening is first-timers just get knocked down a hundred times (quite literally because of the new stagger system) before anything seems to click. And even the inventory interface takes some getting used to.

The camera is an absolute mess.  You'd think that'd be standard for the RE games, but the camera in this game shakes and moves around so much I was legitimately getting sick.

The weapons feel even more limp than RE5.  RE5's weapons were pretty limp in terms of feel, but RE6 takes it to a whole new level.  The skill system basically removes the weapon upgrades from 4 and 5 and makes it so that it lets you *think* there are multiple playstyles.  There aren't.  The game was designed in a way that's so...7th gen.

There's tons of quick time events, tons of walking segments, tons of interruptions, and the gameplay that is there is so unsatisfying outside of a few melee quick kills.

Let's go over the campaigns real quick:

Leon's campaign: If this campaign is supposed to be the best this game has to offer, then I genuinely feel bad for the people defending this game.  Even the Evil Within 1 is more scary, more balanced, smarter, and more fun than Leon's campaign.  This is supposed to be the horror chapter.
Chris's campaign: This is the real reason I played this game.  I wanted to know why he's the way he is in RE7 and 8.  To my lack of surprise, it's never explained.  His campaign is bloated, boring, and very ""Gears of War""-lite.  It has the worst final boss of the bunch too.
Jake's campaign: This legitimately should have been a different game.  Jake would also work better if he wasn't a resident evil character and his whole ""twist"" was predictable since he teams up with barely lega-I mean Sherry.  This is basically the melee part and at times it works fine, but it's wrapped up with enemies that aren't designed very well, don't have interesting or cool designs, boring levels, and and awful QTE's/driving segments.
Ada's campaign: By this point, I was done.  She's the stealth character.  This pales in comparison to the RE4 chapter.  Again, it's bloated and boring.  The ""twist"" is again predictable.  It's also poorly explained.

I can't with this game.  I gave it a chance in the end after 10 years since it came out.  I figured I might have a different view on it.  Nope.  Not even close.  It's not even fun with Co-Op.  If you want a fun co-op game, there's tons of other options out there.",1670530266,1670530266,False,1,1,0.495759934186935425,0,True,False,False

If this game didn't have co-op it would have 0 redeeming qualities. At least playing this bullshit with a friend will give you someone to poke fun at it with.

Resident Evil 6, also known as Biohazard 6, is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. The game was released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. It is the ninth main installment in the Resident Evil series, and the sixth to feature a cooperative campaign mode.

The game's story is set in 2013, ten years after the events of Resident Evil 5. The world is facing a new threat in the form of the C-virus, a highly infectious virus that has the ability to mutate its host into powerful monsters. The game follows four different campaigns, each featuring their own protagonists and storylines. The campaigns are:

 1. Leon's Campaign: This campaign follows Leon S. Kennedy, the former Raccoon City police officer who was one of the protagonists of the original Resident Evil game. Leon is now a government agent tasked with investigating a terrorist attack in Tall Oaks, a city in the United States. Along the way, he teams up with Helena Harper, a secret service agent who was with the President when the attack occurred.

 2. Chris' Campaign: This campaign follows Chris Redfield, the former member of the Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) who was one of the protagonists of the original Resident Evil game. Chris is now a member of the BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance), a global organization that fights bioterrorism. He is sent to Lanshiang, a city in China, to investigate a bioterrorism incident. Along the way, he teams up with Piers Nivans, a BSAA agent who has experience dealing with bioterrorism.

 3. Jake's Campaign: This campaign follows Jake Muller, a mercenary who is revealed to be the son of Albert Wesker, the primary antagonist of the Resident Evil series. Jake is initially reluctant to get involved in the situation, but is eventually convinced by his partner Sherry Birkin, the daughter of two key Umbrella Corporation researchers, to help her find a cure for the C-virus.

 4. Ada's Campaign: This campaign follows Ada Wong, a mysterious and enigmatic spy who has appeared in several previous Resident Evil games. Ada's campaign is a separate story that intersects with the other campaigns at certain points.

Resident Evil 6 received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised the game's graphics, voice acting, and variety of gameplay, but criticized its lack of focus, convoluted story, and poor AI. The game was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies worldwide.

In terms of gameplay, Resident Evil 6 introduces several new elements to the series. The game features a new health system, in which players can no longer heal themselves with herbs, but must instead find health packs scattered throughout the environment. Players can also now move and shoot at the same time, allowing for more fluid combat. The game also introduces the ""Partner"" system, in which players can team up with an AI partner or another player to tackle the game's challenges together.

One of the key features of Resident Evil 6 is its four campaign modes, each with its own unique protagonist and storyline. The game's story is told through a mixture of cutscenes and in-game dialogue, and features a large cast of characters. The campaigns are interconnected, with events in one campaign often affecting events in the others.

The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed character models and environments. The game's voice acting is also top-notch, with well-known actors like Kevin Dorman and Courtenay Taylor lending their voices to the game's characters.

Overall, Resident Evil 6 is a solid entry in the long-running",1375741928,1670422962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oh man, where to begin uh? I knew Capcom had a fallout around this time and the RE franchise was one of its victims. If the franchise jumped the shark with its fifth entry then it completely touched rock bottom with this one. The game is full on 2010's action, and while its not true that it doesn't have horror elements, much more than 5 actually, its more of the first than the latter. The best way to talk about the plot is to analyze each campaing on its own, as Capcom tried to appeal to everybody while not appealing to anybody at all and, at the same time, further alienating their fanbase, but first, the gameplay.

Oh man, the gameplay. This continues with the co-op mechanics of the previous one. Make no mistake, this is a co-op online type game they tried to create here, and to a certain extent, they succeeded, but gone are the old isolated and terryfying atmospheres that made the originals, so if you are looking for that then you are gonna hate this more than I did. Luckily, they changed the controls in order to suit better for this type of game, you can move the camera around freely, the ridiculous meelee attacks are back, and you can even walk while aiming or firing, all of which changes the dynamic of the game itself. BUT, they locked on the camera while running, which is annoying and plain idiotic for all the quicktime events going on. Did I mention those? Yes, this game has so many quicktime events that it should be renamed ""RE Interactive Movie"" and by god I hate any kind of game interrupting when I'm playing. But that's not all, not only the running sections are awful, but every interaction you have with the enviroment is designed to annoy you at best. Your character will trip by just walking over a corpse, hell, Leon will trip into an open grave in Chapter 3 (I think) if you do so much as to go near it. Every single god damn enemy launches at you and triggers some sort of stupid event that just plain interrupts your movement to punch some damn combination with the pad, even bullets will make you fall down on your back. Speaking of which, this is an action game, so you are bound to spend your time shooting but the game is really stingy with the ammo. For some reason, the developers though it was a good idea to keep the low ammunition mechanic from previous games, unfortunately, you need the damn thing to make your way in it, so I ended up most of the time running around boss fights non the less, leaving the AI alone to do the job while I might hit it with the knife once or twice for 30 f***** min. And I know this is probably for the co-op mechanic, but if I'm going solo, give me the damn bullets. Most of the time all your going to find in the crates are those stupid points for the stupid points system, don't even get me started on that. Did I said previously that the controls were ok? Well, I'm sorry to contradict myself but, goddamn, some things make absolutely no sense. The developers decided unexplicably to have two different ""action buttons"" (perhaps to enhance the QTE), so now you have one to reload and pick items up, and one for running and every other interaction, and that's a problem: if you try to sprint and your character is close to anything that can be interacted with (stairs, crate, table, whatever) you're gonna have a seisure. 600 people participated in the development! How can you f*** something so simple as that so badly?! I have tons of other complaits like the terrible cover system, the changing HUDS, the melee attacks only working whenever they feel like, the items selection screen, the fact that there's NO WAY TO PAUSE THE GAME, not even in single player, the un-remapable controls or the fact that you have to scroll up and down for your weapons inventory, which gets really impossible when you are in a tight situation. F*** I even experienced times when an unconveniently placed cutscene left me completely exposed to enemies attacks and died; I could go on and on but this will never finish. On to the story:

LEON: Ok this episode literally starts with a bang and never stops from there, both characters survive such a ridiculous array of things (bus crashing, helicopter crashing, freaking PLANE CRASH LANDING IN CHINA) that you are gonna be asking to yourself ""who wrote this?"" more times than necessary. It's RE: Left For Dead because that's exactly how it feels. Leon is as dumb as he'll ever be, constantly approaching danger as if he was a complete rookie, we also take control of Helena or whoever she is, I don't care, she's just a dumb mix of Hollywood clichés. The story is filled with lame one liners and the zombies just lounge at you like kamikazes, which of course, triggers an automatic QTE. If you are quick enough you can dodge them, but other wise it takes like a full damn clip of your gun to stop them. The final boss comes back 5 times, I'm not even kidding, you are gonna be begging to please stop for all the wrong reasons.

CHRIS: Or Call of Duty: Resident Evil, because if Activision was taking a part in the whole zombie deal why not do it opposite also right? This one gotta be the worst in gameplay terms. Chris is now a terribly cliched alcoholic who comes back to his military job for one last mission, after which, of course, we get our obligatory flashback in Estonia or some made up Eastern Europe country (cause the Middle East was unavailable I guess) with full on bio-terrorism plotline ala RE 5. He's teamed up with generic McGuffin' who only seems to talk in full military man macho hollywood lines, although pretty much every male characters seems to be doing some sort of wang measuring when they talk to each other, that's the quality of the dialogue here. I definitively did  not enjoy this. Specially the end with that camera switching running sequence, did I mention the camera locks when you sprint? Well, imagine trying to control that while the angle keeps changing while trying to run away from a gigantic beast (which like many enemies in the game, don't feel like they belong).

JAKE: I admit I did enjoy this one a little better, but it might as well been because I already was tired (the game is overstuffed to the max). This time we take control of Wesker's Son and the girl from RE 2, who now grew to become an obnoxiuos Wolverine like superhero (really). She is a crybaby and he is the typical sarcastic unimaginative antihero, both victims of poor writing, but I did like the chemistry between them if it's worth anything. They are hounded by this absurd ""Wrong Turn"" like beast who never dies no matter what you do. The final confrontation takes place in a lava filled facility, which only confirms the fact that even at that time, Capcom still had no idea how lava works. He falls into it, yet manages to come back, W-T-F?!?!?!? Even worse, Jake takes him on barehanded... Yeah people, the boulder punching was only the beginning (Chris even stops a full steel door with his arms at one point...)

ADA: Or RE: Arkham Asylum. And you can already see the problem here. THIS IS NOT A STEALTH GAME. So yeah, I got so fed up with this one after being cornered by a bunch of armored zombies with nothing but a damn crossbow, that I just decided to call it quits. This is as far as I go. I am simply not enjoying it.

So yeah, it does has some decent gameplay in between, specially if you play it co-op, but RE 6 is a crummy overbloated badly designed game, not just for the franchise but as a standalone product as well. If it's worth anything, the game does have it's moments of joy, but they are scarce as you are going to be constantly cussing, cursing and screaming to the wind when you get interrupted by its terrible mechanics. All I can say after venting this out is: THANK GOD CAPCOM WENT BACK TO ITS ROOTS AFTER THIS, AND THAT THIS GENERATION OF GAMING IS FINALLY OVER.",1592539355,1669847846,False,1,0,0.505920350551605225,0,True,False,False

Who in their right mind decided that changing the controls that PC players have used for years, was a good idea? WASD is just about the only ""normal"" control to survive. Every other button is something stupid and non-intuitive.  
I already run my mouse at a reasonably low sensitivity, <1000 DPI, but that is STILL too high for this game, that camera is massively over sensitive even when set to the lowest setting.
Game play is horrendous, it regularly snatches control of the camera for no reason, movement is terrible, you can only crouch for a second. They didn't learn the lesson from RE5, as you are regularly waiting/reliant on your dumb-ass companion.
The game is essentially split into four campaigns, each with a part to add to the same story. I was playing for the story, working through each game.

They give enemies guns, and give the player an unusable cover mechanic. Enemies can chain attacks, and there is no soft timer to displace the frequency. So you'll get thrown to the ground from their gunfire, while other enemies pile on, all chaining hits.Gunfire is also not telegraphed, it simply happens. Poor visual design means you are meant to simply be shot from across the room with no way to react until you spot the enemy.

The game is divided into four separately told stories, with Leon's campaign the best of the bunch. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near enough to redeem this game, as all other campaigns will have you screaming obscenities at the failed direction the lead designer championed.

The shining beacon, if nothing else, is the inclusion of The Mercenaries Mode. This time, with an additional ""No Mercy"" option. Things get wild with a friend, so if you enjoyed Mercenaries in RE4 and RE5, it still is a lot of fun and you'll no doubt get many hours out of playing it here.",1420234502,1669373373,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even if the game has a lot of positive reviews on Steam, it's still one of the most controversial games in the franchise to date, fans & fellow gamers carry a resentful statements when it comes to Resident Evil 6, most of it unjustly so. The complaints regarding the game are primarily centered around the fact that RE6 is a complete betrayal of everything the franchise stood for, which couldn't be farther than the truth. Resident Evil 6 is a love letter to the previous installments with nice little homages and a peak point to getting to see all our beloved characters and adventures we've had the joy experiencing. Yes it's over the top ridiculous, yes it's campy, but that's the nature of Resident Evil, since the Golden Age of Gaming with the PSX and the technological limitations it offered that spawned the Resident Evil games the masses seem to love, were indeed always revolved around muscular meathead mercenaries & tomboy badass females obviously inspired from 80s action movies infused with B-tier horror & sci-fi which created an aesthetic so unique and created an entire universe of its own that was so iconic to spawn countless movies, animations & other miscellaneous works expanding upon it even further. 

Furthermore, do not listen to supposed ""fans"" discouraging you from checking out Resident Evil 6, it is perhaps one of the most unique co-op experiences you can witness, and even solo, it is a ton of fun, especially having to play around with the unique combat that infuses action & brawler style of gameplay with survival horror third person shooter, which supposedly was formed by the development team responsible for many Clover & Platinium title action games, it all makes perfect sense, get it now, you won't regret it.",1669158788,1669158788,True,22,3,0.585884392261505127,0,True,False,False

It never was or even close and it's at least scarier than RE5, BAR NONE. But it could've been better in the horror department. I do appreciate the improvements and additions to the controls/movement that lifts the old restrictions of freezing in place when aiming down sights but I miss the old inventory setup which is replaced with live menu pausing that can put you on your toes when enemies are present so do wait until you have a quiet moment to access your inventory. The visuals as well as voice acting are expertly well done. However I do agree with the criticism of the plot being a bit too all over the place as well as being over the top in ridiculous action set pieces that even puts Michael Bay movies on notice. I also like the fact of this game offers diverse range of content and campaign structure/play with up to 7 characters (4 campaigns, 3 with 2 characters while Ada is solo) with alternative plot pathways which is at least consistent when tied together. I'll give it that unlike Sega who keeps stupidly and inconsistently change directions + tones as well as retconning itself every 1-2 installments with Sonic games.

Anyway, I would give this overhated game a fair shot with 8/10 rating since it's clearly a step up from RE5 until RE7 finally goes full horror like the fans wanted. It has plenty of content to enjoy for over 12-20+ hours with vastly improved controls/mechanics, it does have its scary moments (like Ada's opening mission which excellently creeps me out at the start), excellent enemy design as well as engaging boss fights with optional co-op which BTW, THANK GOD the co-op AI partner isn't a complete DUMBASS like Sheva from the previous game so you have nothing to worry about when playing RE6 alone.

A group of people wanted Resident Evil to go back to the puzzle aspect it originally was, in the same vein as Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3.

Another group wanted it to be more action oriented, blazing through the trail that Resident Evil 4, and 5.

Then there was the new group of people whose first experience with the juggernaut franchise was this particular entry.

In a vacuum, RE6 is balls to the wall action, making you feel like you're in a typical Hollywood blockbuster film, filled with explosions, guns, charming if a bit corny dialogue at times, and witty one-liners that only Leon Kennedy can serve up and make you smile. This is the biggest the RE series has gone in terms of scope, both in story and gameplay. 

Gameplay is more responsive than ever before. No longer are you burdened by the tank controls. You can now run, shoot, dash, slide, melee, roll, take cover, and kick ass while doing it. The counter system is one of the most satisfying mechanics ever introduced into the series and mastering it makes you feel like one of the most badass people out there in the world. You've got turret segments, driving sequences, classic RE puzzles, QTEs, it's like a mish-mash of past and then-present gaming trends all blended together to make an action game that others should be compared to.

Story-wise, it's classic RE-schlock and if you haven't checked out by RE5, then RE6 should be a no brainer for you. But much like majority of the franchise, the devil is in the details. Playing through the game lets you get a cursory glance at the plot: a bioterrorist attack that results in zombies, orchestrated by a maniacal villain. But in reality, it's shockingly more fleshed out than the game presents itself to be. It's all in the files, which is a shame because it's a collectible that majority of the people would miss and not bother to collect except for the most diehard of fans.

When I first played this game way back in 2013 on my Xbox 360, I was admittedly confused at what in the world was going on, much like majority of the people that played it. I could follow along, but I could never understand why some characters did what they did, and what happened in between the moments of transition. Only through reading the files did I actually get the whole picture.

RE6's story is surprisingly well though out, though that is my opinion and others may disagree. If anything, the only thing I'm genuinely disappointed about is how some of the interesting developments presented in this mainline entry (Jake being who he is and what he's doing after, Sherry being present, Leon at the aftermath of it all, Ada's next gig) aren't really touched upon in RE7. The only ""mainline character"" we've seen thus far after RE6's outing is Chris. Hopefully Capcom revisits these interesting characters in a future entry--possible RE9 as of this review's writing.

All in all, Resident Evil 6 is a masterclass on how to make an amazing, responsive, and satisfying action game that was unfortunately marred with the baggage of its extensive franchise history. It had the unfortunate burden of satisfying different demographics that wanted vastly different things from it, 

Some would say it failed to satisfy any of those groups of people. I would have said the same thing. But looking back it now, I think it was alright. It's one of my favorite games in the franchise's every evolving history. No other game comes as close to the action that was presented here in RE6, and it really is a shame that no one else had tried since.",1668395200,1668395200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While 5 gave us a satisfying co-op mode for the first time, many longtime fans were disappointed with the faster, action arcade-style play. If RE 5 exchanged some of the survival horror elements for pace and action, then RE 6 completely discarded what was left and got very little of value in return. What we got was a direct to DVD playable action movie with all the campy tropes, frustrating controls, and way too many staged sequences.

Probably the most frustrating part for me was unintended actions like mantling up or jumping down a ledge while otherwise running in a straight line. The controls simply don't feel very intuitive.

RE6 feels like playing one of the many CGI movies such as RE Vendetta so make of that what you will.
this may be better with a co-op partner, maybe a blast, unfortunately i played with AI.
it's not entirely a BAD game, there are worse out there but I think for a Resident Evil game, this is bad:

-the UI is confusing and isn't visually appealing
-story / canon completely scrambling to make any sort of sense (you only really start understanding the plot in the last bit of the game)
-overstays it's welcome and pads out the runtime through unnecessary obstacles or basic puzzles to remind you that you're playing an RE game
-graphics are a bit bad for 2012 (also the year of hitman absolution for comparison of graphics)
-enemy types and bosses were the worst they've ever been in this one imo, boring and uninspiring

i did enjoy riffing along with the game because of it's most outrageous plot, but without that, this would've been even more of a slog to play, that is good:

-runs amazingly after install, no crashes no bugs no anything
-soundtrack wasn't awful, Jake's ending credits song I may actually listen to outside of this game
-sherry is cute
-amazing backdrops for RE, a lot of the Chinese scenery could actually be amazing to come back to
-COACH BABY!!!
-the extra modes such as Mercenaries is among the best in the series
-stun rod

overall, a meh entry to the series that could've been better if it wasn't so ambitious.

Inventory system is garbage and limited, even more limited than your regular systems throughout the other games. There isn't any open inventory, just a bar you scroll through to see ammo and two nearly useless items (incendiary grenade and remote explosive), hardly do anything for you aside from conserving a little ammo, which you'll end up using anyways because rarely do these items actually kill. 

Guns aren't fun anymore. You can't find attachments and upgrades for your weapons in this game, you just find weapons that you need ammo for and that's it. In literally every other game you can get upgrades which do more, expand capacity, fire rate, reload speed, firepower, etc etc. This game just throws weapons at you and hopes the RNG drops you a little bit of ammo for them. 

Story is mediocre and jank. Extremely forgettable and doesn't make hardly any sense. Honestly I wouldn't even canonize this with any other game, the C-Virus doesn't have any depth, there isn't any mention of what researchers did in the creation, just a shitty cutscene in Leon's story, and all you know is ""Neo-Umbrella made this."" That's literally it. Sure there are some good sections in the cutscenes that make you feel kinda warm. ""Hey, this is pretty dope, it's not all bad."" and then you get right back into the gameplay that makes you wanna bash your head in between a car door. 

I'd go more into depth, but I just don't feel like it. Bought this with the halloween RE sale, and figured I'd play through it again because I was bored. I'm 6 hours in, finished Leon's campaign, no thanks. I'm sick of the jank controls, garbage story and dialogue, and dogshit ""inventory management."" 

Just go buy RE2/3 Remastered, or honestly the older games. They're so much better. Camera angles in the older games kinda blow at times but not NEARLY as bad as this game. Plus the controls aren't as bad. You get used to them as you play more. This is just a disgrace of a game and to the RE franchise.

As it stands right now I'd rate the game as a 7.5/8.2 but it gets way more hate then it deserves.

It has very cool, old school zombie horror story, it has a lot of action, great characters - it's just super fun and interesting. It has 4 different stories, and although third and fourth are a bit short, this game is actually 4 games in one - I mean, come on! How can you not love it? Even the graphics are pretty OK considering it's a bit older game. Only bad thing is that controls are a bit overwhelming from time to time. There is a specific point in the game where you die like 10 times before you manage to finish that stupid part, but if you are patient - it's bearable.
So, each of 4 stories has different set of two characters, but they are all following the same plot, although from different points of view and timelines. Each story has something new to add to unravel the plot and resolve a mystery from previous story. It's such a cool and fresh twist to already seen zombie scenario. My favourites are Leon and Helena, and Jake and Sherry stories. 
You can also play this game alone or with a partner, and although I love playing alone - if you have friends who love RE franchise - team up with them, it's like 1000 times more fun. I played it with my husband who is not the greatest fan of this type of games and he loved it, and we had a lot of fun. We will definitely play it again.

The buttons make absolutely no sense, and while I understand that it's due to it being a port, if you're going to port a game at least make the controls make even a little sense. 
If you get grabbed by an enemy, there's no cooldown, you'll just keep getting grabbed over and over and over if there's anything else nearby. Sometimes you'll get grabbed by something far away enough that it shouldn't be able to get to you.

But the game is quite fun, with 3 separate campaigns that all intersect through the story, until the finale puts them all together.

Leon's campaign is a bit more survival horror
Chris' campaign is more like RE5, its action and shooty.
Sherry's campaign is like a cat and mouse game with a stalker enemy, and filled with puzzles.

There is also a Mercenaries mode, with plenty of character and costumes to pick from.

This game is easily a good 30 hours or more if you are a completionist.

So much more fun playing co-op.

They game also does what most other RE games didn't and that is really blending gunplay and melee play. You can do some real damage with melee counter attacks, you can pick up melee weapons to bash people with, use the environment to execute people, etc.

Only annoying thing is quick time events, but that a minor inconvenience.

(For my non-British folk, people either love or hate marmite) 

The reason the game is both loved and hated leans on how you play the game and what you are looking for with a resident evil game. Most of the game falls into being more of a Third Person Action Game rather than a puzzley survival horror. .

What also makes a difference is the campaigns that you play. All the campaigns range from around 4-6 hours and all can be played with a friend or an AI if you hate people.  The campaigns also all intertwine so you'll play some areas a couple of times if you play through each campaign. 

In order from best to worst 

Leon's campaign - This campaign feels more like classic RE. You have more urban settings, a gothic church and a whole lot of zombies. There's some puzzle elements, some big mutated creatures including a literal T-Rex. Overall this campaign feels right. 

Jakes Campaign - This campaign features a new character whom is resistent to the C virus (One day we'll run out of letters) and Sherry from RE2. You travel the world dealing with a good mix of enemies from the other campaigns. Whilst a little disjointed at times, this campaign doesn't feel too out of place and there are some really fun areas and set pieces. 

Adas Campaign - This one should be played last as it generally ties everything together from the other campaigns with a kind of behind the scenes sort of story. This campaign is similar to Jakes in that you get a nice variety but the transitions between each chapter feel quite jarring as Ada just pops up wherever the story needs to be. You also get a lovely co-op partner in this that is incapable of doing anything outside of shooting. For some reason this hasn't been patched or changed so playing this one co-op is a bit lacklustre. 

Chris' campaign - You play as Chris the boulder punching machine as you take down mutant humanoid enemies for practically all of the story. This feels way more actiony and is the least fitting of the game. It's more like Gears of War than anything. This campaign feels like a slog overall. Definitely the least fun for me personally. 
 
Something worth noting is that the movement in this game is actually top notch and makes for some really fun gameplay. You can counter melee attacks, slider, roll and have a lot of manoeuvrability compared to other games in the franchise. The moment to moment gameplay is solid and there's plenty of enemy variety to take this into account. In fact the game overall has quite a bit of content from four campaigns to secrets hidden within the levels to levelling up skills and gunning for the highest ranks. There's a lot of replay value if completionism is your thing. 

Overall the game runs well, co-op works well (Aside from Ada's useless no nmed co-op buddy) and there's a lot of stuff to like here. It's wacky and it's tacky but if you're looking for a competent horror co-op shooter, RE6 is actually quite fun despite it being a bit of a mess.

So I passed it by. I love the Resident Evil games so much.  I replay RE1 easily once a year.  So when when RE4 Remake was announced I decided that I would replay the entire series 0-8 in order.  I was excited to play RE6  when I got to it since I never played it and I was thinking ""It can't be that bad..."" I was sorely wrong.  It's absolutely terrible.  I would call it trash but that would a disservice to actual garbage.  This game can't decide what it wants to be.  It has so many gameplay elements that it can't even be good at one of them.  Its a driving game, it's survival horror game, its a gears style game, and its a stealth game.  Thank the lord this all got corrected in RE7.  This game is an absolute blight on the series and needs to be forgotten.  Too many times I was needlessly killed because the game doesn't tell you where to go during a timed sequence, or a driving sequence when the camera pushes to the front or side of the vehicle and you can't see whats in front of you.   

I hoped the story would have made up for the atrocious gameplay, nope! The story is so forgettable and its spread over the course of 4 full length campaigns that all interweave over the course of a 6 month period.  So by the time you finish one campaign and move to the next you've forgotten crossovers cause it happened hours ago in gameplay time. Or it makes you play the entire sequence all over again as different characters. You know whats not fun?  Playing an hour plus long fight twice.

While RE5 was a bit of a departure adding RE4's style of gameplay with more action but at least it was fun.  This game is not fun.  I installed mods just so i could say I finished it and I couldn't even do that with mods.  I got to the final campaign and finally said ""F this! It's not worth it."" There isn't a single story element that plays into 7 or 8 so why bother. It's painfully frustrating to play.

I have enjoyed pretty much every Resident Evil.
There were some obvious hiccups in the series.
But also a lot of really gud gems along the way.
I'd say it peaked in goodness at Resident Evil 4.
After which, the series became unrecognizable.
Thankfully they went back to quality with RE 7.
But yeah, between 2007 and 2016: Just awful.
They had such a neat franchise on their hands.
I'm not sure why it went to such horrible ways.
There's like 9 games from the 2007-2016 era.
Most of which are total garbage, to be honest.
Although: Some of them are fun in co-op play.
Story-wise, this era is just trash, terrible story.
Out of the 9 said games, RE6 is the least bad.
It's still a bad game, but It is playable enough.
There are actually multiple campaigns in here.
Which is really the main positive of the game.
At least two of those campaigns are very gud.
By which I mean the story & gameplay within.
So a pretty good game amongst the turd pile.
Would I recommend it, though? Probably not.
Yes, It's the best RE from the 2007-2016 era.
Although, some might prefer Revelations 1/2.
I ain't a fan of 'co-op' RE games to be honest.
Which is probably why I don't like this period.
But: I ain't too mad, since now we got RE 7/8.
I'd rate this game like five out of ten, that's it.
Still below average in terms of Resident Evil's.",1666279173,1666279173,False,1,0,0.50105595588684082,0,True,False,False

Leon's Campaign: Leon probably has the best campaign in my opinion (which isn't saying much). In Leon's campaign, you and secret service agent Helena Harper go on a journey to expose national security advisor Derek Simmons for his role in the assassination of the U.S. president. The story and writing in general isn't very good in this campaign (just like with most of the campaigns) but in terms of positives this campaign actually has a few. The opening outbreak in Tall Oaks is very reminiscent of Resident Evil 2/3 and the outbreak in Raccoon city, which was really cool to see back in 2012 when this game first came out. However, we now have modern, much better done, versions of said outbreak in the form of Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remake. The zombies, while not as fun to fight as the zombies in re2/3r, are definitely the best enemies to fight in this game, if only for the reason you don't have to worry about them shooting you mid-melee animation. This campaign also didn't have any terrible vehicle sections to pad out time. The set pieces in this campaign didn't feel as ridiculous as the set pieces in the other campaigns either. Finally, this campaign is definitely the most polished. In terms of things that drag this campaign down, the boss fights are pretty bad for the most part, the UI and inventory system in general is the worst in the series (you can't even give your partner items which is really strange since you could in re5). The quick time events are really in your face and annoying, even compared to re5 and especially compared to re4. Overall, I'd probably give this campaign a 6/10 as it wasn't horrible but there isn't really a reason to play it now. If you want to play a modern resident evil with zombies, just play resident evil 2 remake or even resident evil 3 remake. 

Chris' Campaign: When it comes to positives, the only one I can really think of is the writing in this campaign is slightly better than the others. In this campaign, Chris is working for the BSAA (once again) with his partner Piers Nivans trying to stop bioterriorst operations in Edonia and later China. While in Edonia, Chris' entire team is killed by ""Ada Wong"" and he gets PTSD and tries to drink his feelings away. Piers picks Chris up in a bar and convinces him to come back to the BSAA to help stop a bioterrorist group known as Neo-Umbrella from completely destroying a Chinese city (which later turns out to be a world ending threat). It is also revealed that ""Ada Wong"" is in charge of said group and Chris has to overcome his need for revenge in order to save the world. Overall, the story of this campaign wasn't great, but it was a lot better than the stories in the other campaigns. The story is also a lot better than the gameplay. Chris' campaign is basically that last 45 minutes of re5 stretched over 6.5 hours. It's basically a glorified cover shooter where you fight j'avo (some of the least fun enemies to fight in any resident evil game) in a bunch of poorly designed arenas for most of the game. Unlike the zombies, j'avo have guns so you'll often be shot down before you can even run up and punch the ever-living shit out of them. Chris' campaign also has one of the worst driving and flying sequence I've ever had the misfortune of playing. Overall, I'd give Chris' campaign a 4/10.

Jake's Campaign: In Jake's campaign, you basically run around and punch j'avo with a really shitty combo system. His story is that he's a Mercenary fighting in Edonia, but for some reason, he's unaffected by the C-virus (the virus that turns people in j'avo). Sherry Birkin shows up and basically says he's the key to making a vaccine for the virus and he needs to come with her. While trying to get out of Edonia, they encounter Ustanak, a tyrant like monster whose goal is to capture Jake for Neo-Umbrella. They end up getting captured by neo-umbrella and sent to China so the rest of the game can happen. The only other thing worth mentioning about Jake is he's apparently the son of Albert Wesker, which feels really stupid and tacked on. In terms of gameplay, this campaign is really bad. The level design, particularly the level where you're escaping the mountain is absolutely atrocious and Jake just isn't fun to play as. Ustanak isn't nearly as memorable as Mr.X or Nemesis and just serves as a quick time event generator for most of this campaign. The vehicle sections in this aren't as bad as Chris' but they're basically on rails and control really poorly. Overall, I'd give this campaign a 3/10.

Ada's Campaign: Finally we get to Ada's campaign. This campaign only really exists to tie up loose ends left over from the other three campaigns and the only positive I can say about it is it's really short, not even three hours long. In terms of polish, it's pretty clear this campaign was basically an afterthought. Ada doesn't even canonically have a co-op partner with her. If you play this campaign in co-op, you play as Ada while the 2nd player gets to play as some generic soldier guy who can't do a damn thing except kill enemies. He can't even open doors or progress through the game really. Just about every single one of Ada's levels is reused from previous campaigns, she has a helicopter flying sequence at the end which is easily the worst vehicle section in the entire game, and this campaign is by far the glitchiest of the four. Overall I'd probably give this campaign a 2/10. 

In conclusion, Re6 isn't nearly as bad as people claimed it was when it launched. This game isn't even as bad as a lot of the later silent hill games. But the I can't help but feel that people who think this game is secretly a masterpiece and always was are just wrong. The amount of bullshit and jank you have to ignore to come to such a conclusion is just way too much in my eyes. This is definitely one of the weakest mainline resident evil games, only beating Re0 and Code Veronica in my eyes. I guess if you're really bored and have nothing else to play you could try this game, for anyone else I'd recommend steering clear.",1666120357,1666120395,False,9,1,0.588959872722625732,0,True,False,False

I cannot stand how often the game wants to take over the camera controls, it drives me crazy. The amount of times that I have lined up a shot, ready to pull the trigger only to have a cinematic camera show me a few more zombies enter the battle, like two more zombies join a battle of hundreds... Why show me this? If the camera isn't doing this it is forcing to look at an object.

The game plays like an action game but your inventory and ammo is like that of a survival horror. I got sick of looking for 5 pistol bullets in a fire fight. This is modern gaming, like Half Life giving you about 20 weapons and only about 3 rounds for each.

ALSO, the game is dark, and i don't mean in terms of tone, I can barely see anything most of the time.

Resident Evil 6 is not a Resident Evil game. The story travels so far off the tracks that this franchise is hard to save at this point. T-Virus, G-Virus and now the C- Virus, six hundred different kinds of enemies and over the top cut scenes that make the action in the Paul WS Anderson movies look tame. Subplots make little to no sense. Nothing is explained. Villains are just there because the world needs villains. As for gameplay, the co-op element as fine. I'm OK with that existing but why the overuse of cutscenes while your partner opens a door? Or pulls a lever? Is this game trying to compete with Metal Gear Solid IV? Let us play Capcom!  I cannot even recommend this game for the co-op and I definitely would not recommend playing this game solo. Why does the game need to spell out the objective for us? Or where the entrance to the next area is? This is the same developer that gave us Resident Evil, a huge mansion to explore and solve puzzles and this is the best they can do in 2012? Capcom should do us all a favor and reboot the series, start from the ground up because seriously, I couldn't give a shit you're  so desperate to connect the franchise together you feel the need to make Sherry Birkin a playable character.

It´s a common fact that this game is the most action-filled main title in the series. But that doesn´t necessarily make it a bad game, as long as the action is fun. Which it is, because it´s ridiculous non-sense you can laugh about. Watching the cutscenes of the game is the same experience as watching the RE movies starring Milla Jovovich. It´s trash, but it´s enjoyable trash. The storylines of the the campaigns are held together by coincidences combined with explosions, crashing helicopters and the extreme mutations of your enemies. 
And while we´re at it, let´s talk about the four campaigns, wich can all be played in co-op.
Each campaign revolves around two heroes, following their own orders and motivations. However, you don´t play four seperate stories, because the storylines of the four campaigns all merge into one. While playing one campaign, you can meet the protagonists of the other campaigns, doing the things you do in their story. This can lead to a bunch of ""Oh now I understand""-moments while you puzzle the story of RE VI together. You even have a timeline including all cutscenes from all four campaigns, where you can look up which events happened at the same time or are connected to another. The only downside of this concept is that you sometimes have to do the same battles or boss fights again, but with another character. 
But of course, RE VI has some other problems, too. The savepoints can be very unfriendly, some enemies are very annoying, some death animations are waaayyy to long and some boss fights leave you clueless what you have to do. While the graphics are overall ok, there are points where the game looks like straight from PS1 era, including blurred textures on 2D-houses. Another problem of the game is its action. I know, I´ve said earlier that it´s fun because it´s ridiculous, but sometimes it´s TOO ridiculous, to a point where it destroys immersion and creates plotholes. 
The co-op works very well most of the time, except the last campaign, where the player not hosting the session has to play a nameless agent, who can´t interact with most objects and riddles. So my friend and I decided to play this campaign alone.

Overall, RE VI is a good Resident Evil game to have fun with, and it´s definitely not as bad as its reputation. 
To conclude my review of this game, I once again have to compare it to the Resident Evil movies starring Milla Jovovich. They are fun to watch, but they won´t win an Oscar.",1664794854,1664796790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most grandiose and cinematic RE game out of 4, 5, and 6, with particularly impressive cutscenes and graphics. Unfortunately, the action often amounts to a chaotic, incoherent mess. And with the main characters constantly surviving death-defying scene after death-defying scene, the whole thing loses all semblance of believability, and consequentially, any semblance of horror. The lengthy campaign is divided into 4 separate scenarios, but due to significant overlap between them, much of it feels bloated and repetitive.

The part that I did not enjoy  was Chris's campaign, mainly because the chase scenes in that campaign were awful. The problem was the fact, that they - for some reason - did not use the over the shoulder angle with the camera, and tried to make it a bit more movie like, therefore the camera often changed the view angle, sometimes it even spun around, making it quite difficult to control the character as efficiently and swiftly as the game required it (at the end of Chris's campaign, I've died almost 49 times due to the fact that sometimes I could't even see my character in the Haos chase scene). Apparently that chase scene is less difficult if you play with a controller, but it still doesn't quite fit into an AAA game. I would still recommend it though, because apart from the camera angles in the chase scenes, the game, and the story itself is quite enjoyable.
I really do hope that someday they get to this game and rectify it by a remake (granted they would need to scrap most of it), since even though gameplay, and to be honest story wise it is lower mid-range at best, it is the last new mainline Resident Evil game featuring the original characters (Chris does appear in 7 and Village, but it is not the same) for almost 10 years, and it would be a shame if the story of the characters whom fans know and love would and with this game",1590434184,1664213729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

They may have always been a bit campy but at least they were enjoyable or scary. In the old games you had to be careful to manage your ammo and healing items since they were very limited and in RE5 you could pretty much just go out guns blazing. RE 6 reminds me very much of RE 5 except over-scripted TO THE EXTREME. The game is drowning in QTE events which like, really Capcom? I thought those went out of fashion in the late aughts? Also, you can't shoot zombies that are obviously going to get up and attack you later UNTIL they get up and attack you which is so incredibly dumb. God forbid the game reward you for taking the initiative to be careful and shoot a zombie corpse that may or may not still be ""alive"". Also headshots don't seem to do anything, hell you are usually gonna deal more damage by kicking a zombie than shooting it directly in the head. As Leon, I've had regular zombies take 4-5 headshots without dying which is just ridiculous. Once again, it's like the game doesn't want to reward you for playing carefully or precisely. I've seen posts online that say ""Oh you just have to level-up your firearm skill or whatever"" and it's like lol wut? I should not have to grind skill points just for a headshot on a basic zombie to kill them in 1 or 2 shots.

By default, the game comes a load of content: four campaigns, Mercenaries, and PvP--each of which could easily net you a couple hours of enjoyment. Whether you like it or not, this is hands down the most mechanically polished with each character having a fairly large set of melee attacks and weapons in their respective campaigns. There's honestly nothing more satisfying then sliding into an enemy to stagger him, shoot him in the head for a stun, and finishing your combo by throwing him into his friends.

Now lets get into the main content of the game, the campaigns. I would say each of the four range from just okay to pretty good. Leon and Helena have a vaguely classic Resi feel with many of their levels consisting of puzzles, tight corridors, zombies, and dark spaces. Chris and Piers are the military shooter duo packing heavy firepower and easily reaching the highest body count together in the game. Jake and Sherry is very much an action-adventure since a lot of the major set pieces tend to feature a different style of gameplay and location (driving, non-linear exploration, platforming). And Ada, appropriate for the mysterious femme fatale is a stealth-action styled campaign that has her sneaking around behind-the-scenes and subtly helping the other protagonists in various ways.

With a good variety of different flavors, you and your dedicated co-op partner should easily be able to find at least one favorite amongst those four. As long as you keep in mind this is a balls-to-the-wall action game you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. But if you miss the suspenseful atmosphere and horror of the older titles then it's best you stay away.

As a action cover-shooter it's probably one of the best I've played despite the cover system being almost completely pointless. The movement system, CQB and gameplay mechanics all seem alien at first but once you begin to understand them they all perfectly blend together to make the game into a crazy gun-fu simulator, like how the RE: Vendetta movie portrays the series. There's always new tech to learn and you feel like a badass every time you play if you're willing to learn.

The interconnected campaign system is really cool, you can tell they really focused on multiplayer and co-operative play with this entry. There are 4 campaigns and all of them have points where they cross over into the other's campaign. Leon's campaign has large fights where Ada shows up to help him and Helena, if another player is at that section of Ada's campaign at the same time you are they'll actually join into your lobby as Ada temporarily before splitting off again. All of the campaigns seem to overlap story-wise too and there are little tellers to the other campaigns as you play through them. There's a point in Leon's campaign where you take a plane to China, if you look at the TVs on the plane you can see live news feed of an attack in China going on with members of the BSAA fighting them. When you play Chris' campaign you'll actually push aside the guy who was recording that live news feed and experience that fight. There's a couple other points where this happens and if you're a big RE fan you'll love the cross-overs and character reunions, otherwise this system doesn't really work anymore because people are all playing with the feature turned off or more likely you wont be able to find anyone playing at the exact same time as you which sucks because it's a really cool feature that I imagine felt amazing when the game was released.

The game has so much extra-content and honestly most of my hours on the game come from playing through the extra-content. I would go through it all but it's got your standard RE Mercs mode where you have a set limit of enemies and you kill for time and score etc, as well as a handful of other modes that are super fun to play as a group.

HOWEVER, this game does have some pitfalls...
Mainly, I would've liked more DLC that included characters from other RE games, for example RE5 included Rebecca despite her not being in the story. This is just my personal problem I guess because the game does already come with 8 (9 but Carla is just a reskin of Ada) unique characters all with different weapons and take-downs, I just sort of exhausted them and would've liked getting characters like Wesker, Rebecca, Carlos, Jill & HUNK for example.

On the topic of HUNK, Ada's campaign is honestly the worst campaign in the game and Co-Op functionality was clearly implemented last minute, you're better off playing the campaign completely solo because the campaign features Ada and a character added in a free update called ""Agent"" who serves no purpose other than allowing another player to tag along during Ada's campaign. The worst part about him is that he can't even interact with things and it completely ruins all immersion when Ada grapples somewhere and Agent just pops in out of nowhere because he's not actually supposed to be there. Why didn't they just make HUNK Ada's partner? At this point in the story Umbrella has collapsed and HUNK is supposedly a 'Legendary Merc-for-hire', both of them have had ties with Umbrella and have very notable reputations. Could've done a whole lot more with Ada's campaign instead of making it only about her relationship with Derek Simmons. Would've even allowed for a cool cliche moment where [spoiler] Ada and Carla get into a melee fight and HUNK doesn't know which Ada to shoot [/spoiler] ! Instead it's just about a government official being creepy and stalking Ada because she's hot and destroying most of the world for no real explained reason other than him having an obsession with someone who he's only met in person like twice. Frankly this makes for a terrible villain and highlights how they ran out of ideas on how to continue the story after killing Wesker off. If we had HUNK, the game would've definitely more attractive to a lot of people and we'd have another unique character to play around with in the extra-content.

They've also done the RE Character thing where they introduce these amazing characters only to just make them disappear from existence from every other title in the franchise. Jake Muller, the biological son of Wesker - A pretty big title and name to live up to hasn't been heard from in RE7 or RE8, he just flirts with Sherry and it implies they become close and then he just goes around the world helping people. That's it. Despite him being near superhuman and a carrier of Project W (<- Uncertain but for some reason he has antibodies to the C-Virus so this is the only logical explanation) he just disappears...
Same with his partner Sherry who actually still has the G-Virus in her blood which shows how it allows her to regenerate wounds also disappears throughout RE7 and 8 with no explanation.

Piers Nivans was the Sheva replacement and he was an amazing character, arguably he was a better squadmate for Chris than Jill was in terms of their compatibility and dynamic, Chris being a teacher who fell from grace and Piers being there to pull him back to reality and remember his core values, amazing. Unfortunately Capcom gave us the finger and [spoiler] Killed him as well as gave him an off-screen death [/spoiler] which is such a waste of a great character.

Jill also isn't mentioned at all, she just vanished too.

As someone who's really invested in the lore and story of Resident Evil, for a continuation of the series it adds literally nothing because everything that happens wraps its-self up in the story and writes its-self out.

💼Co-op.
💼Zombies

VERDICT:
After playing this game, I've come to the conclusion that the devs wanted a more action packed game over what they did best, a horror. This started at RE5 and I can't help but feel that they should go back to the original genre, less action and more horrifying scenes! It's also sad to see them remove the item management side.

Now that's out the way, RE6 isn't a terrible game, as much as the die hard fans want it to be. The game play is good and the cut-scenes are brilliant! Theirs plenty to play for, since there's 4 campaigns to choose from, Leon, Chris, Jake and Ada. All of them showing a different side of the whole picture which I think was a great idea. They've stuck with the co-op franchise which is a lot better than the previous RE but I'm more relieved that people are still playing, without you guys, the game would have been a little harder. If you're looking for a story driven game, then look no further because that is the highlight of this game.
Total Score = 83/100.

GAMEPLAY:
Players control Chris Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy, Jake Muller, and Ada Wong as they confront the force behind a worldwide bio-terrorist attack. The story is centred around their four interwoven campaigns, and every campaign features a unique style in both tone and gameplay.

After chapter 3 in Leon's campaign, I honestly think it's awful. Leon is nearly irrelevant to the plot here. I am pretty sure his obsession was not love but more wanting what he couldn't have. Ada’s involvement in his life has been limited to a single routine and it involves Ada mincing about until Leon shows up, using him, and saving him so she can do it all over again in another game. Love is a strong word, I think she cares about him and doesn’t have romantic feelings for him.

I enjoyed a bit of every single campaign but Chris' is my favorite. Chris’ campaign definitely had the most focus and knew exactly what it wanted to be; an action game with mutant super soldiers. The others had experimental sections, which had me almost yawning. The 'horror' in Leon’s isn't that bad, I guess. However, it does nothing to create tension. Although, Leon’s campaign is the closest to a proper Resident Evil campaign, but it features laughable set pieces that I can’t help but love.",1659353482,1660576033,True,5,1,0.590297460556030273,1,True,False,False

Played & Completed the game first time on 28 July, 2022.

I would like to say game RE6 is amazing action shooter game rather than horror survival genre. Game have literally 4 campaigns too play with characters Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller & Ada Wong perspectives to the event happening in the game. Man this Resident Evil game is really big it took me 24 hours to beat all 4 campaign story. My favourite campaign story was of obviously Leon & Chris. Big Salute to Piers. I liked all action sequences of the game despite some of real time events with frustrated camera angle is real mess specially the running & escaping sequence from B.O.W. is literally very bad i didn't like at all. Otherwise game is amazing for me wholesome experience. For other this game is underrated but for me it's best action shooter game literally i got feeling of games like Tomb Raider, Uncharted & Sleeping Dogs in certain sections of the game.

I'll start off with the good:

The sound design and voice acting is fantastic. The sound you hear when the head of an enemy pops is just something else. Similar with the voice acting, all the voice actors did a great job. Unfortunately, that's all the good things I can say about this game.

Now the bad.

The story:

The game is separated into 4 separate campaigns, those being: Leon, Chris, Sherry, and Ada, and in all of these you have a sidekick character with you at all times. The concept that all these campaigns are interconnected and present different perspectives of the overall story is neat, but the execution is atrocious. What really happens is you're forced to replay the same sections as different characters multiple times, for example, instead of giving you to play out two separate ways for separate campaigns, you just repeat the same fights or mechanics in a new campaign as in the previous one. 

Leon's campaign starts off strong and gives you serious classic RE vibes where you're exploring dark cathedrals and empty hallways, however it quickly devolves into a generic action shooter style of game. The stupidity of the characters is insulting. For example, Leon's clearly had a lot of experience with zombies before, yet here, during a cutscene, he will point a gun at the main villain while delivering a spiel of how ""we're gonna stop you no matter what"", and yet he'll wait for the bastard to fully transform into some eldrich monstrosity instead of, you know, blowing his brains out immediately.

Chris's campaign is just bad. Absolutely thoroughly shit. It doesn't even attempt to resemble something from the RE universe. The whole story is just him running around and shooting everything all the time in a poorly-made Call of Duty-esque fashion. This story can basically be summarized as ""Chris makes mistakes because he's an incompetent moron, but somehow he manages to put all the blame on Ada and tries to kill her."" This campaign is BY FAR the worst one.

Sherry's campaign is actually quite bearable. The story itself is nothing to write home about, but it's not terrible either. The new character (the sidekick) is actually quite interesting and not entirely cringe, unlike Chris. By the mid point through the campaign, I just couldn't deal with how shit the gameplay was, so I uninstalled this piece of malware and watched the story of the remainder of this and Ada's campaigns on YouTube.

Ada's campaign seems pretty mediocre, too. After the three others, you kinda expect this one to finally tie everything together and explain the motivations of some of the characters, as well as to provide some context to the story, but it barely does any of that.

Now the worst offender of it all, the gameplay:

This game has fuck-all to do with the classic style of RE gameplay. It tries to be a 3rd person action shooter, but it does an incredibly shit job at that. I don't even know where to start with this section.

The movement is pretty bad. Moving over any obstacles requires an interaction with a separate button press. Virtually all enemies use guns, yet the cover mechanics in this game are basically non-existent (you can lean and peek from a wall while your character is standing near a wall, but you can't crouch and hide behind low cover). The camera is inconsistent at best, with the angle being terrible, and the game being riddled with idiotic sections of a fixed camera angle that changes every few seconds.

Enemies don't really respond to being shot. They either stagger slightly or completely ignore being shot entirely. Their AI is completely broken, as sometimes you'll see several enemies just running against an obstacle, or standing next to you, your sidekick, or some other NPC and literally doing nothing.

Speaking of AI, you can play this game with a friend, who controls the sidekick character, or you can play solo with the game's AI controlling them. If you choose to play with the AI, it will choose to either do nothing (as in literally just stand there), or go on a complete murder-rampage. There is no in-between, and unfortunately, 80% of the time, they do nothing. Basically the AI is mentally disabled. You love to see it.

The level design is just crap. Levels are boring and extremely linear. There's no puzzles for you to solve, no documents to find, only some lame collectible emblems.

The game also can't just stick to a single gameplay model. In each campaign, they keep introducing moronic new mechanics that are used once and then never seen again. They keep doing this over, and over, and over again.

The fucking QTEs. God fucking damn idiotic-ass QTEs for every little fucking thing ever. They're not difficult or anything, just pointless and annoying. They do not add anything to the game, just detract from it.

The boss fights are.... I'm really at a lack for words for how bad they are. Aside from the bosses never fucking dying (basically you have a boss fight, you kill the boss, then 5 minutes later SURPRISE!, they're not actually dead, go fight them again! This is usually repeated 5 - 6 times for each boss), there's also fights against goddamn helicopters. And yes, that's a plural ""fights"", there are at least 4 instances where the boss is a goddamn helicopter. The bosses themselves are just so so soooo shit. Leon gets to fight some big-titty slime spider chick and a grasshopper-ass looking motherfucker, Chris is pinned up against a fetus, Sherry has to deal with a dollar-store knock-off version of Nemesis, and Ada fights a jizz flood. For reference how shit these fights are, in the fetus fight (that's a fuckin' phrase I never thought I'd write), I found that the most efficient strategy to fight on the Professional difficulty was to just do nothing and let your moron teammate do his scripted bullshit, after which you run up to the boss and press a button prompt. Repeat this three times and you win. C A P T I V A T I N G   G A M E P L A Y.

Driving sections and turret sections also exist. They are very bad. Try imagining the worst driving section you can manage. It's still not as bad as the ones in this game. Hell, they even managed to shove one into one of the boss fights. It lasts around 15 seconds before it's over, which makes me question what the fuck the point of it was.

As for the UI, Capcom probably hired a team of scientists to research and develop the worst UI a human could ever experience. It's absolutely idiotic. You don't even have a normal inventory screen. Hell, you CAN'T EVEN PAUSE THE FUCKING GAME. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK???? Who the shit thought THAT was a good idea. If I need to quickly go throw up after playing this shit for 10 minutes, I can't even pause this fucking trainwreck so that my characters don't die while I'm gone.

I'm fuckin' tired of this shit, man. The game broke something in me that I don't think I'll ever get back. If you're thinking of getting this so you can play with a friend just to laugh at how bad this is, just don't. This game goes way past being the level of ""so bad it's funny"", even ""so bad it's tragic"". It makes itself at home on the ""so bad it's actually offensive"" level. It's even worse that RE5, in my opinion, which is an achievement in and of itself.

If you value your time and sanity, skip RE5 and RE6, watch a quick story summary on YouTube, and go play RE7. I hear that one's actually good, unlike this raccoon-shit filled atrocious fucking dumpster fire.",1658665109,1658983247,False,2,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It astounds me how some of the levels made it past QA and into the game itself. There are various areas were enemies can bodyblock you into a corner and essentially stunlock you to death. Add to that enemies that can stagger you from a distance, and you have a game that becomes difficult not because it actually challenges you, but because you have to actively fight the damn camera on top of the gimmicks thrown in.

I just finished Leon's campaign for the first time and would like to give some considerations.

Well, I know many fans don't like this one because it is more like a Michael Bay movie then a survival horror. I don't mind the action turn this game took, I really enjoyed the small amount of suspense at the beginning of this campaign, but I wouldn't say I disliked the parts with more action either. I have played many other games in the series and have come to enjoy them each in their own way.

However, a few things bothered me deeply in this one. First thing to notice was that the inventory management system seemed to be not practical at all, choosing an Item or weapon mid fight was more dangerous than what has been achieved in the dark souls system, for me at least.

Second thing: quicktime events. My 10 years old self might have enjoyed them, but my today self did not. I barely died to enemies or agent hunters, most of my deaths came from the incessant quicktime events that sometimes wouldn't even compute my inputs.

Third thing that comes to mind was having to fight different variations of the same boss. It seemed like lazy writing to just stick the same character over and over as the biggest challenge presented to the player.

Anyway, despite the things I disliked about the game, I am being able to enjoy it. I'm also looking forward to the next campaigns, and maybe going coop again. I had a few players joining in as partners or agent hunters and it was nice to see that this game from 2013 still has an active community.",1658451015,1658451015,True,3,0,0.56081080436706543,0,True,False,False

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Coop is great.
- The mercenaries mode is the best there is in the Resident Evil series, probably.
- It's a nice idea to divide the campaign into several protags with newcomers and returning characters.
- Piers is great.
- WAY better controls than previous resident evil games, you can move while aiming! Although with some awful flaws (See cons below).
- Sherry is back and better than ever.
- The melee system is great, but... (See cons below).

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- You can't mute yourself in voice chat, so you have to disable your mic... Weirdest part? You can mute OTHERS.
- Windowed mode is hidden, it's not in options, I had to google it (Hint: Alt + Enter).
- Melee combat has a stamina system for whatever fucking reason. The way it was implemented feels more annoying than anything.
- Critical hits feel more like critical misses due to having special recoil and animations.
- The story is... not very good. It feels more narmier than usual. Resident Evil 4, which was cheesy, was so in a good way. I felt myself pulling my hair over some cutscenes... and Jake feels like some strange fanfiction creation.
- For whatever reason, you can't pause.
- Camera angles. Lots of them. Expect to either die or receive damage unfairly in certain moments as you adjust your movement to them.
- The idea of having 4 player coop and agent hunt modes, while cool at the time, is now eh as the game has aged and people don't play it much anymore. This isn't the game's fault however and is just there so you know what to expect.
- Some awful bugs here and there. I've often had my friend disconnect or gotten stuck in a wall. Luckily solved once you reach a checkpoint and restart from there but it's annoying nonetheless.
- For whatever unholy reason, you're gonna have to get used to the god awful interface they have in this game. The one in RE5 was simple, but the one in here is gonna have you get used to it, and when you're done with the campaign, other player characters have other interfaces restarting progress once again.",1658419172,1658419172,False,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Having played resident evil 4 and 5 recently, this game takes time to get accustomed to.  I recommend jumping into Mercenaries before playing the campaign, to learn the controls and what not.
The campaign is all action, zero puzzles, as far as I have played.
One major flaw I see, is the upgrading system.  Its incredibly simple and constricting. You should be able to equip more than 3 upgrades at once, but they should take longer to upgrade as a trade off.

Leon/Helena: Not okay. I didn't like it. I don't know why.
Chris/Piers: One of the best in RE games. I only recommend it because of Chris campaign.
Jake/Sherry: Awesome. 
Ada: Awesome as well but short.

Firstly I have to say that the game was not good. I really want to know why they didn't create inventory menu like RE 4 and even RE 5 for this. This has always been one of the most important part for a RE game.

The B.O.W.s can be annoying at some point. They thought making more actions and put a lot of Call of Duty action-like elements would be great for a RE game but it wasn't.

As a conclusion, Ethan Winters and masterpieces like RE 7 and Village is the result of the RE 6 flop and at least we should be thankful for that. I hope they do RE 9 in third person again.",1657169545,1658146763,True,0,0,0.566799640655517578,0,True,False,False

While the story may not be the most amazing, its still a fun game and does a lot of things that were very unique.
The coop element of the game allowing players who are playing different campaigns to band together randomly to fight a boss they've both arrived at in their campaign is ABSOLUTELY COOL, even more so the fact that the boss can be PLAYER CONTROLLED was also in itself an amazing feature even if it was rough around the edges. 
In addition this game has PVPVE in all the campaigns where a player can take control of an enemy character in peoples campaign and try to hinder their progress. 
Your combat ability as all the characters is absolutely astounding as well, being able to roll, jump, dodge, quick fire, remain on your back on the ground firing your weapon from your back while scooting backwards slowly to avoid a zombie from grabbing your legs.

Story's decent, gameplay's consistent, it controls greatly as well and the music is really nice. I've encountered zero bugs during my playthrough. But there's a massive flaw that can be a dealbreaker for so many people.

Aside from Ada's story, this game is NOT designed for single-player playthroughs. You're gonna end up having a pretty boring time for the most part. I've lost interest of this game as I have nobody to play with. Split-screen is a nice way of giving both you and your partner eye-strain because the screen placement is horrible.

The game has a severe lack of puzzles. I'm fairly sure that only Ada had puzzles and action while everyone else had only action. If you were a fan of puzzle sections in RE, then I'm afraid to tell you that you're gonna be disappointed.

But probably one of the worst parts in my opinion is also what proves that this game isn't designed for single-player playthroughs: there's no fucking pause button. I am not kidding. There's no true pause in the game, I mean you can bring up a menu by pressing start and choose options, quitting the game and shit but the game doesn't even pause. So yeah you can't really take a break unless you are in a safe zone (which is really hard to figure out most of the time) and the checkpoint system doesn't really work so well for you to quit and then resume the game.

I'm recommending this game because it is truly a good game BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PLAYING WITH A FRIEND OR SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO INTERESTED IN PLAYING THIS GAME. You will have a good time, but not anywhere NEAR as fun as RE5.",1657066588,1657066588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No game in this franchise or even dare I say the world even comes close to how amazing this game is, the gameplay is unmatched across gaming, the series was seriously falling off after the atrocities that were the other games but somehow this game carries the whole franchise, it is just so amazing

Pros
The gameplay is amazing, i like the loop of walking around buildings and shooting zombies, I really like how the game never tells you what to do, it makes me so immersed in this horror situation and makes me feel like I am there it is so good

I like how the gameplay is so consistent, in fact they don't ever do stupid mechanics like ""Level Design"" or ""Challenge"" i just love the gameplay loop of, exclusively shooting, the puzzles are so easy which is amazing, I am glad the game returns the series to what it was known for which was shooting things for hours on end

Cons
None

Completely shedding the Survival-Horror mainstays you've come to expect and reshaping itself into a mediocre Action-Horror blockbuster with a focus on less horror, and more big explosions, rivaling some of the worst B-Movies I've ever watched, even more so than it's predecessor. So you may be asking, why am I recommending this game instead of throwing it into the dirt like many others? Well, in my opinion, behind all of the questionable narrative decisions and janky game design, there is a genuinely entertaining B-Movie schlock fest of a video game that is more than a blast to play with friends. Although, I would hold off on the mere idea of playing this game if you're planning on going in solo, as this game was clearly built with co-op in mind, and playing without another person to help you throughout the 4 separate campaigns this game has to offer is a hell on earth experience I wouldn't wish on my mortal enemy. But, if you have a friend you wanna laugh your ass off with and 8 bucks to spare during a sale, I highly recommend this game.

We are in good terms now and as I purchased this game when it was on sale, it brought back so many memories for my brother and me when we booted it up and saw the title screen. We genuinely spent a couple of days together playing the various campaigns and enjoying it immensely together as we really felt nostalgic with it.

The storyline was engaging and interesting to play through. It took me some time to get used to the controls again, but after I figured out how everything worked, it wasn't too difficult. Although there were some parts that were so difficult to manage that they required too many tries and attempts to get them right, I'm not sure if I should blame the controls, the game section, or us (I'm more or less specifically talking about Jake's campaign snowmobile section, which has always been annoying to get through and was honestly our hated section together).

People have criticized the game for not being scary enough or being too action-packed, which I respect and understand. After all for almost everyone the main idea behind Resident Evil is that you must survive against dangerous and challenging enemies while dealing with the horror of it all, through various scenarios and locations that are terrifying to traverse, but this game was more or less different from that, and I could say it focused more on the story aspect, which was action-packed rather than the series' actual horror.

For the most part, I was completely enamored with this game. It was enjoyable to play with my brother, and we had an absolute blast with just really going through with one of my favorite childhood classics. We might even play it again in a few years simply to relive the nostalgia.

If you're looking for a game to play with a loved one or a friend, I highly recommend this; it'll be a great bonding experience for even casual players and fans of the franchise.

CAPCOM, WTF HAPPENED!? 
Furthermore, the tone of this game doesn't make a shred of sense. It tries to take itself seriously while simultaneously relying on absurdity as shown in the use of excessive cutscenes with vehicles and biohazards. There are a lot of anticlimactic moments and punchlines that don't land, but what really seals the nail in the coffin for this game is the gameplay. First of all the camera tricks the player into a false sense of security. You may think you have full control over the camera's movement for a while, that is until you unknowingly initiate a ""cinematic"" sequence that will subsequently make the camera turn in directions against your will. Combine this with the camera shifting from the typical over the shoulder perspective of your character to a myriad of arbitrary camera angles against your will and you get a migraine-inducing mechanical mess. Second of all, inventory management. There are no attaché cases that progressively increase in size as you get further in the game like in Resident Evil 4 or a passive inventory with 54 slots in addition to an active inventory with 9 slots like in Resident Evil 5. Instead there's a single active inventory with a meagre 9 slots to work with. Nothing is upgradable and the only thing you can buy are skill points which could have been an interesting concept, except there's a caveat in that no more than 3 of them can be equipped at any time. With the number of total skills being around 15x that amount, along with the cost/prevalence ratio of skill points in missions, it's a statistical improbability for the player to ever use the vast majority of these. Picking up too many items will inevitably lead to a situation with no other choice but to discard items as you cannot sell anything in this game either. Lastly there are sections where you are forced to walk at a snail's pace like in chapter 1 of Leon's campaign. Moreover there are sections where nothing is happening and you simply have to wait until the game decides enough time has passed by. There are no ways to speed these up or skip them and it practically kills all remaining replay value that potentially could have lingered within this blight.

Jake- Jake's gameplay is nothing but hide and seek. It takes the idea of Resident Evil 3's Nemesis hunt and dumb it down to the entire campaign. It's dull and uninspired. 
Ada- Ada's chapter feels like an afterthought. The only reason this Chapter exist is to tell behind the scenes scenarios.

another problem i had with re4&5 was that they were super weird and unclear with what to do next and play through, and like. i'm not really an action game player? im kinda new to this whole thing in general but i got lost SOO easily. and some of the enemies were SOOO strong and hard to kill and complicated, and that! kind of tanked my gameplay experience!

re6 does not have that! imo the enemies are fairly balanced in regards to killing, tho i swear to god theres this one boss fight that makes me SOOO uncomfortable. but like if u dont care abt the lore or the plot and are just here solely for gameplay, this one's fun! idk abt the coop but, im enjoying it so far.

It's over-the-top action, and there's like four campaigns, and I've played through some of them, but from what I've heard, none are particularly amazing, but it's all up to your own opinion. I played the Leon campaign with my brother, and it's fun. It's not scary, and it's action packed. I loved the action, but it felt less like a RE game and more like a generic action game. The mercenaries mode is fun too. I hate the inventory system though...it really sucks ass. 

You can tell this game was an attempt to try to please everyone. Chris's campaign is more action packed (well they really all are), and Leon's is supposed to be scarier, etc. It has some cool mechanics, like you can shoot on your back, slide, and roll. Your character is quite agile, and can perform some cool melee attacks.

I can understand the hate for this game, especially because they didn't have access to many great RE games that came out like Revelations, or RE7/8/RE2 Remake that honed in heavily on horror. But, if you don't take it too seriously, just try it. The story is fine. It's a cheesy RE story. It's not scary. It's action packed, and it's more nostalgic with zombie and zombie-like enemies. At the time, this might have felt like a disgrace, but now it just seems like a small misstep in the series, but Capcom has regained its footing and has consistently been making quality action packed, but harrowing adventures.",1654754281,1654754506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a tricky game to recommend. I would only say that if you're a huge fan of the Resident Evil series that you should give this game a try. But tbh, you're not missing much since a lot of people consider this as one of the dumbest/worst resident evil games in the series. 

This is NOT a horror game as much as it tries to advertise it. There is nothing scary and it's just filled with over the top ridiculousness. It doesn't have a theme or identity. It tries to do everything in one package. Which at first sounds good, but it doesn't work. You end getting a subpar experience in the horror, action, story and etc. 

You get 4 campaigns:
- Leon is ""horror"" focused. 
- Chris is action focused
- Jake is over the top action. 
- and Ada (that ties it all together)  

It tries to please everyone and it doesn't work. Myself who enjoys horror, never felt scared or tense throughout the Leon scenario. Then when came to the other campaigns, I slogged through them and didn't really have a memorable experience. When it came to end of the game and pieced together the plot. I just didn't care. 

For example. In the Chris Campaign. [spoiler] I never felt a connection to him. In the game, he suffers from PTSD when his entire squad gets wiped out. So he goes on this need for revenge. But for me, it never made any sense from his character because of the previous games. He has lost very close S.T.A.R.S team members in the original game. He didn't have this mental breakdown or stop fighting monsters when his closest friend and partner, Jill Valentine was assumed dead in Resident Evil 5. So it feels out of character, or does he care more about strangers than his friends?  [/spoiler] 

In Jake campaign. You will literally not give a toss about anything. Even when they bring characters and plot pieces relating to the previous games. I got this impression that it was poorly tagged in just to have any relevance to Resident Evil timeline. Like, these characters could've been anything or anyone else. But one writer just went; ""Oh yeah, he/she is X long-lost family relative that wasn't mentioned or hinted in the past"". It makes Sonic fan fiction writing look more appealing than whatever the writers did this.

They didn't keep it simple and tries tackle a lot of elements. But it ruins the flow and again, just get tacky and has a terrible structure in the story.  

The controls is great. I enjoy being able to move and shoot, melee, dive and sprint. But it somewhat backfires even during Leon horror segments. It's okay for an action sequence, but not so great when it's trying build tension. It's fun, but it's far from a resident evil game. What I also noticed is that the character interface is different for each campaign. So after playing several hours on Leon. You'll have get used to the new interface for Chris, Jake and Ada. While it's not a big issue, it can be distracting. 

There is ZERO puzzles, and focuses entirely on the action. Which if you're looking for that experience with a friend. It can be a good experience. It can get comical in a lot of places where the game will get even more ridiculous every chapter. Which if you're with a friend, can be a good laugh. If you felt like the planning and tension in the previous games wasn't your cup of tea. Then you can strap yourself in and enjoy the ride for this fast-faced game. 

The theory behind this is because of the Resident Evil 5. Sadly, despite people saying that the previous titles are miles better. Resident Evil 5 focused more on the action and sold vastly more than any of the other games. I think this made Capcom believe that Resident Evil 6 should be taken in this direction. 

There is only a few good elements in this game. But I can't honestly recommend it even if you pay the discounted price. I can say you should play this if you have friend who is also interested and enjoys Resident Evil...for just one weekend. If you're buying this on a sale and want to play it yourself. You might be able to enjoy some elements. This is not the worst thing or even a terrible game, but it fails to be gripping compared to other games. 

It offers a massive variety and the game gives over +20 hours playtime. But in this game case, more doesn't mean better. I'd say skip it and go play something else.",1654588687,1654588687,False,18,1,0.560228586196899414,0,True,False,False

With a quick video refresher on the story, I picked up where I left off with this installment. It was certainly an adjustment from what I'm used to. The areas with endless enemies are quite different from games I had played previously, and when the enemies become more powerful, leaving a zone without exploring an excessive amount was a bummer. This typically doesn't happen though and I was able to clear most areas.

That being said, I found the story to be interesting, and I liked that there were four different arcs that wove together. From what I read, the game seems to get a lot of criticism. I'm not sure why. While certainly not the best installment, it's still a good game. It has plenty of flaws, but the combat is quite fun and ammo drops are frequent. This allowed me to be a bit more aggressive and worry about headshots less. The biggest issue I experienced was an awkward camera that is frequently jittery as it bumps into the floor while running. Some camera switches during boss fights and scenes where I needed to move quickly caused unnecessary deaths. Other than that, not major complaints.

Graphics are good for a game that came out in 2012. Voice acting is good. Music is pretty decent. Even though the game is dated, for the amount of content, the asking price seems far.

I started playing this after i finished re5 and went in with high expectations and enthusiasm as to how the series will expand after 2 successful action takes on the survival horror genre. It would be an understatement to say i was left feeling sorely disappointed..The horror element is noneexistent and action scenes and qte's are being shoved to your face nonstop. The gameplay mechanics are tedious and needlessly complicated, making the already clunky controls and combat system a chore to operate. Another aspect that really tilted me personally was the save system, which instead of normally saving your current progress even if it says so, it never really does forcing the player to replay massive segments of the story just to get to the point where he exited the game at the time. I can't really say a lot about the enemy variety since i didn't finish the whole game but i've come across a few different enemy types which was a nice surprise at least..weirdly enough the enemies have a certain bullet-sponginess to them, which i quite disliked. In my opinion the only redeeming factor is the cutscene quality, which i found superb along with the online multiplayer where you can progress through the game with another player by your side and lastly the story which seemed serviceable so far. At the end of the day i personally think that this game is a far cry from the rest of the titles in the series in terms of the horror and gameplay aspects and as much as it pains me to say it did not feel like resident evil to me..i might try to finish it with an online partner in the future because im kinda curious about how the story unfolds and because going shooty shooty with zombies is always fun as heck xD",1653995311,1654340328,False,11,1,0.574766278266906738,0,True,False,False

 [h1]Quick Summary[/h1]
Resident Evil 6 starts with a combat system I love, throwing in a wide variety of enemies that couldn’t keep up with my already high power level, but that’s nothing new to the series. Then, as the game went on, it felt like they forgot what made the game fun. So, they piled on a mixture of shallow and repetitive spectacle bosses, the most QTE’s ever, a lot of varied yet unpolished gameplay “additions”, with a story so long and convoluted that seemed to go nowhere. After 12 hours, we rang the bell and tapped out.

[h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31495025/] My Personal Curator List [/url] [/h1]

[h1]Promising Premise[/h1]
RE 6 offers four total campaigns focusing on a single character's perspective of the story, with Leon and Chris being the two I played. Jake’s and Ada’s are the ones I did not attempt, as you hopefully will understand why later. On paper, this idea of a massive interconnected plot, with each one being different, sounds amazing, but in execution not so. Let me start from the beginning and see how I grew to dislike RE 6.

You start with Leon’s campaign mid-story in an odd prologue to tease what is to come later; here, it is mostly QTE prompts to escape a helicopter, open a door, and shoot a zombie. Yes, that should have been a warning of things to come. Once you get past that prologue, which you will replay when it comes up hours later, the game finally lets you enjoy some actually great shooting and improved melee combat.

[h1]The Best Action in the Series[/h1]
The gameplay has changed to allow moving and shooting at the same time, which is nice, even if it’s sad to see the previously unique style gone. Your melee move-sets have been expanded with stamina to manage now, to prevent spamming these new martial art moves to disarm or kill enemies. The best addition is a prone move that allows diving into, sliding, dodging, and shooting enemies like a tactical god. There is an instance with saw blades that you can prone under that is the crowning moment of this new move.

These great new additions are carried into each campaign, with every character having different melee hit combos, stealth, throws, and counter animations that are truly amazing and offer depth for a series that was just simple shooting. These new additions bring RE into its best action feeling, even after RE 8. It’s just a shame the enemy AI and difficulty are not brought up to match this newfound power, think of RE 5 but you are Neo.

This praise and actual enjoyment are mostly from the first 3 chapters of Leon’s campaign. Up to this point, it contains one fun boss(that is just a beefed-up zombie) with cannon fodder helping showcase how fun the combat is when it’s simple. The brisk pace of new zombies, locations, weapons, and the ratio of gameplay to non-gameplay is nicely balanced. This is about the halfway mark, as each campaign is six hours long with five chapters each. So three out of the total ten I played were enjoyable. Then the game takes a slow descent into disaster until we get to Chris’s campaign where it plummets.

[h1]Just Give up on writing, Resident Evil[/h1]
Before that, I need to explain the story: in order to have a story, stuff needs to happen, right? RE 6 has a lot of stuff happen and yet nothing really does. Characters will go places, get betrayed, the villains will die, and then come back to life half a dozen times. They will kill your comrades or entire cities and then you let them go because you don’t have time to explain why and never get any answers. It’s so circular that it felt like after 12 hours nothing happened, you might as well skip the cutscenes, and you will basically get the same idea of what’s happening.

A huge problem that happens here, is that in all the previous games each had a relatively low amount of story and therefore cutscenes, and let you just play the game. Here, it feels like you can’t go five minutes without something to interrupt the core reason you play RE, to the point that it feels like half of the game is non-gameplay.

[h1]A lot but Shallow[/h1]
The game takes you around the globe from a city similar to Raccoon, then to China, and lastly to Europe, in some well-crafted levels that you will revisit with other characters later. Probably the coolest moment was a laser hallway of death leading to explosive Roombas that you had to get rid of. For the most part, I feel the game is afraid to have you just move through a level without something outside of normal combat breaking it up, which rears its ugly head towards the end of Leon’s campaign.

[u]A short list of stuff that breaks the flow of fun[/u]:
[list][*]Boss fights where one person does literally nothing
[*]Turret sections
[*]Bosses that feel like cutscenes instead of playing 
[*]A car chase 
[*]Flying a jet 
[*]The worst and most amount of QTEs in the series
[*]Chris’s clear Call of Duty inspired sections
[*]Sequences that are unskippable gameplay cutscenes
[*]Puzzles that aren’t puzzles
[/list]

With Leon’s main villain, you barely fight him and your co-op partner during one literally can’t. He will transform from a dog to a T-rex, then a fly. These over-the-top boss fights might sound or look cool in a trailer but is terribly boring and tedious when the more simple bosses where you just shoot big zombies were more fun. You “kill” him each time in some explosion or fire to the point that you just give up caring as it overstayed its welcome the first time he wasn’t killed.

The 3rd campaign's character, Jake, who is Wesker’s son, so it’s further tied to the series’ lore. The reason they need him is to end the virus. Just imagine if RE 5 had a separate campaign centered around Sheeva, especially after how bad Chris’s campaign was. 

[h1]The Descent into Despair[/h1]
I can stomach the story because you can skip it, or not pay attention if it’s too long. The same can not be done while playing. You have those “gameplay” sections I mentioned above, which feel like 70% of Chris’s campaign if you also include the cutscenes. They went with an insane amount of variety and yet none of it was enjoyable at all. I would rather have QTE running sections from RE 4 and 5 over actually having to do it. I now understand why they overused them so much, as they have to be inept to screw up running, and yet they did, as platforms are wide and yet so narrow that if one of us made the slightest movement off the path, it resulted in death, so would jumping, or looking around. Also, the car chase and jet flying felt more like a proof of concept that was thrown in, as they sound cooler than they actually play.

Further proof of these half-baked ideas, the inventory is now expanded to allow more items,  an improvement from RE 5, but now it has a carousel format so scrolling takes longer, and removing and managing items is now a pain. The real kicker here is that every new gun takes up a slot and you can’t drop them. Even with the triple inventory space, it somehow feels like less as you will be constantly swapping weapons with how few bullets you will have with grenades and health taking up any free slots as well, fumbling the flow of the fun combat that they seemed to forget they had.

The final change from a system that everyone loved and worked perfectly from RE 4 and 5, the weapon upgrades are gone. Now you get poorly described perks from the score you get after each mission to basically do the same thing but they aren’t needed, as again you are a god with your newfound power.

Pros
-Co-op

-length of each campaign almost can be considered a full game for each
- Multiple returning characters from previous titles
-each character has own special weapon and attacks
-expansive move set and faster paced close quarters combat
-Multiple environments going across the globe 
-Mercenaries mode with lots of playable characters plus Left 4 Dead characters added in free 
- A huge variety of enemy types and enemies that mutate depending on damage taken to certain parts of body 
- bosses that are intriguing with their  types of mutations and each feel different 
-DLC is not needed to enjoy or complete the story for any plot holes

Cons

- some parts feel script heavy or go on too long 
- story or environments sometimes don't make much sense and go out there a couple of times

I really like this game, and I feel like it had the best combat gameplay out of every single Resident Evil game. Yeah, sure, it isn't scary, but the overall aspect of the game to me feels more intended to be an action game in my opinion.

People apparently bash on this game a lot, and I can understand that, but in my opinion, I love how you could dodge an enemy's attack when you couldn't do that properly before. Counterattacking was added in this game too, which really made it fun to go from enemy to enemy, potentially without losing a single block of health. It felt exhilarating to do that, and it still does.

And don't get me started on the online play. I absolutely loved how a player could join in on you throughout the game. Maybe some other people don't like it, but I really enjoyed that warm feeling in my chest when someone joined my session as a player. It felt like something was missing when I played the campaign, and when somebody joined, it really filled in that missing gap.

And if you can get it, areas where two players' stories intersect are hilarious. I was playing on Chapter 5 - Leon on No Hope with a friend of mine and when we got to the second to last area in the campaign where you fight Simmons alongside Ada, we actually ended up intersecting with a player. I played as Helena and there was actually an Agent character too, and it was absolutely hilarious. That's how we ended up as friends with those other players.

It's great to meet new people in this game, and having to communicate without voice chat, in my opinion, makes it even funnier.

I love this game.

Now as a shooter this also fails me as I could enjoy it but I have found the lack of being able to save to be annoying as I had to replay several events over again since I could not stay focused on the game and had to come back.  Shooting was pain as targeting worked against me with the sight moving away from where I wanted to aim.

I wanted to at least complete this game at least once but the 2 hours I did play this felt more like a chore then fun.  I can see where the devs needed to change directions for re7 (Which I enjoyed).

Resident Evil 6, what can I say about it.. When I finally got to play it on PS3, I was kinda disappointed by the gameplay.. Yeah, i understand they tried to implement some cool melee sequences, but it felt unnecessary.. I played thru the story campaigns, and when I completed them, I never played the game again. That was back sometime in late 2013 or 2014. This time around, I decided to buy it again for PC (since I've been into gaming on PC for almost a year now due to getting a gaming laptop), because it was on sale for cheap, and give it another chance. It was by playing through it again that I remembered why I never picked it up again back then: The gameplay did not seem as smooth as RE4 and 5 were, and while it helped to be able to shoot WHILE moving (something that wasn't present in RE4 and 5), it seemed the shooting was less consistent. 

I DID see that you could buy skills that could help with aiming, but I personally don't care for the kind of upgrade system Capcom implemented in the game! The upgrade system for weapons in 4 and 5 was MUCH better compared to 6! Not to mention, I think they totally overdid the quick time events in 6! You could be in the middle of a fight with a boss, and it goes to a scripted QTE, and when you complete one, another one pops up 2-3 seconds after, when you're not expecting one to pop up, making you totally miss the timing of the QTE and you get a game over screen! It's quite frustrating at times! The story campaigns are decent, but still leave you with questions! 

However, i would still recommend this game, because it's still a decent time-passer of a game. I just would suggest waiting for a sale before you get it, and be warned, you WILL get frustrated with it at some parts!",1580437893,1651987612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously though if you're going to play RE6 just do Leon's campaign, it's the closest you'll get to an RE-like experience here. Chris's campaign is just some Army of Two bootleg bullshit and Jake's campaign was so abysmal I just put it down at chapter 3 and read a plot summary. 

I was expecting RE6 to be a bad mark on an otherwise phenomenal franchise before getting to it but good god it was worse than i thought. I really do mean it when I say just play Leon's campaign.

   I mean, I do appreciate that some Resident Evil fans actually prefer a zombie-kickboxing simulator to a more atmospheric gaming experience, but seriously, does ANYONE out there actually like all this mechanics-breaking, quick-time-in-lieu-of-a-cutscene HORSESHIT?!  Okay, so maybe The Walking Dead games get away with some degree of it...but if the Resident Evil games are now aspiring to the level of immersion and emotional depth that THOSE games achieve, they may want to start paying some attention to concepts like themes, storytelling, and characterisation, don'tcha think?

   The opening sequence of this game is sooooo painful, they even give you an Achievement for getting through it, appropriately entitled ""The Longest Night"".  They even have the gall to call it a ""tutorial"", when it teaches you precious little other than how to die repeatedly because you don't understand the poorly-explained on-screen instructions of how to RUN...in a SINGLE DIRECTION...and then force you to watch the same ten-second snatch of cutscene OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN to atone for your aforementioned sins.  Next time, Capcom, just hawk up a great big loogie and spit it straight in my face, eh?
 
   Things then start to look a TINY bit more hopeful, as Leon and some chick we've never seen before make their slow, moody way through a super-darkened government building, which is seemingly full of spooky noises but no actual undead. It isn't long, however, before we're spin-kicking and pile-driving zombies, and trying to work out just how the hell you even switch from guns to grenades or use health items (all adventures in their own rights, believe me)!  On the whole, there's really nothing terribly intuitive here...not the controls, not trying to estimate how close you can get to a zombie with your flyin' feet before they can get at YOU...the early part of the game is a constant struggle, or at least it was for me, and I played this straight off the back of Resident Evils 4 and 5, and all the DLCS and ""bonus episodes"" attached to those (undeniably superior) games. 
 
   Overall, there's really not much respect given to long-term fans: this may as well be a big-budget rival company's rip-off of the RE franchise for all the continuity it serves up, both tonally and mechanically.  It's far from the worst game ever made...but it's definitely one of the weakest Resident Evil games, period.  (And I've even played obscure, long-forgotten shit like Dead Aim, the Outbreak series, and the Survivor series, for what it's worth.)
 
    For much of its length, this is barely even a horror game.  It's an action game with unfeasibly dark lighting and horror undertones.  Hell, as zombie-action games go, it's a long way from bad - even slightly ""thrilling"" upon occasion - but it's hardly honest-to-God HORROR, at least seventy-five per cent of the time.  And for all its attempted surliness, its ""grit"" never surpasses that of a Michael Bay movie (nice stubble, Leon, but you still have pretty-boy hair); and when all is said and done, it's still every bit as corny as a farmer's field in Summer (""Mr President, please don't make me do this!"" blubbers Leon, unwilling to shoot the prez, even though he's clearly turned into a FREAKING ZOMBIE)!
 
   A message to the developers of Resident Evil 7: stop catering to the undiscerning fans of those awful Milla Jovavich movies, and stop pandering to whatever is de rigueur in video games right at this very micro-second in time.  Multiplayer and/or A.I. partners DO NOT MAKE GAMES SCARY.  Quick-time events DO NOT MAKE GAMES SCARY.  Endless kickboxing moves DO NOT MAKE GAMES SCARY.  And making parts of your games so visually dark that you can't even tell what the hell just wounded you, IS JUST FRUSTRATING, NOT SCARY.  

   Pretty pretty please, let's do a little better next time, eh? This series is still pretty good...but it used to be GREAT.  The Revelations games seem to be heading in the right direction...how about lifting the game of the MAIN series, whad'ya say?
 
Verdict: 7.5/10.

This game took me around half a year to finish solely because playing it actively made me upset. I couldn't stomach doing more than a chapter at a time, and would often take a month long break between them. Playing this game is just so... sad. It's sad seeing everything I love about the series be replaced with quick time events and explosions.

This game is also way, way, way too long. I was ready to be done after the first campaign, but I still had three to go. Every time I played the mechanics which were originally new and fun quickly became more and more dull. I can only perform wrestling moves on monster so many times before it loses its cool. 

If you put these mechanics on another game I might actually like it. It is inherently fun to flip and flop around on the floor guns blazing. That's why I think that the mercenaries is the best thing in the package. Just some arcade fun with intuitive controls. But when you throw these mechanics on a game that is way too long and never switch it up... well it gets stale.

Also Leon is a shell of his former self and it makes me upset.

on another note this game has 4 different campaigns with different ui and combat playstyle:
1.leon's campaign has the nearest horror vibe but it's gone after fighting certain boss on 3rd part of campaign

2.chris' campaign is totally like call of duty stuff with enemies that can use any weapons & think like real human. they arent zombies indeed so it's ok. but what i dont like is the last boss on chris campaign. the camera view, man... totally the worst. i got killed more coz of the weird camera constantly change view rather than killed by the boss itself. yea sure it's coz the boss mow down the platform we used to passing but i think ya get the idea

3.jake's campaign is hahaha totally action. jake can use full hand-to-hand combat & it can be so powerful like certain boss on previous RE game. most of em fun i guess except the 2nd part of jake's campaign where we need to explore the snowy mountain in blizzard & with those snow mobile to run from avalance. killed me several times

4.ada's campaign? do i need to tell ya? well it sure is a bit fun. puzzles isnt that hard or so. but im more into previous ada's adventure on re 4 (edit: separate ways) for example. idk suited her more there? in here ada's role more into good-and-honest helper to anyone. makes me highly wonder why she did this. even more mystery

overall i enjoyed it & played it with my bf, my bff, my sisters so ok. but if i had to say, the most atrocious thing they made in this game is the inventory system. it goes from re 4 being good, re 5 being ok then re 6 makes me think ""s**t, i wanna go back to previous inventory system"" lol. i mean i cant even save my unused ammo or some other things. if we change characters we gonna need to finished the chapter again before gettin the same weapon. example if ya play as chris then ya got shotgun ya gonna need to replay as his partner piers to get shotgun again. 

but i gotta admit it this game is much more forgiving than previous RE games. like if ya died ya gonna get full hp on next attempt so it makes it easier. the content has much more to explore but i still didnt get some answers after finished the game. 

i had mixed feelings lol but aight my final score is 5/10. 

only coz of my fun experience within the game. if ur not a very big fan of re game & just wanna chill playin almost action-packed games like cod but with different kind of enemies ya buy this. i liked it but also hate it www",1646324357,1650285657,True,12,0,0.653443396091461182,0,True,False,False

At times i felt like they didn't know what to do so they just added another miniboss battle or swarm fight but the story of this game is pretty long and theres not to many of situations like that.

Graphics: 8/10 - While the game looks really beautifull and it isn't verry demanding for what it is some details
                           were just ignored on purpuse to lighten the load on the graphic cards.

Gameplay: 7/10 - Don't fix it if it's not broken, they tried to keep the old over the sholder mechanic but tweak 
                             a bit further which ruined it. Giving someone more options and abilities while also keeping
                             the same limitations as before feels more anyoing then inovative.

Story: 9/10 - As i said i love how they concluded some key parts of the story even though they didn't feel like 
                      they needed it and added new characters to the story as a whole which opens the possibility 
                      for a lot more content (which they didn't make so far) the story of this game is a bit confusing 
                      at times and needs some thinking over after you finish everything to make sense.

Overall: 9/10 - I love the fact that they kept the mercenaries, something they didn't in future games and the 
                        story follows the coop perfectly while also crossing other players coop sessions. The biggest 
                        problem in my opinion would be that the game is massively underrated so there isn't much 
                        interaction with other players.",1650204324,1650204324,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Presumably not the best game of the series and it offers no changes other than the visuals, however it offers action and enjoyment without complications, being the most ambitious Resident Evil entry in the franchise, maybe it should not be roasted too hard. It does offer 4 short stories in one game which are told from perspective of different characters, some of which we know from previous games like Chris, Leon and ADA. But to some this is a downer as the developers were not able to focus on one story. And to be honest I also felt a little bored playing kind of same story from different perspectives.

I wanted to play this mostly because it is co-op and I've roped another friend into playing scary games with me but also to see the wildness that cause Capcom to go 'mmm maybe we take this back to the drawing board' to sort of soft reboot the series with the following 7 and Village games.

Having played the Leon campaign so far (and I doubt stuff changes too drastically gameplay wise in the other campaigns) I can see why this game wasn't as beloved in the franchise known for scares and a creepy atmosphere. A LOT happens at once and you often fights hordes of zombies and other monsters at any one time and so many explosions and slow-mo happens that  you feel like watching an action movie more than playing a tense horror game. However in playing it with a friend, the enjoyment is pretty high and the game doesn't look terrible and everything works so on that front there isn't much to complain about.

The long and short is if you are a RE fan tried and true after so many years this might not be your game but if you also are a fan and want to bring a friend alone for the ride... worse games to play through honestly.",1649104414,1649104414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the time of its release, the game got savaged because of its many issues - which I'll comment about here. But with time, as the game got cheaper and more people where whiling to buy it despite the bad reviews, many players felt that it had positive aspects that weren't appreciated enough at its release. The question then becomes: do its positive aspects compensate for its issues?

After ""Resident Evil 5"" moved the focus of the franchise from horror to action, Capcom developers wanted the next game to double-down on action, while also having some sober horror elements to apparently appease fans of previous ""RE"" games - a way maybe to keep some of the franchise's identity in there. They also wanted the game to feel like an epic, with multiple campaigns, and focusing on several franchise favourites like Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Ada Wong. It is a game that feels very much like it wanted to be the most ""definitive"" game in the franchise.

But the final result is an uneven game that can go from pleasant to frustrating very quickly. It's a game that can be clumsy in its attempts to menage both its horror and action elements, and as a consequence, its horror is no longer scary, being more of a restrain on the action. My suggestion is that ""Resident Evil 6"" should have been an action game all along, scrapping all of its horror elements that just don't click with the overall vibe.

The game has four campaigns: Leon and Helena, Chris and Pears, Jake and Sherry, and then Ada. One thing I really liked about the game is the notion of the stories being interlinked: characters will find each other in their stories and influence them. By playing the game, you'll notice it has a strong focus on the idea of co-op - with the exception of Ada's campaign, all the campaigns can be played by two players. So much so that, like in ""Dark Souls"", the pause menu doesn't actually pause the game, which is common for online games. But of course you can play the game alone, as your partner will then be controlled by a very competent AI, who can manage itself against enemies and is quick to rescue you when you're down.

Leon's campaign is the most irregular. It starts off as a horror campaign, but it doesn't take long before it picks up and becomes more oriented to action. It has moments when it's not sure what it wants to be, and only at the end it becomes good. Chris' campaign is the most action-grounded of them all: you're a soldier fighting armed zombies. There'll be some annoying bosses, but his campaign overall is actually pretty good. Jake's campaign... I'll just say it's hilarious. Jake is such an edgy character that it feels like a parody of edgy troupes. He feels like a character out of a cartoon; he's just so out there. And what makes it all more fascinating is that it's all taken serious: he wasn't meant to be funny. But anyway, his campaign is actually pretty decent, except at some moments when you have to control vehicles (more on that in a bit). Then there's Ada's campaign, which may be the best - it's the only one properly meant for single-player. Not too frustrating, and with enough action for a good time.

You acquire skill points during the game, which curiously, are not gifted automatically to you as you kill zombies, but you have to manually collect them as drops. With these points, you can unlock new skills for your characters, making things easier. You're never truly lost or confused in the levels, since they tend to be very linear, and even when they're more open-ended, you have this device (the Q key) which will point you where to go next. So the level designs are actually well made. Even key fetching don't feel so annoying due to that.

During the stories, the characters are required to do different things at key moments. Their functions are not interchangeable, tough: what the game delegates to Sherry cannot be done by Jake, for example. At some points the game tries to variate, and to introduce players with different challenges. The issue however is that these challenges can be incredibly annoying: going to the subject of vehicles, you are sometimes asked to pilot something. In Jake's campaign, it is this snowmobile that is incredibly clunky at first, and then there's a motorbike section because, hey, there's gotta be one somewhere. In Chris' campaign, it's a VTOL, but if you're playing with Pears, it becomes much easier, since all you have to do is shoot. In Ada's campaign, it's a helicopter, which is actually decent enough. All of this is to bring some variety to the game, which is understandable, but it doesn't always work.

The main grip I have with the game, however, is the combat. Once again, the game tries to balance between horror and action, and as such, it implements many survivor horror elements that don't work with the action, such as inventory management, bad aiming, fatigue, and being throw out of balance. The game tries to focus on melee combat, which would be a way for players to save up ammo. But you can't just go around kicking enemies since there's so much fatigue you have. Besides, being grabed by zombies can sap your health pretty hard, so maybe it's best to keep your distance.

Each character has its own set of initial guns, and as you progress, you'll also find new guns. But their ammo occupies space in your inventory, and too much items means you won't have room to essential ones: namely healing herbs, which have this disgracefully complicated way to be accessed (apparently, you have to first convert the herbs in your inventory into pills, and then put them in your character). Again, this was all meant for a horror game, but they feel out of place in an action game. There are also numerous QTEs that are just overly present in the game: if we were talking about well placed events, that would be acceptable, but they're just overwhelming as they are.

The bosses are actually tricky, because you don't know when to just fill them with lead and when there's a specific action to do. The zombies come in different shapes and sizes, and at one point you'll face the so-called J'avos: zombies that get an extra mutation when they're harmed. And some of these mutations are incredibly hard to deal with (the swarm of bees being the worst of them all). This is all for the sake of combat variation, so you won't feel like you're fighting the same enemies over and over again.

The four campaigns took me nearly 27 hours to complete, but maybe the game should have been a bit shorter, as it was filled with unnecessary moments. On harder difficulties, it becomes unfairly hard, so swallow your pride and complete the game on normal: it becomes more balanced. Besides, once you beat all campaigns, you'll have the option of infinite ammo, which will make some moments much more pleasant, and will allow you to play at harder difficulties without much issues (but the hardest difficulty lacks the infinite ammo option).

""Resident Evil 6"" justifies much of its criticism. But it also justifies much of its praise. You play it and you immediately understand why it's not universally beloved. Once again, developers should have focused more on making an action game, but overall, for all its flaws, it's still a decent game that could have been so much better with so little changes.",1630298909,1648316262,True,6,0,0.594239175319671631,0,True,False,False

Thirty/forty percent of the game is in animation, so your watching videos, not actually playing the game. The developers also repeated the same scene twice.

Now this scenario repeats itself towards the end of the game. I guess the developers ran out of ideas/couldn't think or some other scene to add or just got lazy and put in the same scenario again.

As a fan of the series since it's inception, RE6 is one of the worst RE games, definitely the worst mainline title in the series. However, the game isn't that terrible if you view it as a 3rd person action shooter and NOT a Resident Evil game.

The game has it's fun moments but it is unpolished and mechanically messy, many of the mechanics available to the player are cool but poorly thought out and unreliable. Running in this game will often result in your character snapping around instantaneously in the opposite direction and leaping over something, it gets frustrating. Melee attacks are cool but the game forces it too much, resulting in very weak weapons and low ammo.

The 4 main campaigns are a mixed bag in quality. There are some good moments but a lot of rough or even frustrating or dull moments that just get exhausting to play. The game has a lot of QTE's and scripted sequences, which contradicts all the gameplay mechanics. A few turret/vehicle sections that also aren't very fun fill up play time.

There is a lot of variety here but again not all of it is to the game's benefit. While the game's design does get pretty generic for the time it came out, I don't find it as bad as many of it's competitors. For instance, the QTE's aren't any more frequent that RE4/5 for the most part. It's no where near the frequency of Tomb Raider 2013, Uncharted, etc. and it's better integrated into the gameplay.

It's the scripted sequences that get a bit annoying. There are MANY sections of the game where all you have to do is wait for an invisible timer to elapse and combat is optional. Or bosses that you only need to shoot a few times in a specific spot/timing but the overall battle is long and drawn out with numerous scripted encounters that gets frustrating to deal with. (many villains just won't die...)

Anyway, all that being said the core gameplay, when pitted against regular enemies is pretty fun. It is all the other additions and distractions that get in the way. So is the game worth playing? I think so. I think it's entertaining enough to play at least once even for RE fans, but one should go in with low expectations and playing with a friend will help a lot, the game doesn't seem all that well balanced for single player, partner AI is very unreliable.

I will say this though, only pick this game up at a hefty discount. About $5 to $10 USD is the most one should pay for this, though it does come with a lot of content. Also worth mentioning that the Mercenaries mini-game here is great, with many maps, characters and costumes, it may be the best implementation of the mini-game in the series. Almost worth buying the game just for Mercenaries.",1647607416,1647607416,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Having 4 campaigns with different characters is interesting, however the lenght of the game seems excessive.
This is actually the longest game in the saga so far. Some of the sections in the game seem pointless and by removing the equivalent of one chapter in each campaign the pace of the game could have been improved, for example in each campaign there is a section when you have to find 3 or 4 items lost in the environment while avoiding an immortal enemy (except in Jake/Sherry campaign) , this is a complete waste of time for the player.

I've thought that Resident Evil was one of the most successful series ever made, so I finally gave it a shot, but honestly...

The port is broken, the menus are way too hard to go through even the controls are annoying, specially in combat and godsh... you combat a lot.

The AI is far beyond stupid, either for zombies or for the companion.

Every time you die you'll have to hear the scream of the character's name, and it's not even your fault due to the lack of recourses that could heal you...

it's way too slow to progress in... It's not even scary, just filled with a lot of cheap jump scares...

The shooting parts can be mildly fun but will be interrupted with the game taking control of camera to point something without stopping the action, so when you recover control you have a few tenths of second to avoid a hit or some other shit.

Then they decided to put some annoying QTEs which are way harder that what you have to face in RE4 or 5.

And to completle destroy it, they put some of those ""run something is going to kill you"" taking again control of the camera which is normally for the worst and making sure this parts can only be solved by trial and error and luck based.

I really like the enhanced movement control options and various features such as the quick shot, melee combat and countering capabilities; however, while the story was neatly layed out from different perspectives, the game lacked everything associated with its survival horror roots.

The lack of weapon customization that was featured in RE4 and 5 was a let down, but was more than compensated with various melee combat options and countering capabilities. The little customization that the player has is in setting up eight different triplets of skill slots that they purchase and upgrade skills throughout multiple runs of the game. These were nice, but I wish there was room for just one more due to the difficulty in escaping from various enemy grab attacks. As far as weapons go, each story includes various weapons that are acquired throughout the first playthrough and remain unlocked after that. The use of grenades has also been mapped much better to quickly and efficiently get to and use than in the other games. Another great enhancement is the dying status being upgraded from the way it was in RE5, that allows the player to defend and escape death without aid, though at a disadvantage.

The overall presentation of the game was very well done and had very good graphics. The levels were in some cases less enjoyable the way they trapped you in a smaller section at a time and blocked the ability to backtrack. One of the most annoying aspects of the game was the interactive movie events or at least some of them that wants to cause great wear and tear to the controller to pull off in the limited time. The last complaint would be in the numerous achievements that are attached to the various verses modes that few likely played to begin with, given that Resident Evil has always been a single-player/ co-op game.

Overall the game is stylish and fun and the PC port seems to run perfectly fine. The gameplay is more action oriented and less survival horror, but the movement and combat options are in my opinion the best this franchise has ever featured in any of their games. If you like these games, then you will likely enjoy this one for the game it is; however, if it must be survival horror, then you may be let down by this one.",1646164032,1646164032,True,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 6 is a huge improvement to RE5 in every aspect. I made a review for RE5 and in short; the game changed the format of a mainly single-player survival horror series to an over-the-top action multiplayer similar to Left 4 Dead. It gave you the option to play a single-player but the A.I. was horrid. Resident Evil 6 fixed that problem and made companion A.I. more intelligent and gave it infinite ammo. It also felt more like a horror. I had a better experience with this game than RE5, but I did have some issues. Mainly, the controls suck (Which is more of an issue with the series, not just 6) and the story wasn't all good. The story was cheesy as all heck and it took itself way too seriously. I enjoyed the past games (before 5) cheesiness but back then it didn't take itself seriously. That being said I liked multiple campaigns and how they intertwined with each other. I thought that was a nice touch. My last issue with this game is the run time, this is by far the longest Resident Evil game so far. I have no problems a lengthy game but in this case, it kinda dragged on too much,

Its very well known to anyone who is interested in this game and the Resident Evil series that this game is the most controversial entry, being more action-packed than survival horror. In my opinion this game is great, the story to me is very Resident Evil, though there a lot of action moments that seem to feel out of place, but if you dont mind those type of things then this game is for you.

GAMEPLAY 
Compared to Resident Evil 4 and 5 this game has a lot of controls, a lot of buttons to press and many more, shooting in this game is in my opinion less satisfying than previous entries, weapon upgrades dont exist in this game but there power ups for damage and aiming, when it comes to aiming you are given 2 choices the regular crosshair or the RE4 staple lasersight which can be changed to different colors. To me the biggest problem is the camera, it takes time getting used to it but i was hard at first, being that the camera is so close to the character itself.

OVERALL
 
The game is great for RE fans but know that it is not really a very scary game like the other entries, as a game this is great, it works well but as an RE game maybe not so much. Overall great game has a good and solid story and is pretty enjoyable. I highly suggest this to anyone who is into Resident Evil or just a casual player.",1644760762,1644760762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are here for scares and spooks, there won't be able to find any here. Which is what the RE franchise is all about (mostly). But if you are looking for a fun third-person shooter campaign with the option to have co-op. You found the right game. 

The good stuff about said game-
Every weapon is fun to shoot. plain and simple, red dot goes on enemy, then bang, all done. 
The new movement mechanics are extremely interesting, cool, fun, and rewarding to master. You can leap backwards, roll forwards, left and right, and if you have good timing, you can duck under leaping zombies or attacks. You can also run and then slide, which is pretty neat.
The new and improved UI. Thew UI is extremely well made and never ever gets in the way. If it somehow does, then you made it to big. Which this perfectly segways into
This game is extremely customizable. Which is awesome. If you don't agree with the games default settings, you can change that! 
Skills. They are an ok addition, I never thought it was the greatest addition, but its something to take note of and advantage of.
Swapping to different items. It is as simple as pressing the buttons d-pad. Left and right for weapons and ordinances for up and down. For healing items they are solely dedicated to the right bumper, which is neat.

But besides all of this there is unfortunately some bad

The bab stuff-
Exploration, there is some exploration. But you can definitely tell it has taken a step back.
This game is LLLLOOOOONNNNNGGGG. I have only beaten Leon's story and it took 8 hours. This game is beefy and if you don't like long games then, oh boy.
It doesn't really tell you how to play the game. This game isn't the greatest teacher, so I recommend a guide or you can figure it out how to play the game yourself. I guess.
No spooks :( I can't really say much about this, this game is honestly just a playable action film where you just blast thousands of zombies. 
Its just shooting zombies. I can't really say much about the gameplay either, its just, blasting zombies for hours on end. Not saying thats necessarily bad. It's just, I can see that getting boring, and then people dropping the game.
The characters. Besides the original characters, they are unfortunately very forgettable. I forgot Helena's name for the majority of Leon's story.
Wait what was the story again? I didn't really pay attention to the story. Like, at all. I could not tell you a second about it. And that is because i did not take this game seriously at all. I don't know why this RE game specifically makes me not take it seriously.  Maybe it is because I had some of my friends watch me play and said their opinions about the game while I was playing it. Or I think its silly that Leon has been blasting zombies and monsters for the past who knows how long, and is still doing it. Or all of my friends making Ashley jokes just to spite me. Who really knows.

But besides all of this, I can only recommend one more thing. Please play with a friend. It will make this game so much better and more enjoyable to have a friend tag along on you're silly quest to shoot zombies from different parts of the world.
Also wait for a Steam sale or a price drop.

Attemping to be too much thing.  And horror game, A action game, A car driving game a Motorbike game and a fighter. 

My opinion : 
Resident evil 6 is a game that shouldn't be called Resident evil its not horror and the pacing is too quick to be considered horror exploration.  On the other the game is lengthy and has a lot of stuff to do there is positive but there is also a lot of negative. Still is one my favorite game.

221040,109139720,76561197972365109,0,8,2326,0,2326,1643559231,"This game is consistently maligned by most RE fans, and I get it. At the time, it represented the bloated action approach that really took the game far away from what most loved about the original RE. That said, today, with those ""expectations"" taken out of the equation, I personally think it's a flawed kind of awesome. I love this game. 

I played it on the PS3 years ago when it came out and enjoyed the hell out of it then, too, so after finishing the decent RE 8, I was feeling nostalgic and interested to see how this held up on PC, and I plowed through the entire game again. And once again, I had a great time. 

The creatures/monsters in this game are just fantastic from a design perspective. Some of the best, most varied in the entire series. Truly creative work done here, and it keeps things constantly fresh. The graphics still hold up in 2021 for the most part. Textures are generally crisp and beautiful and it was such a huge step up to play this in 4K from what I remembered on the PS3. 

The four interwoven campaigns was a really interesting approach, and it worked well for the most part, although there were certainly times where it didn't. But the voice acting was generally great (even though the script was not), the action was nonstop (which I know some don't want in a RE game), and the combat was addictive, at least for me. The Leon campaign was especially fun with it's zombie apocalypse setting, but once you get to China and fight those bastards, that was great as well. And watching Ada Wong crawl through tiny corridors on all fours in tight leather pants? Well done, Capcom. Well done. 

I appreciate games that fail because they try too hard vs. games that fail because devs are lazy or greedy or just plain incompetent, and this game is definitely the former. They put an incredible amount of effort into this game to really take the franchise to another level. Sometimes they succeeded wildly. Other times, they failed miserably. 

The skill tree system, for example, is terrible. It takes a ridiculous amount of skill points to level up certain areas, like firearms or defense, so I spent the entire playthrough just concentrating on accumulating enough skill points to raise those. If you were going to play through the campaign multiple times, I guess the system would allow you to explore other skills, but I had no interest in doing that, despite enjoying myself immensely. 

The cover system is also horrible and incredibly awkward. If the could've gotten that down, it would've added a lot to the gameplay, especially in the Chris and Ada campaigns. I did like the new inventory system as far as health tablets go. But the inventory system when changing weapons was terrible. You just have to scroll through your weapons cache, and it's time-consuming and frustrating during a fight. There should've been ways to map certain weapons to specific buttons on the controller. The co-op AI is a step up from RE5, but still not good. I play this single-player, so I was very happy when the Ada Wong campaign allowed me to not have to rely on an AI partner who basically does nothing to really  help you. 

All that said, though, something about this game still manages to really shine through and just be a fun, fun game overall. There's a lot of variety, too, from turret sections to car chases, helicopter battles, fighter jet attacks on an aircraft carrier, etc. I loved it. 

So, despite the flaws, I think this game is a strong entry in the RE collection. It's not going to unseat RE4 for me or even the recent RE2 remake, but I'd put it right alongside, and probably a bit above, RE5 as my third favorite in the franchise after the first. It's really a remarkable achievement in many, many ways. A balls-out approach to game-making where the devs took a ton of chances, some of which failed, but many of which succeeded wildly.

Some portions of the game were very memorable and fun, while some portions were quite dull. The game really shined when it wasn't just all about running, having something explode, having the ground fall out from under you, etc. And while there are elements in this game that fans of the classic RE games should enjoy, they feel more like greatest hits being performed by a cover band.

I do prefer the atmosphere and pace of classic Resident Evil games, where you have a lot of slower pace areas to build tension - which results in bigger payoffs when you reach the action-packed sequences. I always loved the relief I felt when I reached a save room with it's calming yet melancholic music. And while those save rooms offered relief, players would also feel dread about what was to come after they left the save room. That feeling is gone in games like RE5 and RE6. 

I do have to give two big thumbs up to the combat in RE6. I wasn't even aware how good it actually was until about 10 hours into the game (due to the lack of tutorials). Not only can we finally move while shooting, but we can do quick-shots, and dodge rolls where we can either choose to stay on our feet or lay on the ground and fire at enemies from there.

You can definitely tell the parts of the game where they cut corners and rushed. The game has plenty of janky crap going on, with numerous cheap deaths and such. And Capcom simply didn't offer enough of what Resident Evil fans like me really enjoy, which are challenging puzzles and environments that are fun to explore and interact with. Instead, the majority of this game consists of one corridor after another without much exploring to be done or interactive elements to be found.

The story is forgettable. I liked Jake and Sherry's campaign the most, because I thought that their characters had great chemistry. [spoiler]Although Wesker having a son sounds like some dumb fan fiction type stuff. And I find the story of Ben making a clone of Ada to be ridiculous and pathetic.[/spoiler]

I could tell that this would have been a much more fun experience if I had a co-op partner to play with. And the Agent Hunt mode sounds really fun too. But alas, I was only able to play solo on the campaigns and the Mercenaries mode. But at least they improved on the AI partner system from RE5 by simply making it so that you don't have to worry about your AI partner dying.

Overall, I would give this game a solid 7 out of 10.",1642502710,1642808658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So lets start with the bad parts oh boy the billion god damn running parts holy... I'm gonna give you a warning if you are playing with a friend whatever you do let your friend who is the second player go a little further then the first player the cam gets really messed up somehow

The game has one of the funnest fighting systems i seen in a RE game a whole bunch of things you can do you can...
LIST:
QUICK SHOT
MELEE MOVES
KNIFE
GUN BASHING
PUTTING A BOMB DOWN WELL SLIDING (fucking power move)
DROP KICKING
AND MUCH MORE

One thing i don't like is the girls outfits man capcom at this time was horny before you say tall vampire woman in RE8 even she isn't bad as these outfits 

One more thing there is 4 campaigns and i'm gonna rank them based on my experience note i had a good partner with me the whole time so it will probably be very different then you but

LEON: Had probably the best story elements in the whole game but that doesn't stop it from having goofy story at times but hey i can't stop it. I Gotta say it had some of the more funner sections with barely any running parts so i'm glad that was over with. 
TLDR FOR LEON; Good story alright gameplay

CHRIS: Well Well Well welcome to call of duty and running all the god damn time. This is where most of the gameplay comes into well action a bunch of action type shit here so if you want the most out of the gameplay this is the campaign for you but fair warning a lot of bad running drive parts like parts that doesn't make any god damn sense so if you hate those then buckle up or go play Leon's. also the story is a bit what the fuck like and many odd elements in there so it ain't good for the story i say.
TLDR FOR CHRIS; Eh story but Good ass gameplay

Jake: This campaign is the fucking worst out of all of em gonna say it right now first of shit stealth more fucking running and horrible driving into all not only that the most god damn Gary sue OC in the whole game fucking Jake Muller. Basically he is the cure for this shit and yadada whatever atleast sherry somewhat is there but of course Jake overshadows here 
TLDR FOR JAKE; Horrible story Bad gameplay but the big fucking revolver is nice

ADA; Oddly i find this more better then Jake's lets go over. First off no man other then Leon and well Leon chris is just shooting shit in the background and Wesker JR is only there for a second and then he is gone. This had all the ties for the campaigns really sadly though most of the story is already shown with the other parts but hey it's fun to get Ada's shit in but for gameplay this is the hardest to rate since..... Ada is the only singleplayer one and in singleplayer it's shit in gameplay oh boy... But however in COOP fuck does that turn around well the other player plays AGENT or you play AGENT he just does nothing in the story at all fuck he is not even there for the cutsences BUT DAMN HE CHANGES SHIT FOR THE GOOD First off some annoying ass puzzles get simple since he is there to be eyes or even shoot something. He helps with combat being clunky at times. And finally he is really funny. 
TLDR FOR ADA; Eh story and Bad gameplay for singleplayer but Good gameplay for coop and before you say ""He can't open any doors"" Well that helps in the end since non of those stupid double partner doors



TLDR FOR THE WHOLE REVIEW; Good gameplay some odd choises but bad story I Recommend grabbing a friend for this that is funner then the average redditor to play since that makes this game better

With that being said, there's absolutely fun to be had here. 

If you're like me and was playing this for the Resident Evil story of it, you'll likely be disapointed. There's nothing here that really effects the overall story of any other games and has quite a few one-off characters. But as a game, this is a really fun time for *MOST* of the playtime. 

Leon's Campaign: 

Leon's Campaign is the most resembilant of past Resident Evil titles, relating to RE 4 & RE 5. Helena is a pretty good character but getting stringed along by her in the beginning is pretty frustrating. The action sequences are pretty well done and his combat is great. The hand to hand combat was super fun and intuiative, and helped me save ammo. The boss battles are pretty good and don't drag on. Hunnigan returning is also super fun. Overall this was my favorite campaign

Chris's Campaign:

Chris's campaign is the most action heavy one, but ironically I had the most fun with this one. All the characters in this campaign are super likable and the combat is once again well done. All the different weapons are pretty good too. Some sections of this campaign drag on a bit, such as the car turret section. The boss battles are pretty good too and Piers is a super likable character. Overall this was my second favorite.

Jake's Campaign:

While Jake's campaign doesn't have the most action seqments, it has the worst ones imo. Having to replay sections from Chris and Leon's campaigns was annoying as hell and the snow mobile section is just bad. Jake as a character is unlikable at the beginning but slowly becomes better. Also Sherry being back after so long is really cool. She's great in this. Overall my third favorite. 

Ada's Capmaign:

I didn't play the full campaign. I played the first two chapters and was bored as hell and took to YouTube to finish the story and watch the cutscenes. My part of this campaign was boring as fuck and so slow compared to the ""go go go"" fast nature of the other campaigns. Overall my least favorite. 

Overall, there's fun to be had here, but 20% of this game could've easily been cut. The combat system is so fun. but sadly is under used. 

Don't play this as your first Resident Evil. It's the only of its kind and is very different than the rest of the series. Fun as a guilty pleasure.

I can't tell you how many times I've played that original bunch of games; probably numbers in the hundreds, and across many copies and platforms. So, as you would expect, like many I used to loathe Resident Evil 6. It was only good to me as a part of my collection. And I thought that this would never change, and that the resentment I held toward it would only grow with time. But, it didn't. Maybe it's because RE has finally started to return to its roots in recent years or perhaps I'm no longer the cynical teenager that I once was or both, but I can honestly say that I have grown fond of RE6 over time, to the point where it's one of the games I reach for when I'm having a bad day. It's by no means one of my favorite entries in the series and it still has plenty of issues, but I choose more often than not to see the good in RE6 now rather than the bad. As a guy who finds Resident Evils 4 and 5 relatively boring affairs past a certain point, RE6 always manages to keep me entertained for hours on end. Yes, it's loud, bombastic, ridiculous and downright bullshit in places, but that's all stuff I've come to expect from this franchise at this point and I can't say I'm ever bored when playing it. No campaign overstays its welcome and they provide enough variety from each other to warrant multiple playthroughs. And say what you will about the gameplay, but I think RE6 may provide some of the best characterization in the whole series. This game is also quite beautiful for 2012, and runs rather smoothly as well. I guess what I'm trying to say is this: If you are expecting Resident Evil 6 to deliver the same chills and thrills as the originals, you'll be disappointed. But if you can appreciate this game for what it is for just a moment, I think you'll have a quite a bit of fun with it. Especially if you bring a friend a long.

--Sincerely, a fellow fan.

At a certain point you start banging your head on the wall everytime the game grabs your camera to show you an explosion or something. Its annoying and ruins the replayabitlity of the campaign entirely. Stories were cool but Ada's campaign was the only one with any real gameplay. 

Most of my hours were spent on the mercenaries mode. Had a friend get as into it as me. Went through trying to get a Silver rating on all the levels with all the characters. Probably the best mercenaries mode of all the RE titles. We still hop on it every now and then. 

Any of the online stuff, like jumping into someone else's campaign or playing as a zombie is super lacking and was a totally unnecessary addition to the game. Although Ive seen some cool videos on the Teams Mercenaries mode. Seems intense

Gameplay wise, RE6 is a pretty big improvement over the last one. This is the part that’s confusing to me, as RE5 gets better reviews overall compared to RE6. I’m here to tell you now that both games are abysmal, but RE6 is the clear winner when you compare the two in a vacuum. The gameplay in 6 is much more fluid than in the last. The QTE sequences still suck, but in general the game is more fun than it’s immediate predecessor, and feels more true to the series.

Graphics are way better too. Of course, you expect the graphics to improve with time, but the art direction of RE5 was absolute trash, and RE6 brings back the traditional RE “feel” with dark, urban environments that look pretty good even 8 years later. 

Controls are still bad, but again, it’s an improvement over the last one.

Story- In RE6 there’s yet another variation of the virus causing chaos. If you thought that ouroboros from RE5 was lame, you’re in for a treat. The first campaign in RE6 (there's 4 in total, all focusing on a different protagonist) culminates in the player facing off against a transforming T-Rex / dog / giant fly monster. The story is comically bad and the monsters are somehow even more lame. Maybe it’s just not made for western audiences at this point, or maybe it’s only made to appeal to children these days, I don’t know… but god, the story is just awful.

At this point the RE team has not only embraced the cheesy-ness of the series, they’ve tripled-down. It seems like they legitimately believe that people enjoy the terrible storytelling and lame twists that have become standard for the franchise.

I’m only playing through these so that I can get to Village, but unless you’re a masochist like I am, you’re going to be better off spending 5 minutes reading the story synopsis on wiki rather than purchasing this and playing it through. In fact, that’s what I had to do after playing through 2 out of 4 of the campaigns in this one.

I never thought I would be so happy to finish a Resident Evil game, either. I don't know quite where to start, so I'll just say that this unfortunate entry into an otherwise excellent series is incredibly boring, clunky, and utterly devoid of character. I can't say I cared anything at all for the new characters (Helena, Jake or Piers), or for the new stories of the old ones (Leon, Chris, Ada, or even Sherry). None of them had anywhere near enough personality to make themselves worth caring about; very few good one-liners, little interesting character interaction, and...well, I don't really know how to put it, but after watching the characters perform Dumb Impossible Stunt #28 like it was nothing, I just stopped caring. This is the Michael Bay film of Resident Evil.

The game is just non-stop dumb action, but while it was endearing in games like RE5 and, most especially, 3 and 4, here...it's too much. REmake 2 (kinda-sorta), REmake 3, 4, 5 and 8, despite being heavily action-based rather than horror-based, were stellar games because Leon, Claire, Jill, Ethan and Chris were genuinely interesting, fun and often funny characters who, despite being over-the-top action heroes, still kept the games worthy of continued playtime through sheer enjoyability, thanks to their depth and charm. Here, those elements are gone, replaced with nothing but mind-numbing nothingness. RE6 tries to be too many things at once, and fails spectacularly at almost all of them: it's not witty and cool like RE4, it's not grounded like RE2 and 3, it's not a good balance of wacky and entertaining, like 5, and it's CERTAINLY nothing like 8, IMO the best of all of them. Quick-time events are atrocious; they were bad in RE5, but they are GRATING here.

Pretty much the only things I found worth noting were [spoiler]the death of the President[/spoiler], [spoiler]the scene in the warehouse with all the main characters of the game fighting over Ada Wong[/spoiler], and the [spoiler]surprise 'virus bomb' that hits later on in the game[/spoiler]. The controls were somehow worse than RE5, to the point where you can't even manage your AI partner's inventory, for some reason. Inventory management was MUCH worse, removing the easy-to-use grid system and implementing a slider...a f*cking SLIDER. Why?! The only improvement was being able to fire while moving, and that's it. An unfortunate tragedy my time with RE6 was, though at least I can happily say that I will not be playing the game again.

Edit: I played the game again. F*ck this game. F*ck this game. F*ck this f*cking game. F*CK THIS GAME. HOLY SH*T. WORST F*CKING GAME I'VE PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I don't understand. RE5 was stupid, but still enjoyable. This is nothing. I...oh, my god...no words, just no words. I thought RE7 was just OK...I think 1000X more highly of it now, Thank god for RE7, at least it got us away from this f*cking bullsh*t. How this was created, I'll never know or understand. Dumbest bullsh*t I've ever experienced. -100000/10. Don't even play it for fun. Skip entirely if you want to play the entire RE series. I simply could not believe how braindead this sh*t was. F*CK. RESIDENT. EVIL. 6. FOREVER. And f*ck Steam censorship for neutering my f*cking review, you f*cking f*ckwads.",1638515998,1640792397,False,1,0,0.51861041784286499,0,True,False,False

First, it is trash to most hardcore resident evil fans and second, it is really nice adventure action game for non-fan gamers. To say the truth, both ones are correct and true. From old fan perspective it is no more resident evil game, there are no more horror and survival mechanics, which used to be a main focus in classic RE trilogy games. For new players, RE6 is another AAA action game which is good, but not that good to be addictive and likeable like Dying Light or Dead island. Story is simple and straightforward, it is only important for RE lore fans. if you are looking for magnificent storytelling it is not the game you should buy. But, sometimes it's so unusual and exotic, its funny and hilarious in a good way. For example, you are fighting dinosaur like B.O.W monster and then the same monster turns into a big friking mosquito (like wtf, how the hell it is connected to each other). Gameplay isn't too deep as well, but again, it is fun to play. You get massive satisfaction by killing hundreds of thousands of enemies. 

Who should I recommend this game? - to absolutely everyone. As a die hard Re fan, I looked very skeptically at first, but as it finally turned out, RE6 is very fun to play. Is it game bad, which gives you fun? No, it isn't. Just try and embrace massive content which game holds for you.

The game would've had less flak if it doesn't have 'Resident Evil' in its name. The bad stuff I can point out on the game is the tedious quick-time events which lead to cheap deaths, sometimes unforgiving enemy damage & the lack of horror. But at the same time the game does a really good job on having an interesting story throughout 4 different campaigns & how well they intersect each other so kudos to the devs for executing this so well. The story is easy to follow so newcomers won't have a hard time catching up. The battle system can be difficult to pick up in the beginning but once you get used to it (especially the melee system), it will get more interesting later on. The campaigns have insane replay value so you might catch yourself playing them again possibly on a higher difficulty. Also, The Mercenaries mode is really fun.

That said, as we worked through the campaigns... I have found myself grow more fond of the game.

In reality it's not far off from RE4 and RE5, and many of the things people complain about here... combat focus, linearity, lack of puzzles, silly story, QTEs... also apply to those games, which have much better reputations.

That said, RE6 is a bit worse mostly because of small annoyances that add up quickly. Enemies are super tanky, your partner AI will often fight when it should run or help you, endless waves of enemies become tedious and weird level design can often confuse or lead to ambushes of trial and error death. The Leon campaign is by far the best and has the least of these issues, to the point where I'd roughly compare it to RE5, but the others suffer so many cuts they bleed out into annoyance way more than fun.

That said, if you're a big RE fan and really loved RE4 and RE5 then I'd say you'll probably enjoy this more than people say you would. The Leon campaign has a decent story that doesn't truly need the others to make sense, and it has the best gameplay. If you're into the series you should at least play that.

Two Wongs don't make it white but that does not keep Capcom from trying. The first story is that of Leon and Helena. Leon helps Helena through her sister complex by helping her kill her sister. The second story is about Chris Redfield a gay military man who reminisces about his past loves while chasing that elusive disappearing snake. When he finds his true love Piers, his partner and is ready to give up the disappearing snake, Piers dies on an underwater base. I am not sure what type of metaphor Capcom was going for there. The third story was Jake and Sherry. Sherry helps Jake beat his heroin addiction by forcing him to run from mutants and people that are trying to shoot him. This unorthodox method works as at the end of the story he is doing what most former junkies do. Ride a motorcycle at top speed down a desert highway. The last story is Ada. Ada is a twenty something Caucasian cos-player who thinks she is the international Chinese spy Ada Wong from the Resident Evil movies and games. Of course she looks too young and white but that doesn't stop her from being obnoxious and having a whole bunch of people shoot at her.

After playing through every mainline RE title, this slog was the last on my list, and unfortunately the longest. It plays itself up too seriously while not having the quality of writing or gameplay to back it up. The pre-existing characters don't feel right and the new ones don't feel like they fit into the game. The writing is hokey but the gameplay is really where it falls on it's face. 

Many times in this game, you'll leave a cutscene to walk a few feet or fire a couple bullets just to be sent directly into another cutscene. The game will constantly take over your camera to make you look at something, veering your character off course. Running past obstacles occasionally results in you flipping a 180 just to jump over the barricade backwards. You are stunned, knocked prone, or set off balance by most hits, allowing you to be hit again. You trip over dead bodies. You can't preemptively shoot some dead bodies which will come to life via the script so bullets will be wasted. To hammer on the script, many sequences in the game will lead you to believe you're supposed to shoot something when in fact, you're just wasting bullets because its a scripted bit. You can't pause the game to change the settings, instead having to do it live. There's a ton more problems I don't feel like going into.

Resident Evil 6 is one-of-a-kind.  Over 200 developers specifically worked on this game, not counting live orchestras, motion and facial capture, full teams for multiple mechanics and minor details.  If I remember correctly at the time this was one of the most expensive games ever produced.  

It is an absolute shitshow.

Graphically all over the place.  Wide open snowy fields, crowded downtown alleys and streets, underground biological research facilities, abandoned east European villages, dungeons and churches, an aircraft carrier, caves.  You're never in the same place for more than two levels in a row, and it really doesn't look that bad.  Main character models are detailed enough and there's some interesting enemy variety (for the most part) at least until you start getting into zombie dinosaurs and ""Mutated Derek"".  No real complaints here until you realize that almost every segment of these levels is simultaneously too linear and completely cluttered for a free-form style of combat that is completely unusable because of it.

RE6's combat is it's main strength. The biggest problem is that it explains nothing at all.  Did you know taking cover regenerates your stamina almost immediately?  Neither did I for 50 hours.  It doesn't help that there's no clear indication as to what you can and can't take cover on, and that the system for taking cover is unreasonably complicated.  Clearly designed for a controller (the ideal way to play the game, don't even bother with M+KB because you'll be using almost the entirety of the alphabet), you must approach an object and pull the left trigger/right click, then you're locked in cover.  After that the only way to peek out and fire is by using the left stick/WASD in the direction you want to look out at, then use the right stick/mouse to aim, and right trigger/left click to fire.  The *only* reason to take cover in this game is to recover stamina, which is used for ridiculous actions.

Stamina is used for melee and takedowns.  There are contextual melee takedowns, takedowns to steal enemy weapons (and kill them with the weapon if you do a QTE), melee combos that take down multiple enemies contextually, you can stunlock/combo enemies infinitely if you time your hits right.  You can use a Quickshot (L+R trigger/mouse click) which immediately spins your character to the closest enemy with your chosen weapon and fires, stunning them and opening them for a melee takedown.  You can do this multiple times in a row while changing targets, you can do this playing as Jake and literally bounce off of enemies, you can do this as Chris and throw enemies at each other, you can do this as Leon and JUGGLE ENEMIES WITH DUAL PISTOLS LIKE FUCKING DEVIL MAY CRY.  If it wasn't for the clunky cover system and the fact that the level design does not facilitate any of this RE6 would be considering a pretty damn good character action game.

I'm not a Resident Evil fanboy but I'm aware of most of the franchise and characters.  6 is clearly designed as fan service all the way through, which old characters clashing with new constantly.  The problem is that the story is played so straight-faced and so self-serious, with NONE of the previous RE's campy self-awareness, that you objectively can not take this thing serious.  It's so bad it's good, but bad in a good way.  It's a parody of every 7th gen trope smashed into a single package.  It's hard to take anything in this game seriously when you're doing literal midair noscope collateral headshots off cliffs with Chris Redfield, suplexing enemies as Jake, or juggling multiple enemies in midair as Leon.  

I could go on about how RE6 is the best example of ""less is more"" in a game.  The massive development budget combined with the absolutely insane amount of people who worked on the game obviously crushed any real chance of the unique mechanics being fully fleshed out.  Did I mention that there's like 9 different asymmetrical multiplayer modes?  How about Left 4 Dead 2 cameos?  There's an ""Agent Hunt"" mode which lets you INVADE OTHER PLAYER'S GAMES AS A REGULAR ENEMY.  Did you play RE1 and think ""Wow, I wish I could play as the first zombie you encounter and kill Jill""?  Guess what, you can!  You can play as a slow moving zombie with it's own moveset, unique UI, miserably slow controls coupled with attack animations that take up to 10+ seconds to fully complete.  It's pretty fun jumping into someone else's coop match and killing them as the equivalent of a RE4 villager, and you gain ingame currency for doing so.

This game deserves to be played simply because we will never get another title like it.  It revels in itself, takes itself too seriously, and throws a fat middle finger to the concept of basic gaming mechanics.  What the hell were they thinking?  Buy this shit immediately.

1. Main Campaign is only good for 1st time, play after that quite boring. 
2. While sprinting in-game, characters are sliding through table jumping from high-grounds automatically in mean time, like an AI NPC trying making fun of us. Quite irritating. 
3. Concept of last fight scene of Jack Muller with UTSANAK hand to hand, seems illogical.
Pros - 
1. Availability of key characters & their reunions.
2. Addition of new fighting skills and techniques.
3. Mercenaries gameplay - Best part of the game . This single game mode can compensate for all other lackings of RE6. I think Resident Evil 6 Mercenaries mode is best as compare to all the other previous game Mercenaries.

The range of events taken and even the distance is longer than in the fourth and fifth parts, but there are still many non-isolated and undisclosed moments. The height was taken decent, but the behavior and general prerequisites did not work out perfectly. But for the sake of fairness, I note that, to the conscience of the developers, there are a large number of videos explaining the general alignment and elaborated aspects of the intersection of the main characters, and also we must not forget about the dynamism and a decent variety of parts of the chronology of the game. The gameplay is also not entirely unambiguous. There are many pluses, the overwhelming majority. Taken on a wide scale and interestingly worked out fighting game, you also have to get used to the specifics of the game and start combining melee and ranged actions. In addition to all this, one must be able to assess the overall situation and plan ahead. But you can count a dozen game flaws of which, half of which can seriously affect the game. In addition, such negative negative situations with an unpleasant sight on the part of the characters. Which is just disgusting. And of course the developers fanatically cannot move away from their idea with the seemingly endless resurrection of bosses. Sometimes it looks extremely boring and extremely unreasonable. Chris Redfield's battle with the giant B.O.O. at the end of the company, it could enter the top for irrationality and exhausting. When you need to run for about 15 minutes and wait for the right moment due to the lack of ammunition. The latter, by the way, is also a separate topic during the first playthrough, but in most cases it is not fatal. The visual design is very diverse, it seems that it was created by means of graphic elements of different generations. Why an impression? This is true. If the beginning is reflected by exponential detail and color. In the second chapter, it drops in places to the level of Resident Evil 4. All this is in the system of versions of both games. Many graphic elements are clearly from the first half of the 2000s. But the videos are very effective, I must admit. However, in certain chapters, there is again a high contrast and variety of structure in the environment. The characters are very well worked out. Leon Kennedy is still the most stylish hero in the gaming industry. And the figures of the female protagonists are mesmerizing. In terms of sound equipment, there is harmony and everything falls into those notes. Starting with the manifestation of the sound of weapons and ending with professional dialogues. The background music is used in the additional content and fits quite thematically.

Speaking of which, I think the best part about RE6 is its foundation. Once you get past the fact that they completely abandoned the RE4&5 formula, the base mechanics are, while clunky at first, quite a lot of fun, it's oddly satisfying once you get the hang of them, it's clear that Capcom put a ton of time into refining the specific contextual animations, even if some of the hit registration and target selection is shoddy. 
Enemy design is a massive downgrade, they are all bullet sponges and lack their resposiveness and fun unique interactions present in the prior over-the-shoulder RE games. You'll be begging for more variety until you actually get to fight the other Zombie types.

Overall, my first impressions weren't great, but I was still looking foward to what the rest of the campaigns had to offer, until I found out what the game had in store.

Chris' and Jake's campaign are actual geniune garbage, they are merely generic military cover shooters with 0 inspiration with even more scripted events and QTEs. I have nothing to say about them, I couldn't bring myself to finish them, you'd have to force me into finishing them.

The main problem is not that it's not similar to a certain Resident Evil game that came before, but that it utterly fails at bringing a new compelling direction to the series, specially when RE has no shortage of untapped potential in its old formulas, so to utterly abandon them in favor of CoD sales feels insulting. Resident Evil 4 may play nothing like the old classic games, but it's one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed games of all times, it brought (though unfortunately short-lived) a completely new life to the franchise",1638027897,1638027976,False,6,0,0.537790060043334961,1,True,False,False

This design is repeated over and over: go through some very easy combat, occasionally the game will yank control of your camera away or shove you into a cutscene to completely disorient you. Typically you will lose 0 health for the entire level. EVERY level ends in a situation where you can be killed instantly either by a QTE or environmental hazard. Example: running from a helicopter across some boats, but the controls constantly get you stuck against walls or vaulting obstacles in the wrong direction, resulting in a game over.

None of the weapon upgrading mechanics from RE5, and instead you collect points to just buff overall damage and other (less useful) things. None of the upgrades matter though, as the QTEs will be the only thing killing you.

And the item management, I just wish they at least brought RE5's item gameplay back. They removed the gun buying / upgrade shop, they force you to carry every single weapon you've unlocked so you don't have enough spaces to keep much of your favorite ammo type, and takes decade to scroll through the weapons when you need to switch. Meanwhile I could press 1 for a handgun, shoot once, press 3 to quickly use a shotgun and bam in Re 5. The item menu also feels sluggish when you need to discard a thing for space. Big nope.

You can crouch, slide, defend with coup de grâce, hide behind table or wall before you shoot enemies, and also the AI will help you more without worrying their health or ammo (if you play offline) so you don't need to struggle by keeping them alive like Sheva on RE 5 or Ashley on RE 4 since you hit all QTE (quick time event) quickly and correctly.

I've been playing this game for a long time, and yeah I must say I love and enjoy it. Extra content is part of the game that makes us want to play this game everyday, especially Mercenaries. So far, Resident Evil 6 has the best mercenaries system in my opinion, supported by advanced controlling system and attack/defend mechanics. Extra content also gives players to choose their main skill, so ether you love to shoot or use physical attacks, you can adjust it just how you like to play the game. All DLC are seriously fun, especially onslaught and predator. But as long as time goes by, well, now online mode has been dead and you won't find any players easily to play together.

Resident Evil 6 has many features that players will like to play, but also there's a thing that makes me struggle to play it. Like I've said, this game has more advanced and complete controlling system, but well, it also makes players getting stress to control characters. If you are a new player from previous franchise like RE 4 or RE 5, yup you will feel uncomfortable by all controls method that RE 6 has, basically when you play campaign mode, you may have to look notice ""YOU ARE DEAD' or ""MISSION FAILED"" for many times just because of it. But if you curious like me, you can learn all controls method slowly until you know how to do and what buttons you should hit every position of camera changes or also when quick time event appears.

- Very slow pace for some part of the game, Leon’s first chapter for example. And waiting your partner just to open a door was pretty annoying
- No freedom to explore, just follow the guide and it’s done (sometimes there’s a puzzle to solve, but literally very easy one). The game tells you where to go, where to obtain the key item, etc... 
- Poor camera angle and control, especially during chasing scene. 
- Bad saving mechanic. There’s no manual save, this game using an auto-save and it saves only at the beginning of each chapter. If you quit the game in the middle of the chapter, you have to restart that chapter.
- This game is full of QTE and BUTTON MASHING

But the end boss on chris's campaign is just painful. If you're player 2 and playing his femboy companion the aiming is so frustrating. Boss took 20 minutes because I kept missing for no apparent reason.



Jake & Ada's campaign are broken in Co-op.  If you're not the host in Jake's campaign some run sequences are literally unwinnable. Because there's a weird time delay between the host and player 2 you lose instantly or there's about 0.3 seconds of leeway.  For the part where we were running from the Ustanak in the cave i died 27 times before we found out we had to perfectly sync our framerates and vsync settings and match speeds to get past it. The next level, where you run from a tank was completely impossible and i'd get run over instantly no matter what i did. Your only choice is to replay it on single player. 


In Ada's campaign, if you play co-op player 2 can't interact with or help with any of the puzzles or story items. She has a grappling hook they were too lazy to implement for player 2 so you just teleport. There's a part where you fall through the floor and ada has to crawl away from saw blades that my host kept instantly dying at for no reason, just like my tank experience. 


9/10 fun with a friend if you have a good sense of humor because this game is ridiculously stupid

4/10 gameplay. A real benchmark of bad game design and awful forced camera angles ESPECIALLY during run sequences. The aiming for guns is frustrating and your hands shake like you're 35 hours into a meth binge even with max level aiming skills. The melee prompts work half the time if you're lucky.

2/10 puzzles they're not difficult or fun, just tedious and annoying. Like for ones where you have to push things in the right place you can only do it one push at a time, stretching out the time to an infuriatingly sluggish pace for something a 5 year old should be able to solve in under a minute 

6/10 graphics except the women are hot 

0.5/10 story but that's a resident evil staple 


We powered through 2 campaigns. I'd play this again as part of a drinking game or to laugh at it again, but not because it's actually fun to play.

There's 4 campaigns i am through 2 and i feel like i'm Micheal J Fox and my parkinson's is acting up..... like ya boi legit has spaghetti for hands in every other RE you get something to either help ya aim or a steady red dot sight cause you know everybody is a trained solider..... not a person picking up a fire arm for the first time in their life. I would however forgive the more intense enemy placement if they gave you the bullets or teammates to match in the second campaign ( chris redfields) i've resorted to not fighting anything until i have to and it forces you often. 
        They have a garbage pail leveling system. In which they give you 50 experience points in some drops and 100 in other drops most of the upgrades you would want are 20k and above. the worst part about it is you can't spend Skill points in game you have to  end the chapter or quit out...... the worst part about this system is that it makes most of the drops the piss puddle of points instead of ammo , heals or anything of use. This makes the game hard ....for no reason... by the way the skill point upgrades feel like they do nothing. They recycle cut scenes cause the end of each characters campaign i guess they just meet up or whatever. 
        The game looks fine for an early 2010 until you look at the muddy pixelated walls....they look awful and so does the skybox background of the china level(don't actually know but it said china at some point so i assume thats where we are). for context when i play RE5 on the comp or even on a ps3 or 360 it looks vastly better ....that was made during the same gen HOW DO YOU GET IT WRONG LITERALLY JUST COPY AND PASTE IF YOU SUCK AT MAKING LEVEL. 
       With that being said the last thing i want to touch on is the absolute nonsense this game goes through it throws ""zombies with guns"" at you way to much and it turns this game more into a 3rd person COD then an RE game. The feel of RE is lost and honestly makes for a sour experience.....

In Short i give the game a 4/10 it's a game sure it functions sure..... it has a structure sure...... but it's like the guy who goes tango dancing and instead of actually dancing he falls hits the waiter and the bottle of 1934 wine on his tray flies right into your dates neck and kills her.

It is no exaggeration when I say that I believe the hatred for this game is in fact an observable case of mass hysteria.

The only olive branch I will offer is I understand that classic RE1 fans were likely quite upset that this game is the ultimate departure from its roots, and it is likely that dissatisfaction that incandesced the bandwagon of hatred for this game.

With that out of the way, regardless of expectation it is insanity to imply that RE6 is bad, let alone terrible as most people imply, I can fully see why someone might dislike it, but I think it is impossible to call it objectively bad. 

Why am I writing this? Because I have seen so many people call this game bad, and then when I ask them what they think about the slide tackle reversal they answer: ""The what?""

That's right, RE6 has probably some of most in-depth movement systems of ANY over the shoulder shooter on the market, this is a TEN year old game at the time of writing and I cannot think of a single game that comes close. And though the game doesn't teach you it, and you can beat the game without using much of it. 

You can duck, you can roll in all directions, you can slide tackle off a sprint, you can REVERSE that slide tackle to face the way you came. You can choose to stay on the ground, from which you can roll left or right, or jut back and forth, as well as crawl, you can however stand instantly instead. You can shoot while sliding, reverse sliding, while on your back.

These aren't even all the moves, there's way more, I'm not going to drone on, though, you get the point.

What matters is that this system exists, now, I know that's not enough to make a game good. That's where the: Shooting, Enemy Design, Level Design, Quick Shot and Melee come into play.

All these mechanics mentioned above are a balanced gestalt of gameplay. They complement and layer each other near flawlessly. 

The shooting is well tuned and satisfying

The enemies are interactive and varied in many ways from having objects you can shoot on(or off) them, weak spots, unique mechanics with the player/melee system/terrain and all kinda of insanity I won't spoil.

The Level Design promotes using the movement system by having hazards, shortcuts, holes you can slide trough or objects you can vault over.

Quick shot allows you to instantly fire your weapon accurately at the nearest enemy, every weapon has a unique animation for this, effectively serving as the third layer of combat.

Melee allows you to preform environment-aware attacks of opportunity to staggered or otherwise available enemies. This fourth layer of combat ties all the other mechanics together, there are so many of these. Throwing enemies off ledges, pulling their feet while you're below them so they hit their head on the edge, or dropping down on them and push their head to the ground, or slam them into a railing, or a wall. Or snap their neck from behind. Or PARRY them, take their weapon, use them against them.  FLIP a zombie that is LEAPING AT YOU and STOMP on them.

Calling RE6 just an over the shoulder shooter isn't quite enough, it's very nearly an over the shoulder shooter/fighter.

[Did I mention every single character has a unique melee moveset?]

So that's my argument for the gameplay and why you should play it.

Is the story amazing? No... But I thought it was good, campy, but touching at times. Fun

The environments are varied and fun, the pacing is good.

The amount of content is good, Co-op is an amazing way to play this game

Is it scary? No, but it IS fun.

This game is a mess, the story is clunky and boring, the controls are awful and are possibly one of the worst in   any triple A game, the overall gameplay itself is by far the worst in this franchise and no matter what i did the game is so dark meaning i couldn't see anything for most of the game even in brightly lit outdoor areas.

The game presents you with 4 separate and different campaigns that all weave between the same narrative which in concept is a pretty cool idea as it allows you to see the same story from different perspectives and means that you can play as more fan favorite characters, however in RE6 case it means that story feels bloated and moments are contrived just so that characters can meet and tease their own storyline. This also means that each campaign has different play styles ranging from average to god awful and once you have played one campaign you know the overall story with one interesting twist added into the final half of the final campaign.

The controls and gameplay are also awful as sometimes you may press a button and either the input isn't registered or it does something completely different, the amount of times i have opened the menu when i pressed reload during a boss fight and have died as a result is ridiculous, there are also many instances where ill die even though ill be on full health because ill be grabbed by one enemy and thrown into another enemy who will grab me and then im grabbed during the previous animation and so on until i lose all my health, and the checkpoints don't always work so you could be put back to where you were 20 minutes ago. There is also an ungodly amount of screen tearing during every pre rendered cut scene making some moments nauseating to watch.

Don't pick this up unless you are playing through the RE games but even then I doubt this game will be a fun experience.

Campaign greatness :
[b]1. Sherry and Jake.[/b] Easily the best one. Their mechanics are fun, the chemistry they create is believable. Jake as a really O.P mercenary suits the 'cool-line jokester' leagues better then Leon in this game. Leons feel forced, where Jake feels like a cocky prick. And that's perfect- he is. Some of their story is aggravating though: the snow sequence makes you wanna pull your hair out all the way until the end, and Jakes emotions kinda don't make sense. Spoilers here -- > [spoiler]Jake doesn't know his dad is Wesker (also, like, when did he even get the baby shot in? Wesker ain't the one-night screw y'know?)but agrees to help Sherry for money since they need his blood. He implores that he doesn't like/want to know his father, that he doesn't want to be like him or what he did. Then Chris rolls around with Piers and admits he killed Wesker, and Jake gets all uppity about it? It doesn't make sense to me, but it's cool anyways.[/spoiler] Anyways, screw the story. Do Jake/Sherry first it's so much fun.
[b]2. Leon and Helena.[/b] The beef of the story for this game, as is obvious. They grow the desire to slap them both outside the back of the head and move on. If I didn't play this with a good friend where we could goof off, it'd be annoying. But with a friend, it's just stupid hilarity we can enjoy together. Like the lovestory triangle with Helena being a voyeur. It's lovingly buggy and clearly unpolished, but at this point I find it endearing. You couldn't count the amount of times they should be dead on four sets of hands. We tried. They should be dead chief.  The reason they're not my favorite is, as I stated with Jake, Leon has his typical one liners like from RE4. They're just INCREDIBLY FORCED. Like he's giving a punch line to a really long joke and the entire crowd is just crickets levels of forced. The friggin' intro sequence they both pull their guns on a mysterious figure, he cocks a eyebrow and just says ""So, back for more?"" and I wanna scream. They just squabbled what they could of a personality from RE4 and slapped it into his entire story. Helena isn't any better either- friggin' sis con for the MAJORITY of her story. I get it, worry about your sister, that's family. But it's just SO. MUCH. There are a few glitchy moments that really grate my gears, namely the segment at the end [spoiler] where Simmons becomes this crazy four-legged beast who shoots like bullets in a circle from his head IDK. At that segment there I kid you not we crashed maybe five different times. And it was PER playthrough. We're still in the process of doing all the game on the hardest difficulties, and each time through we crash at that train part CONSISTENTLY. IDK what it is about it, but it's a nightmare. You can easily get glitched in that spot too : if you shoot Simmons on the roof and then don't run past him? You're fucked.[/spoiler] Anyways, a decent time.
[b]3. Chris and Piers.[/b] Quite painful at times. I'd say it's on par with Leon/Helena story, but eh. It's a bit less fun more focus gameplay. It's very strictly not puzzles, it's a active shooter. Which is fine. The controls are kind of janky and their story is kind of plain. The whole premise is Chris has temporary memory loss since he let his teammates die to [spoiler]the fake Ada replica that Simmons made using his wifes body. Y'know, the usual foe.[/spoiler] Anyways, they all die and he represses the memory. Piers rolls up, calls him a wuss, and basically drags him back to the military still with memory loss. He retains his physical memory and just brings a damn pistol and knife. PIERS RUNS A MACHINE GUN AND [b] ANTI-MATERIAL THERMAL SNIPER RIFLE.[/b] Anyway, his team dies again and Chris remembers. The entire rest of the time he seeks revenge, even at the loss of the remainder of his team. Piers just joins him around, making sure he doesn't get himself killed doing stupid things. And they do MANY stupid things. Anyways, they're story is meh, the combat is meh, the ammo drop is CRUEL. It's perhaps one of the more annoying stories, but it's not all bad honestly. 
[b] Ada and Agent.[/b] Here, however, on the other end of the spectrum we have the assitry. People screamed joyously about there being online co-op and then pointed an accusatory finger at Ada's campaign that was strictly solo. So the improvised and added a literally unkillable, unvoiced, unnamed agent that can do nothing but shoot. He cannot open doors, he cannot activate puzzles, he doesn't even get any partaking in the cutscenes. Ada opens a door wide, shuts it, he just appears behind her. Ada grapples up to a balcony and he just MATERIALIZES. Her story is all around the place, which I suppose makes sense cause she's a busy girl and has to interact with all the different stories at some point or another. But her whole situation with Simmons bothers me. Her whole combat system is INFURIATING. Some segments feel far too difficult given other parts of the game. Ada's campaign isn't fun; at best, it's fanservice.

Do I recommend this game? Only if you have a good friend who doesn't take things too seriously. Don't get this game if you're one of those people who does complete achievement hunting. I was skimming the achievements myself and realized I couldn't do a few and the slew of others mostly pertaining to the side hunting jobs were agonizingly not worth my time. Otherwise, decent.

In terms of gameplay, sometimes the buttons on controller, occasional camera angle, and flow of combat can be infuriating along with some stupid instant quick time deaths but overall I quite enjoyed the gun play and co-op combat. So think it is worth picking up when on a sale, especially if you can find a friend to play with.

I wasn't a fan of RE 5 when I played it with a friend, and the reviews made this game sound truly awful. It's actually not too bad. It definitely has flaws. A ton of them. I wouldn't recommend this as a game to start the series with either. Heck even if you are looking for a multiplayer RE game look at 5 or the Revelations series. This game doesn't deserve the hate it gets though, and it's worth a play through if you're a fan of the bonkers plot.

The biggest flaw in this game is the game play. If you ever played RE 4 or RE 5 and thought to yourself that you would love to play a version that has all of the slow bits taken out and just have combat (sometimes infinitely spawning enemy closet combat) you'll be right at home. There are barely any puzzles in this game. Even when they do show up it would be generous to call them a puzzle. More like momentary diversions before getting back to the shooty shooty bits. Really Ada's play through it the only one I can think of that had puzzles that took more than two minutes. Personally I really missed better puzzles and needing to plan where items need to be used. Those are some of my favorite parts of RE games and it gets kind of exhausting without them. The combat in the game isn't bad. It's very similar to playing RE 5. On higher difficulties it will push you and it would be good to get a human friend to help. On lower difficulties the AI partners are okay enough. The guns all act differently, but only kind of. I mostly just used the same one until I ran out, switched to the next, and just kept repeating that until stuff died. 

The other big thing with this is that it is an ugly game. Really ugly in fact. A lot of the background textures look like old PS3 assets. The movies look good, but the second you are back in a game play section you know. I played on the highest graphics settings and it still looked bad. The environments are so boring that there were a good amount of times I got turned around for no reason. Every angle pretty much looked the same so I just kept running back to the same place over an over again. Pretty annoying. On top of that most of the chapters are stupid long. I could literally clear one of the original PS1 RE games in the time it takes to beat the average RE 6 chapter. There's quite a bit that could be cut from the levels and if some genius modder figures out a way to cut the fluff from this game I bet it would be 1,000% better.

In the long run though the biggest flaw here is the scope they tried to reach with this game. One of those Icarus reaching for the sun kinds of things. I appreciate what they were trying to do here. They were trying to tell an interconnected story like they did with RE2. It almost works. The problem is that they didn't seem to have the time to really flesh it out and having to make SO many separate environments probably set them back a bit too much. I would guess that is why the environments are so ugly and the game play is so stripped down. They just stretched themselves too thin. If they had more time or cut down two of the stories to focus on the main ones it probably would have been much better for it. 

Here I am recommending a game and I've done nothing but whine about it. Here's the thing, I have been playing RE games since '96-'97. I remember the days when RE1 had a very poorly acted live action intro. When the voice acting was barely passable. I loved that stuff. It was SO cheesy that it made this series one of my favorite video game series. When this game came out I remember seeing and reading a bunch of reviews that complained about the plot. It's like people forgot that this is a series where a slug queen hive convinces itself that it is the 80 year old creator of the T virus. A series where the captain of a special forces cop team is also some how a mad scientist as a side gig and just happens to be really into doing all the evil. When I look at the plot of this game next to those things it's really fun. I can see why people don't like it, but really if you just sit back and enjoy it for the shlocky horror/sci-fi/spy weirdness that it is the plot of this game is pretty fun.

If you are a fan of the series this can be worth it. I would wait for a major sale. It's probably the longest game in the series, but full price is still a bit much. If it is ever on sale for like $10-$15 I would say it is worth it. If you don't have patience for weird plots and janky backgrounds maybe give this one a pass and just look up the plot on YouTube or something. I'm glad I played this.

-O que eu gostei foi do modelo de várias campanhas, tem bastante coisa pra fazer e as campanhas são bem diferenciadas, fora que cada campanha tem 2 personagens jogáveis (tirando a da Ada), não muda muito no geral, mas é o suficiente pra valer a pena rejogar com o outro personagem.

-Os gráficos são bonitos pra época, a jogabilidade é média pra mim, funciona bem até, mas é muito travadona (sei lá se é porque eu joguei no teclado).

-Gostei bastante das armas também, tem até uma variedade boa, e cada personagem tem uma arma que é exclusiva dele.

-Tem um sistema de loot e upgrades também mas nada de excepcional, tem que dar uma farmada mas dá pra coletar moeda o suficiente pra pegar os upgrades importantes em cada campanha.



-A parte ruim foi mais no ""balanceamento"" do jogo, os inimigos são muito esponja de bala, demora muito pra morrer, mesmo acertando só headshot, isso se o cara não se transformar umas 5 vezes e na última virar um casulo e simplesmente ficar lá paradão, fazendo você perder loot e ter gasto um monte de balas a toa, os inimigos são bem mais rápidos e ágeis que seu personagem, isso cria várias situações onde você leva hit sem nem ter tempo de reagir.

-Talvez isso conte como Spoiler sei lá, mas fica o aviso, porque outro negócio que eu não gostei foram as ""boss fights"", quase todos os grandes bosses são mortos em cutscene, tu vai la descarrega tudo no cara, ai ele ""morre"", dali dois capítulos, opa, tinha morrido não, voltei, ai vai lá, ""mata"" de novo, dali dois capítulos, ""olha eu de novo aqui"", ai o cara finalmente é morto, em uma cutscene, muito tosco kkk. Os bosses em si são bem legais e bem feitos, mas as lutas são bem meh.

-QTE, QTE a rodo, pqp, nunca vi tanto Quick Time Event na vida, é o pior aspecto desse jogo, e uma das piores coisas já criada no mundo dos jogos lol, claro, não são impossíveis de fazer, dá pra passar tudo de boa, mas exageraram demais na quantidade, fica chato.

Enfim é um jogo legal de jogar, além de barato, mas vai ter aspectos que vão incomodar bastante, aquele tipo de coisa que você fala ""meu, quem achou que isso aqui ia ser legal"", ""quem deixou isso aqui passar no QA"", etc, mesmo assim vale a pena, melhor que o 5 pelo menos.",1631749555,1631749555,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combine sheer darkness with a camera that doesn't know where it is supposed to be looking, and you'll be playing a game where you can't see what the bleedin' hell is going on. Mix in an obtuse user interface and you have a recipe for frustration.

It's even more action than horror - or any exploration and adventuring at this point. This has been a progression of the series with has now reached it's nadir. You just have to try and shoot as many zombies as you can and then just go toe-to-toe with the rest! It just looks very silly. The story has huge problems with pacing - essentially it's non-stop balls-to-the-wall action. There's no real horror of which to speak because the game can't find time to slow down and build anticipation. It tries too hard to jump-scare you every minute, and when it's not doing that the vehicle or elevator the players are in are guaranteed to explode. It doesn't take long until you more or less are expecting something to go wrong at every corner - and you won't be wrong either. Comparisons of ""Call of Duty - but you have to pick up ammo"" are accurate.

Unlike most survival games, there's zero reason to conserve ammo. Dead zombies give you more - you just have to pick it up. Out of ammo? Just kick them all to bits! The game is marred with many quicktime events until the game becomes a mere test of your reactions. Very little thought or strategy is needed to work your way through the very linearly designed levels, party because it's an experience of pure chaos in near darkness. It couldn't be more further removed and dumbed down from the adventuring and puzzle solving of the very early Resident Evil games. To top it all off, it doesn't even save the game properly between checkpoints and you have to often retread earlier sections.

If a manic over-the-top action movie with zombie elements is your thing then you might like it. There's four campaigns so there is actually loads of content. However, I was pretty much over it from the first few levels. It just gets more comical the more you play into it. It's only saving grace is the mercenaries mode - which is unashamedly a survival mode with an annoying timer - and is pretty fun once you get into it. Playing with a friend could be fun.

I think that the story overall is great, and it can be appreciated how they portray some of the same events through different perspectives. The character movement needs a bit of optimization for PC, as the character struggles to get around corners feasibly when the player is using a WASD format. This can lead to infuriating deaths during high intensity scenes where the camera is panning into many different angles. The camera is another thing that I feel this game needs work on. Some perspectives, when turning corners or turning around, become shaky and make it much more difficult to make fluid movement in-game.

It's as if they trimmed down the UI and item management in a misguided attempt to ""streamline"" the game, but it just makes RE6 feel like it has a severe lack of polish. I especially hate all of the unnecessary action prompts. The pacing can be boringly slow, while also feeling very unconsidered. I am glad that the new RE games have (mostly) struck a good balance between fun, scary, challenging, and actually interesting. 

Two things that might have hampered my experience: 
1. I've been playing with a mouse + keyboard. Maybe it would be better on a controller. But I am not interested enough to play it again with a controller. 
2. I've been playing single-player. I've seen some reviews praise this game for its co-op. But I have no plans of making a friend purchase this game to play it with me.",1629012763,1629012763,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought it specifically to play with a friend, but we lost motivation halfway through the final character campaign. It wasn’t even much fun, because the second player was a dispensable mob character with no bearing on the RE universe. RE5 gets a bad rap, but aside from its terrible camera, the game is a blast in co-op. Thus, I will compare the two and discuss key points that come to mind.

Bugs. RE6 seemed buggy and not well-coded. There were a couple time times in which events simply wouldn't trigger even though we figured out what we had to do in order to progress a boss fight or checkpoint.

Gameplay. Fewer puzzles than RE5, more standard objectives like survive within a time limit, kill all enemies, etc. They also removed shared inventory. Overall, there is less of a feeling that you need to depend on your partner to survive. I did not like this. However, I enjoyed the skill tree system in which you upgrade your hero (not the weapons themselves, as was the case in RE5).

Camera angles. I died more to the sudden irreversible changes in camera angles than to final bosses. After a cutscene ends and a chase + QTE sequence begins, you may have to hold backward to go forward. The timing is tight, so one of us would frequently get caught and killed. It was really frustrating to see our score go down because of this. You didn't have to worry about this in RE5.

Gamma. Holy hera! The gamma calibration was so off in comparison to other RE games. At first, I followed the instructions to turn it down until you could barely see the symbol. However, I literally could not see anything around my character. I was constantly stumbling into things and getting attacked from my periphery. The game was not remotely enjoyable until I cranked gamma up to 20.

QTEs. Strict timing like in RE5, but manageable. There were actually fewer QTEs during cutscenes than I would have liked. It was a bit boring to sit through them, because I don't know anyone who actually watches RE cutscenes for the story. A plus is that the QTE inputs were more consistent, whereas RE5 gave me PTSD by switching it up between left + right, action button, and crouch.

Driving sequences. These were the death of me.  I never want to see a snowmobile ever again. I crashed and died 10-11 times each time we had to navigate a vehicle. You have to drive so fast that you can’t even see the obstacles, but you can’t slow down either. Otherwise, you’ll get caught by enemies from behind, or the target you’re chasing gets away and you fail the checkpoint.",1625464404,1628532060,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After sitting down and be patient enough to finish all the campaigns, my opinions changed: It's a damn fine co-op action game. I went in expecting a Resident Evil game which I shouldn't have, that was probably why I despised it a lot in the first place.

[u][b]Things that Resident Evil 6 did well[/b][/u]

• [b]Well paced for an action game.[/b] After fights you get room to breathe before facing other waves of enemies.
• [b]The story is decent.[/b] This may be controversial but I quite enjoyed the story despise the criticism it has. It might not be as good as other Resident Evil games but still pretty fun on its own.
• [b]The characters.[/b] After finishing the game I appreciate so much more of Leon, Chris and Ada. The new characters such as Jake and grown-up Sherry are pretty interesting as well (except for Helena, she's kinda meh but I don't hate her). I feel like they've done a really good job writing them in this game.
• [b]You can finally run![/b] No more of that Resident Evil 4 and 5 trotting.
• [b]Level design is pretty well done for an action game.[/b] It's easy to follow and there are extra stuffs to find along the way as well.
• [b]The game's length.[/b] Resident Evil 6 is the longest game of the franchise, so if you enjoy games that run for more than 20 hours, this is for you.
• [b]Co-op is fun with friends.[/b] Remember to bring some friends with you, because randoms might try to friendly fire you (this happened to me, yup).

[u][b]Things that Resident Evil 6 did not so well[/b][/u]

• [b]Inventory management.[/b] This is the biggest con of Resident Evil 6 for me. Inventory feels clunky, you can basically see it as non-existent. It's just downright horrendous, even Resident Evil 5 did a better job with this.
• [b]Identity.[/b] The developers tried so hard to please every fans that they ended up disappointing everyone. It clearly does not feel like a Resident Evil game, and the horror that I loved in the older titles was never found in this title.
• [b]The atrocity of quick time events made its return![/b] They really prove time and time again that QTEs are really the worst thing that ever happened to this franchise. Thankfully this game has more tolerable QTEs than RE4 or RE5 but everytime you come across one you just wanna rip your head out.
• [b]Sudden camera angle changes in some segments.[/b] You cannot believe how many times I have died because this game decides to bring back fixed camera angle during tense moments?? It's a really annoying and pesky feature, and it's frequent enough to drive you mad.

[u][b]Every Resident Evil 6's campaign[/b][/u]

You can skip this part if you don't want any spoilers.

• [b]Leon's campaign[/b] is targeted to the zombie fans and the likes. This is supposed to please the Resident Evil fans who love the older titles but it was done rather... poorly. Zombies can use weapons and it looks goofy as hell. Generally, this campaign is okay and the final chapter is kinda epic. 
• [b]Chris' campaign[/b] is for Resident Evil 5 lovers. They feature the same-ish enemies from RE5 (called the J'avo). The combat/melee attacks feel really satisfying with Chris (don't know if it's the same for Piers but it probably is). Overall, I like the story side better than the gameplay side, but it's a decent campaign.
• [b]Jake's campaign[/b] is kinda a mix of Leon and Chris? It's hard to explain, but apparently Jake can do really good melee attacks (I didn't know, I was playing as Sherry). But otherwise, the story and the gameplay is fine on this one.
• [b]Ada's campaign[/b] is for the puzzle suckers from the older RE games. Features plenty of puzzle, and you get the choice of doing the campaign alone or multiplayer which is pretty cool. Ada's coolness is on point, the gameplay and plot is pretty a-okay as well.

[b]Resident Evil 6 is like what others said, a good action game but a terrible Resident Evil game.[/b] Luckily, this marks the end of the 4-5-6 trilogy and the series would turn back to its original horror roots with Resident Evil 7. Although an end to quite a controversial era, Resident Evil 6 is still a fun game, even more fun if you have friends to play it with. It's a pretty cheap time-killing game when it's on sale, and you get to dive more into the Resident Evil universe.

RE games are not narrative masterpieces by any stretch of the imagination but RE5 provided nontheless a fun third person coop experience. RE6 doesn't.

The main issues compared to RE5 are:
1) Terrible camera perspectives during action sequences and quick time events: The camera focuses on being cinematic but this often means you don't even see where you are going with your character. Sometimes you don't even see your own character while you are supposed to move around and evade dangers
2) Clumsy inventory interface: I don't understand what was wrong with the previous interation. But in this game inventory management is poorly implemented at least for a PC game. Hotkey assignment are impossible. You have to scroll through inventory through combination of button presses and mousewheel. You also can't choose your weapon layout anymore, meaning you will block a significact amount of your inventory space with ammunition wether you want to or not.
3) The progression system is unengaging. Instead of upgrading weapons you pick a set of three perks which you can upgrade from level one to three. Consequently you have very little meaningful choice. While in RE5 you could chosse from a variety of weapons and upgrade them, most perks in RE6 are only useful in niche circumstances. Generally you pick firearm damage, melee damage and health because they are always useful, reducing the effective amount of player choice to practically nothing.
4) No item swapping in coop. 
5) No shared progression in coop. If you find emblems or collectibles every coop partner has to pick them up seperatly for some unknown reason
6) Areas are extremly cramped with doors requiring both players interact carefully gating the players from area to area. These ""two players doors"" are extremly ubiquitous. A coop game has to do something like that in order to keep players from straying too far. RE6 is just extremly uncreative when it comes to accomplishing that goal. This gives the game an ""on-the-rails"" feeling that is only seldomly interrupted by open areas.

None of these issues are by themselves gamebreaking. However, in combination they make for a frustrating and lackluster experience. I can't give an impression on the multiplayer since I only played the main campaigns in coop. If you are looking for a coop game I suggest you try RE5 first. In addition to the aformentioned issues you should also have a high tolerance for quick time events, since they are pretty much everywhere.",1628293314,1628293314,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay wasn't horrible, but it got tiring after 4 campaigns and other games in the series do it better.
I really liked the co-op, but I feel that's mainly because I was playing it with a friend who's also a big Resident Evil fan and we could laugh at it together.
There is some really great stuff buried in this game, but it's surrounded by repetitive mechanics, tiring setpieces, hit-or-miss stories, and a complete betrayal of everything that made the series great.
If you're a Resident Evil fan who wants to experience all the games, play it with a friend, you'll probably have a good time. I recommend starting with the Chris campaign. It's easily the best so do know that it'll all be downhill from there, but if you dont like Chris' campaign, you will hate the rest of the game.

Review wise this game isn't exactly that great of a Resident Evil game (If you can call it that). It's kind of a jumbled up mess and there's not much consistency, but it is a fun game to play and laugh at with a friend so I'll give it that.

You would have to be a moron to play it alone. The only way to enjoy this generally terrible game is to laugh at it with a buddy.

Edit: After finishing the game, I can say without a doubt the following about Resident Evil 6:
1. The gameplay is horrible and it backtracks on everything that made RE4 and RE5 fun.
2. The story is nonsensical, poorly executed and explained even worse.
3. The voice acting ranges from alright at best to atrocious at worst.
4. The game is CONSTANTLY interrupted by quicktime events and cutscenes. I would honestly wager that I spent about half my time playing this game in either a quicktime or a cutscene instead of controlling my character.
5. There is no semblance of difficulty even on the hardest setting, No Hope, which only marginally reduces the amount of ammo you get.
6. The pacing of the game is some of the worse I have ever experienced.
7. The game overall is a total shit-show packed with terrible action movie tropes that would make Michael Bay blush.
8. The game is incredibly glitchy and broken. Enemies are constantly teleporting around, appearing and disappearing, and the collision of the game areas are generally subpar at best.
9. The music is bland and forgettable.
10. And finally, the controls. The controls in RE6 are some of the most obtuse, unresponsive and actively unfun I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing in a video game. The camera jitters rapidly and uncontrollably while running if you try to change directions with the mouse, to the point of inducing motion sickness. The game also is CONSTANTLY ripping control of your camera away from you to show you something inconsequential, which destroys whatever semblance of flow was left after the constant quicktime events and cutscenes. Your character enters a lengthy, uncontrollable falling animation that lasts about 6 seconds after being shot more than once, which also makes trying to play agonizing and constantly disrupts gameplay.

Overall I have no idea how or why this game was made. It's so universally bad by every metric that me and my brother had numerous moments of gut-busting laughter at the absurdity and general atrociousness of the game, so I guess it has that going for it. Play it with a friend for giggles, or don't play it at all.

THE GOOD:
[list]
[*]4 Campaigns with crossovers
[*]FANTASTIC animation
[*]The action gets your blood pumping in the first few moments
[/list]
THE BAD:
[list]
[*]The action is all there is.  There's no exploration, no reward for being extra diligent beyond the typical out-of-play extras.  [*]It makes the action lose all meaning
[*]THE CAMERA. GOD, THE CAMERA.  It feels like an old PS1 game. 
[*]You see how in the promo video characters sometimes move around in circles to do something?  That's not a nifty dodge.  It's how you move.  The movement controls are kind of hit and miss. 
[*]The key mapping, by default, is nothing like the previous games.   This makes sense only in as much as neither are the controls.  Remember tabbing into your inventory to pause the action?  NOPE.   You'll be holding ALT and scrolling with your mouse, or hitting a key that brings up an item menu with NO CLUE how to use it.   I know, you're thinking, ""ti's just an inventory"", but imagine playing old Zelda and having to hold the Select key white twisting the controller sideways and holding A plus the directional pad to select the flute. 
[*]The QTEs are back and man are they awkward.   You're either rolling WASD keys in order or rapidly tapping the key you mapped to actions.
[*]Back to that inventory.  Not only is there no pause, but you have to seelct every item previous to the one you want to get to the one you want. 
[*] The HUD is confusing; it resembles old arcade rifle shooters, with a bullet count in little  bullet icons and a number indicating all of the shells in your inventory.   Health is a large series of blocks, while combat energy is in a little bar. 
[*] Gone are the onscreen prompts like blood around the edges to tll you that our health is low.  Your only indicator is your nearly transparent HUD. 
[*] Herbs shake into pills, and pills only restore one point of health.  Found a red herb?  Mix it to get 5 green pills basically.  
[*] Bosses often lack visible weak spots and the ""difficulty"" is bullet sponge elimination. 
[*]You can't carry ammo for every weapons, and ive found no inventory expansion item
[*] The level design is atrocious.   You're often running or driving in scripted events and the controls are sluggish and bad.  The developers appear to have looked up ""levels players hate"" because you WILL have sewer levels and there IS an underwater level where you have to hunt air pockets like Sonic the Hedgehog. Unfortunately, you can't see most of the things you need to save your life or to avoid getting killed until they've killed you already. 
[*]NOTHING is scary about this, other than the damage it does tot he franchise.  The constant threats completely eliminate the sense of tension and foreboding that made the games great
[*] Companion AI always gets the easy job while you're stuck with your back to the wall, no ammo, no health items. 
[*] Those health items are so rare they are almost pointless
[*] Prior games rewarded identifying a sleeping zombie and killing it.  In this game, unless a script has run to make it attack you AND it's been put on its feet, bullets *pass through* the target, so you have to piss it off and risk injury to kill it. 
[*] You MUST master the dodge mechanic, because once a zombie begins its attack, it is invincible until it lands it.
[*] Campaigns spoil each other due to them not being in chronological  order. 
[*] Most bosses are killed by a scripted event, and some you may as well not even shoot. 
[*] Companions can't share loot
[*] Game is so totally on rails that if you see a place to explore, it's really just where it was going to send you next. 
[*] Even a successful QTE can be ignored and you'll get hurt anyway
[*] Some QTEs chain in a way that if you fail the first, the next one coming up will hurt you
[*] Most of the time, running from zombies isn't an option.   You absolutely must kill everyone on the field. 
[/list]

Edit: Since my last attempt, i tried playing the game again, but with a setting that ostensibly disables the QTEs.  It doesn't, actually, except for certain QTEs that would prevent you from watching the story unfold because you have to do the QTE to not die.  However, this did make enough of a difference to enjoy it, and I happily played through Leon's campaign and started into the others.   I'll update this list as I go, but here's what to expect:

[Prologue] - Easy peasy.   Just shoot zombies when you see them, though one or two can be evaded.   

[Leon Campaign] - The nerfed QTEs from the setting toggle helped a lot here.   I enjoyed most of the playthrough, and most enemies were zombies, as one might expect from a zombie game. 

[Chris Campaign] - Chris's campaign starts out more militaristic, but play focused a lot more on weak point discovery.  This had more ""first run traps"", such as a hall where if you go for ammo before you chase off an invisible snake monster, it will yank you up into the vents and you get a game over screen.  I ran out of ammunition more often here, but Chris is a dynamo with a combat knife.   Unfortunately, this campaign also introduced the dreaded ""running in reverse"" that no gamer enjoys, where you have to run toward the screen from something that kills you if you slow down or stop at all, but also have to climb or slide under things as if you were playing Crash Bandicoot backward.   The final boss for the campaign even has this feature, with the camera angle becoming your worst enemy as it flips around and messes with your running direction. 

[Jake Campaign] - This campaign has been hell so far.   It starts with some passable combat moments and story tension, but whoever designed these levels thinks that turning the environment against the player in a Nintendohard fashion is fun, especially combined with the 'Ustanak'. That word means ""uprising"", but in this case, it's Nemesis from RE:3 but without random appearance, with a multipurpose arm that seems to change function as easily as MegaMan selecting a weapon.  He's in every mission so far that doesn't involve you driving a sluggish snowmobile at breakneck speeds to escape an avalanche, and im stuck on the ultimate crap combo: a stealth mission where if you step on ice or shoot a gun or otherwise make noise, Ustanak busts through a wall and kills you almost instantly.   If your'e seen by his pet fireflies, he does it as well.  Then, you have to use bombs to distract him while your partner gets a card key, and then do ->8<- QTEs in rapid succession using the movement keys or again, instant death.   You have to run between those QTEs as well, so if you happen to hit a movement button as the QTE finishes, you lose half a second and die to the Ustanak. 
[Ada Campaign] let you know after I finish the Jake campaign....if I can stomach it.

I know what my major issue is.   if you've ever played D&D or another tabletop game with a bad DM, that's how this feels.   Innovation isn't rewarded.  You aren't allowed to outsmart the design, but instead must follow tightly on the rails. QTEs arefrequent and sometimes even success equates to failure.   Particularly in the Jake campaign, I feel less like I'm playing a game and more like I'm going through  level design that was put together specifically to make sure players ragequit.",1558447101,1627085980,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

During one single hour of gameplay during Leon's story, Leon crash-landed an airliner, his partner (Helena) drove a bus through a barricade, he fought a boss on top of high speed passenger trains (trains.  Yes.  Plural trains) which all derailed in the process, and he piloted a helicopter which he also crashed.  

Michael Bay would think that this video game has too many explosions.  Because it does.  

And instead of a virus that mutates spiders into giant monster spiders, this time the writers decided it would be a good idea if the virus mutated humans into many different kinds of bugs and animals.  So you will, if you play this game, have to shoot at human torsos with spider legs that are carrying machine guns and shooting at you.  What?  How did this game get published?  Capcom, what were you thinking?

All action.  No horror.  The only horror is in the monsters' looks.  But it never unsettles you.  It doesn't benefit from playing late at night with the lights off.

-Money well spent
-Obviously Co-op, better with friends!
-Well placed over-the-top theatrics
-Appropriately delivered cliches and stereotypes
-Can push obstacles the size of boulders, but cant move a lawn chair blocking your path
-If it looks like a trap/boss room it probably is
-Plenty of unique boss fights and usual variety of enemies with some additions
-Usual level of unnecessary boob physics (Since RE5)

My only complaint is that, with the story it is fairly easy to find what 'should be a twist':
-You kinda know who your villain is immediately
-You kinda figure out how a mysterious figure fits into the story before you're 4 of 20 chapters in
-By the time you begin the 2nd story, you pretty much have everything figured out and there's not really any more mystery/plot unless you're terrible at missing hints so the rest feels like 'filler'

Tip: Play through the whole game. Plenty of content with 20 chapters and 4 stories alongside each other.",1626547816,1626547913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will say that it took itself less seriously than Resident Evil 5, more along the lines of Resident Evil 4. My favorite dialogue line was ""Hey, Japanese guy, get the shutters!"" A lot of corny scenarios occur.

As a Resident Evil game it fails horribly - as if Capcom forgot what made their previous titles successful by slapping new-age garbage mechanics and dramatic tension to meet the 2012 trend requirements, and as a triple A game it is a slap to the face.

The countless bugs and glitches were the only thing in the game that put a smile on my face, such as a helicopter clipping through the buildings and shooting missiles directly at me. The combat system adds ""cool"" combo moves, but in doing so the game lacks critical feedback that tells the player what state the enemy is in. Headshots practically mean nothing and ammo conservation is useless. Any ammo that is obtained is immediately spent afterwards. The only way to keep ammo is to overuse the melee attacks which becomes repetitive very quickly.

Guns and characters look really nice but the texture quality in the environment are 144p MS paint graphics anti-aliased to hell. I only looked forward to playing each chapter for the cutscenes at the end to get a grasp of the story which was convoluted to follow, so much so that everything in this game was never mentioned in subsequent titles. I have no reason to replay the campaign more than once and the mercenaries gamemode was pretty much the only challenge but boring to play for more than an hour at most. I wish I refunded this game when I accidentally clipped through the table in the first chapter by vaulting over a pot, but I gave it a chance to only disappoint me.

This game isn't that great but i'm still recommending it to anyone with a friend that they can play with so you can get it if you want just remember steam lets you refund games. 

But DON'T PLAY ADA WONGS STORY WITH A FRIEND it's to unpolished because it was originally a secret campaign you use to get it by beating all three of the other campaigns, and on top of that her story wasn't originally multiplayer so they just slapped a un-named character in called ""Agent"" that's so bugy that they aren't even bugs he cant open doors and weapon cases and this is all on purpose.

It's even more action-oriented, to the point that many fans, myself included, said it's more like a shooter game with scary enemies compared to horror. Like RE5, this game is co-op friendly, where every mission is playable with a partner. There are 4 separate campaigns which sometimes intersect, and the playable characters are Leon/Helena, Chris/Piers, Jake/Sherry, and Ada. You can co-op on Ada's campaign, a non-canon character named Agent will appear during gameplay, but disappear in cutscenes.

Combat gameplay is similar, but also has a lot of new features. The most noticeable and important for me was the ability to move around while aiming, something RE4 and 5 doesn't have. There's also the ability to slide, roll, dodge, and quickshot. While RE6 has a lot more combat moves, honestly I prefer RE5's simpler combat. There's a lot more action scenes, like where you run away while being chased or the place falling apart, and quite plenty vehicle driving/combat scenarios. To be honest I'm not a fan of the amount of running scenes, there's just to many. And outside the helicopter combat moments, which is fun and still feels ""in tone"" with the game, vehicle scenes just feels jarring and very unlike a RE game.

Due to having 4 campaigns, RE6's story is quite long, it can be 5-7 hours each. Each campaign explores different areas, so it's not repeating the same levels 4 times. Although some levels use the same map or with minor differences, usually story intersection levels. All campaigns (except Ada) explore one character's relationship with their partner, giving a lot of time for development. They also have unique weapons and melee finisher moves. With many playable characters and their unique combat strategies, gameplay becomes a lot more fun and varied. It's actually a strong point for this game, like Separate Ways in RE4. It also has a Mercenaries mode, score attack levels like the ones in RE4 and 5, and Mercenaries No Mercy, a crossover with Left 4 Dead featuring characters from there and weaker, but more numerous zombies.

Remember how I said RE6 is really action-oriented and co-op friendly? It is also a major weakness for menu and inventory management. The in-game menu (Esc) where you can change settings and controls, are made in-game. That means you cannot open the menu in combat since you'll get attacked. I know it's preferable for co-op, but not everyone has friends or motivation to play that way. If you play offline there is a pause button, but you still cannot view the menu while the game pauses. Opening inventory also plays in real-time, making combining items or switching weapons difficult and stressful especially when you're in a pinch. You also cannot trade items or use your partner's inventory as an extra storage like in RE5, and the inventory is quite small. In short, it's way too co-op friendly, even if you play alone.

Despite the action direction the story takes, lore-wise I think it still makes sense. Since the use of bioweapons became more prevalent, it makes sense that zombies and the creatures here appear, and in large numbers. And of course the virus can be modified by scientists, creating the gun-using zombies who still have some intelligence. Resident Evil 6 is a good game, but comparing it to other titles it makes this game feel weird and out of place. However, with the return of many likeable characters, horror RE fans still should play this game despite the large difference in its tone and atmosphere. If you're new to the franchise, however, do not use this game as your first entry, get RE2 remake instead.",1626025887,1626025887,True,3,0,0.513419032096862793,0,True,False,False

When RE6 came out, I figured, wow RE and multiplayer. The co-op isn't without issues but made the game worth playing. The side multiplayer maps are better. I saw some people going on about B-Movie quality, isn't that what the games were originally?

The original RE games were, in my opinion, confusing, frustrating, and clunky. I was 12 when it was genre defining and it was too hard and complicated for me then - I had no particular love for the 'traditional' formula and no reason to care about where the series went. But at least then the Resident Evil games were a unique property - something that did what they did better than the imitators around them. So where RE 4 hit a precious middle-ground in increasing the pace of the action without losing sight of what made the series enjoyable (a lucky shot that could just have easily missed the mark), RE 5 began emitting the whiff of corporate mandating as pilfered gameplay elements from other properties and genres began to creep into the series to draw in a larger player base. 

In Resident Evil 6 we see the natural end-point of swapping creative design for profit-motive. This game reeks of gimmicky excess standing in for a desperate lack of inspiration - the kind of creative bankruptcy that stained so many games of the 20-teens and rendered them utterly forgettable amongst the quagmire of conceptual plagiarism they all engaged in as they scrabbled for shreds of consumer attention like rats in a dumpster. 

If you want a bombastic 3rd-person shooter made in Japan play Binary Domain. It shares many frustrations with RE 6, but is better than you expect it to be. At least that game throws itself entirely in the direction it's leaning rather than trying to keep one foot in two worlds that are diametrically opposed in terms of tone and pace. RE 6 wants to be a high-octane action shooter while also forcing dated and annoying gameplay mechanics onto the player to simulate tension it can't organically manufacture when the narrative arc is 'kill zombie' and the entire game can be played by pressing one button at a time. 

I don't have any great investment in the series' creative direction. Who gives a sh*t what a game does mechanically if it does it well? But they say that if a book doesn't grab you in the opening chapter, then it hasn't earned your time. Resident Evil 6 throws a lot at you in its opening chapter and like so many that tried this same tactic, it fails to pull it off better than the games its aping. It's enjoyed something of a critical resurgence as expectations have boiled down and while I can appreciate that it's some mindless, functional fun with a solid amount of content on offer, I've played far too many milquetoast rip-offs trying to snatch some of Gears of War's success to endure this without a very stale taste in my mouth. 

Resident Evil 6 is the point a creative, innovative property truly buckled and became a cowed plagiarist desperate for attention. Capcom came around and closed the circle with its 7th release, but I cannot imagine a scenario in which 4 separate campaigns built on the paltry foundations of this game can provide something worth the time it would take to explore them.

Do you like when a game takes control of your point of view while said cutscenes are still going on and give a chance to let you die and restart the fun all over again? Do you like stupid stories, tropes and generic monsters? If you said Yes to all or any of the above, this game is for you. 

Abomination of a game. Just wanted to go through it once. The pain is forever etched into my memory.

There are many difficulties to select from, so pretty much anyone can play it. There were times when the game was insanely frustrating, my brother and I got super mad at the game and each other when we played Chris and Piers on Professional (the part where you had to escape the giant BOW). Even after changing on Normal it was still challenging, so keep that in mind. There were a few parts like that, but overall the game's pretty easy.

As I've mentioned before, this game is fun to play with someone close, EXCEPT for the Ada campaign. Neither of us wanted to play as Agent because he's literally non-existent in the story. I don't see why they would even add him in the game at all, because the only purpose he serves is killing enemies, or dying if P2 isn't skilled enough. He can't open doors, he doesn't appear in the cutscenes, etc. I'm not saying that it'd be much better if he could, I'm just saying that since Ada works alone, he shouldn't even exist in the game. Maybe it was just for the sake of being able to play co-op in Ada's campaign, but it's pointless 'cause it isn't enjoyable.

Overall, Resident Evil 6 is an okay game. I'd say it was 7.3/10 for me. Buy it if you have someone to play with and if you think it's satisfying to shoot zombie heads, NOT if you're a fan of RE classics.",1600705268,1625225416,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Trying to pull in way too many directions with multiple stories trying to extend the game, the product as a whole is a mess. There are some good ideas in this game, I must admit, but the execution is botched. Quick time events return on steriods, punishing you to a ridiculous degree at times regardless of which story you play. Animation hitboxes for hazards or even enemy attacks so big they have their own zip code, (getting smeared by an oncoming train despite being on the opposite track) you rely even more than ever on invincibility frames and quick time animations. Gone is any merchant or upgrading system from 4 and 5, what you find and hold on to is what you get with an unremarkable skill system to augment your gameplay. If there is any saving grace, is that Mercenaries mode is still fun with a friend but honestly that's a hard game type to legitimately screw up. Combined with a story that demands you to play every pair in order to make sense of it, campaign as a whole can be ridiculously long even with a coop partner.

resident evil fans: worst in main series with bad story and bad characters . gameplay sucks . auto save . no need to loot . no need to fine your way . you dont kill zombies anymore . not survival game and etc
for not resident evil fans or resident evil 5 fans: just go ahead and buy this before read this!! / the game is awesome!! go ahead and kill all zombies and survive with your teammates to zombie attack with awesome gameplay and being ultimate crashing machine best in series for you guys no need to loot for item no need to find way amazing story you can play
main review:
so capcom wth ? is this resident evil ? really?? this is action third person shooter game
ZOMBIES: with c-virus now zombies are better then humans they can aim and shoot like a military forces, they can use snipe to aim your head and kill you with the distance like sniper elite,  they ride tanks!, using rpg against heli, apc, tanks and etc, they actually ride a heli and the worst point is they can be pilot and fly the jets!! and they do this better then ace combat and h.a.w.x series!! so just ignore that they are zombies. i mean even the normal zombies from leon camping are not the same zombies. the officers are now holding a gun and shooting at you and others throw you objectives and control the gears that ride a pipes or active trap for you and etc so dont even think they are zombies 
GAMEPLAY: with ultimate non-stop action game play you can cover and shooting from edge, dogging the bullets like maxpayne, attack the enemies with your hands like wwe sports and jackie chan, covering behind the objectives and shooting like a gears of war, ride a vehicle like james bond and enjoy the war like a call of duty or even battlefield !!
STORY: you can see new stories from old and new characters you can see albert wesker son here -__- wesker? son?? yea this is what capcom do to the story and his partner is sherry birkin hey.. wait a second... you mean that child in re2? yes exactly -__- but this is not the end!! you can also see carla radames becoming and acting like ada wong, you just want to puking up like a baby and original ada wong (lol i must say original ada wong when i want to talk about her) is spider woman in resident evil 6 or just even better then that :D",1561855814,1625024811,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,5,True,False,False

1-No trader,no sense of progression,no reason to look around that much. (This game's crappy skill system is a joke)
2-EVERYTHING is a Quick time event and button mashing. Open door ? Button mash,grabbed by enemy ? button mash. Its jammed in everything and everywhere.
3-Running from [Event] sections. Remember crash bandicoot bosses that you run away from ? 
Imagine that but its not fun. You run from events,you run from bosses. You RUN all the time.

Only reason I keep playing this because it has co-op and its fun to play with friends.
If you are looking for a good Resident Evil game this is not it. Its a barely mediocre action game.

Edit: It takes about 23 hours to finish the whole campaign. I played a couple of rounds of mercenaries because there aren't too many guns (compared to RE4 for example). I didn't bother more than 30 minutes. Its such a shame to not recommend this game but too many stuff gone and it makes a lot of difference. This game could have been 8 hours of content and that would have been just fine.

Please Capcom bring back Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong for Resident Evil 9, and maybe even Helena Harper. The rest of this game is a best forgotten mess.

In 4 you are dragging around -the- most annoying side character in gaming.
In 5 there barely is a story, with the most cliche final boss fight ever.

Yeah, it's no hollywood masterpiece but it does not have a terrible story, especially compared to 4 and 5, i mean come on.

Pros (whole game)
+ 3 main story to play with co-op. Pretty long if not speed run at all.
+ and extra Ada story, also co-op... somehow.
+ Co-op is what make this one good.
+ Load of action. Bore of shooting enemy? Kick them, punch them, ignore them, sandwich them.
+ Old heroine meeting ground.
+ Down you teammate with your weapon & spam Good job at your friend ass.


Cons (game play/function)
- Expect lot of death from TON of QTE/escape event.
- Worst camera angel in history of Video Game. Specially when you run.
- Not much worth replay, but still okay from time to time.
- Not that much story intercourse, really.
- Unless you know what to do and have a rabbit foot, enjoy unlimited cheap way to drain your HP and ammo. It's on par with The lost world Rail Shooting Arcade.
- Don't play solo unless you want some pain. Go play real action game instead.

You have zero control over the character. He, she is all over the place.

You open the door into a cutscene only to be greeted with another door just as the cutscene ends. You press V for ""wait"" and you get into a room. Filled with enemies, about 5 of them, and after you have been running around in circles looking at the ceiling, the floor and every wall 54 times back and forth, you have killed the enemies (god forbid you get hit, cause then you'll rolling around on the floor for an extended period of time, with no guarantee that you dont get hit again on your way up).

This game feels empty and does not contribute anything to the RE saga and because everything else is pure skit. You want to skip it.

TL;DR play RE5 instead.

RE6 has a long list of sins that really impede the fun:
- Unskippable cutscenes
- Cutscenes regularly breaking up action (10+ during boss fights!)
- You can take damage during cutscenes (I've died several times to this)
- Frequent loss of camera control during gameplay (to look at some stupid thing while you take damage)
- Quick-time event boss battles
- Slow-walking sequences
- Tripping over corpses and objects
- Character turns like a boat, enjoy falling into pits
- First campaign with Leon and Helena casually drops all the plot twists in the other character's campaigns. Why the heck would I slog through another 8 hours of campaign just to see the same ""twist""?

Did I have some laughs playing coop with a bud? Absolutely because this game is so bad sometimes it's good. Was it worth $40? No, no it wasn't.

For anyone looking for an entry into the more ""action"" games from RE series, play RE5 and you won't be disappointed. It's tastefully campy, with decent progression and good continuous action sequences. RE5 I enjoyed playing through the campaign multiple times. RE6 I can't be arsed to replay the campaign with the other characters because it feels like such a slog.",1622845265,1622845935,False,0,0,0.474898248910903931,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, it is fairly decent apart from the strange new inventory system, and the actual in game inventory system is really just not that good. Also having the run and interact button be the same led to a solid 3 deaths because of my person deciding to climb up a ledge and then immediately climb back down the ledge to only get hit with my next complaint, falling. If an enemy snipes you, you fall, if an enemy coughs next to you, you will fall and have to get up faster than they can attack, if you don't, you will be stuck on the ground like a newborn baby wearing a BSAA uniform. Not the boulder punching Chris Redfield I seem to remember. The amount of quicktime events that are found in this game are another area that I feel it would have been better off without, watching what seems like a transition only to be hit with a sudden ""press space + R"" led to an exasperated sigh and another try so that I can pick up a bit before only to hyper focus on every transition scene for the next hour of gameplay.

The story of the game s broken up into four separate campaigns, where you play as different characters in different places. Each of the campaigns tells it's own story, but fits into larger narrative and each serve as a piece of the puzzle that connects the main mystery of the game. You can play any campaign in any order you want, but to actually understand the story as a whole, you have to play them all.
The story of the game is very convoluted and bloated beyond any strectch. Not only you have to follow 7 different characters in their own stories, the game itself is full of filler, while not even explaining what the hell is going on. The gameplay is just constantly interrupted with cutscenes of people talking what they need to do to poceed, which annoying, and most of the cutscenes you can't even skip. 
There are some good moments in tehre, but there are two main issues. First, the game takes itself way too seriously, constantly talking about how fate of the entire world is on the line. There is not a trace of some kind of jokiness and lighthearted fun in any situation, everyone is super-serious and doesn't want to make or take jokes at all. Second, the characters are actually unbearable, they are either stupid, act like a-holes, or bland and boring as a piece of wood. leon most of the game just follows around and does what everyone else tells him to do. Chris was completely butchered, erasing progress of his character from RE5 completely, and making him petty whiny b*tch. Jake, while being the son of one the most charismatic characters in the series, acts like an ididot, a-hole and he is bland uninteresting all at the same time. 
And at the same time, the ideas presented here are worth explorring. it is definetely interesting to explore Chris' inner psyche after so much war and fighting, because he probably would suffer from some kind of PTSD. Jake and Sherry beign kids of the biological war are actually worth talking about in the context of RE, two characters who's parents were responsible for so much horror and tragedy, using their gifts to fight for the good of the world is intriguing. But why in this game? Why Jake has to be the most awful character written in RE series? Why Chris has to suffer right after the game he got his closure with Jill and Wesker?  Why Leon does nothing but simping over Ada?

Then there are graphivs. The game actually looks ugly. There is this blue/grey filter over everything at all times. The textures are low-resolution and blurry, it's like they took 144p picture and streched into FullHD. The particle effects look cheap. The game actually looks like a remaster of a PS2 title. the only good part of the games visuals are character modles. There is certainly a lot of love and care put into them But there rest of the game is just unpleasant to look at. 

But how the game actually plays? Well, RE6 tries to be this action game, with big and crazy setpieces, loud combat and cool moves. The blueprint of RE4 is here, third-person camera, manual aiming and shooting, butnow movement is no longer tank-control based, characters can freely strafe around and even move while aiming. The game also borrows a lot of the mechanics from it's contemporaries, like cover system, sprinting and dodge-rolls. The game tries to blend RE stuff, with something like Uncharted, maybe a little bit of Call of Duty Modern Warfare, it tries to be as much of spectacle as possible, while provifing tight gameplay in combat.
But everything feels sloppy and weird. The movement has so much lag. Incredible combat of Re4 is gone, because there is no actual combat sandbox, the game just throws enemies at you and you just shoot them. new melee moves look cool, but rely too muvh on context sensitive inputs and require you tyo manage this new stamina gauge, which is probably was put there for you to not abuse powerful melee attacks, but in the end just punishes you for having fun. There is this weird new quick-shot mechanic, whioch probably should be used to interrupt attacks and stagger enemies, but sometimes enemies can decide to not react to it at all. 
Also, what is worng with this UI? Instead of classic grid based inventory, you get this weird wheel that looks different on each character. In older games you just pick the grid you want and do whatever you want with it. Here you have to actaully sroll to the thing you want to use, and then press a button to use it. The herbs are reworked that now they act as some sort of pills, and if you mix herbs you just get more pills that you can swallow. and tose pills have their own separate space when stored. so there is no reason to hold your herbs and they waste space in your inventory until you find red herb to mis them with. There is also problem with ammo. The game either showers you with it so much you don'e know what to do with it, or doesn't give you any at all, instead giving you new points for the awful skill system.
the skill system should be a replacement for buying new weapons and upgrades. Some skills give you more damage, some improve you defence, some can even spice up your gameplay with something unique. But the price on those skills are just outrageous. You would have to grind hard until you get skills you want leveled up. The game is long, but even then, at the end you would have only a couple of skills leveled up to maximum. 
But the biggest problem with the game is how much it tislef stops you from laying. The game constatly eitehr stuns you, you shakes the cameera around, or locks you into a QTE section, or just straight up takes control away from you, especially in sequences where you have to run in the crumbling facility and sking ships, where there is an earthquake every 30 seconds that shakes everything and doesn't let you control anything until it decides to stop. The game relies so hard on QTEs, that everything you do would be a QTE. Brreak away from enemy, turn a valve, press a button, hit an enemy. Everything is QTE., and the kind of QTE that people bullied so hard it was deleted from gaming last console generation. 
And there is still forced co-op even if you play solo. Thankfully, unlike RE5, now your AI companion is invincible, has unlimited ammo, and you don't need to manage it's inventory. The only function it has is to assist you in scritpted sequences and help you get up after you lose all of your HP. But now you can't even pause the game. Even if you disconnect from the internet, you can not stop it.Just why you would fix one thing and then completely break the other?

All of this piles up into very annoying and unpleasant experience. I know there are still people that enjoy this game and it's own brand of action. it's now in thephase where people can even nostalgic about it. But it should've ben a lot better. The series desrves better, the fans deserve better. As big blockbuster action game, it severely lacks polish of AAA game and is too clunky to be a glorious action experience it wants to give you. Even budge ttitle such as Devil May Cry 4, despite reusing assets and having troubled development from the same company, just focused on what matters and made the game really good. And that is probably what RE6 lacks the most, focus. It tries to be too many things at once, trying to please fans and new comers, trying to be both RE and not RE. This is a failure that could put any other franchise into the grave. Good thing Re is an everchanging frachise at this point. And it always deserved a second chance.",1622673057,1622673057,False,4,0,0.529451668262481689,0,True,False,False

Resident evil 5 managed to satirize Hollywood films of its era (inadvertently or not) whereas this one failed to understand the aesthetic draw of its previous success. The combat is a genuine chore and it doesn't make use of any of the elements in previous games that added tension or a challenge to the player (resource management, inventory management, etc.) and opted to make a mediocre 3rd person shooter.

Just ended up playing an even worse version of it, everyone know that Capcom sucks at porting to pc, but this game is the top of the cake. While the original looks poorly tested, I'm pretty sure this port itself wasn't even tested at all. It's just a straight port, and the devs doens't even bothered adding a proper key setup for pc. Controls were always bad, and this version has even worse default configuration that you can't even fix because some commands are still tied to the same keys and there's no alternate keys setup. Just try reloading your gun when there's loot dropped close to you to see what happens. You can only change weapons through the mouse wheel (enough said, you got CONSOLIZED), and the weapon HUD is giant covering the center of the screen, meaning that changing weapons will either cause you to miss your aim, getting damaged or having to sit still till it disappear. The mouse look causes even more bugs than the console version already has, just check the forum for Chris's pier section: I died 3 times there without even knowing what happened and came straight to the forum completely convinced it was a glitch. Bingo. 
Not like this is the only issue, the design itself is poor and irritating in every way possible and makes you just want to finish the game fast. Playing this game is an absolute torment that I would just recommend if you're a RE fan and needs to know the plot, and with 80% off at least. Thought about dropping it at several moments, so painful it was, and I never did it before unless the game wasn't even worth to be called a game. Enemy placement is just irritating (like placing an enemy on top of you when you can't aim straight upwards, or spawning an enemy with a gun shooting your face when your char calmly finishes climbing a ladder where you couldn't see upwards), enemies are boring (you fight enemies with guns 80% of the game, wich makes the game looks a generic shooter, and enemy design itself it not attractive), zombie mutations makes it look like you're playing L2D (wich makes the game lose it's identity and looks like a generic zombie game), and some boss fights have so terrible and ridiculous fighting scenes that will make you miss Chris punching a boulder.  
There's no pause for enemies in cutscenes: they will keep walking and surrounding you and when you regain control they will instantly attack/damage you.  Same will happen when you need to wait for your dumb AI partner to open a door.
I can barely call it a game, actually, seem fanmade stuff far better than this, actual players wouldn't do this crap. Looks like the devs just randomly popped enemies around the map to reach the quota. They don't even know the difference between challenging & irritating, between scare jump & a monster that bursts from the wall instantly damaging you.
Vertical Sync doens't work. 
I don't even remember dying to enemies, but must've died like 50 times on instant death events due to the camera angle (there's even a record for it, died past 50). That same camera angle mess with your directions when kicks in (always in the moments you need to run), causing the direction keys to change directions, causing you to walk down a pit or just get stuck running into a wall. Not to mention the weird angle choices, like focusing on a monster while you can't see the next obstacle that will kill you.
Some QTE scenes makes you fell you're playing a buttom masher (smash to swim or you die...).
Hitting item boxes is harder and slower than hitting enemies.
There's empty sections for absolutely nothing - level start, you walk down a hallway and have to wait for a CUTSCENE to open a simple door. Shouldn't even have a door in there.
There's a few good sequences, such as the invisible snake boss and the plane crash sequence, wich are really good from the start till the end, and you will surelly have fun seeing some character's meetings. You will not want to miss those if you're a fan and gonna buy the game anyway, just be ready for the absolute torment that is playing 90% of this game. This could easily be the worse RE game ever, if that ridiculous excuse of an FPS for PS1 never existed.
This game is a disaster in every way. Stay away from it, people thumbs it up cause it has ""RE"" on title. I can play RE4 with the weird old school controls and have fun, but this is just an absolute torment.",1622563474,1622570040,False,1,0,0.50321120023727417,0,True,False,False

Pros.:
- Some storylines like love line between Jake and Sherry.
- Some old characters like Sherry.
- Certain cross plot moments.
- The idea of exploring the game through different characters.

Cons.:
- Redesign of Leon and Ada. It's just an epic fail. Ada was flawless in RE4. Why the hell did they redesign her? Also, you play and just watch her ass in leather trousers. I don't mind that but I would rather see old Ada's design with modern graphics than her ass. There was so much chemistry between her and Leon before. And now it's gone. Dialogues, all bland.
- The main villain. Bland. Just a waste.
- The whole game became something like Call of Duty. Humvee race with the sport car? You kidding me? I'm playing NFS now?
- The plot is just boring. They tried to exploit old ideas like RE2 and RE5 but it's a failure, it's not convincing at all.
- QTE stuff. Another fail. It's annoying to play this way.
- The most important thing - the spirit of RE is gone. Suspense, horror, fear, mystery. It's just a blockbuster now.

If you want to watch what's up - just watch the game in youtube.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I here a lot of ""Oh well it's not a great RE game, but it's a pretty good game.""
This is not true, it's bullshit.

I played all of Leon, Chris, and Jake's campaigns, before I finally had enough of this heap of smoldering dog shit.
Jake's campaign is the closest this gets to being ""good"", Leon's felt like a weird mediocre mish-mash of Left 4 Dead and RE4, and Chris' felt like 3rd person COD. 

I'm only reviewing it now because some weird part of me, after beating RE4 on Pro, decided ""hEy, I'm GoNnA gO dO aDa'S cAmPaIgN aNd HaVe ThEm AlL dOnE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! iT cAn'T bE tHaT bAd, RiGhT?????????????""

The beautiful machine pistol that never runs out of usefulness, and the explosive crowd control device known as the Bowgun. Hard to fuck up something that's already been done well, wouldn't you think? Capcom managed it! The TMP feels terrible, it is so incredibly weak it hurts, and the Crossbow is reduced to a pitiful shell of it's former self. 

I'd recommend just avoiding the game completely, but if you absolutely MUST play RE6, play through Jake's campaign, maybe Leon's if you're feeling a bit dangerous, then drop it, never come back.

Pros:
- Some over the top moments (like a tower exploding four times in a row) made me laugh
- There was a fistfight between a human and a literal fucking Tyrant that was kinda funny
- Zombie T-Rex boss
- Lighting was ok
- Actually a solid amount of content, providing me with over 20 hours of game time across the four campaigns
- Mercenaries is pretty fun, probably the best part of the game
- Co-op is easy to set up and get into

Cons:
- Story is batshit stupid and not in a funny over-the-top RE4 way but in a just straight up TERRIBLE way
- Most of the new side characters are boring (barring Agent) or frustrated me beyond belief (Jake Mueller)
- The enemies are either uninspired (Javo) or have been done better in previous games
- CONSTANT Quick Time Events that disrupt the flow of gameplay and make for shoddy game design
- Multiple frustrating moments that almost made my friend and I outright quit multiple times (e.g. terrible defend your position segments or one where you much search for keys or some other item)
- A plethora of bugs, glitches, and crashes, in fact causing my friend to crash several times (some soft crashes, some hard) despite his PC being well above the game requirements
- Agent, as a character in Ada's campaign, is almost completely worthless as he cannot open doors, pick up key items or interact with any key parts of the environment. FFS he isn't even in the cutscenes 
- Snow level was soul crushing 
- Turret section that made me want to throw my computer out the window
- Chris' entire fucking campaign (felt more like Gears of War than Resident Evil)
- Almost zero horror to speak of, almost completely action, and not good action at that
- ""More like an ex girlfriend"" and ""Always something with women"" CRINGE QUOTES from Jake Mueller
- Jake Mueller 
- Game expects you to feel attached to characters that you literally got introduced to about 10 minutes ago if even that
- Inventory system that is clunky and contrived 
- Healing system that does not work well with the series formula in comparison to previous entries 
- Skill system that essentially has little impact
- Ranking system that makes no fucking sense (my friend multiple times got a lower accuracy, more deaths, and less kills than me, yet still came out with an S rank, whereas I was stuck with an A or a B in certain cases)
- Simmons was one of the weakest villains the series has come across yet even worse than the boring main villain of RE4 and the fucking leech opera man from RE0
- Cover system is complete ass, having one of the worst control schemes I've ever seen (having to aim while next to cover and then press the spacebar, whilst still holding the aim button otherwise you leave cover or vault over it)

Conclusion:
This game is an insult to the series and I can assure you if I had not been co-oping with a buddy, I would've quit after Leon's campaign. It is no wonder why the series began to bomb after this game. Thank god RE7 was actually good.

In 2013 (ingame) a new funky virus has emerged. The C Virus! It originated from a research facility in China. (Ingame) Gotta tell you this game was way ahead of its time.  ┐(͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)┌

You play the campaign from 3 different perspectives. Leon, Chris, and the newcomer. Jake. Said perspectives have their fair share of diverse enemy types. 

Like for Leon, you encounter the mutant shark, mummy zombies, Spider-Woman-Thing? And the triple changer Simmons. 
Chris, you encounter soldiers that mutate in response to physical trauma. They become very insect-like. Possessing, maggot heads, and mantis arms, tarantula torsos, flying torsos, etc. Invisible Snek, 2 armored helicopters. And that skeleton fetus thing at the end.
Jake's enemies are that he encounters nemesis 2.0 and some mutant soldiers. So......
Regardless I like all three campaigns. Despite how dated this game is, I adore the action-packed, atmosphere. I also adore how creepy, grey, and unnerving some aspects of the game are. I like the dialogue. Acting. Troy Baker, and Roger Craig Smith. Is always great.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Gameplay? Leaps and bounds from Re 4 & 5. You can jump on your back with ""X"" once your laying on your back, you can roll from left to right. When using ""A"" and ""D"".  You can dodge left with ""Z"" and right with ""C"".  I am easily amused, I just which more third-person shooters would implement an evading mechanic, as elaborate as this.

Unlike any other RE game from the fixed camera angle days to RE 5. You can run while holding ""Spacebar"" not awkwardly speedwalk. Unlike other games. 

The UI is funky. I wish it was like RE4 where you would organize and click tab and select the items and the herbs you want. You know basic stuff. Some weapons in my opinion are trash. Or have weird double standards. Like the grenade launcher can delete J'avos from existences. Yet they can't do significant damage to those regenerator, frog things. Or bosses in general. As you can see, I essentially speed ran the game. I just did the campaigns in one sitting, frankly.

This game is more of an arcade game for some reason. It's the type of game, where you and your friends can pick up the game and well play. It is fun, 8/10.

[h1] Enviroment and Atmosphere [/h1]

Like other RE games I played, the environment, dungeons, are decrepit. Rusty, old. Cold, unnerving. I adore the spookiness. It really puts me on edge. The enemies complement said spookiness. 

[h1] A small note [/h1]

I am relatively new to the RE franchise. In my opinion, I have seen a lot of hatred for this game. Talking about how it strives too far from the RE formula. Now I understand how during a certain period of time, every game company, under the sun, decided to copy the ""warzone"" formula due to its popularity. Just an industry trend. Like how every first-person shooter incorporated wall-running, after titan fall. I like the action RE games. I believe it is a logical and natural evolution for a series such as this. Concerning its lore and overall legacy of said series.

Think about it, if bio-terror was real, like in the RE series, then is accepted task forces like the BSAA. Would emerge. Military, action dudes, would show up to save the day. They are more prepared and well trained. No need to be restricted to ridiculous situations for artificial horror. Now I understand most of the arguments on how certain elements lack horror. Which I do agree with, to a certain extent. Like how you must be resourceful, feel claustrophobic, feel vulnerable, etc. But I am saying I think, we should have two categories for RE games. The action-packed line-up. And the horror side. Where you have stuff like Ethan and his first-person view. While you got my boulder punchers saving the day. You know? There is nothing wrong with having a little both. That is why RE 4 is loved by so many. It is an action game, with horror element.",1621571855,1621649247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Allow me to preface it by saying that a lot of things can be forgiven, if it's played with other players in co-op mode. The single-player walkthrough, however, is a painful experience.

So much of the game sounds amazing on paper: several story campaigns with returning fan-favorite and original characters spanning all over the globe, a few dozen of unique enemy types, improved combat mechanics with proper abilities to take cover and dodge attacks etc. But any improvement from previous games is coupled with severe signs that the game was rushed and ran out of budget: clunky controls, inconsistent level design (pacing is all over the place), terrible graphics (worse than Resident Evil 5 and some textures and models are straight from the 90s) and the story that relies a lot on re-used levels and assets.

Speaking of the story, it is horrendous. Without revealing spoilers, while actors try their best with terrible dialogue, the main story is a combination of things that we have seen before, but dialed to 11. If you thought Leon being a Secret Service agent saving the President's daughter in Spain was cheesy in RE4, you should be scared of how pulpy the story becomes in 6, but only this time it is not charming, but exhausting. Another power-hungry villain who comes out of nowhere with character depth of a shallow pond, even more crashing helicopters, exploding vehicles, bike chases and a non-ending stream of cheesy one-liners that would make Arnold proud. It is an absolute opposite of the first three games, and if 4 and 5 were a signal for you that the series was going the wrong way, Resident Evil 6 is an exclamation point to that idea, gleefully embracing its own stupidity and proudly flaunting its well-deserved label of being the worst game of the series.

P.S. This game is so bad, Capcom soft-rebooted the entire franchise after this.

Verdict: If you like Resident Evil franchise, maybe just avoid this game. It does not finish storylines from previous games, it's mostly self-contained. If you start RE7 immediately after RE5, you probably will not even know that something else happened between the two games.
If you want a fun co-op experience with a buddy, it's not so bad. Co-op mode is the only redeeming quality feature of this game, but there is also Resident Evil 5 that has co-op too, but is not a pile of trash at the same time. There is Resident Evil Revelations 2 which is excellent and is built around co-op, so maybe grab that instead.
If you like horror, definitely avoid this, the horror-roots of the franchise were pretty much buried in a cemetery. 

P.S. 2: By the way, this game forces you to chase a dog around the cemetery in a dark environment, because the dog has a key. This is the game's definition of fun and it explains everything about its design.",1621571957,1621614437,False,0,0,0.450928390026092529,0,True,False,False

This game is just a complete mess that can only offers solace if you play it to laugh at how terrible it is. 

And to site a review by Gamespot which sum it all:

""Resident Evil 6 is constantly (and annoyingly) playing with camera angles, even outside of the running sections. The worst moments are those that yank control from you and force you to stare at a growling behemoth's dramatic entrance, or a helicopter's flyover, even when you're in the middle of a quick-time event, or engaged in a shoot-out. Smart games either have you hold a button if you want to witness a major incident, or simply allow the incident to happen. Resident Evil 6 is not a smart game. It doesn't care what you're doing: that monster is big, and the game forces the bigness upon you. (And when the sequence is done, the camera may not be in the position in which it started.) Such occurrences are, every time, detrimental to gameplay, and it's shocking how many of them there are.""

""But while you won't often die due to the level of challenge (unless you crank up the difficulty, of course), you might not be able to escape a few of the game's ""gotcha"" deaths. With little warning, a vehicle might crash through a barricade, and if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, you're dead.""

""Its problem is that it throws a bunch of action game mechanics at the screen and expects them to all work well together. Instead, Resident Evil is sloppy and random. You've never quite seen a mess like this.""",1621569907,1621569907,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h1][b]Devo's Seal of Approval?:[/b][/h1]

If you've got a mate like mine to do co-op with (""Daemonicrazor"")...THEN YES. Cooperative campaign gameplay makes this title worth the asking price. It's a casual & entertaining 3rd person shooter set in the ""Resident Evil"" universe...nough said.



[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
[list]
    [*]Cooperative campaigns...FOUR OF THEM!,
    [*]Entertaining enemies & interesting weapons,
    [*]An ""over-the-top"" story line set in the ""Resident Evil"" universe,
    [*]The graphics have held up well considering this was released back in 2012,
[/list]

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
[list]
    [*]Some frustrating sections in some of the campaigns which can only be put down to poor game design,
    [*]While the ""over-the-top"" story line is entertaining, it can drag on a little at times,
    [*]A ""tacked-on"" Ada Wong campaign...wait...is this a pro because its laughable how ""tacked-on"" it is,
    [*]Really poor sniping mechanics,
    [*]A confusing inventory system...at first,
[/list]


[b][h1]CONCLUSIONS...[/h1][/b]
I played through this title with my online BFF ""Daemonicrazor"", and let me tell you, WE HAD A BLAST. It was so entertaining that it even got us talking about which coop title we could jam out next.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1684529098
There's not much to say about this title; it's a pretty solid, entertaining and casual cooperative game, set in an amazing universe that i'm a big fan of. More accurately described as a 3rd Person Action Adventure Shooter, it's not the traditional ""Resident Evil"" survival horror genre.

Cooperative gameplay (with a funny friend) is what makes this title great. Coupled with hilariously outlandish story elements and ""logic defying"" gameplay design decisions and you have a recipe for ROFL'ing. But like I said, cooperative play is what makes this title great, and this day-and-age I wouldn't recommend you to play this title alone.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1684528951
I'll remember playing this title for a long time; messing about with ""jiggle"" physics, getting our characters into compromising positions for a well-timed screenshot or two, and making fun of the some of the story plot-points.

In short, if you've got some spare money and time, and have a good mate to jam out on this title with; give it a go. ""Daemonic"" and I had a ball of a time.

Resident Evil 6 Review

Este Resident no es apto para el publico que viene acostumbrado. Esta entrega tiene mucha acción y por momentos deja de ser Resident Evil. Es interesante que las 4 campañas esten unidas. El problema esta en las medallas finales. La clasificacion va por historias, capitulos, dificultades y personajes. Lo cual por historia hay 10 medallas las cuales 5 son de cada personaje. (PROMEDIO POR CAPITULO 50 MINUTOS) Lo cual es sumamente estresante hacerlo al 100%.

RESUMEN GENERAL DE CAMPAÑAS.
Como antes mencione el promedio. El juego tiene una durabilidad de 20 horas aproximadamente. 5 horas por campaña.

Leon / Helena
Es la historia más parecida a la de un Resident Evil.

Chris / Piers
La historia es como si fuera esa tipica pelicula SUPER EXAGERADA de Acción.

Jake / Sherry
Pasa algo similar como con la de Chris y Piers. Es como si fuera tipica pelicula en la cual aparecen los mismos 2 protagonistas y el mismo antagonista de principio a fin.

Ada / Agent
Es la más complicadas en cuanto a introducción. Luego se vuelve más sencillo pero aun asi sigue siendo complicada.

Conclusión: Recomiendo las historias de Leon y Ada.

PROS
•Multiple Historias
•Variedad de dificultades
•Sistema de habilidades (Puede ayudar dependiendo tu manera de jugar pero no te genera un GRAAN cambio)

CONS
•Jugabilidad (El Sprint, los saltos no deseados, el movimiento estando agachado o cuando esquivas para los costados) 
•Pesima camara (En algunas campañas dificulta la visibilidad del jugador o hace Zooms cuando esta en lugares un poco cerrados)
•El lado del apuntado se reinicia a cada rato cuando jugas con personajes secundarios.
•Inventario muy limitado

DLC: PROXIMAMENTE

RECOMENDADO SI:
►Sos un jugador dedicado y jugas los juegos por orden
►No tenes una mejor oferta y ya compraste todos los juegos que querías

- Story is actually really good and actually has some good character development; (especially for Chris, finally) each characters story has a distinct flavour to it and the narrative flows naturally with some overlap. Leon definitely had the best campaign out of all of them, the game felt like it was mostly his story and the other three campaigns were just added for the sake of it. The voice acting is also the best it has ever been despite the still occasionally cringey B-movie dialogue
- Game play is the best its ever been for a Resident Evil title; it's nice being able to shoot and move and the diving and dodging aspect really improves everything and makes the combat more seamless; I also really liked the melee system, it's nice being able to hit enemies without them being staggered (like previous games) and you can chain your attacks together 
- The sound design is excellent, everything comes through flawlessly on my 5.1 system and the music and sound effects are really well designed

Cons:
- Too many qte's; I know they were going for the whole cinematic aspect but the amount of them was just way overboard, it creates too much of a disconnect in the game play
- The controls on m+k are abysmal and take a fair bit of time getting used to, I recommend rebinding some of the keys
- Whilst I really loved the overall story Jake's campaign felt completely unnecessary in the grand scheme of the game, it felt like he was jut there to have a ""twist"" added to the story. It also would have been nice to have the campaigns over lap more seamlessly instead of having them separated for each character",1620258643,1620258643,True,0,0,0.499535709619522095,0,True,False,False

-UI and inventory system are really bad.
-AI partner system is still as bad as it was in RE5 so play CO-OP if you can. (As a side note, each character 
 having a different UI style is a nice touch.)
-Perk system that replaced weapon upgrades doesn't hold up to it and there is nothing more frustrating than 
 having no ammo, breaking something and getting 50 skill points instead of ammo.
-In game menu not pausing the game is annoying.

But positives like:
+''Four stories that are mostly different but sometimes cross ways with eachother'' is a really good and fun way to experience the story.
+Over the top action scenes and boss fights are really fun to play.
+Controls and overall gameplay are smooth and fun.
way outweigh the negatives for me.",1620221197,1620221197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The actual action run and gun part of the game is fabulous, but unfortunately Capcom decided that was too one dimensional. 

So they added stealth parts with horrible mechanics, QTEs everywhere that are a chore to do, and also... some campaigns just aren't that fun. Chris' campaign is incredibly boring the whole way through.

However, Leon's campaign is super fun, and Jake's is interesting if you can get over having to wag the analog stick every five seconds.

""Resident Evil 6"" is a 3rd person, over-the-shoulder, adventure zombie shooter. The graphics are generally good and the sound is built beautifully. It's also very very long (almost 50 hours played and I'm still not sure if the thing is going to end...). Overall, I like this game a lot.

RE 6 feels exactly like a Resident Evil game in that we can play multiple characters through a variety of maps, skill upgrades are funded by collectable artifacts, boss battles are fun yet long winded, the movement system is consistently inconsistent (by now I have to wonder whether Capcom thinks poor movement makes things scarier?), and the story follows a convoluted plot about human experiments that spawn zombies. What makes it feel unlike most Resident Evil games, is the satisfying Fun of it all.

This is the most complete of the Resident Evil games, without daring to reinvent anything at all. Not quite as swift and addictive to play through as RE 5, but definitely a well built and functional adventure.

Does Resident Evil 6 have an annoying amount of flash at times? Yes, it does. And does the game not let you quit because re-starting will load a Chapter rather than a Checkpoint? Why, yes it does. But the flash can be turned off honestly and replaying chunks isn't a problem, because this action adventure's primary gameplay is so creepy, sleek, fast-paced, and thrilling that we forgive the sins. The puzzles throughout are clear and engaging, battles in general are a blast, and the skill tree can actually change things specifically for your unique gaming style. Even though the game maybe overstays its welcome because it's so darn long, I would be ashamed to complain about getting more for your buck in this day and age.

A lot of good in RE 6 makes the bad feel nitpicky.

I really don't understand the hate that this game historically had. It's true that out of the series that this is the Michael Bay Resident Evil, but that's what makes it so fun. The fact that when it came out (and had the player base to support it) you could have intersecting campaigns online and play with two other people across the net in real time was amazing. I've played this one the most out of all of them (5 being a close second) and it's just fun. I didn't really like the original trilogy, for me they were a chore I had to power through to get the story I needed to play 5 and 6. I will say that Code Veronica X for me was a far more enjoyable experience than 1 - 3. I have not played 0 or 7 or the Revelations games.  Maybe in the future or if 0 gets a PC port. I think all of the negativity this game got was unfair and undue and exposed how toxic the gaming community can be sometimes. The bad reviews were completely unjustified. The fact that dogshit like TLOU 2 can get overwhelmingly positive scores and this blockbuster blast of a game can be so widely panned just shows that the gaming media is not only clueless, but possibly even corrupt.

That being said, there are some issues. Some of the dialog is corny, some of the decisions made by characters in the game make absolutely no sense, and there are still some bugs that require a restart from time to time. There are times where it is completely over the top (perhaps even exceeding punching boulders) but I maintain that this is a personal preference and not an aspect of the game to be critiqued. I myself am a fan of machismo, actions movies, and 80s tough guys (for all three, check out Far Cry Blood Dragon, an incredible homage to the era) so boulder punching for me isn't lame or silly, it's something to get pumped over.

If you enjoy fun shoot em ups, like the Resident Evil universe, or just want a good time with friends, I highly recommend it. These days more than ever we could use a fun popcorn flick (or game) to distract us from all of the silliness in the world, and I think RE6 fits the bill.

It fails, the camera controls are wonky, its attempts to get you to engage in melee are a trap that just leads to lost health from grapples that enemies often get to do for free, its story is the usual RE camp but with the added annoyance of attempts to be an action game that are undercut by the frayed ribbons of survival horror left inside.

The characters are too vulnerable, the gunplay is anemic, your actions as 'heroes' often lead to the deaths of civilians because the dramatic story is forced to share the same space as an arcade game. You have zombies spitting acid as hordes while crawling around underneath traps left over from an indiana jones set but aren't granted the courtesy of one shot kills or even a guarantee that your bullets will hit your target.

This is a shame because its full of fan service for long time RE fans.

When playing coop, the gameplay seems very jarring having the action interrupted constantly by mini-cutscenes and whatnot.  This game also has many ""no warning"" instant death action scenes which seem a bit unfair.

I did not get that. You only have one gun of each type per campaign (down from the 5 of each type in RE 5). Your inventory is a mess, and the controls are terribly convoluted even for a PC port. I found myself accidentally using things all the time since the use item button and the kick the zombie in the face button are the same button for some reason.

The real no no is how choppy and disjointed the boss fights are. There is a stupid amount of quicktime events in this game. The boss fights are literally 5-10 seconds of game play and 20 seconds of cutscenes. Some of the bosses we killed by letting the AI kill them we didn't even touch them.

On top of that the game has this annoying thing with zombies playing dead, corpses you know are zombies but the game renders them invincible till you get close enough for them to grab you. If you aren't aiming at the thing you have zero chance of avoiding it. We also noticed that for some reason the zombies seem to exclusively target player 1 and almost entirely ignore player 2. Unless they had no actual path to attack me, they never attacked my friend. We could have ten of them there and they would dog pile me and just totally ignore player 2. This is especially bad when you do Chris's story because most of the enemies have guns. In the first mission I'd been downed four times (we played on professional) and I'd used every single healing item we both had. My buddy was in front of me for half the mission. He was shot once. One time. The entire mission. I was lit up like a christmas tree hiding behind a wall and he's just walking around behind the zombies shooting them all to death while they hyper focus on killing me.

Then you have the skill system that replaced the shop in RE 5. This system is bad. What's the point in having a billion skills if you can only use three? Who is going to take ""increased melee damage"" over ""take 75% less damage""? Who would take ""Reduced recoil"" over ""Do more damage with ALL guns?"". Basically every skill set turns into ""more damage with guns"" ""reduced damage taken"" and then ""extra damage to (insert primary enemy type of the mode here).""

Melee combat is more fluid and meaningful. Gameplay is more dynamic than RE4 and RE5. You can also play co-op and co-op is kinda fun if you are playing with a friend.

But to me, Resident Evil 6 always has a spot in my heart for being my first Resident Evil game. To be fair, it is not regarded as a good Resident Evil, but still is a very decent third-person shooter. So far I’ve done five playthroughs (not all on Steam), two of which are done cooperatively with friends. Co-op is way more fun than playing solo. That said, solo is not bad either. It is harder, but AI is decent and would not drag you down like in Operation Raccoon City or some sessions in Resident Evil 5.

The story took a very dramatic tone to accommodate the action, which some fans dislike. The protagonists do not die no matter it is an explosion or a high falling, even people around all die or turn into zombies. These dramatic scenes are probably just slightly better than Chris “Boulder Puncher” Redfield in Resident Evil 5. I think they are too much, but I won’t bother myself picking out all the dramatic yet unreasonable stuff. Just enjoy it for what it is, it is a little cliché but still very entertaining. On the other hand, character building is pretty good though. In my regard, Ada Wong is probably the best of all, with her unspoken affection for Leon. Sherry is my second favorite with her cute voice and clumsiness as a rookie agent. Characters in this game have certain personalities and some very good moments.

As for the storytelling, this game has four storylines going on at the same time, given the event in the game is on a global scale. This approach is very unique among video games and a brave trial in the narrative. I appreciate it for being able to present a full picture of a biological terror event, from the start to the climax and to the end. On the flip side, you will experience some scenarios twice when you play different roles. Capcom tried to minimize the repetition in these scenarios by offering different viewpoints for different characters, yet I still find it somewhat redundant and uninteresting because on the gameplay side you just do the same thing again. Four storylines also have certain different play styles. Leon’s questline has more of a traditional Resident Evil vibe, Chris’s and Jade’s are full-on gun-blazing and very action-packed, while Ada’s questline has some stealth elements and puzzle-solving. It is very dynamic, to say the least, but unfortunately, none of them nail the horror apartment.

The presentation itself is not bad. Surely it is a 2013 game so it doesn’t have good textures, lighting and other visual stuff like today’s game, it is still very decent. Character models are eye candy, not only better than counterparts at that time but also many games later on. I also like its music and I still listen to some of them from time to time.

The gameplay of Resident Evil consists of shooting, action, QTE and some light puzzles. There is no inventory management or any complex map design from the classical Resident Evil. Shooting is much faster-paced than previous games, it feels good, accurate and responsive. To compensate for the fast pacing, the game introduced a fairly complex dodge mechanic, which is quite in-depth for a shooter and very useful if you can master it. Puzzle session is too few to talk about and as for QTE and action, they are not a hurdle but I hold negative opinion towards these two. 

QTE is a popular game design at that period and I hate it because it is a very lazy design trying to engage players in the current event. This game has too many, to the point it kind of exhausts you out. As for the action, this game has quite some escape sessions which themselves are not the problem. The problem is this game has a very stiff keyboard and mouse control for movement because it was transplanted from the console, and the fixed camera angle during escape made the matter worse. I remember back in 2013 when I first played the game, in the last chapter of Chris where he has to flee from the giant monster, I could not make the escape no matter how many times I tried, not until I bought an Xbox controller just for this session. Also in other escape scenes and even normal sessions, you can feel the stiffness and unresponsiveness of movement from the poor keyboard and mouse control. It can be frustrating from time to time.

To sum it up, I don’t think Resident Evil 6 is a bad game. It surely has its problem and is not a Resident Evil that fans hope for. But if you just treat it as a normal third-person shooter, you can still have some good experience.",1539087610,1619048643,True,4,0,0.581230521202087402,0,True,False,False

RE6 has a pretty robust combat system which has the serious drawback of not using enough buttons, as it is a console game at it's core, though technically it is a very solid port with the kind of functionality you'd expect from modern capcom PC release.

Examples of the button problem is: 
Reload and pick up item drop is both R by default, meaning pressing R will have you pick up an item drop at your feet, good if it's the ammo you need to reload, less good if you need your gun reloaded without mashing reload key at that moment.
Dashing by holding space and vaulting over obstacles/leaping of edges/over pits without slowing feels good, until you try to dash a few centimeters to close to the edge of a table and getting a tactical sliding across going 160 degrees opposite of the way you were going.
Counter attacks on mutated J'avo and killing them with their own mutated limbs feels great, unless you press M1 next to another enemy in a vulnerable state, which triggers an attack which might not have enough knockback and/or invincibility frames to knock the first one back and instead leave you open to attack, though one could argue spacing to avoid such interactions is a skill that on the players responsibility.

Story is... Okay the story is some of the dumbest shit I know and I love it.
Spoilers, I'll even try using the tags.
[spoiler]So this high ranking US security official, Derek Simmons, is actually also working for the secret underground organisation, that isn't called the illuminati but it is basically that, called the family.
So Derek had some super secret mission taken care of by everyone's favorite super spy for hire, Ada Wong, and seeing her in her new tight leather pants and cleavaged red shirt got him head over heels, so he did the only sensible thing a man with an unhealthy obsession for a coworker and access to research by at this point defunct bio weapon companies and the seemingly endless funding by a secret society.
He cloned his crush onto his girlfriend, Carla Radames, by giving her an injection that causes a cocoon based mutation, modified to mutate her into a near perfect clone of Ada Wong, which is successful and he got his hot asian spy gf.
Carla isn't super hyped about having forcefully been turned into her boyfriend's waifu and as one might gather neither of them is all there mentally. So she decides to destroy the world by getting meanest fucking virus and flushing an gelatinous human reaper from mass effect 3 into the ocean(called Haos) into the ocean, assuring complete global devastation or something.

Separate from this, the current president of the USA has decided to step forward as a whistle blower on the Raccoon City cover up, at this point(this story taking place in 2013) an event from 15 years or almost 4 presidential terms ago, meaning he is basically going to expose the US government, or something.

Derek doesn't like that at all since, idrk why he's weird, so he orchestrates another virus outbreak, using US security agent Helena Harper's sister Deborah as leverage to get it going, when the president is about to appear at Ivy University in Tall Oaks, the zombie outbreak starts, claiming his life and assuring the secret of raccoon city remains a while longer, maybe forever. 
However it turns out Leon S. Kennedy, a survivor from raccoon city, has some experience surviving and escaping cities full of zombies, and Helena and Leon escape Tall Oaks, though not before being declared rogue agent by Derek who then immediately board a plane to China, like all non suspicious government employees after making accusations of treason against federal agents would do.
They follow, crash a plane into a populated chinese city center and track him down and kill him, then expose the US government about raccoon city.

Meanwhile Carla has been selling super performance enhancers(the C-virus, which is T+G+Plagas stuff+idk gene magic) to insurgents in [NONDESCRIPT EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY] which gives them super powers like growing extra eyes and spontaneous mutations in response to damage. However Jake Muller, secret son of Albert Wesker, is among the insurgents taking this injection, though he is immune to all viruses since he has strong genes on his dad's side.
He gets picked up by orphan turned government agent, Sherry Birkin, who gets him to agree to sell his blood to make super vaccines for the whole world against all the wacky viruses Derek and Carla are dropping unbeknownst to both the world at large and themselves.
They get captured by nemesis 5.0 after some hijinks and a taken to china for researching by the baddies, though later escape and beat him up, and then bail, Jake gives Sherry a friend discount on his special blood sample.

Chris and Piers don't really matter that much, they do their job(to fight bio terrorism(ie zombies and stuff)), one of them dies and RE7/8 takes place after this and features Chris so guess who dies. Though he seems even more traumatized that time around than in this one where he becomes and alcoholic.

Ada does spy stuff, finding out the stuff I mentioned in the start of the spoiler, then helps Leon kill an US government official and destroys the backup clones of her Derek was keeping in some underground lab, presumably made from homeless chinese people grabbed of the street.
It is the funniest campaign in coop since it's not designed to be(patched in after release) and player two just plays a teleporting faceless Agent.

The story in summary, the world is almost consumed by an apocalyptic infectious zombie virus because some illuminati guy had a crush on/boner for Ada Wong.[/spoiler]

Like I said, while gameplay is solid with some core flaws, these flaws are enhanced and expanded in the story mode, as movement is camera based with the camera sometimes being wrestled to highlight certain elements(leading to awkward movement/unintentional inputs), enemies are not generally frozen for cinematic highlights(leading to cheap hits) and certain events that should really should have been pure qtes/cutscenes mix it up in a pseudo controlled environment that displays the worst features of the controls(often leading to frustrating instant deaths).

Each chapter is rather lengthy at around an hour to 40 minutes, with 5 chapters for each of the 4 campaigns, so if you only play it through once you got a pretty decent bit of content. 
Though each character plays mostly the same, learning their unique quirks and weapons traits is quite fun and mastering them even more so, like Helena [spoiler]automatically reloading her hydra shotgun upon making a quickshot wth the last shot[/spoiler] or Jake [spoiler]having a unique man-toss move that's great for crowds on enemies on the ground by equipping hand-to-hand and standing by their feet[/spoiler].

Multiplayer as of right now, is surprisingly filled and there is almost always a story mode game available with at least decent connection(I'm in northern europe, so that mileage may vary).
Getting a buddy for some mercenaries is great fun, and almost required as you cannot play while waiting for someone to join, a problem shared with all the extra multiplayer modes, so they are all basically dead outside of organizing something through the steam forums or other outside the game means, which is a shame as some of them are quite fun.

The game, in summary is a great bit of stupid, rather unique fun, if you can overlook it's many flaws, or just play mercenaries until your eyes bleed.

Also, there is modding functionality, look it up, it's not officially supported but there is lots of stuff and not the most difficult thing to get into if you want a custom mercenaries music track or something. Anything more complicated you probs wanna get a mod manager, I used Fluffy mod manager last time I did some modding, should still work fine.",1618789657,1618789657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for challenging puzzle's, counting your ammo and planning ahead your next steps carefully like you might have come to expect from the previous Resident Evil games then this game is not for you and you will be dissapointed.

If you like a fun action packed game in the Resident Evil universe with great co-op capabilities you have come to the right place! 

You could compare Resident Evil 6 to a rollercoaster, it's fun its thrilling but there is no freedom to go off track.
You pick a character you will play their story and you have no other choice than the follow the directions given to you. Which sounds boring but for a co-op game this is the only way the game will work and I am afraid this is the reason for some of the negative reviews.

Still I had a wonderful time playing this game Solo and Co-op and as you can see by my hours played even after finishing the game I still come back to it once in a while since the replayability of the game and the graphics hold up great.
After finishing the story mode there are multiple other multiplayer modes that are more arcade based if you are looking for a quick 10/20 minutes of fun playtime.

At the moment the game is heavily discounted, if you are reading this and there is still a discount available I highly recommend trying it out.

It's also fun, like, a lot. You're gonna laugh your ass off when you see yourself in situations that even a trained agent would have died, like more than five minutes underwater with a giant fish swimming while holding you into him and you fight him off like you're using some cool underwater equipment, but you're not.
Or, a fucking plane falling off the sky and destroying half of the city, but you're alive without any scratch (Well, RE5 did this too).

It's fun, because it's dumb.
But for a dumb silly story that competes with Bollywood on how crazy and silly it can get, it has a fluit gameplay, controls that would make lots of shooters jeallous of it and if you take it as an action game where you shoot zombies and infected people, and everything and everyone gives you bullets, with a cool soundtrack and a high-tech HUD system, for the time this was released, this game aged pretty well.

The mercenaries here is easier to get on in single player for example, and it's fun to play too. Actually while Resident Evil 5 has the best multi player mercenaries, Resident Evil 6 has the best single player one.
The game runs flawless and is very optimized, I have no complaints about it. It's from a time where Capcom wanted to grab the name of big franchises and switch to a genre that were giving tons of money to them and they hit their face on the wall with it, everyone were mad because at least RE4 had a little of horror in it. The game is NOT perfect, but it's pretty damn fun to play if y ou remember that untill 2014, QTE's were a thing and this game is full of them. XD

Play it, you gonna like it. Just don't play it thinking it's an horror game, or a survivor horror. It's just a fun single or multiplayer game (Sometimes I feel it's easier to play this one single player).",1618165982,1618165982,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Action takes the front seat with the only survival horror being starved for ammo or the controls
- Enemies move around during scripted events giving you no chance to react to them
- Enemies move around while the camera is stolen from you to watch your partner being knocked on their ass
- Many enemies animations line perfectly up to kill you the moment you stand up
- The controls will have you sprinting and then vault over an obstacle BEHIND you
- Enemy behaviour is completely erratic, newer following any kind of proper system ie. a sniper needing to take aim anywhere between 0 seconds and 3 seconds before shooting
- Absolutely boring music
- Multiple campaigns with the substance of 3/4 of ONE

Leon: the best out of the bunch, fair difficulty, it's playable, awesome cutscenes and action sequences, but with flaws here and there surrounding the gameplay. Leon Kennedy is awesome, enough said, 7.5/10

Chris: a more annoying and more difficult campaign, lots of enemies and an annoying final boss, i hope you saved some bullets cause i beat it with merely ten shots left, whoever thought it was a good idea to screw around with the camera angles can die in a ditch, 6/10

Jake: i'd like to point out that the timeline is inconsistent, lots of enemies, little fun. A really bland attempt, and nothing new to offer. Ustanak is basically another version of Nemesis and the fights against him have unresponsive controls and the giants in the game are basically another form of El Gigante. Didn't really enjoy this one. 5/10

Ada: were they on heroin when they made this? Too many enemies for the amount of bullets they give you, for a more action oriented gameplay, conserving ammo is not something that you should worry about, so why the overwhelming amount of enemies. Carla was a pain to beat and the chainsaw dude can go to hell. I did not enjoy this one and found it painfull and agonizing, 2/10

I love RE. However, I simply cannot recommend this game. As a RE fan, or even as a normal gamer, it doesn't matter. RE6 is just...bad. I don't even know where to begin since pretty much all of it is quite flawed but I'll try my best to give this some structure and explain why I don't think anyone should get this game *except maybe coop players starved for games*

First off, this game isn't entirely without merit. It tries some new things to varying degrees of success. For example, the movement. This game handles differently to 4 and 5. 4 feels kind of floaty to control and 5 feels more grounded. 6 would be the next step in this evolution. For example, they made it possible for you to run into objects and physically ""crash"" on them or trip over bodies. While I think this is neat and adds to immersion, it can also become pretty annoying quite fast. So I consider this change more of a side grade rather than positive or negative. On that same note, lots of new actions were added like sliding around or dodge rolling, which allow you to maneuver way more than ever before. They're not entirely flawless and can feel pretty janky, but hey at least they work most of the time and serve their purpose.

Now, what about the mechanics/aspects that are indeed negative? Well... I have to talk about the UI first, who in their right mind thought that making the interface for each character different was gonna be cool? It's not, and it can be jarring if you're constantly switching between campaigns and characters but that's the smallest issue of all. It's the actual icons and the inventory itself that are absolutely terrible and one of my major gripes with this game. RE5 had a very simple but very intuitive and fast inventory, as well as potential for higher level play with it. RE6 on the other hand has a very cluttered inventory that is visually unappealing and too distracting. 5's inventory was more ergonomically designed, allowing you for quicker inputs whereas 6's feels clunky and sluggish. It's just a step back unfortunately.

Now here's another issue that is more of a bunch of systems with 1 common flaw: the camera. The camera in this game can be pretty unruly. To point some of these instances, take dashing for example. When you dash in this game, you pretty much can't move the camera at all. Why? Because doing so will make reset its position for no reason, try looking down or up while dashing and it'll start the rebound process. Which is especially aggravating when going up some steps or anything that involves changing elevation (because those make it bounce naturally already). Dashing by itself already feels bad considering there's severe understeer but with this annoying camera ""feature"", it gets really annoying. Another time when the camera can royally screw you over is when the game decides to show you ""this event is happening, look at it!"". So what does the game do? It takes total control of the camera over you, often times mid fight! So there you are trying to make sense of what's happening while getting your centre of attention elsewhere, often times not even on the enemies you're supposed to be fighting. What's even funnier is that aiming during these forced cameras makes it return to normal, but only while aiming. Games taking control away from you in such an intrusive and random way is a problem that in this day and age shouldn't be a thing, but it seems like this focus on ""cinematic pieces"" rather than actual gameplay and player input are even more common now. There's even some instances where you're viewing a cutscene and immediately after it's over you've been grabbed or attacked by an enemy that wasn't even there before. Don't know if that's a bug but it's certainly annoying, especially when playing in the higher difficulties where your health gets deleted by these cheap moves. Also speaking of these, there's plenty of times where the game autoaims for you after opening a door or watching the characters interact. Why? Does the game think players are too stupid to ADS for themselves? Sometimes there's no immediate threat yet the game still aims for you for a couple of seconds (without letting you do anything else).

Lets take cover shooting, since it's also affected by this in a sense. In this game you take cover automatically *sometimes*. Other times it doesn't. I have no idea what makes it apply auto cover since in previous games, there would be context sensitive button prompts to take cover, which makes sense and isn't intrusive or disrupting to the gameplay. But this game doesn't have such logic (RE6 even has those prompts, yet it still included an autocover!). It feels poorly implemented like most of the game, and it just pains me to see and experience considering all they had to do was keep the mechanics the same as previous games. To add insult to injury, I had times where my laser and the dot were lined up on enemies while shooting from cover...then as I fire I notice I'm actually hitting the cover. One time, this hitbox was literally on thin air. I had a clear shot, yet pieces of rubble fell from an invisible extension of a wall rather than blood pouring from the enemy's bullet wounds. Did they even playtest this game?

I guess they didn't because the game is buggy. During Jake's campaign, there's a section where you get chased by a tank. Yet the second the cutscene ends you get squished. No matter which keys or direction of thumbstick you use, you die. Probably because you don't get any input at all, the moment the cutscene ends you die. Look it up if you don't believe me, hell the friend I was playing with even stayed behind on purpose without pressing anything yet I still got killed. We tried many things but what ultimately fixed it was restarting the game, reloading that checkpoint with reversed roles as host and (oddly enough) moving left instead of away from the tank. And no, just pressing left wasn't the solution since I tried that before we restarted the game and I still instadied. We had to quit, reload and switch as well as press something that doesn't even make sense just to get past it. Also had instances where some context sensitive actions don't even show up, causing more resets. Maybe this PC version is buggier but that's still no excuse.

Now to end on a positive, I have to say the melee system is actually pretty fun. And overpowered! Honestly, you're better off using melee attacks than guns most of the time. Guns feel like they tickle enemies whereas melee staggers them and lets you finish them in one combo quite often. Probably dependent on difficulties (we played on Veteran) but this just highlights yet another problem with the game. Guns feel less viable than melee, on a third person shooter lol. As a related side note, there's many sections in the game where the whole camera/world shake tremendously and it makes precise aiming unnecessarily more annoying. The worst is when you're trying to snipe during these, because scope sway is already quite high so it's a nightmare.

This didn't even touch on the absolutely nonsensical story, or how Michael Bay-ish the game is where things explode for literally no reason every 10 seconds, or how each chapter long overstays its welcome and ends up feeling repetitive and tedious (the gimmicks that would be cool if they lasted 5 minutes, instead last triple that). I wanted to focus more on the gameplay side of things because I can't stress this enough, the game just doesn't feel good to control or play. It had some neat ideas, but it bit way more than it could chew and instead of delivering a fun, tight experience like most other games in the series it ended up a mess in every single aspect. I played this when it came out way back and didn't really enjoy it. Now that I got it again and tried giving it another shot, it feels even worse.",1616217266,1616217945,False,4,0,0.559748470783233643,1,True,False,False

Let's get the boring stuff out of the way: Yes this is as far removed from original Resident Evil mechanics as you can get. No this game isn't even remotely scary and no this game isn't going to win any awards or beat out the old, beloved games that we all know and adore.

Got it all out? Great let's keep moving.

This game has an incredible amount of content and passion put into it. 4 long and complex campaigns with a star roster of Resident Evil characters ranging from Leon to Chris to Sherry and even Ada, all while throwing in some new faces that helps spice things up.

The game is just a joy to play with it's incredible combat and varied enemy types. While the game is far removed from it's survival horror roots it is still very much Resident Evil. It has all the insanity that you come to expect from a title in this genre what with it's grotesque monster designs, wild explosive weapons and out of this world insane cutscenes and stunts that will make you go ""How the fuck is any of these characters still alive and breathing!?""

It was the same deal in Resident Evil 5 and it was the same deal in Resident Evil 4. Even in 4 which, to many, is considered the best entry to the series has some really insane and wacky stuff you wouldn't see from it's Playstation 1 origins.

The series soon came around with Resident Evil 7 and it's return to survival horror but even that entry has some insanity thrown into the mix.

What I'm trying to get at here is that it's unfair to say that Resident Evil 6 is a bad game because it's more action oriented compared to it's predecessors because even the older games had that same flair of crazy action horror. Resident Evil 6 just steps it up a notch by throwing in some fun combat and shooting mechanics that leaves you curious how far you can stretch it's mechanics for the joy of taking down monsters in an almost Devil May Cry like fashion.

The story itself is also fairly deep and you can tell Capcom was passionate about creating a complex and intertwining story. At key moments in the 4 campaigns the characters collide and it's fun to explore the different campaigns perspectives for the overall narrative and how it all ties together at the end.

Finally it's coop allows you to experience this joy ride alongside a friend while you laugh at it's batshit crazyness. It will never live up to it's predecessors but it doesn't have to. Resident Evil 6 stands on it's own and if you can accept that it's not a survival horror then you got a really great Resident Evil worthy experience on your hands.

Oh and give Mercenary mode a try while you're at it. I'd argue it's the best entry of Mercenary we have seen in the franchise so far.",1616038104,1616038104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't hate it necessarily and I do have some fun playing it, but it is so far removed from anything I played RE for, it could easily be called a different name entirely.

And yes, while the game is not ""scary"", there is plenty of horror in this game... story/theme/general goal of the game is to tell a horror story... but it also wants to offer an action adventure, and a war story... all at once. Can you see the problem? So you play through a campaign of your choosing, let's say Jake, and it goes like this...

You start on a battlefield, lots of enemies, explosions, cool macho posturing. After 15 minutes you end up in a horror scenario locked in a warehouse with an invincible monster, then you go through a creepy blink-and-you-miss-it manequin factory, then there is a layered battle sequence against a giant angry monster, then you are shooting down helicopters and incoming rackets. END Chapter 1.

EVERY chapter does this. Every 10-15 minutes you get thrown into a different style of gameplay and the game wants you to feel something different. But NONE of it works, because everything is so over-producer and over-eager to please everyone. Nothing sticks with you. This is a horror story of epic proportions as told by Michael Bay. Lots of explosions and cleavages, lots of macho posturing, lots of slow motion and ""epic"" setpieces.

I love Resident Evil and I have a strong tolerance for bullshit as far as this series go. However I cannot recommend Resident Evil 6 to anyone, unless they are a complete newcomer to the series and have never played a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter in their life.

I have played through RE6 several times back when it came out on PS3, completed all the campaigns and let me tell you, the dissapointment with this game only grows stronger every time I return to it.

Almost every thing that could have gone wrong did, in fact, go wrong. This game is a prime example of bloated budget, overblown development and wrongheaded executive decisions. There are TONS of content in this game but none of it works as it should.

It was a slog to play all those years ago and it is still slog to play now. It is not fun, the story is a complete pointlessly complicated yet extremely dumb bullshit. The game takes itself way too seriously to be in any way enjoyable at least on that level.

Let me list some points...

+ Excellent soundtrack and presentation.

- The game is emotionaly empty. It is not scary, funny, thrilling, tense or anything... it is so terribly univolving and dull it hurts.

- The atmosphere is non-existent. You have several cities thrown into chaos, numerous viral outbreaks etc. but it just leaves you cold. You don't care about anything happening on screen.

- The gameplay is just a rehash of RE5, but with the fun sucked out of it completely. More of everything does not make a great game. There are more enemies, more combos, more scenarios, more main characters, more on-rails shooter segments, more giant boss fights, more mounted weapons etc.. And nothing of it is done correctly or interestingly in any way, shape or form. There IS some fun  to be had (mainly in co-op) but it is buried under tons of bizzare choices.",1532435033,1615881692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I play games for fun even when they're bad, sometimes they are fun because they're bad.

This isn't one of those games.

RE6 is both a bad Resident Evil as well as a bad game in general.

Some games lure you in by giving you a grand opening followed by falling off rapidly. Thankfully, RE6 is horrible from the very first second.

You start by only being able to move forward. No matter which button you press. Same speed, same animation. You can either move forward like a slug or stand still. 
There is no penalty and nothing to see. This should be a cutscene. Instead it's a mix of cutscenes, quicktime events and holding down a button.
The quicktime events are especially egregious. None of them have to be one. At one point you have to press a button to hold your partner's hand.

Next scene is the same. You walk, your input gets interrupted by a short cutscene, you press a button, you get a cutscene yada yada yada. Some cutscenes stutter to interrupt the monotony. I haven't found a game I couldn't play on highest settings and this isn't even gameplay, it's a cutscene. There is no reason for it to stutter. 

You learn how to handle the menu and oh boy if that's not the point where you quit then hats off to you. 
If you put a gun to my head and tell me to navigate through this atrocity to find a specific item I'd tell you to pull the trigger.

By the way, throughout all cutscenes and interactions neither Leon nor Hannigan speak and act like Leon or Hannigan.
Don't worry if you don't know either. They are still horrible.

You get a few more sets of cutscenes, buttons to press and whatnot (engaging gameplay!) and get to the scene where you're literally told to run throughout the whole scene.
You can't fail. There's not quicktime event to du. No buttons to smash. You press move+shift and hold it. Again, no reason for any of this to exist.

Your escape runs into trouble because someone on your helicopter randomly turns into a zombie. Were they bit? No.
Why do they turn? Who cares. Here, have a crashing helicopter and some fiery explosion. Micheal Bay would be proud.

The following area is a bit darker, which is a horrible thing because you finally realize that Leon's hair wasn't just shining because of the fire around him. It always is.
Apparently he grabbed chrome instead of shampoo. Lighting also changes randomly in certain spots.

Speaking of Leon, he's a massive pussy.
Here's a things your character will be scared of visibly:
- Thunder
- Noise
- Running into a chair

You think I'm exaggerating? Try running into a chair. Nothing else is going on. No cutscene or anything. This is part of his gameplay. Any chair you run into will scare you.
Speaking of running, this is the part where you're randomly unable, able and forced to run.
Sometimes you can't, sometimes you can, sometimes you have to because normal movement is disabled. No cutscenes inbetween, it just randomly switches.

Why? For the glory of satan of course.

On the topic of being scared: Our hero Leon S. Kennedy is letting a random university staff member go ahead and clear debris.
You couldn't even do it if you wanted. You have to let a civilian go ahead during a zombie apocalypse.

You know, like a true hero.

Speaking of true hero, he is at least a true gentleman. Should you decide to want to move on to the next area you will wait for your partner, no matter what happens.
There is no way to end waiting prematurely. Enemies coming closer? Tough luck, you're waiting. Shouldn't have tried to assume your AI partner is competent enough to run straight towards you.

At this point you've barely played a little more than the tutorial.

This game is utter garbage and unlike many games, which get tolerable if you love the series, it actually gets worse if you played any other part.

- Running, racing parts in Chris and Jake campaigns.
- Sometimes the game forces the camera to look like the classic RE which makes me get hard to move control, and it always happened when I was in a hurry.
- Too many cutscenes that interrupts the playthrough.

One of these reinventions was the series actionized escalation, which started becomeing evident in RE4 and reached its apex here in Resident Evil 6, before critical mass'ing and returning to its pure horror roots in RE7.

Resident Evil 6 is divided into 4 scenarios, each with different characters, parallel stories that connect and different playstyles.
- Leon and Helena have a more classically-bent, RE4 inspired campaign facing mostly zombies.
- Chris and Piers have a very actionized story facing against the more intelligent J'avos, infected ""half-zombies"".
- Jake and Sherry also follow an action-heavy story that has elements of a Mr. X / Nemesis like entity thoughout the plot.
- Ada goes back to a more puzzle-focused campaign that is reminiscent of older titles.

All in all, I really enjoyed this game. The action scenes, plot and sheer impressive moments are incredible, and voice acting is top-notch delivered by greats such as Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, Roger C. Smith and Troy Baker.

It may not be the best one in the series and too actionized for fans of the classical survival-horror titles, but RE6 is a very fine all action game with horror aesthetics.

First and foremost, this is a bad game. But I love it.
If you're into bad games, play this. Try it. Play it on easy, don't take it seriously. 
if you play the game on normal or higher, too many of the enemies are just bullet sponges that show no reaction to being shot. I remember 5 different times while playing through the first chapter, I had to stop and google if a mini boss was un-killable because I really could not tell if I was making any impact.. There's no cry of pain, hardly even a flinch. And several times through the end boss of chapter one, I ran out of Ammo and had to just stand around until Someone came to help me. There was no way to melee the boss, I had to just wait until more ammo dropped then run out of that and wait again.
If you play this game on normal, you will have a bad time. It will feel like playing catch with your older cousin but they're all twice your size and you can't catch the ball and they don't even try to make it easy for you. It's punishing and upsetting. 
If you play it on Easy, you will have a great time. The story is so over the top bad and stupid and just weird. and the mechanics are so laughably bad too. You never feel like you have control of Leon or Helena or Sherry or whoever, it always feels like they're some klutzy idiot who got stuck in a children's playhouse and you're shouting instructions from outside to help them get out but they keep bumping into things and making things worse for themselves.
The ambition is so well intentioned but misplaced. they tried to make three different campaign styles, it basically boils down to having different weapons. The ""classic Resident evil horror side"" for Helena and Leon is the exact same as Chris's story except you get a pistol instead of a rifle as your primary. Sherry and Jake's unique ""nemesis style"" gameplay boils down to brief running and puzzle segments against this unkillable enemy. It's not worth getting excited over
Now for the truly bad parts that no one will enjoy, even if you like bad games.
The bosses at the end of every campaign are terrible. Chris probably has the most interesting as he fights a titan sized mutant that's essentially an aborted BOW that survived. It's confusing and hard to figure out how you actually do damage. Leon and Helena fight a politician turned Mutant BOW and I swear you fight and ""kill"" him 9 different times. You'll be begging for it to be over, you just get tired of him and wish he'd just be gone. Sherry and Jake just off the ""nemesis"" that's been chasing them.

This review was also posted as of finishing the campaigns of Leon (veteran & professional difficulty), Chris (veteran difficulty), and Jake (veteran difficulty). I just started Ada's campaign on veteran and I'm almost frustrated enough to uninstall rather than finish it.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Four separate campaigns, each with several difficulty levels, that provide plenty of play time, provided you're not frustrated by the cons that I'll be mentioning below.
+ Leon's campaign is very reminiscent of older Resident Evil games, since you've got traditional RE zombies in there. The nostalgia kinda falls off once the action and story just get ridiculous, like [spoiler] fighting the big bad of Leon's campaign who transforms into a zombie centaur,  then a zombie dinosaur, and then a Godzilla-sized zombie fly. [/spoiler] The early parts of his campaign do have a nice horror feel to it, though. I definitely enjoyed that.
+ Somewhat decent AI partner if you decide to play single-player. It's not great, but not terrible either.
+ Wide selection of weapons to use, ranging from pistols to shotties, automatics, explosives, and more.
+ Skill system that encourages replaying the game to unlock more skills.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- The camera angles can be a worse enemy than bosses or even regular enemies and turns even mundane fights into a struggle; it feels like they took the worst parts of the original RE camera angles and slapped it onto RE4's over-the-shoulder tank controls, so suddenly switching from over-the-shoulder to fixed camera angles throws off your direction/movement flow. It's janky as hell.
- Very limited inventory space; it's hard to hold more than one stack of each ammo and throwable type together with herbs and first aid sprays.
- Too many quick-time events. It's easy to tell that the game isn't modern at all based on the sheer number of QTEs the game throws at you. It's also incredibly frustrating when failing a QTE just instantly results in a mild case of death. Combined with the janky controls and bad camera angles, it's sometimes already a challenge just to start the QTE, then a horror story when you actually have to punch in all those QTEs once they've started.
- The camera angles are just so bad.
- Story-wise, [spoiler] the whole background can be summed up as ""guy gets too horny for some woman in red and starts a bioterrorism crisis."" [/spoiler] The RE franchise's story is generally cheesy, but this one's less cheesy and more just bad. It even gets to the point that the big bad goes on a full mustache-twirling let-me-tell-you-what-evil-things-I've-done monologue at some point.
- Dying multiple times to a forced POV/camera angle switch isn't fun at all.
- Not a fan of how hitting Esc to open the menu in single-player mode doesn't pause the game at all. You have to press the dedicated pause button to do that, and you can't access the menu to change up any settings while the game's paused. When a zone was too dark and I needed to brighten it up a bit, I had to raise the brightness while hiding behind cover, only to get killed by an ambush.
- The game isn't well-optimized for PC. I'm a bit over the minimum requirements and running everything on the lowest graphics settings, yet I'm seeing sudden framerate drops on occasion that turn it into a slideshow or just outright freeze the screen for a moment and result in me dying/failing the objective. The same goes for cutscenes; most of them end up have desynchronized audio and video, with the cutscene stuttering for a moment and the audio lagging behind once it resumes.
- Did I mention how much I dislike or even outright hate the forced camera angles?
- Considering how long ago this game was released, I didn't have any expectations for online multiplayer. Tried it out anyway and it's pretty much dead. If you're really looking for a proper multiplayer experience with this, bring a friend along with you. Public lobbies/matchmaking isn't happening here.
- Speaking of multiplayer, game modes like Siege are locked behind DLC. On top of buying the game, you gotta pay for that feature too.
- To whoever decided to put forced camera angles and janky tank controls together, who hurt you so badly that you had to take it out on everyone who decided to play this game? After playing this, I'm glad camera angles and controls got overhauled for the Resident Evil 2 remake.

Edited for formatting and the disclaimer up top.

[b]TL;DR[/b]: not a good Resident Evil game at all, but could've been a half-decent action game. However, it's completely ruined by forced camera angles with janky tank controls, and a worse-than-average-for-a-videogame story. [b] Would NOT recommend.

Now, I agree that RE4 was a good turn for the series and it has its iconic moments but it set a very bad trend for the series with a focus on action that doesn't always work right. I enjoyed RE4 because it tried something new while keeping some of the classic DNA. It did just enough to be fun without being ridiculously frustrating. RE5 was an annnoying but decent experience with its moments and I respect the bold decision to make a RE game set during daytime. RE6, though, was an exercise in frustration with a pacing that's constantly crippled by scripted events and QTEs. 

RE6 tried to be that epic blockbusters that brings well-known heroes of the RE universe in an epic multi-layered fight to save the world, much like most Hollywood action movies with shared universes. In Capcom's mind, it meant explosions and self-destruct sequences, tense chase scenes and incredibly tough bosses who only drag the fight on for the sake of spectacle. You could argue it would work for an actual action movie but even so, a good action movie doesn't drag things for too long. And RE6 likes to overstay its welcome with pathetic attempts at padding with QTEs you barely have any time to react to and that kills you instantly. These doesn't serve the game at all, it's just an half-assed attempt to keep players on their toes, not because of surprise attacks from monsters but because at aty time the game might plop you in front of the jaws of some annoying trap that will immediately kill you should you fail to press the buttons quick enough.

This game should be called ""RE6: Wigglesticks"" because wiggling the joystick and mashing buttons is what you do the most often in this game, wheter it's to shake off an enemy or avoiding a cheap death trap. QTE to avoid a blade sticking out of the wall, QTE to not get your head stuck in a grinder because of a monster popping out of nowhere, QTE for this, QTE for that. Even combat has QTEs to kill or push a zombie who grabbed you, this I could forgive more easily, but the rest are just scripted bullshit that just slow the game.

And you have four bad campaigns to get through, three of which must be completed to unlock the fourth one and they're all mostly forgettable. Leon's campaign is supposed to be the most ""survival horror"" of the four but this is where you get most of the annoying QTEs and insta-kill traps. Chris' campaign turns the game into a cover-shooter with most setpieces being shooting gallery that has you fight gun-toting terrorists that can mutate into half-monster creatures. And Jake's campaign is the most laughable of all, it puts you up against a gimmicky monstrosity called the Ustanak, who's basically a discount Nemesis. Between uninspired boss fights and chase scenes, you have a dumb stealth section in which you have to avoid some kind of insects who warns the Ustanak of your presence and you get insta-killed if you don't hide before he gets you. Finally, you get Ada's campaign, which is a subpar attempt at stealth, putting you in tight corridors where you have to takedown enemies to avoid alerting everyone around and getting overwhelmed. These four campaigns are easily the weakest part of the game and they're a proof that quantity over quality is no way to make a memorable experience.

As for the story well, it makes no sense, as expected. With each new game since RE4, the series jumped the shark to ridiculous extent. Here you have a virus that has little to no explanation and only seems to infect anyone who doesn't wear plot armor and the games enjoyes cliché'd tropes way too much, like the big tough hero Chris turning in an alcoholic asshole because his men died during a mission or Helena trying to reason with a too-far-gone, mutated sister or the bad guy Simmons going on about bringing order to the world through viral warfare. The game is shock-full of bad clichés and predictable twists without even the slightest attempt at surprising the player. If this was a bad Hollywood action movie, nobody would bat an eye but unfortunately, this is a bad action movie you have to PLAY.

Sadly, the most fun I've had with the game is its Mercenaries mode, in which the game's combat truly shines. Unlike the main campaigns, here you actually need to use all kinds of combat moves and strategies to stay on top since you can't rely on an AI partner to save your butt once you go down. You can use slides, tackles and follow-ups to bring enmies down and you have to prioritizes threats to avoid taking an attack that can damage you hard or worse, insta-kill you. You can unlock characters and costumes through playing the mode and it'll keep you busy in a much more satisfying way that the campaign ever will. To be honest, Mercenaries should have been the whole game; a spin-off title with heavy focus on action, pulling monsters and stages from the entire RE universe, a bit like Mercenaries 3D on 3DS did but with much better technology and more content. 

And this might be the reason I would recommend getting this game on sale for a low-low price because the best part of RE6 is an extra mode where the action focus actually works. But even so, there are other action games that might scratch that shooting gallery itch a lot more for the price, even though, in my opinion, the ""shoot-enemy > Follow-up attack"" of post-4 Resident Evil games is so satisfying. If you really want to get this, keep your expectations very, very low for the campaigns and don't expect anything groundbreaking for the Mercenaries mode. As far as Resident Evil games go, its overall mediocrity is only outdone by the likes of Operation Raccoon City and Revelations 2.",1614969419,1614969419,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, the game is entirely too long. Like, I actually would really enjoy the multiple campaigns with interweaving stories... if they actually told a story. Seriously, the story in this game felt the most jarring and incoherent. At least with Resident Evil 5 shit kind of made sense, at least there were notes and things that you could read here and there. This game has none of that. You get virtually no in game notes. I think the game mentioned that you can shoot these blue medallion things to get access to the files, but honestly is that even storytelling at that point? I'm going to go into more spoiler heavy stuff here:  [spoiler]So the game has 4 campaigns, you can play through leon, chris, and jake in any order, but you get ada after you beat the other three. You can more or less play them in any order, but be warned that there is a lot of overlap sometimes. In fact, I feel like the game could have done more to make the experience slighly more linear and skip sections you have already played. For example: There are two boss fights in Jake's campaign that (assuming you've played Leon or Chris) that you end up doing again. A whole two ass boss fights that the game just MAKES you replay.  Anyways, as far as the story is concerned this game has the depth of a mud puddle. None of the characters are interesting, none of their objectives are complex, and the virus just makes no sense and is never explained. It just is.[/spoiler]

Gameplay wise this game is all over the damn place. The gunplay is alright, however most of the guns feel like they are lacking in power. Enemies will sometimes just flat out ignore the fact that they've just been shot, and this is wildly inconsistent. Sometimes the enemies fly back and recoil after taking a buckshot, other times they just keep charging you. The game gives ample resources, but then throws you into boss fights where you will drain through resources like crazy because the bosses are either complete bullet sponges or they go down in two hits once you find the right way to defeat them. There is no consistency with that. The game also likes to throw you into situations where you will die instantly if you don't press a certain button or move fast enough. 

The level structure is boring. The game consists of shooting galleries. There are a few unique segments where you get to drive vehicles, but these are mainly on-a-rail sections that last a whole 2 seconds. There also seems to be in every chapter a section where you collect 3 keys, which are honestly the worst sections. They serve no purpose but to extend an already bloated game. 

The enemies in this game suck. I swear those black goop guys are really annoying, and the fly things are the worst. The enemies aren't fun or exciting. They fall into three categories: 1. Fodder enemies 2. Bullet Sponge enemies 3. Bullet sponges that instant kill. Also the game has enemies with guns, and they knock you over constantly, which would be no big deal if I was fighting a boss, but these dudes are legit the standard enemy.

Last but not least, the camera gave me motion sickness. Idk who thought it would be a good idea to make the screen violently shake up and down when you try to adjust the camera while running, but they should be fired.

Basically, this game sucks. I don't know why I finished it. I thought maybe i'd be paid back in some way. I wasn't. Honestly, just watch all the cut scenes for this game and you'll be fine.

Capcom has zero idea of who their audience was for this one. They have combined all of the worst parts of all the previous games into a bloated monstrosity. 

The controls are abysmal. The UI and inventory management are the most unintuitive systems I have ever used. The game actively fights you at every turn to merely try to walk along and try to enjoy yourself. It constantly interrupts the action to draw your attention to the thousandth building on fire while you slowly amble along while things are trying to kill you. During one fight there were 4 cutscenes that took control away from you in the span of 20 seconds. It switches to fixed camera angles abruptly but doesn't compensate for the current inputs so you are left spinning in circles or facing the wrong way during difficult or timed encounters. The biggest sin of this game is how much control it takes away from the player. It is more frustrating than enjoyable. RE6 can be used as a guide of what not to do in a game for almost every single design choice.

There is almost no puzzle solving or exploration of any sort in Leon and Chris's campaign (disclaimer: I haven't played the other two yet). You pick up all these weapons that you can barely use because you can't carry much ammo at all and the tablet system for healing is absolutely ridiculous. There is no combining or examining items in the inventory. It feels like they wanted to make an action movie and completely forgot what fans like about the series. None of the weapons feel satisfying to use since non-basic enemies are extreme bullet sponges. I will say the visualization of headshot damage on basic zombies is good.

The writing is atrocious even for the usually cheesy dialogue of the series. The characters are completely out of character and make the worst possible decision at every opportunity. They constantly lament their comrades/civilians who were killed but are causing large scale devastation and collateral damage. Resident Evil 5 looks like a masterpiece next to this game.

The quick time events are perhaps the most annoying ones I have ever encountered in a game. They add nothing. You could be walking down a hallway with a bunch of bodies on the floor. You can't shoot the enemies ahead of time and instead you have to let them grab you and mash buttons while they damage you.

This game completely jumps the shark. There are a bunch of giant, towering enemies that just have no place in the universe. We've switched back to a virus after the parasite in 4 and 5. The virus is airborne yet the characters walk through virus clouds constantly without any effects except when the story makes it dangerous. I'd gladly punch 10 boulders over the stupid set pieces in this game.

I'm happy that Capcom found its way after this complete pile of garbage with 7. A soft reboot was the only way to fix this travesty. I sincerely hope that whoever thought this game was fun and in a state to be released    no longer works in game development.",1614309741,1614309741,False,30,3,0.621761620044708252,0,True,False,False

At that time, People criticized this game not just because it had more action than horror element but because that time's console hardware was not so much capable of maintaining constant fps for this game, which made this game for console version buggy and broken. 
The Criticism went so far to drop the actual rating for the game, which wasn't supposed to happen because the actual game was actually really good only the PC version went successfully that later released. Which had some of the multiplayer problems which was fixed following late that month.
The game Originally has 4 different campaigns, which was enough to make a good Quantity content for the game but it all came down to Quality which it lacked the horror content again, its all the opinion of the people and the critiques. 
To me it was really great Experience, I really enjoyed this game with every moment of it. It had all the characters and they felt real, when they interacted with each other it was really amazing, it was one of those moments when you just stopped there just to be surprised that two of your favorite characters interacted with each other and it really felt amazing.
I know there will be no future of Resident Evil 6 but I would love to see another game like Resident evil 6 in which they put multiple campaigns in one game but learning from the mistakes they should put more horror content. I would really love to see a game like this again.

Resident Evil is... evolving.
Like Assassin´s Creed, they are taking out the boring stuff and leaving only what really matters. (in AC, I never liked to lose a mission merely by being spotted; they took that away and it got so much better - my opinion)
In RE 2 Remastered, there was a lot of secrets, hidden things, annoying puzzles, a humongous amount of backtracking. So, more often than not, I was forced to look into the internet for walkthroughs, hints, etc. The remastered game was gorgeous to look at, but the hindrances and time-consuming little tasks and mini-quests took away from the experience.
And this is the word: experience.
Resident Evil 6 is waaay more straighforward. You have somewhere to go, you know the general direction you must go,  you have to free yourself from grappling zombies by means of manageable quicktime events, deal with zombies by shooting them (of course) or barehanded beat them, open doors, jump fences, climb stairs... nothing too fancy or mysterious. Even when a key is needed to open a door, the key is nearby. 
So you must just... go on, and keep going.
So you can really focus on and feel the experience of fighting for your life in a zombie hellish mayhem, a dark, confusing, chaotic, flaming nightmare, beautifully rendered, as the story progresses at every checkpoint. (oh, and the checkpoints are always ahead of you, not behind you - you really move FORWARD in this game, you don´t run in circles like a lab rat)
This games really provides you the experience of being in a zombie apocalypse. Nothing more, nothing less.
So far, this is the zombie apocalypse game I´ve been looking for for so long.

UPDATE: I´m on Chapter 6 (of 20...) The game is throwing an almost impossible to beat boss at me, right after having me play a sequence of actions that were almost identical to the ones on Chapter 1. The developers forgot Bauhaus motto, ""less is more"". In this case, more is just more. If I wanted to fight boss after boss, I´d go to Dark Souls. This game is getting less fun by the minute. I still recommend it, though, because there´s quality gaming content here, although right now it is distancing itself from my preferred taste.

UPDATE 2: Turns out the impossible-to-beat monster was the final boss of Leon´s campaign. I´m satisfied, because I had the good feeling of accomplishing an ending right after defeating the final boss. I had closure. Now I´m starting Chris´campaign. I will refrain from commenting it. I´ll just say it´s quite different from Leon´s, and you can carry the skills you got from the previous campaign to this one.",1612399076,1613427354,True,1,0,0.459459453821182251,0,True,False,False

you are mainly given xp as a drop that only matters if you play the easy difficulties, on harder ones it replaces the ammo you desperately need, cos ya know, 20 headshots.

Many of the games in the series are up there with some of my favourite games of all time. I came into this game expecting a game in the vein of Resident Evil 5 but attempting to cater more to the action crowd with a bit more of an action centric game. It was much worse than what I came to expect. I went in with middling expectations and came out having played a game that I can easily list with the worst games I've ever played.

Cons:
- Playing the same segments multiple times to pad out content because ""two characters were there""
- Weapon accuracy is all over the place due to the erratic laser pointers
- The movement controls. Getting characters to accurately move to where you want to go is so much harder than it should be and makes for a frustrating experience trying to interact with things.
- The map design is occasionally so unreadable there had to be a button to point the player in the right direction.
- Almost everything in the game stun locks you constantly taking control away from the player 24/7 which is incredibly frustrating.
- Almost the entire game is non stop action with tedious enemies that weren't fun to fight without any breaks.
- A lot of the story threads in the game went nowhere and there were some laughably bad moments thrown in there. Chris' story was somewhat interesting but the military focus lead to the majority of the gameplay feeling incredibly generic and tedious.
- The coop. It might as well not exist. If you need to do something in coop it usually involves both players doing the same puzzle individually or being an assistant to killing enemies. (In the 4th campaign your coop partner can't even interact with the world)
- The inventory system. Seeing as the game made the effort of streamlining it out I'm not sure why it still exists just to mix herbs. Having it there just to have to fumble with the single row inventory during the hectic combat scenes does not work well.
- Constant quick time events for everything you do doesn't make for engaging game play. The analogue wobble ones are just ridiculous.
- The in game menu's were a bit of a mess mainly due to the fact all of the options were only icons so many of the options require you to scan over them to know what they are.
- The camera is thrown to different locations quite often making playing those sections even more difficult along with the dodgy movement systems. A lot of the times they'll just get you killed.
- The game occasionally changes the aiming methods of your character from keeping the crosshair in the centre to moving the crosshair around the screen. Why?
- Everything that made Resident Evil what it was is gone in this game.

Pros:
- There are a few decent story cut scenes.
- There were a couple of basic puzzles in two of the campaigns which were alright.
- The attempt at interweaving story lines was an interesting idea and  it was cool to see an alternate story line playing in the background of a few segments.
- The character models look pretty good graphically for the time it came out.
- The dive mechanic is pretty fun.
- It can be so ridiculous at times that it can crack you up

When it comes to Resident Evil the old RE formula is what caters to me the most. Despite that I went through the whole of this game to finish experiencing what the action games of this series had to offer. This game surprised me in all the wrong ways.

Only for the Resident Evil completionists and bored people looking for a mediocre third person shooter with way too much to unlock for its own good. Mercenaries though, as always, can be a blast.

RE6 has a half baked story that tried to do way too much to please everyone but ended up being... Just kinda boring on all fronts. It felt more fun when it came out on the PS3 back in 2012, whether that's due to the more intuitive controls, the new-game hype, having more people to play with online, or some combination of the three, I don't know.

For fans of the older Resident Evils, you'll notice that RE6 shoves (or rather, drop kicks) some of your favourite characters towards the ""anime protagonist"" side of the spectrum, they definitely aren't just survivors anymore. This was the turning point that made Capcom backtrack towards a more subtle gameplay style for a reason. You get to see Chris and Leon together for the first time in-game though, so that's pretty neat.

Graphically I think this game looks great, and still holds up well today despite originally being an Xbox 360 title. I love how almost all of the areas look.

Plot wise, there's a lot going on, but I do really enjoy how as you play each campaign you get a much fuller piece of the picture. It's a story told from 3 perspectives, but at the end of the day it's pretty simple, there's a zombie virus that lots of people have and some dummy wants to use the virus to make a bunch of money. It's what you would expect after resident evil 5. I did end up really caring about some of the characters, and one campaign's ending specifically was incredibly sad to me, despite me at first not really caring about the characters.

Gameplay wise, it is great! There sadly aren't many puzzles and for most of the game everything is pretty linear, but it's still fun. It's a very mindless resident evil, something you play to turn off your brain, but that can be good and relaxing.

There are way too many QTEs, worse than in RE5. And even then, the response is horrid. Also, the camera position is horrible. It's WAY too close and difficult to see what's around. AI is better in what it does in taking out enemies, but SO many times I've had them jump on top of me when I'm climbing ladders and they knock me down, making me lose time in many instances. Other times, they just sit there, blocking your path as the areas can become quite tight in places. Yet as you try to push your way through, they just stand there, oblivious of your intentions and not moving at all. I had to restart many levels because of this.

It started out almost like the scary REs before RE4, but definitely, they've ratcheted up the action beyond what RE5 was. And this is just into the first 4 chapters of the Leon campaign. It still has it's fun moments, but at times, especially into chapter 3, there's a lot of scripted QTE events that just seem to go on and on. Exploration is mainly for the Serpent emblems but that's it. Chapters 1 and 2 started out slowly, appearing to increase the tension then all of sudden, it's just non-stop action with some breathers here and there. It almost seems imbalanced possibly? It goes from one extreme to the other (nothing going on seemingly to build up the tension) then it just does a 180 and it's action, action, action. Still, it's RE right? So you have to play it and you can get enjoyment out of it, but for me, it just seemed to go too far in the action if that's even possible. 

The Chris campaign was nothing but action and way too many QTEs and scripted scenes. It just feels like the control has been taken away from us and we're just watching it rather than actually doing anything. This is RE's path to COD I guess. 

Jake and Sherry's mission is even more over the top than Chris' and there are so many ""come on"" moments that even Jake says that one point. I had to laugh as if even Capcom had to admit this was too much. 

It could have been so much better but then maybe we never would have gotten RE7 because of it, nor RE Village when it comes out.",1610489221,1611023482,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Fun multiplayer experience, connects easily with friends.

2) Controls are fine

3) Many characters involved in the campaign and playable too. 

4) Long gameplay which is fun

5) Beautiful graphics

6) Loving the location, more outdoor than indoor


CONS
1) The whole game felt rushed, inaccurate object size for example,  The styrofoam boxes for food and the chopstick on top is huge also the campus plates and etc. 80% of the time i yelled wtf?? 

2) QTE that is faster than sonic and unnecessary stuff like when Leon taking control of the plane, wanting players to look around to search for the button is annoying and can be avoided by just simply let the players flying it. 

3) On the other hand, the game makes no sense, I know games doesn't make sense but the law of physics does not apply here. Characters survived all the way from critical attacks and crashes like really?? Maybe a little is acceptable but way too much. For instance, Leon and Helena can stand steadily while the enemy flew away from the open plane with strong force and also managed to stand on top of the train while going fast. Just seems very scripted.

4) Boss defeated by QTE which is boring and lame unlike Resident Evil 5 and 4. 

5) The skill points wise, I preferred upgrading the guns which is again like previous RE game.

6) Bad camera angles, switching to fixed angle randomly while being chased, causing confusion and died instantly.This can be avoided again.

7) Odd low angle behind when running which is frustrating again why?

I have a been a big fan of the Resident Evil series ever since RE2 (1998), I was now once again reintroduced to the franchise as a teenager around the time RE2 remake was released. I heard Resident Evil 6 was the most hated game of the franchise because it diverted itself from the usual survival horror, to a co-op third person shooter game. I played this on the Switch, and I have to say that this game HAD a lot of potential. In some parts of the game, I remember or I am reminded of how similar the gameplay mechanics were to L4D2, the AI is also smart this time, so none of your partners will die and they actually respond really fast when you get downed! 

If only critics and fans of the game weren't so harsh, this game had the chance to become the next L4D2 game or replacement. The idea of having all of the characters in one game (Except Jake and Piers of course) sounds really cool, think of it as a reunion party.

Leon and Helena's campaign was really interesting, I felt connected to some of the background characters and I felt bad for them. Chris' campaign is like a warzone, fighting with big monsters and men with guns and tanks. Sherry's was okay, and felt more like survival. 

My only complaint was how bad the GUI or inventory system is, I have no idea how to bring out grenades and sometimes even trash herbs by accident! I guess I got too used to the switch version.

If you are ever getting this game, please do get it with a friend. It's such a fun game, and I recommend it alot.

This is one of the most fun games I ever played. Since the moment I saw the trailer I knew it was going to be a memorable experience. 

The gameplay is really simple if you play it with a controller (using a keyboard and a mouse is easy too, but it can get confusing sometimes), the graphics are not top notch, but for the year this game came out it is really beautiful. ( Also I never really care for the graphics too much. It's not a crucial element of an enjoyable game.) The story is so ridiculous and over the top, a true Japanese writing that is so engaging and fun to watch even if they only released the cutscenes and made a movie instead of a whole game. The characters are all unique - the old ones, the new ones. They are actually written very well and made very sympathetic. Not to talk about how much the voice actors really enjoyed making the characters sound believable. All the kudos to them. The co-op is the best part, more so if you play with a friend.

Anyway, I've already played this game like a dozen times, and It's actually so big that I'm still learning things about it. I plan to re-play it a lot more in years to come.

Any res fans should throw aside their preconceptions and give it another chance, I'm glad I did.

-graphically it still looks good to this day
-4 separate campaign, creating longevity (this is a pro or con depending on your viewpoint)
-Nude mods ;0
- good story 
-Chris can still punch the feck out of everything
- Apparently Leon learned some wrestling moves in his spare time.

Cons 
-No pausing during game play....why?
-mixing herbs and healing can be a pain with no pause 
-Each chapter is around 1 hour and if you leave halfway through you are put to the beginning of that chapter again despite hitting checkpoints.
-Not a typical res game, much more action orientated.

Compared to The Witcher 2, where you're immediately plunged headlong into a sexy story of intrigue and betrayal, this main quest can seem mundane, even perfunctory at times. But each time I stepped off the well-beaten path to blaze my own trail, it turned into a wild, open, exhilarating fantasy roleplaying experience, rife with opportunities to make use of its excellent combat. Even after over 100 hours with The Witcher 3, it still tempts me to press on – there’s so much more I want to learn, and hunt.


The Witcher 3 is as dense and deep as the other two games in the series in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing The Witcher 3’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.

The one caveat on all that though, is the technical performance on the PS4 version I played for review. 30 frames per second was sometimes too much to ask, transitions between The Witcher 3’s two main maps are just a bit too long, and minor glitches do pop up from time to time. None of it ever impacted gameplay in any meaningful way, thought it did compromise the beauty of the experience ever so slightly.

This new open-world map obviously has ramifications for the structure of the story, and though there are flashes of greatness, the main story is ultimately the least fulfilling part of The Witcher 3. You might call it another case of The Elder Scrolls Syndrome. Our tale begins as a multi-continent search for Geralt’s long-lost lover Yennifer, and Ciri, his surrogate daughter. My single biggest issue though, is that it never becomes much more: the overly long main story is essentially just Geralt running errands for people in exchange for information on Ciri’s whereabouts. It effectively maintains focus and momentum, but it feels more like a wild goose chase than an intriguing mystery to unravel, like the one we got in Assassins of Kings.

Thanks to lots of excellent dialogue and voice acting there is some emotional payoff along the way, but it’s mixed in with too much padding in the form of meaningless fetch quests and collectathons. Every time I felt like I was on the verge of an interesting revelation, I’d have to suddenly stop to escort a goat, or search for a lost, narcoleptic dwarf. Heck, even Geralt can barely hide his frustration with the constant parade of menial tasks at times.

It’s also worth noting that though you will get along fine without playing the first two games in the series, without the context provided by the Witcher novels, Ciri is more or less a complete stranger until the last quarter of the journey, which made it difficult to care about finding her as much as The Witcher 3 expected me to – especially given the slew of intriguing characters who are relegated to supportive background roles.


Thankfully, they all get chances to shine once you venture off the beaten path, and that’s where The Witcher 3 gets nearly everything incredibly right. Depending on your decisions in The Witcher 2 (which can be handily recreated via some dialogue early in the game), you’ll see lots of familiar faces returning to play a role in Geralt’s search, and once they have, they offer you a secondary line of quests that typically provide far more interesting scenarios to dabble in. Underground turf wars, assassination plots, love triangles, and unexpected alliances are all part of these optional romps. They’re all so meaty and full of rich story content that they feel like they should have been part of the main story.

The same can be said for a lot of the side quests you pick up in the field as well. Aside from the bevy of standard side-quests, monster lairs, and bandit camps generously littered about The Witcher 3’s gargantuan land mass, you also get a bunch of monster-hunting Witcher contracts to persue. Geralt's quarry ranges from ethereal wraiths that need to be made tangible before you can harm them, to Foglets who conceal themselves in thick smog, waiting for a chance to strike. The payoff here is twofold: in keeping with the lore, these represent your most reliable stream of income, which is refreshingly significant due to an appropriately stingy in-game economy.

The other upside is that, more often than not, these hunts and other side activities provide interesting insights into a land being destroyed by war, and the many forces that play a role in shaping it. Best of all, you’re one of those forces. It may not shift the main story’s conclusion in monumental ways, but I often returned to places I’d visited earlier to find that a seemingly small decision played out in a very big way. There is no morality meter, no paragon or renegade rating. In the grayscale world of The Witcher 3, there is only cause and effect; the decisions you make, both big and small, can legitimately change the world around you – far more so than most games that make similar claims.

Character progression and equipment choices are equally impactful. Relative to The Witcher 2, I found that Witcher 3’s RPG systems have been streamlined in some ways, and made more complex in others. In both cases though, the result is the same: a better experience. Simplifications to how you restock and use potions and oils makes them feel more practical and immediately useful, as you no longer need to meditate to do any of it. Sure, the old way was more in keeping with Witcher lore, but in a wide open world, it makes less sense to expect players to predict and prepare for everything they might come across in advance. On the flip side, there’s a wider variety of powerful, interesting potions than ever, including those that greatly enhance mounted combat, and others that restore health as you cast spells (or Signs as Witchers call them).


Speaking of Signs, they’ve been improved across the board with alternate casting modes, and a wider variety of upgrades, making them impactful in every fight. It’s actually entirely viable to build a sign-focused Geralt. I played him a lot like a Jedi actually, able to influence people’s minds in conversation, a powerful long range “force” push, and the ability to reflect crossbow bolts back to the sender (a returning ability that’s been made far more usable). The new skill system provides a good deal of flexibility while still rewarding players who want min/max for the best builds, and weapon and armor crafting is as deep and nuanced as ever, if not more so.

All of this shines through in The Witcher 3’s responsive, brutal real-time combat. Where combat in this series has up until this point felt vague and even a bit clunky, here it’s so fluid and satisfying that I walk around hoping for bandits to jump me just so I can repel their attacks with magical barriers, parry their blows with uncanny precision, and relieve them of life and/or limb with the occasional gory flourish. The Witcher has always done a great job of making me feel that I’ve outsmarted my foes, but for the first time here, controlling Geralt feels tangibly badass with every successful fight.

1. play on professional at the least
2. turn on attack reaction

this game is insufferable yet extremely funny. its worth taking the time to learn how the game controls and to play it like a platinum shooter (think bayonetta) as it'll be way more fun that way.

my friend and i followed this guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=937551032

i primarily played as player 1, who always has the melee weapons (except for agent in Ada Wong's campaign, who has the melee instead of Ada)

i can say that Leon's campaign is by far the most enjoyable out of them all, with Ada's being by far the least enjoyable for co-op (and fortunately the shortest)

after that, chris's campaign is great as well

jake and sherry's campaign is also a lot of fun but it has a few bumps (notably the section where you're separated from your partner...)

ada's campaign is a joke for co-op. the second player can do NOTHING. not even open up doors. they can pick up items and kill enemies, thats it. they can't even do QTEs

terrible game, bad story, bad acting, great gameplay, but jesus never play this game without a friend

When play it, it feels like you are a protagonist in a AAA movie. The whole game flows like a movie too. Each campaign has it own well designed background music. And like a well written movie, it has its own build up, climax and ending.
Also, the characters have much more depth. Ada is no longer just an eye candy in sexy dress. The story write had done a very good job.
Some people criticises this game for being ""not scary"". Well, let me tell you, they are liars.
Because if they are real fans of the RE series and had been playing this series for as long as I have, they would have been desensitised and should not longer feel any fear. That's what happened to me. I had played RE7 through and through and never felt any trace of fear.
You cannot expect the RE series to never change and keeps using the same formula. Then it will just re-textured the same old game

the campaigns: RE6 is splitted into four campaigns that are connected to each other and you get to play as familiar favourite characters and some are new to the fans (leon s kennedy and helena harper , jake muller and sherry birkin, chris redfield and piers nivans, ada wong)
and with that being said the focusing on making it co-op playable and having a non-controlled partner covering your back and too much action totally eliminated the horror aspect that the series is known for, perhaps it would have worked better
the story may not be the best but it's still good and interesting and it has it's emotional moments 
the gameplay: decent and enjoyable, every character has his own unique weapons and play style and upgradable skills there's as well few puzzles here and there which is nice, and let's not forget the QTE which is not everyone is a fan of, but I heard it can be turned off in the options
multiplayer: there are some fun game modes like the mercenaries and pvp modes some are only included when getting the complete pack edition which I wouldn't really suggest it because the multiplayer is dead but the price difference isn't big so it's up to you, my advice is look for the steam game groups to find people who still play them since it doesn't take so many players to full a lobby
the controls: I found them easy to forget sometimes especially if I haven't played it in a while but they're good once you get used to them again
graphics and optimization: it seems like capcom didn't focus on that aspect much, there are some spots and objects that have a really terrible looking textures even when all the settings are maxed out but they can be easily ignored, the optimization is great and it isn't really demanding so I believe most of the low end PC's would be able to run it just fine
conclusion: even with it's flaws it's still a fun game if you don't treat it like a RE game and I recommend it for players who are looking for a nice story co-op experience!",1609146706,1609148589,True,25,2,0.690017104148864746,2,True,False,False

[I AM ONLY TALKING ABOUT MERCENARIES MOD]

Game Mechanics & Ideas:
The game allows you to move and shoot at the same time. You can also evade enemy attacks & best of all counter them. The weapon switching is also done very fast & efficient. They also allow you to press buttons or move analog sticks (Controller users) to get out of sub-bosses which put you in instant dying mod which is pretty creative & fair. The Weapons' mechanics, sound, & power are all very balanced. The inventory was unique & while it was hard to understand at first, when's I got to understand it, it became fun to use. I would still say that RE5 inventory was better in a way though RE6 inventory does have some better things than RE5's inventory. 

Graphics: 
The graphics are very nice & detailed. They did NOT put a filter that removes away the true colours which is a good idea because they kind of made everything darker and balanced it with lightning visual effects. The visuals & mapping design is very creative & it can easily be said that they put in a lot of effort which is why you don't see a lot of RE6 modded stages simply because it won't be easy modding these type of stages. For me, I really liked it as it seemed to have a unique theme for the RE franchise. The glow, colour saturation, details, shadows, lighting, environments (Ground/Tunnels/Inside/outside/Houses/Sewage), are all PERFECTLY well made!

CONS:
- Game uses microphone & finding the option to disable it is very complicated for some people.
- Accessing the inventory can cause you to slow down or sometimes disable your character's movement.  
- Regular Mercenaries has too little enemies & it's very boring to play. 
- Servers still have a very bad netcode & lag for P2, P3, P4, P5, & P6. 
- A lot of times when you do melee, you are not invincible & you can take damage from enemies. 
- The inventory for some of the characters in No Mercy Mercenaries is very badly put & it doesn't fit the style or theme of this game at all. 

Overall, it's a good game & I bought it exclusively for it's mercenaries mode & I wasn't disappointed as it has a speedy fast paste mercenaries mode & one of the best soundtrack out of all the other RE mercenaries.",1609112975,1609112975,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
