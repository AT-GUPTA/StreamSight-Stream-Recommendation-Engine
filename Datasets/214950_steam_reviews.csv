There are a lot of playable factions which makes your game style change example, greeks maybe more defensive because of the spear infantry variety and barbarians more aggressive because of the melee infantry variety.
I consider this game to have one of the best land battles in the series and the management of your politics, civic infrastructures, armies and navy make it so you have to find a balance in all of them otherwise you will have some quite serious problems (at end game i got a secession and it completely demotivated me so i restarted a campaign).
Another thing that makes this game great are the mods on the workshop there are so many great mods that make the game 10x better (sometimes harder) and different like Divide et Impera.

What slave uprising have YOU heard of where the slaves had well armored cavalry and competently trained fighting units? 
Buy if you want to have enemies that somehow pull hordes of troops from their behind and random, bum-hick slave uprisings with better equipment than your entire army can afford.

Edit: Divide et Impera makes the game much more tolerable. My troops actually handle like you'd expect a roman legion to. That is to say, they don't crumble under some low-tier assault by the CRINGE Carthaginians and barbarians. Now, to be clear, the mod does make your starting position much uglier, but after you figure out how to beat that, it's fun all the way through. Still wouldn't recommend it at full price, though.

War, politics, historical realism, cultural expansion, technological upgrades, battles, spies, dignitaries, champions, trade, confederations, marriage, plagues, traits, traitors, astonishingly high infant mortality rates... what's not to like?
Just don't bother with the boats stuff because it's boring and unnecessary.
There are tons of diverse factions, although you do have to buy some in DLC.
There isn't any silly magical generals that completely undermine the historical strategy. The generals in this game have a realistic impact on nearby troops.
The grand campaign is fun for painting the map a single colour.
The Imperator Augustus DLC is fun for trying to hold together a fragile empire. In fact, it's better at this than the Attila TW title because at no point does the game magically start spawning in hordes that completely undermine the strategy you have been working on for the past 40 turns.
This game is also great for multiplayer, but I would recommend agreeing to some ground rules, such as:
Only 2 armies per region per turn.
No boat battles with the AI (unless you are willing to sit through hour-long battles where the AI sails back and forth out of range).
No besieging a settlement immediately after withdrawing from a battle in the same settlement in the same turn.",1708293301,1708293301,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still has all the frustrating bugs they've had for years, but there's no competition. AI gets to cheat, random reinforcement directions, units standing still (cav is the worst, cant have more than 2 units attack 1, followed by missiles only skirmishing with targeted units ignoring others advancing,) and ships cant land unless you go one by one leaving units stuck at sea forcing you to concede or wait 60 min for timer to run out... Oh and forget about naval battles bigger than 4v4. Just auto-resolve. (They hit it out of the park with empire and napoleon, don't know how they regressed so far.)  The list goes on. Majority could be bearable with a restart battle button but no, you must lose or exit to desktop. Why allow quick-save but not restart battle when the campaign map is the best functioning part of the game? If you're a total war fan you understand exactly what I'm talking about. Don't expect more.

That being said nothing else comes close, because there is nothing else. I love it for what it is though. Can be very fun in moderation, mods help a ton. Cant play too long before I have to go back to napoleon or empire. 

Under no circumstance should you pay $60 for it. Its like $15 from resellers. Good job CA for steering away prospective players with a full price tag on a 10 year old game.

Graphics are awesome for a TW game.

Positive points : 

It is about ancient times
Battles are not too bad

And now for the negatives :

Horrendous interface
Useless diplomacy
Confusing city management
Annoying mechanics just there to fuck over new players like slums
Unit tooltip is a disaster
Lack of factions
Lack of unit diversity, not only are there very few units but a lot of them are also just reskins with copy pasted stats like cmon is this still 2003 ?
The ""province"" system is also one of the worst additions to total war games

To put into perspective how bad and boring this game is : I have arround 2 thousand hours on rome total war, even bought the game on steam after i lost the CD-ROM. 
Meanwhile Rome II makes you uninstall the game out of boredom in under 30 hours.

Get rome total war, the classic one not the remade version and you will have infinitely more fun than with whatever this is supposed to be.",1707829973,1707829973,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

1. Only the capital city of province has city walls, while i am unable to just recruit soldiers to garrisons as i want. This is a terrible design as you cant defend properly your sate, and the stupid AI will annoy you a lot. On top of this there is limited building slot and resources are specific, making this ""no wall"" design way too much hassle. Also takes away the sandbox feel from the game. 

2. Armies are now bound to generals, which could be a good design and historical let say, but not when you cant build walls. Not when i am forced to micromanage a stupid family tree so i can have some generals, while the game doesnt even allow basic/meaningful diplomatic options. Armies should be limited and recruited from the population, with food supply, if anything. The way generals are implemented, are only fantasy/powercreep element in this game, all of this which hinders strategy and tactic.

These two things cant be fixed as i know with mods, and this is why i hate playing campaign, and in my opinion the AI cant handle these rules well.


3. Every sword unit has a pila. This not only made the game unbalanced and generic, but goes against history. The terrible implementation of phalanx also killed the greek factions.
Shogun 2 or even rome 1 had a good pikewall concept, sadly they didnt improved that direction. The way this game works, they should have called it Rome civil war.

4. Morale. The fourth and the last sin made by CA. It is way too high in this game, should be half the value as what it is now on every unit. With lower morale rome 2 could be more realistic and fun.

5. Time period and DLC. CA failed with the time periods and unit rosters as they cramped and mixed things into same place in the grand campaign, which hurts the multiplayer balance. Not only that, but they managed to release 2 dlc which period is already featured in the grand campaign. The development of this game is total chaos.

----------------------------
I bought the game in 2018 Q4 and the game has improved a lot since release i guess.(i didnt play ""1.0"")
I didnt even planned to buy this, due to negative opinions, but Total war Arena brought me here with the special dlc deal since they closed down the development of that game. Since there is no total war alternative game on the market i tried Rome 2 out...
In 2018 there was the Ancestral update, which improved the game a lot.

I like the game its fun, its my favourite time period so i can spend lot of time in it, even with just the custom battles.
it has lot of sp content and variety too.
 But it is sad that after all these years since shogun 1, MP is basicly still the same, even the lobbies...

CA just needs to shift back focus towards battles being the main focus of the game instead of campaign map
i dont rly like the campaign map, and its UI in rome 2, it feels overcomplicated and unintuitive. The battlemap ui/controls and camera are the best here of any total war, which helps a lot playing multiplayer battles.

The AI, pathfinding is terrible sometimes. The campaign map cant rly give a challenge, not even on hardest difficulty. Also battle AI is broken for spear/pike units under phalanx as you have to constantly give them attack commands otherwise they just dont move or attack. This is huge problem and multiplayer is plagued by this a lot. So its kind off hard to recommend this game, if you want to play a spear/pike faction.

Rome 2 isnt as cinematic/epic as Rome 1 due to realism and balance i guess.  Infantry charges have no weight to them, they just ""walk"" up to each other. I bet warhammer battles are similar to what we felt in rome 1, though i never played warhammer, but from videos i have this impression.
Battles, especially without blood dlc are boring to look at in rome 2, but playing, mangaging ur troops is better compare to rome 1.

But if they went for realism and balance, i wonder how they explain the terrible looking pike/hoplite units in this game...as they dont hold the pike in hand unless in phalanx formation, and spear hoplite formations are unrealistic, boring. Pikes are hard to spot also.
 or the fact that u can push units through the enemy easier than in old games.

overall i prefer to play rome 2 over rome 1",1548274741,1707799104,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game just doesn't work properly anymore. I would advise anyone to steer well away from this mess.

[h2]Intro: Conquering the Ancient World, One Bug at a Time[/h2]

Rome II: Total War is like playing a game of chess, but with more fire, screaming, and the occasional glitch where your knight turns into a red and blue patchwork square marked ""Texture."" It's an ambitious attempt at bringing the grandeur of Ancient Europe to your screen, with mixed results.

[h2]“Massive Battles: When Size Does Matter”[/h2]

The game's battles are the stuff of legends – vast, cinematic, and incredibly detailed. It's like directing your own version of ""Gladiator,"" except Russell Crowe occasionally walks through walls. These battles are as much about morale and tactics as they are about sheer force, giving you that authentic general-at-war feeling.

[h2]“The World is Your Playground...Sort of”[/h2]

The campaign map is a gorgeous, living, breathing entity, teeming with life, sound, and animation. It’s like a game of Risk but with better graphics and more backstabbing. However, don't get too lost in admiration, as you might find a bug or two lurking in the empire's underbelly.

[h2]“A Mixed Bag of Strategy”[/h2]

Total War: Rome II is a strategy powerhouse with an improved engine that unfortunately shows its age compared to newer titles. The game attempts to blend old and new mechanics, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the basics while retaining enough depth for veterans. Imagine trying to teach your grandpa to use a smartphone, but the smartphone is an entire ancient civilization.

[h2]“Sieges and Bugs: A Tale of Two Cities”[/h2]

City sieges are a highlight, wonderfully impressive and tactically engaging. However, be prepared for pathfinding issues where your soldiers might get as lost as a tourist in Rome. And the AI? Let's just say it's about as sharp as a marble statue.

[h2]Verdict[/h2]

[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]
Like a beautiful fresco that occasionally loses a few tiles.

[b]Sound: 7.5/10[/b]
The clashing of swords and the cries of battle are music to any general's ears, but sometimes it hits a sour note.

[b]Gameplay: 7.5/10[/b]
A blend of strategy and action that's like a well-oiled chariot, except when a wheel falls off.

[b]Story: 6.5/10[/b]
An empire-building saga with enough intrigue to keep you hooked, but sometimes it feels like the scribe fell asleep.

[b]Overall: 7.4/10[/b]

[h2]Closing Thoughts: “A Trip Through Ancient Europe, Bugs Included”[/h2]

Total War: Rome II is like a grand tour of ancient Europe where you're both the tour guide and the conqueror. It's a thrilling journey through history with spectacular battles and strategic depth, but be prepared for the occasional pothole on your road to glory. And remember, even the mightiest empires had their flaws – Rome wasn't built in a day, and apparently, neither was Rome II: Total War without a few glitches.",1469279954,1706953788,True,2,0,0.545743286609649658,0,True,False,False

I heard about the negative reviews regarding bugs and optimization, but I can't speak to how the game used to be.  I can say that Rome 2, in its current state, is a very good Total War (TW) game and worth buying (especially if on a Steam sale).  Is it the best game in the TW franchise? That is up for debate.  But I believe that a lot of the negativity associated with this game is unwarranted.

The positives:
A well-polished and optimized gameplay experience.  Compared to games like Empire and Attila, which have very ardent fanbases, this game runs extremely well, even at higher graphics settings.  I’ve found that even with bulky mods (DEI) the game holds up well.  The extensive post-launch updates to this game really show here.

Amazing breadth of factions and gameplay scenarios.  With all DLC’s enabled, the player has access to nearly 2 dozen factions, each with unique unit rosters, and several campaigns that create very immersive scenarios: Ceasar in Gaul; Empire Divided; Hannibal at the Gates; Rise of the Republic; Imperator Augustus; Wrath of Sparta.  Each campaign offers an unique experience worth the purchase; I frankly find them more engaging than the main campaign from a role-playing perspective.

Interesting new dynamics on the strategic map.  A full political system where family members and rival clans must be managed.  A food system to enable strategic buildings and avoid famine.  Sanitation and banditry systems (exclusive to the Empire Divided campaign) which impact public order and empire income.  The ability for certain factions to confederate into larger factions.  Governance penalties and civil wars for larger empires.  A general trait and army system that allows players to specialize and focus armies.  Supposedly, much of this content was not well implemented at launch, but a lot of naysayers don’t quite appreciate how much effort went into refining this content via DLC’s and updates.  

Beautiful strategic map with a variety of filters and layers to review different sorts of region information: faction ownership; economic potential; trade resources; political allegiance; diplomatic status; ect.  This strategic map, as well as the UI windows really do a good job of displaying a wealth of information to the player.  The fact that most TW games post Rome 2 (Atilla, Warhammer) continued to use and build upon that strategic layer says a lot.

Tactical gameplay.  A lot of people hate on the AI and the battle experience for Rome 2, but IMHO the game works well enough in this regard.  Is the battle AI going to truly challenge you (without the massive buffs applied at higher difficulty)?  No, and that has been the case for most titles pre and post Rome 2.  On the land and sea battles, the AI will act in a mostly logical fashion, with only the occasional jankiness.  Pathfinding and unit collision functions well for the most part, despite the underlying shortcomings with the Warscape engine.  I’ve seen a lot of complaints about how certain infantry (Phalanx units, Roman infantry) are too strong and cavalry lack punch, but this makes some sense due to how warfare of that age was primarily infantry based.

The negatives:
The removal of a true population system which impacted recruitment and city growth/wealth. 
 
Cities are now broken down into major (walled) and minor (unwalled) settlements, each with limited build slots.  There is less freedom on how to grow and develop each city, and certain historically important cities are relegated being minor unwalled settlements.  The provincial edict system associated with this new aspect, while interesting, doesn’t make up for degradation of player choice. Sadly, this concept has been carried forward into the future TW games.

All armies must be staffed/led by a general, again limiting player choice and flexibility.

Removal of trade routes between individual cities (continuing a trend that was started with Empire and Shogun).

No in-game building browser or encyclopedia.  Instead the game gives you a link to Creative Assembly website which contains next to no useful information.  A stupid oversight, and one that CA could have easily corrected post-launch, but never did.

Diplomacy and overall empire management can be a bit underwhelming at times.  While the AI will respond in a mostly logical fashion to diplomatic outreach and war actions, there can be unpredictable behaviors at times.  Similarly, it’s hard to understand the payoff or risks with the political intrigue and family interactions.  TW games have historically underperformed at the strategic and political layers, though newer titles (3 Kingdoms) have supposedly seen improvements in that area.  The dev’s definitely could have spent more time fleshing out this content.

Bottom-line: None of the above negatives are game-breaking, but it would have been nice for CA to have fully followed through on their implementation.  The game still is a very fun and immersive experience, more so with the right mods (of which there are many to choose from).  I see a lot of people complaining about how bland Rome 2 is compared to Attila – my take is that there is very little which separates the two in terms of core gameplay and mechanics.  After all, much of the content that earned Attila praise is ultimately traced back to Rome 2.  The key difference between the two games is that Attila offers a pre-fabricated doomsday scenario (Huns, political dissent, famine, climate change) which challenges the player with staving off defeat from turn 1.  Rome 2’s DLC’s offer different variations of a pre-staged scenario, but the main campaign has no such construct and is basically an open canvas for the player to paint upon as desired.  There is nothing wrong with either approach, and certain mods (DEI in particular) can make the classic empire-building a very challenging and replayable gameplay loop.

My recommendation to anyone starting this game: play Rome 2 vanilla DLC’s; and then experiment with the main campaign.  If you get to the point where you no longer find the gameplay challenging, try your hand at one of the mods (DEI, Parabellum).  I believe that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of enjoyment to be had if you explore all this game has to offer.",1706403943,1706676597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like a game where you control big armies armies and maneuver precisely where you want them on the battlefield you will love this game. It's all I ever wanted from a war game.

The Rome single player campaign is very good and will give you 40+ hours of enjoyment, more or less depending on your speed.

The controls on the battlefield are nice and causes me no problems. The only thing that sometimes get in my way is the mouse turning the camera right or left when I'm moving it across the screen. But I've learned to keep that to a minimal.

The amount of formations you can put your army in is amazing!

The simulator on the battlefield itself is gold! No other game series comes comes to simulating so many troops on the battlefield. Seeing your army fight up close with other armies is the best thing about this game.

I like battlefields and city battlefields that are simulated, especially the cities, they don't look like they are randomly generated.

The city building aspect on the campaign map is good and costs are reasonable. I actually like city building in this war game.

One thing that confuses me is the political system in the game. I Can't figure out how to get more senators for my house, and how to decrease senators from other houses. You can only spend so many hours on google, before you start going with the flow. Also, for some reason, the costs of political actions for new characters rises astronomically, the reason for this was never explained.

Lastly, I don't like about this game is the AI agents in the campaign map. The AI agent spam actions against you are all critical successes, they never fail. Your agents on the other hand will have 17%, 35%, 7% chances to succeed. These agents also cause the map to be cluttered.

- All out war with Romans from the start
- Defense alliance with Etruscan League
- They invaded the Italian peninsula from the north, while me and Libya, a client state, invaded from the south. City of Rome is looted.
- We expelled the Romans from Italy. Their capital, and last settlement, is now situated in Alalia, Corsica.
- A civil war broke out within my faction. Lost control of my provinces in Iberia.
- Numidia declares war and starts raiding my African provinces.
- Amidst all this chaos, the Romans regain momentum and invade Sardinia. I tried to reinforce Karalis but the reinforcements arrived too late. I lost the settlement.
- I crushed the rebellion putting an end to the civil war in my faction.
- The Etruscan league is fighting the Romans for control of the Tyrhenian Sea, but the Romans keep winning naval battles. 
- I settle a peace deal with the Numidians
- A slave uprising reaks havoc in my north Africa settlements

(All of this is my opinion so don't be mad if what I hate is what you like. Go write your own review)

Short summary: Yes, you should buy this game if you want to play campaign. Add on some mods and there is hundred's of hours of content. BUT... As a new player, if you want to play multiplayer, don't buy it. (read below)

Long review:
There are a few things which might change this above answer for you.
- In 2023 CA removed the ability to chat with other players. This makes multiplayer a horrible experience to jump into for new players. Not being able to ask questions and not knowing any of the common rules, such as 1 arty, 2 pikes, 4 ranged (124).
- You will also need to buy DLC factions to get the full multiplayer experience which makes it hard for me to recommend it to new players.
Campaign:
- While the base game is fun I would say modding is essential to get the full experience of the game. In my opinion you should play your first campaign as vanilla plus with a few QoL mods. Then play one of the overhaul mods, my favourite being Divide et Impera.
- The vanilla gameplay is very fun especially in field battles. Lines of infantry, ranged skirmishing and cavalry flanking.
- Sieges are also fun, however the AI is frankly just stupid. I love multiplayer sieges (which contribute to about 2/3 of my hours) but as above, it will be tough for new players to jump in.
- The campaign map is amazing and massive with many factions but... You will need to pay for extra factions (and thus extra campaigns).
A few negatives:
- The political/family system is confusing and tedious imo. 
- The population system was removed
- Armies can only travel with generals (no more small single unit armies)
- The province system divides provinces into a capital city with walls and smaller towns which can NEVER build walls. This contributes to a much worse experience than Rome 1 imo.

Ok, I'll wrap it up. 
Campaign. Yes buy it. Add on some mods and enjoy.
Multiplayer. Don't buy it unless you are willing to join a community such as a discord which will help you out.",1706070195,1706070195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing more frustrating than playing a team based game with no way to communicate things a simple as rules for the match, and the pathing is just terrible as always, same in every total war. They don't seem to be concerned with making it better either... ever since CA pushed the warhammer series they have destroyed the historical games and shat on the original community repeatedly.

Online with no chat is the most frustrating experience you can have in gaming... also makes it harder to weed out laggers for a chance at a smooth match in this unoptimized game. The community isn't all that bright either as they will try to run a 4v4 large army on ultra with crap pc and connection. ruining the entire experience for others... and CA has never once added a ping indicator on individuals in any of their games... which would fix the issue by letting you kick laggers.",1705183464,1705780794,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's taken three install-uninstall's to even get this game to let me into the campaign map and even then it almost crashes every 5 - 10 minutes on the map or in a battle. Just ridiculously bad along with little support on addressing the issues. 

The actual game is ok when I get to play it. Interesting changes to the campaign's settlement management system. Squalor is no longer crippling but this is about the only positive change here. The rest of the changes to the UI and district systems seem superfluous and have little substance behind them providing no additional challenges or strategic management incentives to get excited about. 

In battles it took a little getting used to the new UI and finding out how to arrange loose formations or place siege/defensive equipment wasn't obvious at first but nothing a google didn't solve. Interesting tweaks to powers of units and hoplites seem to have been given a nerf until you figure out how to use them properly in the new combat systems. Any spear unit seems to just stand there doing not much even when engaged until you spam attack on the opponent to cause them to keep moving forwards - little frustrating.

Plenty of nuance to getting that straight, and I still haven't figured out a lot of it. Empire and family management is more confusing than, say, learning Civilization VI, and also simpler. The turn-based strategy and battles fought in real time are an awesome mixture. Civilization VI doesn't have real-time tactics, and Age of Empires is overwhelming because it has no turns and everything is a race. This is the perfect balance to get the best of both worlds. You get very invested in your nation throughout the campaign, and the story written along the way is neat. I find playing just single battles from the main menu boring, but when playing a campaign and knowing how each battle fits into your larger strategy, that this battle is to capture a settlement and grow your empire, or upon this battle hinges the fate of one of your settlements, or you are desperately trying to turn back the enemy army before they reach your settlement — those give each battle a unique meaning and importance.

The battles are slow enough to keep your head wrapped around everything (and you can speed them up when you feel sure of yourself), and they feel very realistic, to an extent (other than some wacky fantastical units). Formations are important, and battles are won by maneuver and turning flanks; frontal attrition is a slaughter. It's not very intuitive to learn the nuances of the game (like what units beat which other units, though the basics of sword/spear/cavalry make sense), but I like the fact that applying real-life tactics will win you battles. There are many different ways one could arrange a force and go about pursuing the battle, and you always have to be watching and reacting to your opponent's movements. You can't just have a mob as in Age of Empires; maintaining order and control of your formations and keeping your units together is the difference between victory and rout. I can even see the tactical principles in Clausewitz's On War showing in many battles, which I think is a sign of a good simulation. If I can read military literature like Clausewitz and apply it to win battles in Rome: Total War, that is the pinnacle of a realistic simulation where I can play general in a historical universe, even if the units themselves aren't 100% historically accurate. That is what I was hoping to get when I bought this game, and it has not disappointed me.

I have found one bug that lost me a battle because the AI wouldn't land a boat of missile infantry, and I couldn't destroy the ship with my missile infantry on shore (ran out of ammunition, and couldn't set it on fire before that happened), forcing me to concede defeat. I'll autoresolve next time. No big deal, albeit annoying.",1704739624,1704739624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NTL;DR: At this point I have played every single faction in every single campaign at least once. That does not mean I [i]actually know[/i] what I’m talking about, but I’m going to be [i]really good[/i] at pretending I do.
Word to newcomers to the Total War series: This was actually my first TW game. The initial learning curve is going to feel steep, but it won’t take very long until you get used to it. The training campaign is a little wonky but learning via Multiplayer is, from experience, a viable option if you have a friend/contact so inclined.
Without further ado:

[h3]THE BAD:[/h3]

• Diplomacy is on the clunky side. For example, you cannot tell your own satrapies/client states to stop warring against each other or [i]by all your gods as well as mine I will turn this Trireme around and we’re going to row back all the way home [b]you absolute ingrates[/b][/i].
Your ability to turn soon-to-be-enemy alliances on each other or at least break up large defensive alliances with Machiavelli-style machinations is also very limited, as the AI will almost never cooperate with anything you do. Even allies. [i]Especially[/i] allies. There are ways, but they are very mechanical and non-intuitive.

• There is a persistent null-pointer exception error causing a crash to desktop in the game, both single- and multiplayer. That one is reproducibly caused by tearing down too many walls on siege maps and/or having too many “objects” (read: corpses) piling up in the same small area. Sadly, this means you cannot use Ballistae or Chariots and Elephants as much as you would like to without running that risk. I have had entire campaigns without any crashes at all by minding this though, so otherwise stability is quite good.

[h3]THE MEH:[/h3]

• If you are looking for an in-depth economy or cultural simulator, this ain’t it. You do have to take care that you don’t annoy people too much (who’d have thought people hate having food surplus so much? Rhetorical question, just to be obvious). Other games do that better, but if you are looking for a surface-level mash-up of simulation and tactics, you’ll do fine.

• Not something I blame the game or its creators for, but informative nonetheless: The historical information is partially outdated at this point. Mind, it is still quite detailed and can serve as a kickstarter to the interested, but the game is quite old at this point and science marches on.

• Generally, the AI is not very sophisticated. Again partially absolved by the age of the game, but if you’re looking for a hardcore challenge, even the highest difficulty level does not make the AI smarter. It’s all numerical boosts/nerfs. Consult your friendly neighborhood modding community for fixes. Civil war tension can be interesting, but after the tenth in the same campaign that you crushed in one turn, you start to wonder why people still voluntarily attack you.

[h3]THE GOOD:[/h3]

• The game is giving you all the information you need. Reading stat cards is straightforward and you can quickly compare even between your units and enemy ones (not on higher difficulties). Balance is likewise sensible: If it’s more expensive, barring [i]very[/i] few gimmick units, it’ll perform accordingly.

• Replay value is really pretty good. Each culture group handles more or less same-ish (with the Thracians as a notable exception), but between the cultures you can – and sometimes must have – considerable variation. Playing Iberians as if they were Greeks will make you have a bad time, while playing Steppe tribes as if they were Romans makes Baby Jesus cry and you a sad panda. You [i]can[/i], if you like, go the standard 8/6/3/3 mêlée/ranged/artillery/cavalry with [i]most[/i] cultures and get away with it just fine, but by no means do you need to. Also, in each campaign you may be confronted with different cultures on account of RNG, meaning even with the same faction you may end up having to fight battles differently from before.

• Historical information is, as mentioned, not bleeding-edge, but you’ll still learn quite a few things that can broaden your horizons. If nothing else, you’ll be better at geography than you were before. Some of the sayings mentioned are also [i]disturbingly[/i] applicable in and to modern life.

Conclusion: Even after playing this much, there’s still fun in it. Multiplayer makes for much better coordination too, opening up some new playstyles that are not feasible in single-player. I would have more points for each list (but mostly the ‘good’ or ‘meh’ ones), and I haven’t even gotten into the DLC campaigns, but this review is already bloated beyond reason or sanity.

Word of advice, if you have vassals of any kind, kill them, they are dead weight, and the vassal and satrapy system are completely empty and devoid of any benefit to you.  They also took out population and now your cities can't be upgraded however you want, they have a set number of tiles to build on and then your done and most of them are locked into being small settlements without walls.  You also can't move your capitol anymore.  Combat boils down to stats now not tactics, so forget terrain, momentum, morale, exhaustion, and formations too a lot of the time. They don't matter, only stats do, so match up your units versus what they are good against and bash them against the enemy or whittle them down with tons of ranged units, anything else is usually a mistake.

However, the Emperor Edition has genuinely turned things around for the better. Nevertheless, my reservations persist, especially regarding the steep cost of DLC compared to the base game. While the modding community has produced some commendable content, there's room for improvement in the available options.

Certain changes, like the reduction in garrison strength, leave me puzzled, and I yearn for Rome to have a more meaningful connection with the Senate. The ability to customize Rome's color to match the chosen house would have been a welcome addition. On a positive note, the revamped politics system is a highlight.

In my Roman co-op experience, the AI proved its mettle in strategic maneuvering, forming confederations and forcing us into a challenging war for control over Gaul and parts of Germania. It's disheartening to see complaints about the AI's inadequacy in the Rome 2 community—my advice: try playing on a higher difficulty.

I appreciate the AI's focus on capturing key points and forcing tactical retreats in city streets. The improvement in AI behavior, like refraining from running cavalry into pikes, adds to the immersion. Diplomacy, however, could use some refinement; my attempt to offer 5000 for a trade was inexplicably rejected.

Navy battles have become more engaging, with land armies unable to overpower navies. The enhancement of archers is a positive step, though a broader distribution across factions would have been preferable (thankfully, mods can address this).

Introducing a turn timer, allowing players to customize the passage of in-game years, is a suggestion worth considering. I also advocate for expanding build slots, as the current limitations in towns/cities leave something to be desired. A longing for features like spies attempting assassinations and pre-battle speeches by generals remains unfulfilled.

In essence, while improvements have been made, there's still untapped potential and room for refinement in various aspects of the game.",1401718286,1701179590,True,3,0,0.562021434307098389,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: Don't risk it. It's overwhelming complicated at first and then becomes a pretty lame formula fast. In the first ~50 hrs of game play, expect hours 35-45 to be novel as you get the hang of it as a newbie. Then it returns to just being plain bad minus the novelty of something new.

It's buggy, boring, overly complex and after 70hrs of playing I pretty much have it down to a formula. Naval battles involve artillery to bombard with small but quick ships to distract enemy ships while you pulverize them. 

The computer AI(which is a VERY generous way to describe it) has literally ONE tactic for land AND naval battles. Just a SINGLE way of attacking/defending and that is supposed to fill 100hrs+ of gameplay so....you be the judge.

I have memories of playing Medieval TW and I do recall it being rough around the edges but kinda fun. This game was a little fun for a while...but would I pay over $20 for it in 2023? Oh my god no, it's clear they were too busy making DLC for you to purchase rather than giving the computer SOME variety in how it fights.

The computer in campaign literally controls every faction. So don't be surprised if the moment one nation prepares to attack you, there is another preparing to do the same as if they are somehow being coordinated... How about that? Additionally the comp doesn't adhere to any rules you have to. Food, population happiness, etc are all just for show if you are the comp. The diplomacy and politics are such a joke it's painful to imagine why any of the engineers making could think they were nailing it. 

Pretty sh*t game tbh. It tries to be this huge, amazing historical strategy game with different aspects of empire building to consider but beyond that, it doesn't actually.... try. 

And I mean at any of it. They are too busy writing dumb descriptions about ancient Roman barracks and Celtic horseman to actually tell you what the building/units stats are. It is literally the old TW games with new graphics and that is about it, so please. It is 2023, I'm sure there is a fresh new RTS/empire building game out there that is worth you time.

Having acknowledged that I read countless reviews for both games as both communities very much intertwine like a helix. The whole vs.'s conversation was inevitable. Having just played about 2 hours worth on 2 turns in campaign I can say in complete confidence that Rome 2 is highly detailed and expanded. Battle maps are very large and you can have 40 units on the field /w 2 Generals, aka 2 army. Rome remastered is a 20/20 with a smaller and much less detailed battle map. Rome 2 feels like a 3,000 hour game due to how much is available within each turn. I feel  Rome Remastered is a scaled down Total war Game game that happens to be remastered. Hence the titles Rome remastered and the title Rome 2 ( 2014 ). Rome 2 is a sequel to Rome total war that is now remastered ( 2021 ). I will add more about Rome 2 in the near future as I explore the game more. P.S. I bought the Empire Edition and then added only 5 expansions.

For an experienced player this game is too easy. Main campaing turns into a chore instead of feeling like a game with meaningful decisions. Initially I really enjoyed the game but find myself getting bored as time has gone on. Played many different factions on legendary and various difficulties. Though a fun game at times, it will leave you wanting more as you play beyond a few campaings. Any pike faction is brutally easy, even the horse archer tribes are easy once mastered. 

I do like this game but for the price and the ai being unable to provide late - mid game challenges I would not recommend buying it unless it was on sale. Medieval 2, Shogun 2 have a higher replay value and decisions feel more impactfull. Honestly shogun 2 is a masterfull game that is hard even having played it many times. The political system is broken imo. Having to deal with factions trying to split within your empire gets tedious. The game in general feels repetitive. Beyond turn 60-100 there is minimal challenge. I often know I am going to win and get stuck fighting 2v1 battles until the enemy has no one left to throw at me. Late game I can autoresolve almost every battle. With sparta for example, I declared war on everyone around me and won simply by holding choke points and watching the enemy rush my pikes. If they fixed the ai on a strategic level, made it so factions get bigger in main campaing to provide a better challenge and lowered the price.

- Economy makes no sense and is poorly explained. Why am I suddenly losing boatloads of money after conquering a third of the map when everything was fine before? Why do I lose lots of money every few turns? I don't get it and the game doesn't explain it.

- Building and unit icons are ugly. The interface omits relevant info (like the age of the people you can choose as generals). Attila does this way better.

- Victory conditions in campaign take too long to achieve and may even be completely unreasonable. Once again, Attila is superior.

- Battles are not fun and make no sense. Cavalry charges are so weak that it's borderline pointless to even try. How is it that when I'm charging multiple cavalry units into enemy infantry units that are pinned down and have their backs turned to me only 5 guys die and nobody routs, even on the lowest difficulty? The only good use for cavalry in this game seems to be fighting unprotected archers.
Also, heavy infantry is way overpowered and takes ages to kill no matter what you do. You're better off just auto-resolving that sh*t. Attila's battles aren't perfect either but at least cavalry charges feel appropriately powerful there (and can counter heavy infantry) and I don't get the overpowering urge to auto-resolve everything like in Rome II. 
Also, the city layouts suck - once again, Attila is a massive improvement because it actually gives some tangible advantages to the defenders.

- Faction politics are poorly explained and cumbersome to deal with. I'm a broken record at this point, but Attila does it better.

- Creative Assembly hates and belittles their customers. But I guess you have to deal with that if you wanna play Total War.

This game is great, its honestly such a good return. It feels like total war Attila in its set up, but its way easier to pick up as the learning curve is shallower. I've played two campaigns, the first of which is Rome. I just love super heavy shock troops marching on mass to wipe out the enemy. My second campaign is Sparta in the ""wrath of Sparta"" expansion which is probably the only expansion paying £10 or more for. I wish you can choose Sparta in the main campaign but you're kinda stuck to the smaller wrath of sparta map to use them. Sparta are fun, again they super heavy troops but play much more defensively, I've reached out south and east taking the smaller further away islands before turning back. it has a weird mechanic where you get massive penalties if you take out one of the big 4 competitors capitol. it pushes you to taking out all the surrounding territory before closing in for the kill, which actually feels cool and appropriate for the time / diplomatic setting.",1699873729,1699873729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not going to lie. When I played Rome 2, I mostly played the multiplayer battles, which can still be fun if you play with a few friends. 

But my point is that I don't have tons of experience with the campaigns.

I will however say that I do think that this game, Total War: Rom 2, is a good game, despite what some CA haters may say.

Yeah, the game had a terrible launch, but CA put a LOT of effort into fixing it, and while they didn't make it absolutely perfect, I will say that they made the game far better than some other companies would've.

CA could've just written Rome 2 off and let it die, but they didn't. They stuck with it.

And because CA stuff with it, we got some majorly great mods that add so much to the game, which might not have happened if CA just given up on it.

I used to like playing this game, I really do. But when things change--sometimes for the worse--my thoughts on this game change as well.

[b][u]Everything Wrong With [i]Total War: Rome II[/i]:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*] Vanilla gameplay is downright [b][i]terrible[/i][/b]. Steam Workshop mods make the game [b]WAY[/b] better, but have the chance of being ruined by each new official update/patch.
[*] Patch 20/[i]Rise of the Republic[/i] ""Family Tree"" system completely misses the point of why fans wanted it in the first place.  
[*] No ""Man of The Hour"" events.
[*] No way to acquire settlements through diplomatic deals.
[*] QOL: No way to type a [i]specific[/i] amount of money in the ""Offer/Demand Payment"" diplomacy option.
[*] QOL: No weapon, shield, and armor upgrades in Custom Battle.  
[*] QOL: Minor settlements don't have rudimentary wooden walls/defenses.
[*] QOL: Exchanging units between armies is tedious thanks to a poorly thought-out design for the army exchange windows instead of wider windows with more detailed view of the units being exchanged.
[*] [i]Power and Politics[/i] (introduced in Patch 18) was improved in Patch 19, but Patch 20 ditches it anyway and adds even more unnecessary complications.
[*] ""Imperium Level"" Army/Fleet cap is (artificially) restrictive, especially in a game where you can expect every faction from outside and within to betray you.
[*] QOL: Naval combat still needs polishing.
[*] QOL: ""Duty Calls"" event is as annoying as a pop-up ad.
[*] QOL: Unit pathfinding is still problematic at times. (They've had that problem since [i]Rome I[/i].)
[*] QOL: Units still have a ""delayed reaction"" to orders. (Another problem since [i]Rome I[/i].)
[*] Game devs do not provide the last stable version of each patch, forcing the player to either roll back to a ""beta version"" that causes problems with mods that used to work with the last stable patch--or go update to the newest patch which breaks the player's ongoing save games and Steam Workshop mods.
[*] DLC rarely goes below 50% discount during Steam Sales. When I asked why they aren't offering a lower discounted price for older DLCs during their promotion for [i]Total War: Three Kingdoms[/i], they never gave a straight, honest answer and deleted the comment.
[*] That limit to the amount of active game mods. Nice work spoiling players' fun, CA... /s (But i guess they have bigger problems to worry about now...)

TL;DR: [b]Should you get this game?[/b] If you're just gonna play vanilla, then [b]eff NO[/b]. [i]Rome II[/i] is still far from improved in its base form. Go get [i]Total War: Warhammer[/i], [i]Shogun 2[/i], or even the original [i]Rome: Total War[/i] instead. Heck, even [i]Empire[/i] would be a better deal. The only way I can recommend [i]Rome II[/i] again is when it's at 75% off (including [b]ALL[/b] DLC), allow full support for game mods regardless of game version, and fix the aforementioned QOL issues above.

Then again, it's been a long-a** while since I heard any new updates besides DLC, and considering that newer [i]Total War[/i] games are CA's main focus now, [i]Rome II[/i] still remains a letdown.",1511698089,1699255319,False,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

Decided to give it another chance. Just went into a campaign blind this time, figuring things out and following the advisor.. was 10x smoother of an experience. For the average player I would just suggest a youtube video over the terrible tutorial this game has. Once you get the basics down, this game is a blast.

After that I decided to expand westward and conquer Iberia. After I conquered Iberia, I decided to conquer Carthage. Carthage was so terrible that I autoresolved their whole empire. After autoresolving Carthage I decided provoking a political party would be funny. They seceded. The secessionist army met Legio II at the Battle of Numantia. Romans had to slay their brothers, it was a bloody day. The darkest turn in my whole campaign. The secessionists were defeated and Rome is at peace. But to win the game I had to conquer more. I decided to head eastward toward Asia Minor, conquering Greek cities along the way. I conquered all of Gaul to enter Britannia. Britannia was a drag. The Britons had 20 stack armies and navies. I had to use my big brain strategies to conquer Britain. But the problem is that whenever I defeated an army and conquered the city, another 20 stack would come and take the city with no resistance while my main army was away besieging another city, leading to a back and fourth war. But the war in Asia Minor was the absolute worst. It was just 20 stacks attacking my depleted army after I took a city, leading to many legions ceasing to exist. Whenever I did beat their 20 stack spam, another faction decides that they hate me and declares war on me, bringing their 20 stacks to conquer an undefended city. What's worse is that another secession happened. I autoresolved the secessionists since luckily they sucked, but Asia Minor was still a problem. I decided to raise another legion to conquer Sparta because they had territories in Asia Minor. They got defeated pretty easily, except for 2 battles that I had to manually fight. Luckily, a faction in Asia Minor loved that I declared war on Sparta, so I made a military alliance with them, since they had a lot of territory and it would count their territories to the victory thing. I then conquered Egypt since they declared war on me. I pushed back the 20 stack armies one by one, suddenly Asia Minor was looking to be a success. I then used my legions in Gaul to conquer Germanic tribes. At last, the final few cities fell and I had all I need. 90 pure cities. All required provinces. I had won. I had won the campaign. Never felt more accomplished in my life.

So long story short, this game is fun and enjoyable. The game to me is a 10/10. There are no flaws to it other than the Ai 20 stack army spam. The game has a lot to it, and I would definitely recommend it to people. Maybe someday when you buy this, you might have such a memorable and fun campaign as I had.",1698615914,1698615914,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Old TW features:
Shogun 2 had a better system than this. You had the faction leader and his brothers in another group. You had a generals in a group. They all had family trees. You could assign any of them to do certain things like be a commissioner of war, finance etc. It was a pretty cool feature.

In Empire it showed you who ruled a region like the governor and other certain people like on the British parliament. 

Medieval 2 you could marry your princess into another faction or bring a general into you faction and make a alliance. 

If you had features like these it would increase the depth of running a empire by a ton! It is so boring now and nothing really. You can not marry generals on command or atleast have a event pop up for one before they die.

I spent countless hours messing around in battles, listening to heroic speeches (and cheating at the game because I was 11 and didn't quite get the campaign).

I was pumped beyond belief when I heard Rome II got announced and bought it immediately (in my Freshman year of college, boy how time flies) only to not be able to play it because of how broken it was on launch. But it got fixed and countless more hours were spent and finally some campaigns beaten.

In that time I've also played Shogun 2, Empire, Medieval 2, 3k, Thrones, Attila, Warhammer I & 2 & 3 (Check my steam library, they're all there). I even bought the Remastered version just because I love Total War.

CA has essentially banned criticism of them or their products within the steam forums for their games. They insist if one must be critical of the game that they provide a solution to fix the problem. This is nigh impossible for me as I am not a software developer or well-versed on how these games work under the hood. Therefore my advice on how to fix things must instead be focused on the need to engage constructively with the fan base, not alienate people who have spent hundreds of dollars on their games over the years, and been the base of the company's success over the last two decades. I also suggest that DLC prices moving forward be reduced to reflect the paucity of value they provide to the game. Additionally I would greatly appreciate new content to reflect what has been promised to consumers in the past (3k scrapped DLC). If anyone at CA or their parent company SEGA wants to discuss further suggestions I have I invite them to message me.

Rating: 8/10 vanilla, 10/10 with the right mods.

1. Mods. Get mods. If you want a simple Total War experience, get Para Bellum. If you want historical accuracy, intricacy, and you like some aspects of Paradox games, get DEI.
2. Rome 2: DEI is best Rome 2. It's tricky, it takes some getting used to, but it has the best depth and replay-ability of the mods/expansions. There are population mechanics, thousands of new units, and so many campaign actions feel satisfying. It's HARD to start playing, and that's ok. Use battle difficulty normal, campaign difficulty based on your Total War background. If you have 1000 hours on Total War games on Hard, start on normal. If you're newer, start on Easy. There are YT videos and guides for starting out economy-wise, and the Discord is very active. I like Immersaholic faction guides for picking a faction and some hints on starting out. Media Atropatene is my favorite because I like to rain enough arrows to blot out the sun, but if you're into Greek factions, there are dozens of Greek factions with hundreds of Greek units. And yes, Rome has more depth than ever too.
3. There's too much DLC, and it all costs money. Personally, I think the main game feels worth full price at this point. It's broad, and has plenty of content. As for DLC, wait for a sale and/or pick what's important to you. If you want blood, like me, get the Blood DLC and just role your eyes and glare in the general direction of the UK as you pay $3 for something that should be included in the base game.
4. Where is this compared to other Total War games? For games about Rome, I would start with the remake of Rome: TW. It's simple, and collision in battles is fun. For medieval games, I would go Medieval 2: TW if you're under 50 years old, Medieval 1: TW if you're over 50 and really don't care about graphics and have enough patience to run it, and then third is the 1100AD mod for Rome 2. I'd put Attila and 1212AD after 1100AD due to optimization issues with Attila.
5. My remaining problems with Rome 2. There are a few bugs that will never be fixed or modded out, like with the accumulation of political influence of the third political party, and the collisions in battle aren't as satisfying as with older games like Rome 1 and Medieval 2. If you want to dopamine hit from a big collision in Rome 2, use ramming in naval battles. Watching ships split in half with some solid audio is always fun for me.

OVERALL: 8/10 vanilla, 10/10 with DEI, and probably 3rd best historical TW after Rome 1 and Medieval 2.

In my opinion , this is Rome remastered amplified by 10,000 and it was the historical experience I was looking for in a game especially in a total war based game, The campaign map looks glorious and the unit detail is amazing , the music is very good as well being utilized in many historical youtube channels Kings and Generals being one of them, the family tree system not being there at the start i heard , when finally implemented, gives for an immersive experience when handling your vast empire/kingdom/ republic/ principality etcetera. The battles....my god the battles. Another aspect of the game that gets utilized in some historical channel videos to simulate or replicate a battle that happened during those times, huge step from Rome 1 or Rome remastered... Lol, the only thing I disliked was the lack luster diplomacy system but even then it's 'alright' at best. Compared to Empire or medieval series. All in all , 8 out of 10 experience.

Battles are top notch and if you are into ancient rome or ancient greeks or ancient everything THIS IS THE GAME. Hundreds of units, hundreds of ancient civilizations, varied troop roosters, superb level of detail on the unit models. If this game was just battles and not campaign i'd be the most aethetically pleasing battle sim on earth. 

However the campaign is just utter crap. This is the game that killed the total war franchise forever. Design decisions taken during the development of ROME II still linger to this day in the series, and those are some awful design decisions. 

What made me play this for an insane amount of hours is the battles and their majestic detail. Cities are beautifull, units are gorgeous, playstyles are varied. And the DLC'S cover EVERY IMPORTANT CONFLICT OF THE TIMES, except for Alxeander the Great's campaign's, which is a shame. 

It's hard to give a score on a game that launched like shit, took two years to fix, has dumbed down the Total War series forever YET is gorgeous and super detailed. 

The veredic is decided by mods. There are a BAZILLION workshop mods that fix most of the trash in the game. 

So altho i dont play this anymore and find it boring now, the dlcs and mods make it worth your purchase. 

Should you get it? it comes down to one thing: Loving the Roman Empire. If you are one of those dudes, just get it.  Otherwise i still recommend it but be aware, this game is conflicting. Please refund if you dont like it, Creative assembly doesn't deserve the money for this one. It is the one ring that destroyed them all. 

This is the most painfull recommended i'll ever give in a review. After all i've been tru, rome 2 still deserves a buy, simply for being the best ancient battle simulator out there.",1591382648,1698017215,True,2,0,0.528582334518432617,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed a lot about this game, from the visuals, voice acting, combat, UI, and campaign. I have more time in this TW than any of the others though as it's one of my favorite eras, so I am biased to a degree.

What's ridiculous is that CA is charging so much for the DLC to a 10 yr old game. The DLC should be heavily discounted in order to retain old players/attract new ones. When I first bought this game 5 years ago I noticed immediately how much content is locked behind paywalls; I'm not paying $15 for like one extra campaign and two extra civilizations. They go on sale every now and then but even then I think they're prohibitively expensive.

Was in a tough spot in a campaign where I knew a settlement would get attacked by 3 full stacks of enemies to my 1 really good 20 stack (no town garrison, recently captured). Since the enemy is attacking by sea, I figure I could raise a fleet of 1 to gain at least 1 more good infantry unit, then also raised an army near the settlement and hired as many mercs as possible. Overall, I expanded my available defense forces by some amount, but upon the next turn coming, the enemy attacks my garrisoned fleet force (I made sure its garrisoned). The battle loads in, and my good 20 stack army is NOT in the settlement as it should be, but is REINFORCING the settlement and has to run across the entire field to the city gates.

- ui is confusing and overall usage actively hinders play (for example slow movement on campaign map, clicking on minimap takes 2 or more seconds to take across your empire instead of instant teleport to where you want to look; you have to wait until a character moves on the map instead of right-clicking to instantly boost his movement; campaign map doesnt look good visually nor functionally)
- first battle really felt just like some algorithm calculating in the background instead of actual battle on the map (elephants, cavalry nor infantry felt like they had any weight)
- tech tree and building seem like uninteresting 1-5% percentage upgrades to stats, the economics so far feels like graphically visualized excel sheet instead of actual world
- the game suddenly crashed after 66 minutes without warning

Ill give it some more hours in vanilla, then with mods, but so far the game feels much less engaging and rewarding then Shogun 2 or Rome 1

UPDATE after 4 hours:
Yeah, so I ran a battle tests and clearly it s just that the more expensive units win any engagement. Tactics, manoeuvring, flanking and charging does nothing - more expensive unit with a moderately better stats just wins (i m not talking the best against the worst, but mediocre tier units against low tier units with double numbers advantage AND USING TACTICS). In vanilla Rome 2 just seems to be a stat fest, unfortunately.

I'm not complaining about pricing or content at all. I bought all the DLCs for every single Total War Game ever released. Some games I've even bought twice. But his comments have been too far from ok for it to even be acceptable with apologizing at this point so I'll leave all my TW reviews to negative until he's removed from the industry entirely.

----------------------------------

I realised I never wrote a review for this game despite having owned it since release and liking it a lot so here we go.

To start off, Rome 2 has always been a positive experience from me even during the arguably shoddy launch. I didn't really have any issues during the launch of the game but over the years it's grown better with the latest addition of the much wanted family tree. I've been a huge Total War fan since Medieval 1(give us medieval 3 already!!!) and I'm honestly yet to be disappointed in a main game of the franchise(I don't consider Attila and Britannia to be ""main"" games and I haven't tried them). 

Rome 2 does scratch my Roman era itch where the design of units etc looks pretty much as I prefer them. I prefer the lorica segmenta full ""hollywood"" look compared to the more ""realistic"" mail looks some mods for this game encourage. I can't really comment on barbarians, but playing Rome is great in this game, as is playing most civilized nations. Campaign map is great and still holds up fine despite having seen improvements in both Warhammer and Three Kingdoms. Battles are not as great but they're okay imo and still fun. It gets better again in Three Kingdoms so I'm happy CA is reverting to their more ""old"" ways there. This should make for a good MTW3! ;)

Carthage had been settled by Phoenicians as a city-state in North Africa near the current Tunis. In his 1961 work, French Historian Gabriel Audisio comments that he considered ""Hannibal to be neither a Phoenician, nor a Carthaginian, nor a Punic, but a North African... The majority of the Punic populace seems to have had African, indeed Negroid, ancestry."" Whether described as Carthaginians, Phoenicians, or Punics of North Africa, according to Audisio's research they were certainly a mix of aboriginal North Africans that included the native Berbers, Moors and other groups.

January 2015 edited January 2015 in General Discussion
Throughout the total war series, there has been a long trend of misrepresented ethnicities and nations in Africa, that did not so much favor the darker complexioned Africans.

Examples:

Berber and numidian portrayal in Rome 1, Medieval 2.

Mixed Ethnicities of Carthage, including the large berber and numidian presence stated previously. (Hannibal was half Numidian)


Nubian Culture, in Rome 2, the nobility is depicted as tribal, when at this time they would have a culture and political system related to Ancient Egypt, though alot of the population were also semi-nomadic or nomadic.

I also noted, the complexion of Makurians of Medieval 2, of which portrayed them as rather dry skinned, which was not that common as depicted, as there were many natural, and developed remedies for dry skin, though I also acknowledge that there may have been some exceptions to these.( I also acknowledge that there could have been limited texturing options to allow more accurate depictions, to make them look less dry skinned...?)

Almoravid Ruling Nobility, along with many other Moroccan dynasties were also historically of darker complexion, along with many of their citizens. The Christians there, the largely european populace there, in fact were seen by their society as inferior to the Berber-Arab aristocracy, and were largely enslaved..

I believe they could have compensated in Medieval with just a few unit add ons to represent the diversity of some of the African units that were available in the regions, let alone a bit less biased depiction of the ones existing.

You made it so that black people can't even be given shoes for Christ's sake.

Also. now you want to white wash Attila and steal the history of Asian people too. ""

People in Rome2 community believe Moors or Egyptians were not black people as well. They claim they were never any black Romans Some of them claim black people had no kings or don't have any kings. I was also cyberstaked and harassed for wanting black characters in rome 2. Rome 2 community  harassed me for black Egypt mods and black hannibal mod!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cKhIIUEc44

when I was upset the mod deleted my thread about hannibal being black. I asked why the mod refused to answer my questions to why my thread was taken down. I also confronted the community  about Rome 2 being just a game with a lot of sources showing how black Egypt was, moors etc the mod claimed I was spamming and frankly some people in the community were happy for me to gone and were franlky racist.

Coin of hannibal at his battle carbon dated to the time of the battles show his true appearance, other coins and busts appears hundreds of years later and that is the basis to call him ""white"", White people have the nerve to say ""afro-centrist"" you cant even call yourself eurocentrist because you cant stand black europe either! You have no claim to any civilisation, native or indigenous people of this ENTIRE PLANET ""


qoute"" “The Carthaginians were descendants of the Phoenicians, a Negroid people, and that in fact until the rise of the doctrine of white superiority, Hannibal was traditionally known as a Black man.”

Today, many encyclopedias classify the Carthaginians as whites or Semites, but ancient Greek and Roman eyewitness accounts paint a different picture.The indigenous peoples of Carthage were called the Afers.  Ancient Roman poet Vergil in his poem “Moretum” speaks of a woman from the Afer [Afar/Afra] race. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afri

He says of her:
“And all her figure proves her native land. Her hair was curly, thick her lips, and dark her color.”
In Library of  History Book XX, Greek historian Diodorus mentions a Greek lieutenant named Agathocles, who defeated a people in the area of present-day Tunisia, who were the same hue as Ethiopians.

[b]It's a bit rinse and repeat-y.[/b]
Fight the battle. Form your lines. Send cavalry off to fight ranges units or into the backs of the enemy's lines. When they collapse, play the fun game of selecting cavalry units and trying to click on the routing enemies to mop them up.

The battles ARE good and this is an oversimplified look at them, but sadly this is more or less how it goes, no matter your opponent, no matter where you are. Admittedly, it may be very different if you play as different factions as not everyone has the heavy infantry of Rome. I may find out one day but for now I need a break.

[b]The army structure is too strict, and this causes problems.[/b]
You make an army by starting with a general, who then spawns an army with 19 additional slots which you recruit units to.
You recruit units into this army. You do NOT recruit units from settlements (despite the fact that it's your infrastructure that dictates which units you can have). Your units CANNOT leave your armies except from being disbanded or by being handed over to another army standing right next to their current army
The number of armies you can raise is driven directly by how your ""Imperium"" level - which is an artificial difficulty system meant to make the game harder to manage the further you progress. 

On the plus side, it means there's less scrappy armies bumbling around like you'd see in other TW games - you (and the AI) are forced to build big, tall armies.

So why is this a problem? [b]You have NO flexibility.[/b] You conquer a settlement. You move forward. An enemy army can just walk out of the fog of war and walk into your settlement [i]without even fighting you[/i] and take it off you. This is relentlessly frustrating. Your settlements have NO garrison until you've rebuilt their buildings - which can take a handful of turns. Even if you don't sack the settlement, you need to rebuild the whole lot because it's the wrong culture so it doesn't work for you. So you're supposed to just have your army squat there until it's ready to go before moving on? How incredibly dull.

Oh well, I'll just leave behind a token force who can catch up later, right? That's how it works in other TW games, right? Wrong. As I said, your units cannot leave your army. You can't leave any of them behind. It's your whole army or sweet FA guarding that town until a garrison appears after you've rebuilt it. It essentially increases the amount of armies you need in order to go forth and conquer.

And those garrisons are incredibly small. The garrison is almost the same between a basic city and a level 5 one but even a fully developed city can have fewer units than a half-stack army and half of those are basically unarmoured, useless plebs/mob. There's no point to them. Basically if the AI shows up with one large army with a reasonable arrangement of units, they'll outnumber you 2:1 with better units and you don't stand a chance. If we had access to a middleweight-tier militia arrangement it might be a lot better. At the moment your garrison is one strong unit, 2-3 decent units and the rest is rabble.

So why the thumb up? It is a good game, there's lots of unit variety and some of my issues look like they can be fixed with mods. I've only tried vanilla so far, and I know this is an old game that'll never get patched and for all I know, more recent titles in the series fix a lot of this but here's what I'd do with this game to fix it:

1. Allow garrison recruitment on a city level. I'm making 60k a turn, I'll happily spend a few thousand on the odd garrison near my borders. I'm not even talking about troops that I can order to leave the city or wander around. Just troops who form a garrison and stay there until I disband them.

2. Bring back the Man of the Hour mechanic. I know this doesn't work in a game where armies aren't allowed to exist without a general, but if cities can build their own garrisons (see point 1) then maybe? At the moment you have to play the family sim minigame and make sure everyone gets married asap and starts having kids. This wasn't impressed upon with such importance in the tutorial so I ignored it for the first 60 turns of my first campaign as the menu was confusing. Regretted it because my political party ran low on generals, meaning the other parties had more generals, which allowed them to become quite influential. It's better if this doesn't happen! Anyway I digress.

3. Rework some of the other types of battles. Earlier I mentioned that the battles can be repetitive. This is true, but there are a multitude of types of battles in this game which is a welcome innovation. You could be storming a makeshift fort/camp, you could be ambushing your enemy who are in a disorganised marching column, but 99% of the time... you're just sieging a city or fighting on the plains in a standard lineup. Perhaps that's just me, but there is still room for variety I think. It would certainly help the tedium if city garrisons could be more varied and just bigger, as stated. 

4. I know this one's literally me saying ""do more work!"" but I think that's acceptable here. Please, this game needs more battle maps. Uncanny that every settlement of a given type happens to look the same. It makes the fights all the more repetitive when not only is the town the same shape, layout and size, but so is the surrounding terrain. I can probably count the number of different town fighting maps I recall fighting on, on one hand. That's kinda bad, guys, because you need to conquer nearly a hundred of these things to win a standard game. Earlier titles had cool features like being able to see other cities or islands in the distance, depending on the nearby geography. Compared to that, this just feels a bit rushed.

It's a good game. I'd say get it on sale if you're interested.",1693293851,1693293851,True,26,0,0.744088351726531982,1,True,False,False

I am aware at first this game got knocked for removing gameplay elements and mechanics from previous total wars, to be fair that was to fix a bug in the engine they were using. The game was also knocked for it's removal of content to sell as dlc and it's bad graphics at first launch. However, The Creative Assembly fixed all that in a timely manner and made the game even better. The dlcs are good as well. The game is historically accurate and faithful to the series and to the scenario it's set in. The graphics are still passable even today. The gameplay is fun. CA fixed the launch problems. The modding community is still active with one of the greatest total war mods of all time. 

pros 
CA fixed the complaints and bugs 
the modding tools were freely given out 
the graphics and units are beautiful 
the world is accurate 
the mechanics are good 
the dlcs are good 

cons 
CA removed the ability to mod the map 
All the minor factions are copy pastes of each other 

overall a solid 8 out 10. The graphics and gameplay are good, but most of the content is only for the playable countries and CA took huge series changing steps that took us a bit to get used too.

EDIT

The recent update has rendered the game unplayable even on my high end PC because of the new extreme unit lagging making battles impossible to play which persists even after disabling all mods and going to lowest settings. shame on you CA for ruining one of your best games.",1589422968,1693093193,False,0,0,0.450928390026092529,3,True,False,False

I'm not going to list pros and cons, as I've noticed that some of these might be pretty subjective, and instead I'll touch upon several aspects of the game from different perspectives. For context, this game was released 9 years after the original Rome, 4 years after Empire and two years after Shogun 2. A lot of people somehow expected Rome 2 to be a modded version of the original Rome (like Europa Barbarorum) with better graphics, completely ignoring that CA were on a different trajectory for many years already (although I do think that they used some ideas from the mods when fleshing out the unit rosters). To me it was less of a surprise to see some features that were already present in Empire (a fun and ambitious game, but hilariously, embarrassingly bad and buggy at times) and Shogun 2 (that was put on a pedestal by the community), including, but not limited to, issues with unit mass, limited building slots and questionable DLC practices.

At this point I think there's something like 8 different campaigns, all of which feature a variety of factions in different starting positions in terms of size or geographical locations. I like that the grand campaign includes East Africa, Arabia and Central Asia. You can see that the Greek cities (possibly for balance reasons) are not very well fleshed out there, but they are much more detailed in both Wrath of Sparta and Rise of the Republic.

I do like the province system of the game and it feels neat to me when I obtain control of a whole province, although I get that someone else might see this as railroading. It would've been good to be able to set taxes per province, for example. A population mechanic is also missing, although it was terribly balanced in the original Rome. The province edicts compensate a little bit for that lost complexity, but not much.

The building system in Rome 2 is criticized for two things: its representation through icons and the limited building slots. I think it's good that the game forces you to think what building is best to put in your precious building slot, where you have to consider the state of the entire province. This limitation is compensated by two things: the variety of resource buildings and the factions' unique final buildings, which also help to shake up the building icons a little bit. I think the resource buildings and especially the final buildings could have been utilized much more in the game in order to increase its replayability. One thing that I find annoying (especially when coming back from Attila) is the lack of a building browser. There was an encyclopedia but at some point it was removed.

There's plenty of events, wonders, politics and diplomacy, which are all nice. One thing that's missing from the game is figuring out some form of different playstyle for the nomadic factions. I think that, overall, the current politics system is great, and I love that the foreign diplomacy action can get you a settlement for free. Some people would be unpleasantly surprised when their character gets killed on a mission. However, if you were to send someone to a foreign country, would it be your son and heir, or someone more disposable?

The traits are often cited as an example of Rome 2's lack of soul in comparison with the original game, which is ironic given the amount of effort the developers have seemingly put into creating Rome 2's trait system. Rome 2 has plenty of traits, but they are presented in a different way from Rome 1. Some traits are gained by the characters on their own, but most of them are selected by the player when they level on. Depending on your playstyle, all your characters would end up having the same traits, as there is one build that you would consider to be the best, or rather the most practical one. I think it's a difficult thing to get right. The issue with the retinue and household is that they are presented by icons that you don't really understand and you only get what they mean once you mouse over them. These icons are a part of the core feel of the game together with the unit cards, so it's a take it or leave it sort of situation.

Speaking of the unit cards, they got a lot of hate ever since the release of the game. It was fairly ambitious of CA to radically change something that was a core aspect of Total War and completely depart from what they had done on every other game before or since. The issue is that with this Greek pottery style it may be very difficult to distinguish between units, some of which might be already very similar to each other in terms of where they fit on the roster. This might be an issue if you need to look at the unit cards during a battle in a situation where you might have to react quickly on focus on the battle itself. Personally, I find them immersive and aesthetically pleasing, and I don't mind looking at them from time to time.

You may notice that my review is mostly concentrated on the campaign, as I have few things to say about the battles that haven't been said already. To me all Total War battles are kind of similar and I can't not notice how all games since Empire have been impacted by this same engine, so I don't think there's anything sticking out in Rome 2 in particular. If you are playing a campaign on higher difficulties, you will notice how missile troops become more important as melee tactics become irrelevant due to AI bonuses. As I mostly play on Normal, this doesn't impact me at all. As people are still playing Rome 2 multiplayer 10 years after its release, the battles as an aspect of the game are obviously appealing to enough players, although the rosters feature many units that seemingly differ very little in function and have similar unit cards. As I mostly play the campaigns, I love that Roman units can be retrained into different ones, both in the grand campaign and in Rise of the Republic, it's just something that feels satisfying. If you only play multiplayer, you will end up wondering what's the deal with all these pointless units. This is something that the developers leaned very heavily into in Attila (to my delight), which is a game that is even less oriented towards multiplayer than Rome.

The naval aspect of the game is it's greatest weak point, I think. If only the transport fleets were handicapped a little more, the players would be more incentivized to develop fleets. I think that in the current state of balance in the game, building fleets is completely pointless and can be ignored without consequences. This problem feeds into two other systems, the buildings and the traits, as I never build military naval buildings, nor do I make my characters into admirals, which limits my game experience. This left me wondering why another naval building was added to Empire Divided, when this core issue remains. I'll admit that the some of the ships look very beautiful. One other thing that turns you off from the naval game is the fact that even when you win a naval battle, you can still easily lose a ship. I don't know about you, but I often like to keep all of my original units during my campaigns as they are something like my children.

The soundtrack of Rome 2 is often compared negatively to the one of Rome 1. I think it's pretty okay, I definitely wouldn't listen to it for fun with the exception of two tracks: Hunters, which has kind of a mystical Barbarian forest thing going on ( at least in my imagination), and Goddess of the River Nile, which is a gorgeous and rich representation of the splendor of Cleopatra's Egypt. Not the real Cleopatra's Egypt, mind you, but a classic Hollywood film set in it. I think it represents Rome 2 as a game: big, bloated and flawed, but it sure is beautiful.

TLDR: I've played more than a thousand hours of this when I could've done anything else with my life. Two thumbs up!",1692538217,1692538217,True,1,0,0.504854321479797363,0,True,False,False

CA has abandoned this game as the MASSIVE amount of bugs and broken game mechanics have not been fixed in the past DECADE... its been 10 years and they still haven't done anything except downgrade this game by taking away multiplayer chat. !!HEAD TO BOTTOM FOR FINAL THOUGHTS!!

Buying the game itself does not give you the full experience as half the factions are locked behind a paywall and crashes are a normal occurrence. Every time I play a game and exit it completely Shuts down my computer and freezes it. My computer is top of the line and I used to play this game on an old potato of a computer and the graphics only slightly improved while the crashes stayed the same.

Problems START:
Bugs relating to interface with letters being invisible and certain backgrounds turning invisible (makes it hard to see anything)

Soldier unit placement doesn't always show on elevated areas making it impossible to see formations.

Sometimes Saves are deleted in computer shutdowns when exiting game.

Rome 2 Mission Campaigns are glitchy, broken, crash recurrent, unplayable, worse then Rome 1 Mission Campaigns (which came out 20 years ago and works well for its time)

Faction diversity is bland where everyone has the same Roster/Settlement system as the Romans from Scythians to Africans.

Multiplayer duels/campaigns have a high rate of crashing early to late game with random lag spikes from different types of internet so it doesn't matter if you have good or bad internet. (I've played about 30 hours of multi)

Unit Pathing is buggy and broken especially in naval as naval units don't listen to orders most of the time.

AI is the same through all difficulties just making it harder for you to use the interface and politics just turns into civil wars every 10 turns.

The DLC's don't add much except for a new starting area of the map with some new units. The Blood DLC is basically required if you want the Rome experience even though it should have been in the base game, Although the DLC it self is broken where if your unit comes into contact with another unit for a second half your troops will be completely bloody as if they went through minutes of fighting. 

A lot of game mechanics from the original Rome 1 were taken out of the game like soldiers standing to the side letting other troops through unlike the lazy version in Rome 2 which just bumps your troops around a lot and traps your troops sometimes in another unit. 

Problems ENDED:

That's all I can say for now cause I may have forgotten some other problems with this game.

This game is not worth $70 and most of it's DLC's are essential for the Rome 2 experience and should be part of the main game. The games worth less then a bag of potatos. All the hours I've played I had some fun moments but after a while I got bored because its really bland and the bugs are everywhere. It's more healthy and stress free to watch videos of this game then play it.

CA is trash, Rome 2 Sucks, I hope their Greedy Corporate hands don't ruin Rome 3 or Medieval 3 or Empire 3.

Rome Total War II is a spectacular game. It is my first Total War experience (Played Empire in 2010 Summer for 1 month I was too young tho.). It is everything I expected and since I started in 2023 I got the best version, read a lot problem with early versions.

You can easily get Rome and start your campaign, fail 2-3 times then you'll learn how to play, there is no one stopping Roman Legions, only way you are losing your army is if you position them wrongly against 2 armies, otherwise Hammer and ANVIL

Now there is a crazy problem with this game: There are TOO MANY factions, I destroyed some of them to lower the turn times but it gets longer as more turns passes, so you have to dabble with mods or git gud enough to finish the game in 100-200 turns. This is the biggest problem and it's really a major one because game becomes inaccessible and loses it's fun and magic when you wait 2-3 minutes a turn. I dont have time and patience to wait, im sure there are mods to solve rejecting between turn offers and do auto fights but it's just not fun. If this is not a problem for you, you'll be finding yourself conquering literally EARTH.

1) The devs push out updates to literally remove features like chat and break all mods again in the process.
2) This game is very hard to mod properly and even if you're careful, you never know if bugs or performance problems are creeping into a long strategic campaign, which is supposed to be the core of the game.
3) AI is extremely flat and doesn't even build out its territory properly in the base game. Look at the Second Triumvirate as Pompey Sextus if you have the game or can. A classic example and what really convinced me on this point is seeing how Octavian didn't even upgrade his starting area--ridiculous. Basically, if you survive the first 30 turns of most campaigns, there isn't much real opposition after that if you do an actual build.
4) I am beyond sick of companies that do whatever they can to crush gaming and take the fun out of it. They even had the audacity to recommend that people move to Discord when it is closed source (enjoy being spied on 24/7) and doesn't have freedom of speech on it. I guess letting people chat with their friends is automatically wrongthink now or whatever--I don't keep up with it, but I sure can't stand the behavior.",1691118412,1691118412,False,22,1,0.611617803573608398,1,True,False,False

This isn't a [i]bad[/i] game, I mean, it's still a Total War title, and it is Imperial Rome. It's just that the ingredients never seem to gel.  From the somewhat drab color scheme (seriously, the legionaries armor looks brown), to the uninspiring character portraits, to the progressively tedious gameplay, there's something about Rome II that doesn't spark joy. 

Flawed as it was, Rome: Total War had a zany energy that pulled you onward.  What energy there is to Rome II burns out after turn 50 when the game essentially becomes a poor Paradox grand strategy, because who's personally fighting battles after turn 50?  What at first seemed like strengths of the new game, like the immense map, quickly became insufferable (""where am I in generic central Asia?  I don't even care anymore..."")  Or the way-too-long endgame victory conditions requiring ridiculous grinds of conquest and logistical contortions that no halfway decent player would consider: field 40 mercenary units?  Maintain 60 naval units in a game where naval combat is totally, and thankfully avoidable?  Economic and cultural victories that require random territory conquests on the other side of the map that your supply lines could never keep up with?  Add to this an Imperium system that makes each successive conquest  more about spreadsheet micromanagement and diminishing returns than, um, Total War...  And a political and character management system with 15 options of which only 2 are ever available?  

My Carthage campaign on N/N was a feat of endurance rather than a labor of love.  I wanted this game to be an overlooked gem.  It's not.  Pick it up on sale and prove me wrong.  But if you want to actually have fun, pick up Attila (with AoC, preferably) or Warhammer II and knock yourself out.

I am a casual gamer and I've put what I consider to be a good amount of time into this game over the years. I love the Total War historical series and I own most of them. However, as of recently, almost every one of them has ceased to work for me. I have a good computer, 3070 ti, 16 gb of ram, decent CPU. At the very least enough to get into a custom battle. Now, for most of the Total War games, I have crashes through any campaign, battle, or start screen I go to. To me, the game is unplayable and it's frustrating to waste the few hours I have clean installing and troubleshooting constantly. I've read many discussion posts in each of the Total War games so I know I am not alone in this problem. I hope one day they fix this issue, but until that day it's just not worth the time to keep coming back to them.

Buy at your own risk. I didn't see any reviews recently mentioning this problem so I figured I'd leave one as a warning to potential buyers. There is a good possibility the game just won't run.",1689980147,1689980147,False,8,0,0.564739584922790527,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Dealing with a few large scale, well-build armies is great fun.  Dealing with hordes of small stupid armies is not fun, it's tiring.  

CA has a long standing tradition of abandoning beloved games in the series, so if you're going to pick this up make sure to try out some mods as the base game is lacking.  Perhaps when CA is no loner drunk on the spirits of Fantasy and re-skinned sagas, then maybe in a not too distant decade they will return to the strategy world and leave behind the micro management of spells and equipment stats that belong in World of Warcraft.

They should rename themselves to lesser EA cuz atleast EA has released a decent game since after 2010+.

ignoring the CATASTROPHIC launch, which you might be willing to because everyone makes mistakes (only CA tends to repreat them over and over),
1. the AI still has troubes to orient itself or react to you 
2. diplomatic relations are de facto impossible because they are rigged (nobody wants to trade with you and even if you bribe them to, they will cancel it in the following 1-3 turns) 
3. units have pathing problems and struggle with executing your commands, especially in sieges
4. they have the AUDACITY to roll out a new patch after years, REMOVE FEATURES (multiplayer chat is gone now) and claim ""we made a few improvements to the game""

Do not buy this game, it really ain't worth your time and ressources.

I love that there are multiple settlements in a province and you can upgrade or specialize each settlement according to your preferences. Most importantly, the AI has notably improved by a lot. I have most of the DLCs so I am not sure if that contributes at all to the AI, but I have noticed the AI smartly keeps spearmen in reserve and prioritizes cavalry whereas the old Rome AI can be easily baited into chasing skirmishers. In addition, the campaign map AI is also pretty realistic. When you are conquering factions and getting powerful, they will trip over each other to start non aggression pacts and alliances with you. They also start ganging up on factions that you have whittled down their strength and settlements.

If you give it time you appreciate it a lot more; it seems overly complicated at first, and the battles are hard to understand, but it's very unique and I've never really played a game that can compare to it, in the way that it combines a civ clone tactical overview with a general's viewpoint of a battle. 
The battles are easily the redeeming part of the game; skillfully outmanuevering your opponent and executing a devestating charge that makes his troops break and run, is the most satisfying thing you could experience in a game. They are a bit glitchy, though, and the AI is way too good in some places, and completely clueless in others. In a way, it's more realistic than it wants to be: communication in an army was often not a sure thing, and sometimes a unit or an entire wing would be operating on different information than the others. 
The vanilla game is kinda frustrating; I recommend a 4 turns per year mod, an agent removal mod, and a civil war removal mod at the very least. There are also so excellent unit packs out there that really expand the game. 
As for the game as a whole, this is definitely a scholar's game; it rewards tactical thinking, and punishes tunnel visioning. Moving your armies on the tactical map requires a lot of careful thought; losing a city you thought was safe is really frustrating and will happen unless you're a god at diplomacy (diplomacy is also kinda stupidly done, not a huge fan but it's ok I guess). This game will teach you a bit of stuff about cultural and military history, in a fun way that puts you into the mindset of a conqueror during these periods of expansion and attrition. 
I would say it's a buy on sale. Definitely check out mods to get the most mileage out of this game. I've played three campaigns to completion and I'm on my 4th.",1430192024,1688222734,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game was porked when it was first released, but CA did a great job fixing it. I have to say that given its age, Rome 2 srtill looks pretty good. There's something epic about the scale of the map, the era, and the powers involved. 

The main reasons I still play, of course, are the Mods. Many are good, some are fantastic. I've probably spent most of my time teh last several years playing DEI and 1100 AD, the Medieval Mod. I recommend them both to anyone looking for a great Mod for Rome 2. 

It says a lot to me that after 1,000 hours I'm still learning things about Rome 2. There's so much going on in the game, and even more with the Mods. That'as why I keep coming back to it. 

How can I complain? I've spend about $150 on the game and the DLCs, most of which were picked up on sale. That comes out to about 15 cents per hour of entertainment.

It has many issues that other maps have like the fact towers are so fucking shit and bug out so often where they just freeze over nothing, can't be placed any closer than 1km away from the other towers and overall is so shit to play because artillery is so innacurate you can only break one wall with all the ammo it has (and I know there is manual aim, but it isn't much more accurate and is really slow since it only lets you shoot one of the 4 artillery units, instead of letting you shoot each one manually in succession to let you properly control them, which is a massive nerf to manual aim) which doesn't leave you much room to push in. every time I played this shitty fucking map nobody got past the defence's defence, this game is overall heavily defender sided as the positional advantage you have is immense and the asymmetrical money they give to attacker's to compensate is often not enough.

Why is it so difficult to make your units move the way you ask them to? In this game, when you right click it quick places the units where you clicked usually facing the enemy, that's fine. When you hold right click tho, many issues arise, as you hold right click, sometimes the right click automatically unholds the button which makes the game think you simply right clicked, and when this happens multiple times in a row it leads to way longer placement times. or longer time to properly make your formation before the battle begins. this has been often detrimental to me as I see my opponent coming for a charge and I want to rotate my units and adjust their width in a quick fashion to properly tank the charge. In this game you can also hold alt or control to move the units you selected as a whole in a fixed manner, very neat feature, makes atilla shit just because it doesn't have this feature. However, when there is any form of terrain that one of the units can't be on, for example a hill in between the formation where you try to go, or a rock, instead of moving individual people within a unit to shape them around the rock, it will push the whole unit out to a location you don't want just so they are all in a valid location, which ruins the formation.
On the note of formations, why is it that when a unit gets pushed, the game doesn't save the placement that the units had, in their formation, before I ordered them to go to an partially invalid location, this would allow for me to finalyl go into forests, which often misplace units for some fucking reason and which fucks up the formation, which then means you have to manually fix it if you want to come out of that forest in formation.
This previous example wouldn't be that bad, if when units are ordered to move in formation, over a flat surface they wouldn't fuck up the formations just like that until they reach their destination, which means selecting them all and rotating them to brace for a surprise cavalry or chariot charge is impossible, this is probably due to the fact, that even in walk mode, when you tell your whole formation to advance, THEY ALL MOVE AT THEIR OWN FUCKING SPEED . they should obviously adjust their speed to the slowest so that all of them hold perfect formation even as they go around, to allow for quick repositionning, and if someone has artillery slowing down their formation, then let them manually tell it to go somewhere and control the rest of the formation where they will probably go at the archer's speed since they are often the second slowest unit 
I think this change should also apply to running units, to avoid my cavalry general running head first into the enemy territory, just let the players who want those units to go faster control them manually.

Why is it when i try to place my units in a cramped space, it often bugs out and places them in totally wrong positions, this wouldn't be so bad, IF EVERYONE DIDN'T FUCKING PLAY SIEGE DAY AND NIGHT WHERE ALL THE STREETS ARE CRAMPED AND OFTEN MAKE PLACING UNITS A HEADACHE, THIS ISNT SO BAD FOR THE DEFENDER WHO PREPLACED HIS UNITS DURING PLACEMENT PHASE BUT VERY FUCKING SHIT FOR THE ATTACKER THAT OFTEN NEEDS TO OUT MICRO THE ENEMY DEFENDER TO BE ABLE TO PRESSURE MORE THAN ONE UNIT WHILE HAVING HIS UNITS FACE THE RIGHT WAY DURING THEIR CHARGE INSTEAD OF FACING RANDOM WALLS, HONESTLY I DONT KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS ISSUE CUZ I AINT ONE OF THEIR SHITTY CODERS THAT MADE THE MAIN FUCKING GAMEMODE SO FUCKING CANCER TO PLAY, EVERY TIME I PLAY A SIEGE BATTLE I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HTE PLACEMENT OF MY UNITS THAT COSTS ME MY TROOPS, FOR EXAMPLE, LETS SAY I BROKE A WALL IN BURDIGALA, I TELL MY UNIT TO PUSH TO THE RIGHT OF THAT WALL TO ATTACK SOME ENEMIES, WHILE THAT HAPPENS, I TELL ARCHERS TO GET ON THE WALL, THEY DO SO, BUT THEY ARE LOCKED FACING OUTWARD OF THE CITY INSTEAD OF INWARD, WHICH MEANS, I CAN'T ASK THEM TO SHOOT THE ENEMY UNIT FROM THE SIDE, SINCE THEY ARE SO FUCKING RETARDED AND CAN'T MOVE FOR SHIT ALONG A WALL AND ATTACK AN ENEMY, THIS ALSO HAPPENS WITH MELEE UNITS, WHICH IS WHY I HATE FUCKING GETTING ON THE WALLS, BUT OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE PLAYS  WITH THE RULE: 1 artillery 2 pikes 4 missile units max, WHICH MEANS I ONLY BREAK ONE WALL SINCE I ONLY HAVE 1 ARTILLERY  AND CAN BARELY GET MY UNITS PAST IT SINCE THEY KEEP BODY BLOCKING EACH OTHER NATURALLY, CUZ MOVING YOUR WHOLE ARMY THROUGH ONE TINY HOLE ISN'T VERY EFFICIENT.
Also for Burdigala, why is it that when i break the wall, it pours down dirt that I can make my unit go through, but I can't tell my units to place themselves on that dirt hill to protect, FOR EXEMPLE, FROM A CAVALRY CHARGE COMING FROM ONE OF MANY IMPENETRABLE DOORS WITH WAY TOO FUCKING MANY FIRETOWERS AROUND IT AND A HILL AFTER THAT ENSURES THAT EVEN IF YOU GET PAST THE DOOR, YOU GET FUCKED BY YOUR REDUCED UNIT'S UPHILL CHARGE SPEED. ALSO, MAYBE TO BALANCE THAT MAP, REMOVE OIL FROM THE GATEHOUSES ON IT? AN IDEA FOR YOU MORONS WHO MADE THEM IMPENETRABLE AND A PERFECT PLACE FOR THE DEFENDERS TO PULL OUT THEIR CHARIOTS OR CAVALRY FROM.

NOW FINALLY, FOR MY LAST GROIP WITH THE GAME, WHY IS IT THAT WHEN I PREPLACE MY ARCHERS FACING THE CHARIOTS OR CAVALRY THAT IS ABOUT TO CHARGE THEM, THEY DONT SHOOT? What I mean is I told my archers to face the incoming cavalry or chariot charge as they are the best units to deal with them, since they are basically invincible to most other units for some fucking reason, and I DOUBLE right clicked the incoming charge when they were in range (note: I always have guard mode on and remove fire at will on archers) they didnt shoot, instead they looked at them, and after 5 seconds pulled out their daggers, just so they can get fucked royally. and when that isn't what happens, THEY REPOSITION, AS IF THEY WERENT ALREADY FACING THE ENEMY, why? why? why? can't they just let fucking loose like they do in other instances where they fuck my cavalry? WHAT SECRET AM I MISSING PEOPEL THAT MAKES THEM FUCKING SHOOT, I DOUBLE RIGHT CLICKED WHEN THE CAVALRY JUST GO INTO RANGE!!! I GAVE THEM MAXIMAL TIME TO THROW THEIR VOLLEY, AT LEAST THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT, AT THE FRONT, WITH THE CAV SHOULDA FIRED.
WHY DO ARCHERS IN THIS GAME SHOOT SOMETIMES AT THE FUCKING SKY 80 DEGREES UP TO SHOOT YOUR UNIT THAT IS TRY TO HIDE AGAINST THE WALL OF THE HOUSES ON THE OTHER STREET? WHY ARE THEY SO GOOD AT THAT BUT NOT AT SHOOTING UP TOWARDS DEFENDER'S ARCHERS WHICH HAVE SUCH A FUCKING EASY SHOT? WHY CAN THEY NTO SHOOT PEOPLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND DECIDE TO LOITER AND STAND STILL AS THEY SEE ANY UNIT CHARGING RIGHT INFRONT OF THEM WHICH IS THE EASIEST SHOT OF THEIR LIVES??? BRO FIX YOUR FUCKING ARCHERS CA YOU BASTARDS.

Coming back after a year (or two) there was an overhaul and a balance update in between, all good and well that they want to keep the game balanced and introduce new systems, but I couldn't finish the game I started and there was no way to revert back to an earlier version, because the new balances and events screwed my campaign up so much I basically lost the next turn due to revolts and the resulting downwards spiral.
I tried again a few times on fresh campaigns with different factions but never got far. The cities on their own aren't that useful and you run out of food really quick, while you can't build up enough troops to siege your inferior neighbor. Conquering whole districts is thus a priority, while not always practical. There are some events added in one of the updates for realism sake I guess, which are forced to happen, but not always make sense. 
I feel like they are half going for historical accuracy and realism but that's not what I'm looking for in a war game. I'm just finding myself picking up Rome TW again instead of this, despite the jank of the old game and the better looks of this game.

 The Caeser in Gual campaign is my favorite as a lover of roman history and specifically that of conquests in Gual and Germania, this campaign scratches that itch for me perfectly. Although not a downside for me the multiplayer is about 90% siege battles which I perfer but if you dont have friends who play this and you perfer pitched battles you’ll feel it lacking a little but not always. 

All in all it’s a great game I recommend to any who love strategy and seeing lines of roman shields crushing the northern barbarians that threaten our borders! AVE CAESER! ROMA INVICTA!

Sure it looks nice and to be the leader of Rome is a lot of fun but the game is so poorly managed that it's hard to ever see it making a proper recovery.  The release of ""DLC"" while the features of the game itself were not completely or properly functioning was a disgrace.  We got an Alpha version of Rome II and it showed.  Feature wise we got some nice new bits and some great new graphics but is it a major improvement over Rome Total War?  Considering they are now releasing DLC for the same types of features and cultures that were in the original I'm pretty disappointed.  In some areas Rome II is an improvement, but for the most part, it's a major step back.  After the disaster that was the Empire Total War release I avoided Shogun II for a long, long time.  Whatever comes after Rome II is going to have to do a lot better to convince me even try it.

EDIT: After several years and now revisiting this game, I can say it is now complete. Sadly I still think it is amongst the weakest of the Total War series.

WARNING: CAESAR DLC IS COMPLETE WASTE OF $15

I really wanted to like this game. I even still find myself playing it from time to time. The original Rome Total War not only got me into strategy games but started my obsession with Roman history. When they announced this game I was on the CA page waiting for every bit of coverage. 

After playing since release, I have come to terms with how monotinously boring it is. The tech tree, the province system, the trait system, land plotting system, general creation, spy/dignitary/veteran system are all designed to add content to the game. Unfortunately, all that these features really do is take away from the abstracted depth that the original had. Everything feels too much like a todo list that takes too much work to navigate through.  

Another issue I have is the ridiculous amount of tiny factions. Not only do they make waiting for the next turn a chore, they remove all sense of there being an epic war between nations. Often I'm thinking 'OK time to take out these guys.' Later game doesn't have this problem but by then (especially if you are Rome, Greece, Egypt, or Seleucid) you are practically invincible. The late game is not only annoyingly time consuming due to all the menus you have to click through, it isn't even worth playing due to the balance issues...

The DLC for this game is the most absurd thing I've ever seen from CA. I had to pay 3.00 just to have blood and gore in a game about sending massive armies of melee troops at each other? Really, CA? And the Caesar in Gaul campaign is a joke. It's the same exact thing with a different tech tree, a general named Caesar (and Marc Antony), and a few extra units. Definitely not worth $15. Really dissapointed by this.

The redundant roman units, slow loading textures, long battle load times, clunky naval battles, over-crowded/sized unit grouping, boring political system(the three territory system of the original was much better), frustrating multiplayer campaign system, completely unbalanced campaign(which is expected but still pretty excessive... Egypt), awkward campaign camera, and unatractive UI are just a few more of the things that make this game an epic failure. 

In fact, I can't think of a single thing about this game that I liked that Rome 1 didn't do just as well, if not better. Even the graphics engine isn't properly optimized to look relatively decent on my Core i7, Radeon R9 280x machine. I have to stress to anyone who hasn't played the original...

Go play the original Rome: Total War, it is an incredible game that is much more fun than this mess of a project. Hopefully in a couple years Rome 2 will have been modded to the point that it is worth playing again.",1389041256,1682732546,True,0,0,0.530466675758361816,0,True,False,False

I started a slightly modded campaign as Macedon on VH and decided to do a WC. I had an absolute blast playing it and it gave me many nostalgic vibes from the campaigns I've played across the years. Personally, I believe that Rome 2 is the crown jewel of total war as I sit here with about 750 hrs making it the #2 most played game on my 9 year old account. It's just a fantastic game and remains one of my all-time favorites. If you want an indepth explanation of why I think it's so good then I'll leave one below, but to sum it up, this game is excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes war games. It's a very easy to learn game and still remains fun on the harder difficulties that I play on.

AI (8/10)
I didn't realize how much better the AI is in this game than the newer games untiI I played Warhammer 3. The AI will regularly attempt to fight your armies, invade you, and likes to put up a fight. I couldn't even tell if this game has an anti-player bias which is shocking when compared to the egregious way the AI behaves in WH 3 (ignoring the 4 stacks bearing down on its country just to raid your settlements). I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to not have the AI constantly moving out of your attack range and instead choosing to sack as many undefended settlements as possible. Of course, the AI isn't amazing but it feels more realistic in this game and less manufactured. In battles, the AI is competent enough to give you a fight. They are fairly predictable but a lot harder to cheese, which makes the battles SO much more enjoyable to play. It's just nice to play against an AI that feels fair rather than an AI that is dumb and manufactured to be aggravating.

Empire Building/Economy/World Map (8/10)
My favorite part of the Total War series is empire building and developing provinces until you can make a super economy and fund elite armies. In Rome 2, that aspect of the game feels great. You can specialize certain provinces to produce certain types of income and build them accordingly to maximize profits. Researching specific technologies may help you in one area, but delay you in another. There are plenty of choices to make when it comes to the economy and what to divert funds to. The AI doesn't straight up refuse to make deals with you and is generally open to trading and alliances. Public order isn't that big of a pain to manage like it is in the newer games and even on the harder difficulties you shouldn't have that much issue managing it. I actually like the fact that you can't permanently remove cultures from the game since that is historically accurate. The vast majority of regions would never be 100% one religion or culture. The food mechanic isn't a massive issue and honestly I kinda like it. With all of that said, Rome 2 has probably the worst mechanic in any total war game which is corruption. I have no idea why they designed corruption to function the way it does with your economy getting worse as your empire expands. You get to the point where it can actually be harmful to expand because the amount of money you lose to corruption is directly related to the amount of provinces you own. It's an awful mechanic that is frustrating to deal with and should have been either tempered or replaced entirely. This section would get a 10 if not for that god awful mechanic and the middling politics system. It's better than it was at launch but is still largely able to be ignored or bought off. All in all, still really fun.

Factions (9/10)
This game has a very good variety of factions that each play differently. The Romans will play completely different than the Parthians for example and don't function the same at all. Most nations will end up have a similar build but the unit variety is wide enough to the point where it's not an issue for me. The only issue I really have with the factions is the fact that the barbarian factions feel very copy-pasted. They all field basically the same unit roster with little to no change which makes it feel kinda eh. Other than that, I enjoyed playing the wide variety of factions Rome 2 gives you. 

Battles (10/10)
This might be a slight hot take, but I absolutely love the battles in this game. I'm not sure if its because I'm writing this review after playing WH 3 whose battles are so atrocious that it makes anything else seem like a ray of sunlight, but the battles in this game are really fun. I found myself actively wanting to play battles in this game even if I could autoresolve them. I love the Roman Era unit design and I thought the weather feature was a great touch. Fighting massive battles in giant rainstorms, the desert, snow covered forests, etc. was extremely fun. Playing differently depending on who I was fighting or fighting as was also fun  (Nomads vs Hellenic as an example). I just found myself always wanting to fight more and to this day I have not had a total war have that effect on me. The unit rosters are massive and there are so many different units you can use and fight against during the course of a campaign.

Graphics + Performance (9/10)
I actually think the graphics for this game have held up pretty well. I genuinely would rather look at this game than WH 3 which is shocking considering this game is almost 10 years older. The only thing that looks kinda weird are the faces of the units. They look like play-doh and look really off. The game runs beautifully and doesn't suffer from the awful performance issues that plague Attila to this day. I've had 1 crash in the past 300-400 hours and 0 glitches. It's just nice playing a game that actually feels finished and bug-free (which is crazy considering the way the game launched) instead of the dumb crap CA puts out nowadays. 

Music (5/10)
Eh, it's alright. I still vastly prefer Rome 1's soundtrack over this one, but it isn't the worst in the world. It isn't annoying like WH 3s is, but it's still rather forgettable. 
 
DLC (7/10)
This will be the first game I've reviewed that does not get a 0 in the DLC category. That is because I actually think the DLC campaigns in this game are extremely good. A large amount of the time I've put into the game was in the DLC campaigns like Empire Divided, RoR, and the like. The unique scenarios that they bring make them, in my opinion, worth buying. You get a good amount of factions even up to 8-10 in some cases and it's like buying a different game. The reason it doesn't get a higher grade is because of the existence of faction packs. I am of the opinion that faction packs are a cash grab and should not exist. Other than that, I think the DLC is actually worth buying and I find myself enjoying those campaigns even more than the main game at times.

Mod Support (10/10)
Rome 2 has arguably the best mod for the post-Shogun 2 era total wars which is DEI. That mod and the amount of work that has gone into it are only truly rivaled by MK 1212 AD for Attila. It expands or overhauls every single feature in the game and floods it with historically accurate units and extremely cool campaign features. Besides that, the game has plenty of mods that customize units, remove bad features (corruption), create a cleaner UI, etc. Plenty of options to create a customized campaign. None of the mods block achievements as well which is a huge added bonus. 
 
Conclusion
Rome 2 remains my favorite total war of all time and one of the best games I've ever played. I love this period in history and I'm glad the game survived it's rough launch 9-10 years ago. It's blossomed into a fantastic game that I enjoy far more than CA's newer products.

Thank you racist developers. Now we know their true face.

If anyone does not know, then when pre-ordering Dlc, it was indicated that there is a translation into Russian. But when the add-on came out, it turned out that there was no Russian and never would be.

Thanks to the racist pigs at Sega and Creative Assembly. In your ""fight"" with Russia, you spat on all Russian-speaking players from Kazakhstan, Ukraine, the Baltic states (naturally, there is no localization into the languages ​​of these countries, and many people can only play comfortably in Russian). I'm not talking about the millions of Russian-speaking people living in other countries.

All players are advised to think about paying money, because tomorrow YOU can become ""inconvenient"" for the developer and publisher.

I personally enjoyed playing Total War™: ROME II - Emperor Edition. The game offers an immersive experience where you can control your own empire and conquer other territories. The game is set in ancient Rome, and the attention to detail in the graphics and sound design is impressive.

One of the aspects of the game that I really liked was the strategic depth. You have to manage your resources, maintain diplomatic relations with other factions, and keep your army well-fed and happy. The battles are also challenging and require strategic thinking to emerge victorious.

The game also offers a multiplayer mode, which adds to its replay value. You can compete with other players online or team up with friends to take on the AI.

However, the game has its flaws. The AI can be predictable at times, and the campaign can become repetitive after a while. The game also requires a high-end PC to run smoothly, which may be a drawback for some players.

Overall, I would recommend Total War™: ROME II - Emperor Edition to anyone who enjoys real-time strategy games and has an interest in ancient Rome.

Horribly optimized graphics and FPS issues - game breaking brain-dead A.I.(able to steam roll legendary historical battles in less than 10 minutes let us not talk about campaigns) - broken naval combat - broken ground battles unbalanced units and most of all flags ( You have to defend a random flag on a open ground battle... and say goodbye to any strategy you might have ...really?! CA really?!) worse politics system than Rome 1 (no family trees and its confusing as hell) .
Only1 turn per year so  upgrading/promoting the generals doesn't even matter anymore and it takes ages for the ai to end turns...now the multiplayer campaign is horrible,you WILL desynch most of the time plus the A.I turns take way too long and it's pretty unbalanced on the competitive side...
score: 5/10

This time I picked the Arverni tribe, because don't we all like a good underdog story? After several in-game decades of brutal campaigning, shrewd diplomacy, and economic subversion, my Gallic Federation stretched out from the Iberian peninsula to the isles of Britannia and the forests of Germania. The green banner of the Gauls proudly flew over what was once the capital of the mighty Roman Empire. Mortal eyes, ever afraid where the Gallic blade would strike next, looked upon my works and despaired...!

Then, since I had mostly neglected internal politics, a civil war tore the federation in twain and I had to watch helplessly as half the settlements I had left were sacked and/or conquered by all the armies that used to be mine to command.

Total War: ROME II is one of the most divisive games in the entire series, probably on par with Attila in terms of the divide. At launch, ROME II was a complete disaster, and that is putting it lightly. It was a buggy, unstable mess that barely worked and when it did, it ran so unbelievably poorly it made you feel ill. If this was the Original release of ROME II, I would probably be giving a negative review right now.

This is not the case with Emperor Edition (Abbreviated as EE from this point onward).

EE and subsequent patches have fixed most, if not all, of what was wrong with the original release. It runs well, plays well, looks good enough, and improves on many of the gameplay aspects that powered SHOGUN 2, another Total War I hold extremely dear. A large, impressive map, dozens of factions to both encounter and play as, Roman Legionaries, improved diplomacy, naval invasions, Roman Legionaries, tech trees that advance your empire with many being real historical breakthroughs made by said empires, family trees with succession lines, did I mention Roman Legionaries?

The best part about that whole spiel is that I'm only talking about the base ""Grand Campaign"". That is nothing to say about the 4-5 other maps introduced via DLC.

If you're into Roman history, or history in general like I am, then hoo-boy are you in for a real treat. ROME II: EE is, naturally, focused around the Roman nation, mainly the Republic and Early-Mid Empire periods. ATTILA shows the disheveled corpse that is Late-Empire Rome and its total collapse, but ATTILA is an acquired taste and does not appeal to most. All Campaigns, with exception of ""Wrath of Sparta"" and technically the base Grand Campaign, focus exclusively on Rome and its history. From the conquest of Italy that hardened the Romans into a truly unique nation, to the Crisis of the Third Century where Rome nearly broke until the ""Restitutor Orbis"" somehow fixed(?) the Empire. 

Rome II: EE just delivers what you come to expect from a good Total War, it's hard to believe that the original game initially launched in a state so bad that it made launch-day Battlefield 4 look good by comparison.

The one thing I will dock EE for, however, is its price. Original ROME II is nearly 10 years old and EE is nearly 9. It's a travesty that this game is still 60 USD. Thankfully, it goes on sale somewhat often, and often the sale price is very low. As of writing this, its 15 USD for the base game.

TL:DR: A good game today, too expensive for its age, still worth it if you can grab it for under 30$.

It's fine. It most certainly is the origin of how New Total War looks and plays. That may be good, that may be bad, depends on how much you love or hate the classic gameplay. Personally I prefer the classics, but wanted things like being able to play Multiplayer campaign with a buddy, and we can't do that in RTW remastered.

I have a very hard time recommending this game to you at full price, as frankly, $60 for *most* of a 10 y/o game is ridiculous in of itself. What makes it worse is CA's DLC practices for this game. I very much so disagree with the cutting of unique factions, and simple graphical features, like blood, from the base game to resell to people as DLC later. If I did my math right, it is actually around $90 to own all of this game, and that is excluding any of the campaign DLCs. I will only recommend this game to you if you can catch it at CONSIDERABLE discount like I did. I paid $30 US for the base game and all of the ""Culture Packs"" (which are CA's word for ""factions from the game you already bought we decided you have to pay extra for, fuck you."") at that price I consider it reasonable. Considering that this game isn't always on sale for 75% off, and that is the only way I feel it worthwhile, I ultimately feel it warrants a ""Not Recommended"".

TL;DR, Its an okay game, but never worth full price, and CA's DLC practices with it are scummy.

It's not perfect, but most battles feel epic and units feel responsive to your tactics and commands. The setting is awesome and the stories, grudges, and acts of betrayal and vengeance that evolve during the game drive everything forward. There is enough difference between each region's units and strategies for things to feel different, though I wish these differences were more fully explored. 

The best part is certainly the mid game. For many factions, surviving and putting yourself in an opportune position can be challenging in the early game, especially on higher difficulties. In contrast, the late game largely consists of you steamrolling over the map with very powerful veteran armies and agents. The mid game however, which consists of a handful of powers vying for control, is worth these more tedious bookends to your campaigns.

The game's graphics are simply stunning, with lush landscapes, detailed character models, and breathtaking battle scenes that will leave you breathless. From the rolling hills of Italy to the deserts of North Africa, every location is rendered with an eye for realism and authenticity that truly brings ancient Rome to life.

But Total War: Rome 2 Emperor Edition is much more than just a pretty face. The game's strategic depth is truly remarkable, with a wealth of options for players to explore as they build their empire and wage war against their enemies. From managing resources and building armies to negotiating treaties and forging alliances, every aspect of the game requires careful consideration and planning.

Of course, no game about ancient Rome would be complete without epic battles, and Total War: Rome 2 Emperor Edition delivers on this front in spades. Whether you're commanding a legion of infantry, a fleet of warships, or a horde of cavalry, the game's tactical options are diverse and engaging. Every battle feels like a high-stakes affair, with every decision you make potentially determining the fate of your empire.

Overall, Total War: Rome 2 Emperor Edition is an outstanding game that combines historical accuracy with exciting gameplay and stunning visuals.

Who doesn't love a good ol' historical strategy game? It's like being the world's smartest dictator, minus the real-world consequences.

If you've ever had fantasies of leading a Roman army to victory and conquering the world, this is your chance to live out your dreams without the risk of getting stabbed in the back by your own men.

Whether you want to take on the role of the Roman Empire or one of the many other factions available, you'll get to experience the thrill of outsmarting your enemies in epic battles.

You get to command a massive army, and who doesn't love shouting orders at pixelated soldiers and watching them obey without question?

It's a great way to learn about history, except with more blood and guts, and less boring textbooks.

If you've ever wanted to try your hand at political intrigue and building a flourishing empire, Rome II is the game for you.

Nothing beats the feeling of unleashing a horde of elephants on unsuspecting foes, crushing them underfoot like ants.

You'll learn valuable life skills, like resource management, diplomacy, and how to manage a sprawling empire.

There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of watching a well-executed battle plan come together, resulting in a crushing victory against your enemies.

And let's be honest, who doesn't want to feel like Julius Caesar, minus the assassination part?",1677016003,1677016003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've given this game chance after chance, hoping I would finally change my mind about it. I pre-ordered this years ago, and was disappointed by the horribly broken and buggy release. After all this time, I've tried to forgive and forget, and some of my friends told me the game has had serious improvements. I have a much newer rig now, I can run it on high to max settings, everything should be good, right? 

As it turns out, there is a problem persistent in the engine of many of the newer total war games which manages to max out you CPU and GPU usage almost instantly, even in situations that are not graphically intensive. I was able to play the game for just under 20 minutes, when my computer shut down instantly from overheating. I wasn't even playing on the battle map, it wasn't late game, I was simply looking at my building options of my single settlement faction on the campaign map. That was enough to bring my entire system to a screeching halt. 

I grew up an avid total war fan, and I want so badly for this franchise to succeed, but the direction CA has taken is insulting to it's consumers and long time fans. They have repeatedly produced shoddy release after shoddy release, chopped and cut content into pieces locked behind additional DLC pay walls, and spat in the face of those who have been loyal to the franchise since it's inception. It's going to take a miracle for me to trust this studio and this publisher again, and I don't plan on giving them a single cent after the consistent disrespect they have shown to their fan base.",1676724412,1676724412,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've waited for this continuation for many years, but it's simply not what I expected. The animations of the projectiles (stones/arrows/spears) looks cartoonish with those white lines/stripes and I don't understand why put such bad effect. The UI and city management looks needlessly complex. You need to essentially decide what to build for each of the four sections of a province and the buildings must not overlap...

After tons of patches the melee units are still making mosh pits!!! Also when enemy flag goes white the unit doesn't immediately route. It has like 2 stages of routing now which is confusing and not needed. 

The fighting in the original game was way smoother and the soldiers looked a lot better (clothing/equipment). Here the Hastati/Triarii look like villagers although this might be historically accurate for some unit types from what I've studied.

On my first campaign (normal difficulty Julii) in just 5 years I easily get to around 15 unit army easily. Seems strange that I generate, so much income at the beginning of the game! Makes me wonder what kind of a scaling factor is there?

After trying to play it some more, it was still horrible after mods (which they banned/ ""made obsolete"") f this fng piece of fng s^%t of a game. it's garbage, then people try to fix it with mods, then they ban the mods. F the a-holes. I uninstalled this fng sht of a game. 
2 years ago I would've recommended this game. It's complete trash right now though. I used to love it, but it's so rigged that it's unplayable. All mods make it crash, so I don't even now why tf there's a workshop. They've tossed historical accuracy out the window, now literally every ruler or general is female, every single ""important figure"" opportunity is female half of every regiment is female. Look, go ahead and toss historical accuracy out the window, but at least keep the feminist historical white-washing to fictitiously themed games, that's all I ask. Oh, on top of everything, they make it literally impossible to maintain a political equilibrium. You get one general of your political affiliation - the king/ruler, that's it. Every single other political candidate/general is of the opposing political party, it's rigged that it makes the game complete trash now. Oh my gosh, this game is so terrible nowadays.

And this is an absolute* master piece. 

I put an asterisk there, because you should really look into the DEI (Divide Et Impera) mod. 
It's so easy to install and makes this game one of the best historical games. If not the best historical strategy game I've ever played.

Even now I still haven't optimized my playstyle and I'm still discovering new features and mechanics. The game gives you some goals but they don't really do anything which is why you are absolutely free to do whatever. 

You can have many different playstyles.
You can be a raiding barbarian, looting, razing and sacking settlements. You can go raid territory. Or you can confederate as some factions. You can form the great Hordes of The Steppe when confederating as nomads while you're raiding the others. 
You can be a pirate of Rhodes and liberate the conquered Greek city states and reinstate their old leaders. There are many more ways to play the game that I haven't listed at least one will fit your way of playing. 

If you get the unlock factions submod, you gain access to most factions (These will be less polished as they aren't really legit, but still very playable and fun). If you buy some DLCs on the other hand you gain access to full fledged rosters and factions (each is also upgraded by DEI). (You can even be a satrapy to the Seleucids with this method.)

The tech tree features many reforms and some must be unlocked by meeting certain requirements rather than research. The Romans start with the Marian Maniple system and later on use the Legionary system followed by the late Legionary system. Many other factions have different reforms aswell, all staying true to history ofcourse. 

Each region has different mercenaries from African spear throwers to Indian elephants to light Nomadic horse archers to the great Balearic slingers to Greek pirate ships to f*ng Scottish dogs and chariots. Hell they even have scorpions (ancient LMGs) and ballista (ancient mortars).

There are also new campaigns added. Like the Alexander one, where you defeat the Achaemenid empire and it's satrapies. The Mithradatic wars, a civil war where Pontus is involved in as well. Then the Sparta and Hannibal DLCs have been reworked really well and are polished.

All in all, I would never have even thaught about refunding the game, runs smooth, works and with the much needed mod, amazing! There are also some other mods (like medieval ones i believe.) 
But for some classical strategy this is THE go to game.

In any case i recommend buying the DLCs from legit key dealers or steam sales as I find them a bit too expensive.",1674252924,1675356388,True,8,1,0.625419557094573975,0,True,False,False

The good.

• The game is stable and optimized.

• You have some mods to enhance the game.

The bad.

• Agents, too powerful and unbalancing. You can win wars with a fraction of the armies realistically needed if you win before the agent contest. Solution = No Agents mod

• Provincial system. It's a silly transposition of a late imperial political organization. Makes no sense at all when tribes and minor factions are still alive, and harms some factions and others not. Solution = Sara's Single-Region Provinces

• Unprotected settlements. In a time of war and uncertainty is impossible to think that settlements have no walls. Please think about Numantia, sixteen months to surrender the city and in game has no walls, this is simply unbearable. Solution = Sara's Single-Region Provinces

• Too much money. You can expand your economy and simply crush your foes spamming army after army, if they have ports worst still, because the high cost of navies means that you will gain soon the mastery of seas. Also you can have your armies in permanent campaign without any penalty. Solution = Supply Lines & Logistics

• Imperium system. Each level of Imperium (power) have a limit for armies and agents recruitable. This is a silly and cheap way (not very effective) to limit the AI spamming generals while trying to ease the snowball effect late game when the player is too powerful and nothing can stop him. Solution = Bison's Immersive Army Limit / Sara's Single-Region Provinces / Community Patch For Rome II

• Late game boring. When attained certain level of development the AI becomes rapidly powerless, you may add some chili to spice things up. The bigger your empire, the bigger the hate from other factions. Solution = Realm Divide: ROME II Edition

• Time goes too fast. Your generals die of old before achieving any glorious status, your armies need one or two years to sail from Egypt to Crete. Solution = 12 Turns Per Year

• Battles are too fast and AI is silly. There is not much to do in order to help the AI to fight better, but some improvement can be done. Solution = Rome Total War Classic Combat / Ancient Combat

• General Menu and Battle music is strident. Solution = Alexander Music / Aeterna Troy Music Pack

• You miss some refinements from Attila or Warhammer. Solution = Community Patch For Rome II / Dresden Sack, Liberation And Diplomatic Options Mod

• The Roman are tomato red. Yes, that's a concern, but you have a plethora of reskins and even custom units to fill the gap, also graphical improvements to battles, settlements or UI. Unlike the music part I will not recommend anything specific.

Despite all the ""bad"" I pointed Rome 2 is a recommendable game for everyone who loves antiquity and wargames. With mods you can improve the experience but don't expect perfection. If you feel too lazy to tinker with your (mod) load order you can try an overhaul like Para Bellum or Divide et Impera.

The game offers a vast and complex campaign mode that immerses players in the historical world of ancient Rome, allowing them to control one of the many factions vying for power and dominance.

The level of detail in the game is truly impressive, from the beautifully rendered 3D landscapes to the intricate and historically accurate unit models. The game's AI is also top-notch, providing a challenging and engaging experience that keeps players on their toes.

One of the standout features of this game is the grand-scale battles, which are truly epic in scale and provide an incredibly immersive and satisfying experience. The game's battle engine is incredibly well-done, allowing players to control their units in real-time and make tactical decisions that can turn the tide of battle.

In terms of gameplay, the game offers a wide range of different playstyles, from aggressive expansion to a more defensive and strategic approach. The game's diplomacy system is also well-done, allowing players to form alliances and engage in diplomacy with other factions.

Overall, I highly recommend Total War™: ROME II - Emperor Edition to anyone who is a fan of strategy games or has an interest in ancient history. With my 500 hours of play, I can confidently say that this game is an absolute must-have for any strategy gamer.

Rome 2  was stripped of many great features that was in Rome 1. Go and check out (Rome 2 Angry review) on you tube. Here Angry Joe will give you a bit of an idea how this game has changed. These issues have been left unresolved by SEGA and CA. What I will now do from here on is simple. I wont buy one more DLC for Rome 2. I wont buy any other game where CA or SEGA was the developers until I have seen the game and tested it to see if its worth its insame price. This game as stripped down as it is compared to Rome 1 and then also sold in bits and pieces isnt worth anything more than 10 dollars for the main game and the hell with buying all the DLC's. In Rome 1 there was no need to buy Sparta and some other factions. Start giving us the same value we had in Rome 1 and stop trying to sell us more DLC's. Sorry if my english is crappy....

Blood and gore SHOULD already be in the game this been complaint for ages, just another way for you spend extra you for more content that was removed or striped from the game.
vinalla game is pretty moderate but a skeleton for content , Its great but your locked out of 80% of content. 
Honestly there should be gold edition or complete edition empror edition only gives few of the dlc., Instead they just charge you extra, I dont blame anyone for torrenting, or pirating this game, Locked out of too much content.Dont get me wrong its pretty damn good, alot the dlc add alot more, And follow the story on ,Graphics, and way units act, citys looks great, And rise of replubic is pretty intresting early rise of rome campaign ,Wrath of sparta pretty cool ancient warfare expreince lack luster limited units (hisstorically accurate) ,Ceasar and gaul campaign was a blast too, But this is ALL the DLC thats making it better.
Rome 2 was rather undwhelming, and world domination on 40 hr campaign with Rome was Just legion stacks steamrolling against braindead ai would offer me 500 gold for peace every turn. Its a shame this will never be as good as Rome 1 remaster.  i think in future if they did a complete edition of the game, this will be worth playing, but it was heavily monetised game, Unless you torrent all dlc version or willing to spend extra, it can be a disapointing expreince , alot the dlc is optinal but limited other factions, like greek dlc effects what siege engines are available . So not getting said greek faction, or said pirate faction effects the roster of Romans, even if you may never play the pirate factions., Same story with beasts of war, even though 2 extra units in your roster of recuirtment.

I pretty much play exclusively with the Divide Et Impera mod - which completely transforms the base game into a complex, immersive and (sort of) historically faithful experience. 

Despite the negative reception this game received, you can tell a colossal amount of love and work went into crafting this game. The details on each unit, the historically accurate armour (from real-life museum pieces), the sound design of the weapons and armour clashing and banging, the interactions between soldiers on the battlefield - who scream and shout at each-other and lock into brutal one-on-one combat. The music is sweeping and beautiful.

The graphics are still absolutely beautiful 10 years on and I still stop to admire the scenery frequently. Despite strangely not-to-scale trees and other strange quirks on the battlefield. The commander/leader portraits are the ugliest around - with gaping fish mouth-ed animations. Yuck. They still have legacy versions of these with 3D portraits in the latest TW games - which I find mystifying as they are so rubbish!

One of my favourite things to do is to pause the game mid-battle and look at the combat up close, it is amazing just how much happens and the complexity of the troops. The battle gameplay isn't perfect  - orders can be clunky and troop behaviour can be erratic, even with mods. Sieges battles are pretty dreadful and the maps all look the same after a while. 

In my view Rome 2 is a flawed masterpiece. Perhaps still haunted by some serious problems in development but with time, and on reflection, is one of the best they've made. What is a more peak 'Total War Experience' than building Rome up from nothing to dominate the known world? In a world that feels ancient and alive - campaigns that feel epic and grand.

City building is very limited and dumbed down in comparison, you constantly feel like you have far less input or control over your settlements, a lot of mechanics consolidated into one or just outright missing and battles are far less strategy and formation orientated as all units seem like they do the same thing regardless of who you are fighting against - you just don't get the level of civilization exclusive tactics or ways of playing you did previously. The biggest kick in the balls is civilizations that you play against in grand campaign are locked behind DLC paywall - which is an abhorrent practice of the gaming industry. Remember when we used to get actual expansions with different campaigns, content and new units and mechanics? Like what the Total War franchise predecessors used to do? Yeah - none of that here, you get a game with portions of it locked behind cash-grabs. 

On top of all of this, the game is STILL plagued with game-breaking bugs. Save files randomly get corrupted or glitched at turn 100 to where your camera no longer works - meaning you have to restart a brand new campaign. Siege artillery on walls does not fire. And this is a decade after the game has been released.

To give it credit, the politics mechanic is an interesting implementation and is a plus, and the graphics are an improvement over Medieval 2, but as far as gameplay and content goes - it's just lacking and a buggy mess. It's a real shame too - I really really really want to like this game, and have been trying to get 'into it' several times now. However every time I give this a shot, I end up going back to Medieval 2 or Shogun 2 after a couple of hours as those predecessors are simply superior in terms of gameplay and content.",1672993758,1673409969,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Needless to say, we were ALL massively disappointed with the pile of dog feces we got. It was the first Total War that didn't blow me away. Let alone the bugs. The campaign was utterly lifeless, there was no ""family tree"", and not even NASA computers could get a good frame rate. This game was awful when it first came out, and in turn it seemed to start a trend of Total War games just not meeting the community's expectations.

Here we are 10 years later an I cannot recommend this game enough. I dare say, they ""fixed"" the game. A version of the family tree was brought back and bugs were squashed over the years. The game at highest graphics settings is still visually very impressive. I run the game at max (extreme) settings and 1440p, on an RTX 3070. Very smooth, no stutters, consistent 60fps. The AI is not batshit stupid anymore either and provides a fun challenge

Do yourself a favor and download the ""Divide et Impera"" total conversion mod. This mod made the game 100 times better for me. There are boatloads of new units (which are very historical and realistic), the AI is intelligent, they do not get unfair bonuses, and the campaign is just straight up challenging fun. The modders took some of the elements from Attila and put them in Divide et Impera. I'm 65 turns into my Rome campaign and it's extremely challenging. I'm still battling for basic survival on the Italian Peninsula. Diplomacy works really well in the mod too. Neighboring factions will not just get mindlessly aggressive and attack you for no reason if it doesn't benefit them greatly. Establishing trade agreements is more realistic than before too.

Women were, by accurate historical accounts, forbidden from going to war because the men weren't around to help take care of the children. This isn't sexism, that's just a reality of war that woketards just consistently fail to comprehend, and instead it has to somehow be ""offensive"" and it ""doesn't conform"" to the femoid supremacist agenda that SiliCommie Valley wants to propagate

But okay, we'll just have to settle with mods and sailing the high seas to ensure integrity of accurate historical accounts. But what would be better is if someone came along in a few years and simply patched out females (outside of named historical figures such as Cleopatra and Boudica. No, there weren't many, but the names of the few are remembered for a reason, THEM BEING WOMEN IS LARGELY UNRELATED)

Female representation doesn't have to be everywhere, it just needs to be enough to maintain historical accuracy, which really isn't that much beyond the two aforementioned names, so there's really no reason to complain. If you wanna complain about ""waaah, muh feemail djenruls got washed out by 'EviL nAzi miSoGYnIsT hWiTe SupReMaCiSt sTraIghT MEN'"", just remember that at least half of those labels didn't exist until at least the victorian era, and one of them isn't even a century old, so maybe keep the ad hominems to their respective time periods, yeah? Wouldn't want you to sound uneducated, but I'm pretty sure you've already done a sufficient job at that back in 2018.

Can't wait for female general rng to get patched out, dealing with the sociopolitical atmosphere in the real world is bad enough, there's no need for it to contaminate games that aim for historical accuracy. If you want your female generals or - hell, a female-only experience - then just make your own mods and games that support your nonsense, and you stay in the little corner you were given; outward expansion will be seen as a hostile threat, as it always has been. Let everyone that wants historical accuracy enjoy historical accuracy, and for the love of whatever gods are still daring to watch mankind please stop trying to tell everyone that they're somehow required to enjoy your ""content"". What I mean by that is your opinion is phallic in nature, and common sense would dictate that swinging it around violently in public isn't exactly a good way to get other people to accept it, let alone stuffing it down people's throats. Keep it in your pants, you're not special just because you have one. Everyone has an opinion. Get used to it.

Now, as for me? I'm going to enjoy myself a nice hot cup of historical accuracy... if I ever get the itch to play Rome 2 again. And by ""historical accuracy"", I mean all the maidens will be staying in the pantries and nurseries where they belong, taking care of the children and those who lack able bodies for the battlefield, because that's what the role of the female has been for thousands of years.

I, Sparta, decided to go assist Athens, my ally, with killing Epirus, no one likes them, but the moment I go and help the ""military alliance""  I had with them and Macedon disappeared as they declared war on me. I'm just sitting there with a damaged army up against 2 stronger opponents. My main army is currently smushed in between Macedon and Athens with Epirus re-gaining an army. I noticed that Athens moved it's army to get closer to Sparta, where my small army is at, and took the opportunity to absolutely destroy them. I sent my main army, which still has some minor damage, down to Athens then forced marched my smaller army to get into range of the reinforcement circle, auto-resolved the siege of Athens. I now only have to deal with their armies. The Athenian armies fearing for Athens, ran back to retake their home. Their army started sieging down Spartan controlled Athens. I fought a battle and won, leaving me a Epirus, who still hasn't fully recovered, and Macedon. Macedon had already took some of my land and were ready to take me out. I recruited more soldiers to bolsten my armies, and I rushed over to deal with the small invasion force Macedon had greatly underestimated me as they sent small army hoping that Athens would do the heavy lifting. their army was dealt with quickly, and I re-took my land that they stole from me. I now had my sights on Macedon themselves as they were in a conflict with the barbarians to the north. Using the this advantage I quickly stole Macedon's capital before they could even react. Their attempt to re-take it was laughable and was dealt with quickly. With 2 port cities under my control I set my eyes on creating the most powerful navy the world had ever seen, this and another navy was esential for many victories. 

After dealing with Macedon I laughed as a barbarian tribe gave Epirus a good beating, but they had failed at conquering Epirus which allowed me to sign a peace treaty with them and become friends. Now why would I do that to my enemies when I had such an advantage? 1 easy answer, Rome. They had became great friends with them and continuing this war may lead Rome to join in, and I was no where at the level to even start thinking of dealing with Rome. I had remembered a previous campaign in which Rome declared war on me which lead to the worlds strongest navy and military to rush upon my poorly defend cities. I could barely hold on when I fought the first wave and Invading them would be neigh impossible. With a new found friend, I took to spreading my empire, and I looked northward. I quickly dealt with most of the northern barbarians and quickly took most of Europe. Until, Lusitani had declared war on me. At the time I was still fighting another barbarian faction. Most of my European victories came from pre-war planning and knowing where the enemy was most vulnerable. Now that I'm still in France as Lusitani was in Spain, I had no info of their power nor their vulnerabilities to exploit. I tried to quickly rap up my war to get to dealing with Lusitani, but I had seen something that any general would crap their pants at. A mass mobilization of multiple 20 stack armies and a couple navies heading straight toward Greece. With this started retreating my most powerful armies back to the Greek homeland. My previous navy, who had won me may battles, was stationed near Rome to deal with pirates, and was now being moved back to the port cities of Greece. An army on sea had gotten into my view, but was quickly scared off by my navy, this is saved me trying to re-take Greece as my armies were still a long way away. The newly weakened offense started to have difficulties in mopping up the rest of the barbarians and to get to fighting/defending against a Lusitani European invasion. This gave them the time to fully mobilize their troops to get close to Egypt, one of my major trading partners and military allies, which their threat had never came to fruition as Rome, now an ally of mine, declared war on them blocking all access of Egypt. Rome did loose a city, but such a port city was never  a concerning loss. My armies are now in position to protect the Geek homeland, and to start an offensive. In their rush to take my capital down they completely forgot to defend their lands. From the intel I could gather, Rome and my other allies in the region took down most of their massive armies and navies in the sea, but what I still had to fight was no walk in the park. 

My slowest invasion had commenced. I succeeded in keeping my wars within only a couple of turns and another couple to mop up any issues arised from the war. This had become longer in the previous war as it came to a close I had to retreat most of my fighting force, but now without a massive push as I could've prior my 2 weakest armies (and a strong reserve) had to deal with a still formdiball foe. My armies now at their weakest had the support of some barbarian nations that I had left alive due to this war. With their support I still only able to take a bit of land compared to what I was capable before, this was a failure, a massive one at that. One of their armies had finally came back and my armies were split apart to try and take more land. My third army had finally finished it's retrofit to a more powerful army was not able to get to my army in time. The enemy army had finally engaged me, this was my most experienced weak armies but still filled with nearly no mid/top tier units. Auto-resolve had told me that I would quite horribly lose this army and the settlement I was protecting. I continued to engage in the battle ready to deal any damage to the army. In the battle I noticed that they didn't actually have any cavalry, and once I had engaged in the line battle I started charging into the enemy's back lines alowing me to come out as the victor, but still with a wound that would take a bit to heal. My now hurt army was close enough to re-engage the retreated Lusitani army, and my 3rd army was also in range which proved the end of the first Lusitani counter offensive. At this point they still haven't gotten the bulk of their might back to their homeland but they were near. I continued my campaign and took over another city with the assitance of another navy and my 2nd army. I now was ready to make a massive push into their territory cutting them straight in half untill I noticed their armies had arrived. Now Lusitani had made another, final, counter offensive which backfired and allowed me to take more land. I kept on pushing and took over all of Spain and Portugal. They now only have a city in Africa, the one they took from the Romans, and  I had mobilized my main navy which was currently attacking it. I engaged it in a battle and used my long range artillery to take many of the defenders down but not taking it for myself. They had also noticed that my armies are near by and retreated from their city in which Knossos assisted me in taking the city. That was it they had no more cities, and I could now deal with them and win my drawn out war. 

That is the point in which I got to. I hope to continue this campaign and [b] TAKE OVER THE WORLD [/b]. Allas, I hope you enjoyed this little campaign!

I do believe that this is one of the better Total War games. With an amazing modding community who make an already fun game even better! in this campaign I used 2x reasearch speed, Gods at War and the Para Bellum mods while playing Sparta.",1670377236,1670377236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI is ugly to look at for me.  To the point I feel a bit ill.

Honestly, those naval battle are one of the most off putting aspects.

It's a shame really.  The game takes place in one of the most fascinating time periods in european history.

The Best: Amphibious assault.
The Worst: Boring late game and Diplomacy AI[/h1]

This title is the right culmination of many things tried previously in the franchise. Again on one of the most interesting time periods, from the rise of the republic to the early Empire, with units a bit less ridiculous than in the original ROME, but still with some charm here and there. Game still fun even with the more realistic touches.

Is hard to compare it with the original title, because it became a cult classic and its faults are fun. Here we have less shirtless units, not that many meme strategies and the unit roosters feel better put together. Of course you always gonna be on advantage playing as any roman faction, but the flaws on them are well thought and add a good challenge.

Civil wars and rebellions are just part of daily live here, which is very historical, made in a manageable way but hard enough to make you suffer from time to time. Makes you humble to face units 2 tiers above yours after been beating lots of unorganised barbarians for so long.

Naval warfare is really fun all on itself. You have to really polish your boarding and ramming tactics. Unit skills timing are as important as with land units. At times they feel more like land battles on water, until you found yourself losing a unit because hull strength went down. It's so refreshing since you fighting in many dimensions.

Then we have the bonus that you can coordinate land-naval assaults on settlements, which is a magnificent addition. Maybe overpowered at times, because the AI rarely will coordinate them well. Although you need to limit yourself on the amount of exposure you want your expensive naval units to be. This is one feature that I would have liked to see perfected past ATTILA. Sadly it didn't.

The settlements industries and economical upgrade interface is simplified and ends being very effective. Is not as distracting like in EMPIRE, even if this last has more visual appeal, it eventually ends up being too overwhelming. ROME II does a great job on giving you enough information and interaction for those turns you handling too many dozens of settlements.

Some bad aspects in the game design are the unit portraits, they are now stylised and I think are a big misstep. In all previous titles you have portraits that were taken from the unit appearance on the tactical map, and is really helpful to know what they meant for. That's something gone here, low tier unit portraits aren't that much different to endgame ones, and the designs certainly have an effort on conveying some information but I think they failed on that. You have to spend more time reading names and descriptions.

Graphically the game stands up very well. In EMPIRE we had a big jump on quality but the settlements and siege looked horrible, here we have very beautifully made and detailed cities and towns. You don't feel repeating the same siege over and over that much, and that's an amazing job, because apart from making this aspect look good, they did it in a way that enriches gameplay.

Late game with any of the main factions is as usual, very heavy on management and boring on battles, but that's not a particular flaw of this game only but something that happens in most Grand Strategy/4X games. It does not help at all when you playing as Rome, so you certainly have to step aside and grab some barbarian, greek or eastern factions to get a different POV.

EDIT:
As a last addition, to try play the game leveraging heavy on diplomacy can be a waste of time and cause of many headaches. Is not rare factions to never accept peace, even if you left them without any settlement and are just a random general alone with 90% attrition. This happens quite often and may limit the terms on how you engage in war, because most the times you gotta have to fight a faction further than expected.

Overall is an amazing game that has aged well, with the right balance of seriousness and fun, very mature game design and enough stuff to do to keep you hooked. Not a history class but certainly lots of good fun.",1666905879,1668331940,True,10,1,0.612785637378692627,0,True,False,False

This is my favorite Total War game, for its grand map, combined features and eventual polish. Campaign map plays well, battles are excellent, visually still fantastic and as always the sound design team does an amazing job.

Features added which stand out to its predecessors. Legion/Army mechanics. In addition to stances, armes themsevesl can level up and gain passives and special abilites that influence it both on Map and in combat with its own skill tree. Excellent feature to truely make that extra connection.  
Combined water and land battles. Your ships can land on the shore and join the fight. Artillary can attack cities or armies near the coast. It doesn't seem like a huge thing until you actually do it.
Revamped Poltics and family trees. A much more details (possibly too much so for some peoples preferences) of many actions to boost your family/factions pressence and control of the faction and outside and internal threats of civil war. Fun and interesting options to use diplomacy, espinoge and subterfuge in teh family and politic tree screen. You can marry, divorece, adopt, groom, educate, party, praise, scorn, bribe, assasinate and much more. 
Massive battles and armies. Now you can have reinforcing armies, join the battle in addition too instead of reinforcements. Specically, you have 2 armies? 40 units will be on the battle at once instead of the 20 and trickle in reinformcents one at a time. Making huge forces and a much deeper strategy of army building and support army building. 

The DLC much of it is very worthwhile, base game is still my favorite and I still randomly pull up this game and plow into in over a weekend and expect to put at least a couple hundred more hours into it.

The good.

• The game is stable and optimized.

• You have some mods to enhance the game.

The bad.

• Agents, too powerful and unbalancing. You can win wars with a fraction of the armies realistically needed if you win before the agent contest. Solution = No Agents mod

• Provincial system. It's a silly transposition of a late imperial political organization. Makes no sense at all when tribes and minor factions are still alive, and harms some factions and others not. Solution = Sara's Single-Region Provinces

• Unprotected settlements. In a time of war and uncertainty is impossible to think that settlements have no walls. Please think about Numantia, sixteen months to surrender the city and in game has no walls, this is simply unbearable. Solution = Sara's Single-Region Provinces

• Too much money. You can expand your economy and simply crush your foes spamming army after army, if they have ports worst still, because the high cost of navies means that you will gain soon the mastery of seas. Also you can have your armies in permanent campaign without any penalty. Solution = Supply Lines & Logistics

• Imperium system. Each level of Imperium (power) have a limit for armies and agents recruitable. This is a silly and cheap way (not very effective) to limit the AI spamming generals while trying to ease the snowball effect late game when the player is too powerful and nothing can stop him. Solution = Bison's Immersive Army Limit / Sara's Single-Region Provinces / Community Patch For Rome II

• Late game boring. When attained certain level of development the AI becomes rapidly powerless, you may add some chili to spice things up. The bigger your empire, the bigger the hate from other factions. Solution = Realm Divide: ROME II Edition

• Time goes too fast. Your generals die of old before achieving any glorious status, your armies need one or two years to sail from Egypt to Crete. Solution = 12 Turns Per Year

• Battles are too fast and AI is silly. There is not much to do in order to help the AI to fight better, but some improvement can be done. Solution = Rome Total War Classic Combat / Ancient Combat

• General Menu and Battle music is strident. Solution = Alexander Music / Aeterna Troy Music Pack

• You miss some refinements from Attila or Warhammer. Solution = Community Patch For Rome II / Dresden Sack, Liberation And Diplomatic Options Mod

• The Roman are tomato red. Yes, that's a concern, but you have a plethora of reskins and even custom units to fill the gap, also graphical improvements to battles, settlements or UI. Unlike the music part I will not recommend anything specific.

Despite all the ""bad"" I pointed Rome 2 is a recommendable game for everyone who loves antiquity and wargames. With mods you can improve the experience but don't expect perfection. If you feel too lazy to tinker with your (mod) load order you can try an overhaul like Para Bellum or Divide et Impera.

So hard to break their morale and not only that but when you make your units fight against any AI unit, your unit will always lose. Basically for every manual battles, you have to always skirmish your enemy units using your missile units until they are no more. Sucks that you cannot win any battles that easily. And the cavalry charge (at least on player's perspective) is shit. I charged into the enemy unit's rear and they barely lost any units. So I have to rinse and repeat. But by doing it, my cavalry units are the ones that are slowly being reduced.

I would want to love this game because unlike Medieval 2 where the diplomacy is shit, the diplomacy in this one is pretty good. But the combat just sucks. 

Maybe I am just a noob but I can handle the likes of Shogun 2 and Medieval 2's battles just fine even in hardest difficulty. It's just, in the case of Shogun 2, it has so many bugs like enemy bow ships can fire flaming arrows during the rain and they keep on getting more and more fullstack of army each time. And in Medieval 2, the diplomacy is shit (everyone hates you).

Sigh. How I wish that CA would have that almost perfect game where its battles are fair wherein the AI are not too overpowered, little to no bugs like in Shogun 2, and diplomacy isn't crappy like in Medieval 2.

I've always loved the gameplay in Total War. The mix of grand strategy and real-time battles has always appealed to the child in me - pretending to be an ancient general or warlord is great fun - and beating back a faction which betrayed your diplomatic agreements to take advantage of your weak position is satisfying. There are a few bugs in this game which are slightly frustrating but far from game-breaking. The music isn't as iconic as in the original Rome: Total War, in my opinion, but all in all, the musical and visual package is lovely here. 

The biggest problem I have with this game is its developer, Creative Assembly. There are so many DLCs for this game, many or all of which arguably should have been part of the main game itself. Separating the Greek States out as DLC, for example - ridiculous, I think. That's the reason why I only recommend buying this or any of its DLC with a heavy discount - I think you can pay less than $2 each for most of its DLC packs when on sale.",1664241375,1664241375,True,9,0,0.644959509372711182,0,True,False,False

By far the greatest disappointment ever released by the Creative Assembly. This game was over-hyped in the weeks and months leading up to release, and the final product was months away from being ready for release. Adding insult to injury, the moneymakers at SEGA/CA have decided to release add-on packs for this incomplete game so that you can pay more money for the content that should have been there in the first place.

The shortcomings of this game are too numerous to mention, but the worst of it is the lie. CA hyped a game that they simply failed to deliver.

Pikes
Skins vs Shirts
Rebellions when you don't couple with your second cousin

so like imagine a  new total war with a relation and politics  like Three Kingdom plus a trade system  like Troy together in one game, where we can interact with multiple resources  would be a perfect combo.",1663124475,1663124475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------------------------
Let me start by saying I am a dedicated fan of the Total War series. My personal favorite being Empire Total War. I purchased this game (Rome II) and spent a whopping 65.00 on this game, only to get about 3 hours into it and the campaign camera has frozen. If you google this issue with the keyboard camera controls not working on Rome II, you will see a large amount of fans displeased by the same issue I have run into. In order to fix the issue I have to download a program and edit the save file (sounds easy right?) and then load my save. I had to spend another 20.00 on WinZip to extract the program to fix an obviously common bug that has clearly not been resolved by this company. If I spent 5.00 on this game I could see that Im overreacting, however I did not spend 5.00, I spent 65.00 on a game that I only played for 3 hours before it was rendered useless. At this very moment I am still trying to get it fixed. Terrible programming!!! Shame on you for releasing this with as many bugs as this game has.

Germanic tribes are actually fun to play as. Slow start but once the war parties are ready, nothing can stop the Barbarian Horde.

10/10 would unite tribes again

Most of the mechanics are the same as in the other Total War games except this time there is a limit on building/producing single units instead you have a fix set of armies and you cannot separate units from your army.

The town mechanics also work differently compared to its predecessor and it isn't always clear what the direct benefits are of a building and/or how to manage them. Overall though still highly enjoyable game.

Because every game after this has been total Fantasy.   Warhammer.   People like warhammer.   I refuse to buy their games however if i buy a warhammer game its not from these guys.  

This game is in far better shape then its rocky start.   And the woke stuff has died down.  The game is very modifiable and fun with some mods in the steam community that you can easily find and install.   Up to you if you wanna buy this game or not i sill like it over all.

(original review.)
I say in short what i dislike about this game.    IF you have this game already find a way to play the game before all the new constant patching.   With steam making everything stay up today by requirement this is harder then it sounds.    Like all Old total wars games you will need to manually patch things.    

 IF you find a way to get ROME before they did their SCUM DLC addon bonus packs 5 years later...... on a already old game to make a quick buck then pull SJW stuff in the same year you should just say Good bye to CA games in general.    IT was a good ride but i'm out of here Atila was the last game I bought from them and even if they made a Rome 3 or new game and it rocked I don't support SCUMMY practices  and paying a ton of money for things that should be in the game already.   Also I'm not interested in future changing the games i buy to support political views later on No matter what the view is unless its historically accurate it does not BELONG!      History games are men't to be historical not fantasy I will buy a fantasy game if i want to play fantasy and i already got some thanks.",1540294328,1662730960,False,25,0,0.532886624336242676,0,True,False,False

It's far more historically accurate than the first one, and it has a lot more interesting mechanics, with differing families in factions who will vie for power and do everything they can to get the most influence, a lot of interesting skill trees. The graphics are quite impressive even for today, and there are some mods that can help in that area even more. The battles are still a lot of fun, and seem to be a bit harder when they're more even, the enemy AI even in vanilla seems to field better armies overall, and a better mix of units. 

Overall if you like the first one, you'll like this even more, it's much more in depth and detailed, and feels like it's even more authentic to this period than the original.  They also make the AI better in many ways, for example, in vanilla rome, the enemy AI never reacts quickly enough, if at all sometimes if you start attacking some of their cities while they have armies pushing elsewhere. With some of the mods they make it so that the AI does respond quickly, if not immediately and they move to protect their unprotected cities quickly, so it adds a lot more dynamic realism to it in that manner I do highly recommend using some of the mods after you play vanilla a bit, some make the game a bit more difficult and purposely slower, while expanding It's also hard to expand very quickly, because of public order issues, unless you're playing as Rome.  Some of the mods also do a tremendous job adding a lot of new historical units that look amazing.

Rome2 had a rocky start, I marathoned a 24 hour playthru on launch day, didnt touch it again at all till patch 19 and 20. The game had changed immensely by that time. So much variety, replayability, content and polish.

Not the most complex of TW games in terms of politics and management, but still a solid challenge on the harder difficulties. Easy to learn and understand, but difficult to master(on harder difficulties). In terms of combat it is very similar to previous TW games, nothing very groundbreaking there. If your choice is between Rome I and II, choose II, in this case newer is better. My favourite aspect is the all the campaigns one can play, though DLCs, they are big enough to be worth the price. And you can of course choose not play as Rome, but why would anyone do that?

I found it easier to learn than TW: Warhammer I/II but I'm guessing that's because I'm more familiar with Roman history (via school and movies), than with Warhammer's lore/races.

Each unit type behaves in a way that is appropriate with Antiquity: The calvary specifically, perfectly embodies the limitations of the time. However, some of the heavy eastern Cataphracts are a chilling prelude of what is to come after the next 500 years of warfare. Ranged units also play an important role. Their missiles are satisfying to track into targets with breathtaking sound design; it's also very immersive how arrows or javelins will stick into armor and shields. However, at its core, Rome II is an infantry focused game. Legionaries, Greek Hoplites, and Macedonian Phalanxs dominate the battlefield with ruthless efficiency, and rightfully so. Faction diversity is another major strength of this game. Having the campaign map stretch across most of the known world, at that time, is a huge plus. There are definitely certain faction blueprints: Roman, Barbarian, Greek, and eastern. Although, there is some overlap within these major groups, each culture has their own distinct feel and play style. Multiplayer battles specifically, have some of the best sieges in the Total War series. Field battles also offer a distinct contrast, as certain more skirmish heavy playstyles become accessible to the player. If I had any complaints about the game it would have to be the subpar blood and gore DLC. This add on will cost you a few dollars and the difference is very minimal. Unique beheading animations are uncommon and the blood itself looks very fake when splattered on models or the ground. Overall, Rome II Total War is an awesome game and 100% still worth the money in 2022.

The good:
- Really huge campaign map
- Lots of factions
- Internal politics
- House management
- Sea battles (Ramming speed!)
- Sea to shore invasions

The bad:
- Soundtrack is bit generic, not even close to Rome 1 OST
- Frame rate drop on main map, when raining or snowing.
- House management window is too small for big familia.
- Fonts are sometimes not really clear, it's hard to tell of something is with plus or minus.

The base game has more than enough content and I enjoy the managment of cities even if it seems that every faction has similar base buildings. HUGE MAP. honestly there are a lot of pros to discuss but its really cons that make disicions:

The ship battles are kinda simple but greek fire is awsome.  The barbarians often come off very similar in the northern regions and their pantheons tend to just favor one diety.  Rome will never exept peace even after they have no power.  the auto resolve is not aqqurate.

Let your mind pickle at the thought that on release, which was 2013, almost a decade ago, Rome 2, which was hyped for years, was unfinished, broken, unpolished, and still sold to the masses. Alongside locking behind Sparta and Greece a purdy paywall.

Games like Half Life 2 and Rome 1 were completely reworked and built from the ground up after getting about 75% of the way through the game. Now a robot marketing investor who I'm pretty sure are all reptillians sent from hell would think; ""Waste of time! They should've continued work and finished their game!"" Because that same disconnected emotionless unempathetic robot would only be thinking of the profits they would make on release, and not the actual quality of the game. The reason Rome 1 was so good is because even though they were so close to completion, it still wasn't good enough and those developing it KNEW it wasn't going to be good enough, and so they wiped everything, kept the good parts and started again. And so Rome 1 came out and changed gaming forever, and is still very very fun IMO. I have about 150 hours on Rome, and only about 70 on Rome 2. Why?

Because Rome 2 wasn't rebuilt from scratch or delayed. It was forcibly released to please reptillian investors (Who I believe should either go submit to Jesus or go kill themselves) And knowingly was unfinished and in a terrible state. Hilariously, and unsurprisingly, CA did this a couple years before with Empire, and have done it with plenty of other new releases. To add, most of CA's staff is not the original team who made Rome, and much of the team have left, which I can only assume is because of passionless leadership and incompetent management. F3cking investors. Always want their money.

Rome 2, itself, after years of passionless and mind boggling ""work"" has actual managed to be a decent enough of an experience. But there is a serious lack of soul in comparison to Rome 1, and many things are just never going to be as good or as streamlined as Rome 1. Some improvements are quite obviously the engine, which is better suited to modern hardware, the graphics, which look real purdy, the animations and collisions are alright, not better then Rome 1 but not worse, the actual combat itself doesn't feel that different from Rome 1 or Med 2. The DLC and whoever decided to make it the way they did should definitely go hang themselves, I have no respect for over exploitation of middle class by uber rich investors, please go kill yourselves. 

Outside of my hate for the marketing team r@ping CA currently the game is enjoyable, plenty of mods (THANK GOD FOR MODS) that save the game, because of developers not being able to see what made Rome 1 so good and only what ever their higher ups demand, (after all the team that made Rome 2 HAD NOTHING TO DO with Rome 1 so its a miracle it is somewhat decent) There are plenty of shortfalls with game design decisions like with limited armies, the god AWFUL political system that is just annoying and boring to use, it feels shallow, the building system is good, so overall, a nice 6.9/10",1658351710,1658351740,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

For those who didn't played it is a good, epic strategy. For those who played - it is a strange (not to say ugly) bastard of Rome and Warcraft.
Endless bugs, absence of the family tree, taking cities without siege weapons, buttons that magically replenish energy, drunken brawl instead of clever tactics - there's much said about all of this, no need to repeat. All this rage is not about bugs, it's about game mechanics, that became RTS in a bad meaning of the term.
Particular word about music - it is... wait, is there music already? I'm don't remember. I remember Jeff van Duke's soundtrack in Rome till now, but soundtrack in Rome II - it's a pitiful attempt to depict something epic.
Little secret - Rome II Emperor Edition - it is, in fact, final release of the game. First release was alpha, that was released without disclaimer that it is an early access. But whatever, the game is a fail. 6/10, and only for merits of the previous games (excluding Empire, that was also fail). 
Summary - I was foolish enough to preorder this. In future, I'll buy CA products on 80% sale... maybe.
P.S. Wait... CA is developing Alien Isolation? Well, gentlemen, it's the end of the Total War series.
P.P.S. After some time, I decided to give this game another chance. 10 years after release. And, after 10 hours or so, it crashes and still crashed after reload. This game is a misery.",1411727578,1658237616,False,7,0,0.482304602861404419,0,True,False,False

One example is when you kill the enemy general during a battle on your territory and nearly destroy its army. Fast forward one turn and the army somehow has a new general with its accompanying unit of top tier elite units, fully replenished, even though they are deep behind enemy lines.

The Cons:
Rome 2 is a game which promised much, and didn't fully deliver on many promises. I remember the state it launched in, and that state is the reason I no longer pre-order games. I suspect this game's development had staffing issue; it was clear that the developers couldn't quite get this game off the ground, possibly due to difficulties translating the Warscape engine to an era which relies on big blocks of organized units to win the day. 

Many issues such as formations blobbing into each other, lack of proper collision, and over-reliance on matched animation fighting were present in Shogun 2 as well. But samurai breaking off to fight duels felt *good* somehow, and the units' Japanese dialogue, the screams and shouts and noises of units colliding, the artstyle and music all helped one overlook such problems. 

Rome 2, by comparison, felt shabby. Units spoke English across the board; Romans had their traditional Hollywood British accents, as did the Greeks, and ""Barbarian"" factions oft sounded like idiots, with such sage quotes as ""RRRAAAAAH."" The voicelines of the individual units are usually pretty silly, and the noise of units colliding is surprisingly lowkey. 

The music is a sore spot for many, though over time I've grown to appreciate Richard Beddow's soundtracks. There was a sort of ""bait and switch"" that happened amidst the game's marketing and launch - in promo trailers, Creative Assembly used Jeff van Dyck. In-game, we got Richard Beddow. Comparing the two composers, I think Creative Assembly wanted music that better fades into the background, whereas Jeff van Dyck's music has always been heavy hitting and head banging good stuff. Though I don't mind Beddow's OST, I do think the game's audio mixing somehow manages to throw the music further back than it should be. I often play with master volume low, music cranked up, and cranked up in the Windows volume mixer to get a better overall audio balance. 

The UI tried to do some era-matching by making unit cards that look like they come right off the side of ancient vases. Neat idea, but I had trouble telling units apart mid battle, and ultimately just found the whole thing unappealing. There are some that love this design still, and that's cool - it's just a personal taste thing. 

There are some nuisances on the campaign map. AI armies frequently get stuck in places. The diplomacy is barebones and the Campaign AI (CAI) is either completely passive or murder hobo'ing across the Universe. Desert attrition is sort of silly - you're supposed to stick to roads in desert regions to avoid taking massive attrition damage, but the algorithm that determines how you move when you click a destination will frequently route you offroad. The result is doing tiny clicks to move forward a centimetre, saving the game, then moving again, and reloading if you go offroad. 

There was clearly some struggling getting units to even run correctly in a formation. Even today, units sort of rubber band back and forth as they run so they don't phase into each other. It just doesn't look good, and it breaks immersion. 

The matched battle animations are straight up bad; I'm not sure if I've ever seen worse. It is clearly two mocapped dudes pretending to fight each other, *slowly.* They do not even aim at each other for certain swings. Ultimately, fights look great a distance, and really funky when you get up close and pay attention. 

Naval battles are still buggy today. They are not as bad as they used to be. When the game released, I remember a naval battle in which my ship and an enemy ship conjoined with each other, floated up and into the air, then slid off the map together. Occasionally you will still see some weird stuff like this (in fact just a week ago I recorded a ship slowly doing circles on a beach) but mostly it is just hard to get ships to do what you want them to do consistently, making important naval fights very frustrating at times. 

The DLC scheme is...meh. Locking Sparta off behind pre-orders was a mistake and the fandom let CA know it. Modders implemented factions for the game, then CA released DLC which made inferior versions of these factions with less units, which blocked these mods from working unless you paid CA again. DLC in Rome II locks content instead of adding content, which is unfortunately the spirit of many games these days - later CA games do a much better job with DLC, but this one doesn't. 
Blood DLC is also an instant thumbs down from me due to sheer dumbness. I don't want to hear ratings arguments (some suggest Blood was made DLC to dodge an M rating), because FreeLC would've worked were that the case. 


The Better:
Rome 2 is better than it used to be. The devs took some more time to polish the game and re-released it with Emperor's Edition, thus clearing out their negative review history and updating the game to what it should've been at launch. Mostly. 

The AI IS better behaved, animations DO work better, battles make sense and function better overall. This is what makes the game worth a buy on a steep sale. 

With DLC, there are lots of factions to choose from, some different campaign scenarios you can play which may or may not be worth it, really depends on how much you are interested in those specific time periods. 

There is a ton of unit variation in this game: pikes, hoplite phalanxes, sword units, spear units, various ranged units, siege equipment, basically everything you would expect is here. Pikes feel proper powerful from the front and Romans just grind things down into dust over time. 

Missile fire looks great, with arrows spinning and bouncing off shields. Artillery looks and sounds great as the shots land. 

Units will react to missile fire by raising their shields in unison. It looks a little odd when they do this as there isn't much of a transition animation and they all just do it at once, but seeing those shields all raised up to block the oncoming missiles looks awesome. Pike formations also look pretty damned cool. 

Ultimately the gameplay with Emperor Edition feels good. It's still got that clicky, satisfying, *something* that Total War has always had, and it is possible to sink many hours into a campaign, catching the well known ""one-more-turn-itis"" which keeps you from going to bed on time. 


Modding:
This is separate from the rest of the review because the game deserves credit for having decent mod support, but doesn't necessarily deserve credit from modders' efforts to make the game even better. 

There is a longstanding, large, experienced modding community for Rome 2, with massive overhauls and tweaks being offered in the Steam Workshop and on the TWC forums. You can tweak almost anything. 

Personally, I use Divide et Impera overhaul mod which adds many new units and mechanics to the campaign, along with many graphical tweaks, such as more dust, smaller arrow trails. I also use Rome I music, and some smaller campaign tweaks, such as one which removes desert attrition. 

Thus, my game is like a totally different game, using Rome 2's solid bones to create a much better experience overall. And that is the Rome 2 I have sunk nearly two thousand hours into. I encourage any player who buys this to try some campaign and see how you like it, then head to the workshop and change what you dislike.",1657490489,1657490489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

--- OLD REVIEW BELOW ---
I am a HUGE FAN of the total war series and a big history nut. 
This game was, is, and will be the biggest disappointment i have ever had.

Let me just start and say that the game can be pretty fun at times and has its pros, however they are greatly overshadowed by all of the negatives.

One word: STREAMLINING

This is probably the simplest total war game yet, and it really takes away from the experience.
Now this could be a positive if you are new to these games, but for hardcore fans this is a slap in the face. 
All of the factions are divided into 3 types (Hellenic, Barbarian and Rome rip offs) ALL OF THEM FEEL THE SAME! 
The Macedonians feel like the Seleucids
The Iceni feel like the Arverni
Egypt feels like Carthage.

and on and on AND ON

The only difference between all of the factions is different named units with slightly different skins.
Or some crazy exotic unit like fully armored war elephants that can rip army's to shreds.

To add on to that
WALLET RAPE
There is already two full dlc campaigns and a unit pack dlc
all incredibly over priced and worthless. 
But don't worry, there are no over powered units in the dlc's
want to know why?
BECAUSE ALL OF THE FACTIONS FEEL THE SAME!
The dlc units are  just re-skined units with different names and a funny accent.



If you enjoyed the innovative and Amazingly addictive multiplayer of shogun 2 (in my opinion it was a lot of fun, disagree if you want.) 

If you liked the RPG mechanics of your online general in Shogun 2
If you had fun playing with clan mates in a game with full clan support in shogun 2.
If you had fun Playing With your own personalized army holding the flag you designed in shogun 2.

Play shogun 2

The multiplayer in Rome 2?
Its bad
Its terrible
ITS ABSOULUTLY TRAGIC.
Bare Bones and Pointless.
Doesn't even include the fun free for all battles that Rome one had.


I could go on and on for a lot longer then you are probably willing to read, so i will just let you make a decision.
If you are a super hard core fan, get it on a super sale for as cheap as it will get
but just be absolutely sure you want this game before you waste you money.

Pro: 
- For me best overall TW game since MTW2 Kingdoms.
- Stable. No crashes. 0 crashes after epic fights.
- Lots of mods

Con: 
- Core combat issues: You can make formations move in sync as you like but you are unable to place units most of the time properly without the shadow unit formation jumping around so the annoyance starts at deployment stage.  Also if you did manage to get units to seemingly place correctly they may still end up facing away from enemy from time to time or just plain standing there sideways with their flank towards the enemy. Just what?  Can i ignore this and just have your units yolo around on the field? No because
- Units get stuck on battlefield or ignore orders resulting it situations where units just aren't there were they are supposed to be. So you either meticulously spend time doing formations and pause constantly or you ignore the individual units and end up doing worse than you expected because of this and it bothers you. You simply get worse results than autoresolve sometimes and when that happens it's every single time because you just don't get your units to be where they are supposed to be. Small things yeah but if you do it enough times...  
- TW games at best have flowing game play with just a few keys and mouse. Flowing game play = many battles = lots of fun. Getting these two to work together properly here just doesn't work. Why am i able to play MTW2 or RTW so easily yet this one just devolves into cursing sooner or later when i make complex moves? Unit placement in MTW2 isn't easy either sometimes, especially up in rugged terrain but that one still works. Here the end results are surreal most of the time. Showing your back to enemy or just whatever... 
- All the above in the end sums up so that especially big fights are a major chore and annoyance. In MTW2 you do a big fight and it's over in somewhat relative speed and you move on. Here you wrestle against the weird issues and try to move on.  None of the added UX features that have been added here help you get that streamlined experience you had before when you didn't have so many options. Small annoyances pile up. And for that in the end this game narrowly falls under the 'not recommended' flag. I did complete a grand campaign as rome, conquered the world but i will definitely not want to do that anymore. The mods i tried did not help the core issues with how fights flow from user interface point of view and thus i see no other option than to set this to a 'No don't buy this' 

Note here that i don't trash anything else here really. This game IS a worthy successor to RTW but i think they have changed some things so that i don't want to accept it as a long term game to play.  I am even today completely happy with MTW2 simple grouping controls and it allows me to play out just the simple or complex tactics i want. Here i no longer even want to try anything too complex as it will be either lots of cursing or just fail. Which brings us to
- Waypoints - How did they mess this up? Incredibly unreliable. I never do more than 1, max 2 waypoints for a cav unit for example. Always fails somehow. Units stopping. Ending up somewhere else. Some singular enemy soldier stopping the whole thing in it's tracks etc.",1657184760,1657185803,False,5,1,0.53776782751083374,0,True,False,False

in the original game, units occupied space and when two or more melee units collided, the units pressed against each other and didn't pass through. Melee spear units in front of archers, with cavalry on the wings was the classic formation used by Alexander the Great through the Roman Empire. In this game, I can charge cavalry right through an infantry formation and attack the skirmishers behind, and skirmishers can wipe out heavy infantry because their weapons are much more accurate and dangerous than in the original game. 

These seem like engine problems due to the game using the same engine as Empire, where gunpowder units were supreme. Also, because of the games increased complexity, modding is more difficult, and so there is less additional content for the game--unless you count being sold each scenario and faction microtransactionally. total War was the best game franchise in the word from 2004 to 2009, but has steadily gone down in gameplay quality while going up in production value, and its a damn shame.",1656343324,1656343324,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DEI drastically changes the game play from vanilla and makes the AI function 100x better and includes more diversity of nations, units, scripted events, and replay value. DEI is also still supported by the modders as the most recent big update was a couple of months ago.

The game mostly focuses around the Roman Empire but you can play as most of the major factions during that era as well such as the Carthaginians, the Persians, Egypt, Germanic Tribes, Seleucids, and the Greek states (although you'll have to buy the Greek States DLC for any other faction besides Athens, noticeably Sparta). It's great fun playing the Campaign and watching as history is recreated by your hands or just the factions vying for supremacy which leads to varying Campaigns as sometimes even the major factions get snuffed out from the underdogs.

The game also has good mod support for when you get tired of vanilla or just want to tweak the visuals. Some of the more notable ones being Divide et Imperia, which completely changes the game as you know it while also adding in a lot of new content, and New World, which adds more mythological factions such as the Amazonians, Atlanteans, Troy, and many more.

Overall I'd rate it a 8/10. Only reason it's not a 10 is because sometimes the movement for the units can get buggy which is frustrating and takes away from the immersion, especially in naval battles.

Following the immensely popular Shogun 2, Rome 2 made many changes to the Total War formula, including a generals based recruiting system (no standing armies without a general and the general recruits new units instead of cities), the most advanced economic system yet, and the most expansive family management mechanics to date (as of 2013). All these and more paired well with the tried and true Total War formula to bring the most satisfying and immersive game of the series.

There’s a big debate between fans of whether or not these changes were good, but I think they are. I don’t mind tying armies to generals. The complexity if the economic systems may take more than one playthrough to master, but it enables to player to make strategic decisions about planning their economy. A grand design that balances Industry, agriculture, culture, trade, religion, and sanitation is fun and satisfying in a way that no other Total War has been able to really nail. 

The combat is detailed and fun. There is less of an emphasis on playing the battles, which I enjoy. The auto-resolve is fair and reliable. When I am playing Total War Warhammer 2 I sometimes feel like I need to play every battle and that can be both good and bad, but Rome 2 offers a more relaxed playthrough for those not interested in fighting tons of battles.  
 
The unit variety is great, unmatched in Total War games with the exception of the Warhammer games because they obviously have many different races and technology levels to work with. Each ethnicity and culture has its own unique feel. Naked celtic warriors, Dog handlers, War Elephants, Anti-Cavalry Camel spearmen, Parthian horse archers, Sobek cultists, Phalanx, and many many more fun and distinct units to use in battle! 

The game has 6 distinct DLC expansions. They add new campaigns with unique mechanics, maps, and other features that I find to be lacking in the DLCs of the Warhammers, which for the most part just add new playable factions. DEI Mod is incredibly popular with those who want to kick the game up a notch. 

I would absolutely recommend Total War Rome 2 as a great starting place for the Total War Series as well as a great game for fans of the series to pick up.

Oh yeah, because I waited years before buying and paying full price for it and because I waited for a super-low sale where I wouldn't if I did not like the game anyway. Wow, I still don't like it and am pissed I actually paid money for this. I shoulda listened to aaaaalllllllllllll those reviewers reviews instead of trusting TOTAL WAR game lineage.

This game is a sad continuation of the Total War series. From what I saw in videos of the ""creators"", or people in charge of the game, they had changed a lot of the mechanics and other things that worked well in the previous games. On top of that they added unnecessary mechanics like the Senate/Political management system. This is TOTAL WAR, not a sim/resource management system game. This is supposed to be a game where you can progress due to your battlefield prowess not whether or not you can ""bribe"" Senators.

The combat AI is wonky at best. Some times I have 3 or 4 full units fighting one unit and that one unit is not only fighting and holding their ground, but depleting my 3 or 4 units, even if a unit is attacking them from behind. It seems the enemy AI's one unit can not only hold my many of my units but can kill them until the rest of their buddies show up. What's even more funny is that broken and routed units will now run back and attack my units in the rear, this after they've had their asses handed to them and have routed half way across the map. You try to use and fight according to ""battlefield"" tactics but these tactics just don't work in Total War anymore.

What killed me was when I took a HUGE army to a town or city, destroyed its garrison and army and then said defeated army runs away and on the next turn it has replenished its troops and added several more units, much more than what I have. I just decimated them and they suddenly have MORE troops than I do. I call BS.

Should I talk about Squalor? It's the stupidest concept. I try to upgrade my cities but I spend more time spending money on getting rid of the Squalor areas that pop up in your cities.

It's impossible to keep your population discontent down and your bread up. Especially when most of the upgrades for your areas don't include positives for these MOST IMPORTANT features like population content and bread.

The bullshit Senate management and civil war possibilities. This was the things that totally made me stop playing the game and write this review and will soon delete the game from my hard-drive because it is taking up space in my game hard-drive. This is actually the first time I will delete a Total War game in the middle of playing it and I've owned and played all of the major ones since the first Shogun decades ago. Without even waiting for the Senate to tell me to attack Carthage, I swept down the Italian peninsula and started attacking and taking Carthage territories. This and the reason that historically what was done. I'm ahead of the strategic ""game"". Nonetheless, I took over Italy, Sicily, the two big island west of Italy and took Carthage(city) and Libya and was heading west to finish off Carthage(enemy) when suddenly the Senate decided to go to civil and half my areas and armies changed hands over to the ""opposing"" Senate. I had a HUGE army heading west across Africa and boom that army belonged to the AI. What's funny is that I went back to play the Iceni and was expecting NOT have the same ""Roman"" political system, but it has the SAME POLITICAL SYSTEM. How does the Iceni have the same political system as the Romans? I was like oh boy, they just copied and pasted the same EVERYTHING onto every other culture. Lazy game developing.

I've played games where the developers make the game ""harder"" and say that benefits the game to be more playable. No. You're just amping the hardness just to make it harder cause it's a shit game to begin with. I've played many games and the shit games follow this format. Make the game ""harder"" because it lacks content and gameplay. 

I'll leave you with something I saw on an old 80s TV show. There was a boy character that met a game arcade owner and the game arcade owner told him the secret of his monetary success. He told the boy that he sets the game to very hard and that ""there is no level 10"" therefore kids keep dropping quarters trying to ""reach level 10"", which doesn't exist. Just like these games that people ruin or create that don't have a ""level 10"" but they call it ""hard gameplay"" because there literally is no content after a certain point.

I'm an old-schooler from the 80s and I'm not buying anymore Total War games but I WILL BUY games from new indie developers that won't follow bullshit formats or concepts or ""the message"" narrative. My money will speak and I will keep in my pocket until I find something worthy of my money. Plenty of games out there to play and I can always replay all my old games which were well made to begin with, unlike this one.

I don't think there's another game I've spent so long in except for maybe Skyrim. Rome 2 is to me what Rome 1 is to a lot of people. I have some incredibly fond memories playing this game, and it's one of a precious few that I always come back to. It's just new enough that it doesn't feel painfully dated, and just old enough that it doesn't feel frustratingly dumbed down. To me, this game represents the golden age (or pax romana) of Total War games. It has that *chef's kiss* special something that I have found almost nowhere else. If you enjoy ancient Rome (or ancient civilizations in general), this game is for you. If you enjoy real time battle simulators, this game is for you. If you enjoy turn-based strategy, this game is probably for you (more gritty and in-depth than Civilization in many ways, but not as complex as Imperator: Rome -- do with that what you will). The DLCs are also a lot of fun and I've spent a lot of time with them (some are admittedly better than others). Sorry I'm not good at writing reviews for games I like this much, but this is an S class one for me for sure. I can't promise you'll like it as much as I do, but I hope you do.

The battlefield AI is clunky at times -- missile troops refusing to fire, awkward troop movements -- and the enemy AI is pretty weak and easy to trick. The political system is also greatly lacking, and much of it has little useful function. The game lacks motivation beyond ""take over everything"", and can quickly become stale. But overall, the setting is great; and if you can overlook the fact the your troops have arranged themselves into a ginormous blob with one awkward thin tail in formation, then the game looks beautiful.

If you are looking for a fun strategy game of this type, I would highly suggest the sequel to this game ""Attila"". The setting and general feel is similar, and the game is far more polished.

Wait and buy the game and the DLC on a sale, and you will get great bang for you buck, and Hours and Hours of enjoyable game play. Recommend

Addendum: The newest updates, while somewhat controversial, have breathed new life into the game.  I still believe that the game is overpriced at full value, but given how often sales occur, pick it up on sale and you wont be disappointed. Recommend

Second Addendum:  As much as I love and have enjoyed this game, I can no longer recommend it.  It is unjustifiable that this game is still 60 dollars and that the DLC is still full price.  As a complete package, Rome II is a fabulous game that I have sunk endless hours into.  But, it is insane that the price has never dropped and that their is SO MUCH DLC.

Graphics are just superb.
Needs some overhaul mods like DeI (Divide et impera) or Radious, then the game has a better feel.
The unit expansions make it better, because Italian factions (besides Rome), arabian factions, have an otherwise limited unit roster.


Cons:

I feel like it would be cool,  if in late game, one faction wasn't owning like an entire country (i.e one faction ruling over Germania). This way, you'd have to fight a number of factions when coming into a new area. 

I.E if I were to invade Africa late game, I'd want to fight [i] all [/i] the African factions and not just one ruling over the entire place.

The best part of Total War games has always been the historically accurate uniforms, units, banners, etc.  It's a real detriment that Creative Assembly decided to do some bullshit warhammer thing for 8 years.  With a fictional setting there is no chance to have historically accurate anything.  I honestly do not understand why CA would even agree to make a game that could never be its best just from the get-go.  

THE GOOD:
This game has all the units, factions, historical accuracy, bla bla, everything we want from Total War.  

This game has multiple missions with varying units, strategies, etc.  

Giant game board!  Not as big as Empire of course.  Empire was truly the best Total War game ever and I wish CA would attempt to meet/beat that honor.  


THE BAD: 
This game suffers from the same detriment as all Total War games: Not enough maps.  There are like 3 cities and 5 non-city maps.  Much of the joy of generalling is using terrain to our advantage and, like all Total War games, this one utterly fails.  Most of the maps are just a flat rectangle.  

Artificially limiting units to ""must be attached to a general"" makes this functionally much more of an RPG than a strategy game.  The way to win this game is to level up your general character, not be a good general.  Artificially limiuting the number of generals is just plain stupid.  I'm sorry, I tried for literally years to think of some sort of justification for this, and I just couldn't come up with anything.  That was a bad decision through and through.  

Bottom line if you enjoy Total War games, this is another one to add to the collection.  Not the best (obviously Empire, or maybe Shogun 2).  Not the worst (literally all of the Warhammer bs).  

If you enjoy strategy games I gotta recommend Empire: Total War.  After you're done with Empire and Shogun 2, move on to this game and Attila.  If you're still desperate for more Total War after that I recommend (roughly in order): Napoleon, Medieval II, Shogun, Alexander.  

I end this review with a plea to Creative Assembly.
Look guys I fell in love with strategy games.  I fell in love with history.  Will you please stop the rpg bs and move back to strategy?  Will you please stop the warhammer bs and move back to historical accuracy?  Thanks guys.",1653519882,1653519882,True,1,0,0.494672775268554688,0,True,False,False

The buildings, unit options, etc. aren't really much different. I get it... it's the same empire so the same units and buildings about apply between games but somehow I expected the complexity to increase and there to be more upgrade tiers available between buildings and such. It's really just the same game but with prettier graphics... which maybe is what people wanted. 

Also, be warned, I upgraded to the new MacBook Pro with an Apple chip since Steam claimed Rome II would work on the machine... it does not. It opens to the ROME II screen then disappears.

Conclusion in advance:
Recommendation for all fans of the ancient era, explicitly Rome, who are willing to pardon some gameplay issues like instable performance and stupid AI. For players, having their focus on pure gameplay, there are better historical Total War titles available (e.g. Shogun 2, Three Kingdoms).

Positive:
The game is atmospheric and can provide a lot of pleasure. It does NOT want to be historically accurate, but that is okay in my opinion. The unit diversity – especially with the many DLC’s – is impressive. Also, that each faction feels different to play. The great campaign map is huge and beautiful in my eyes. The units look very detailed and authentic. It is great fun to build up your empire step by step and to conquer the whole ancient world. Since the 2017 update CA implemented the family tree, which was sorely missed by fans of the first part.

Negative:
During my years with Rome 2 Total War, I had many different performance problems. Sometimes it crashes between the rounds, sometimes at the beginning of real time battles. I got used to save before each battle. So that is annoying, but not a big deal.

The biggest problem, all Total war games (even the new ones) have, is the completely stupid AI. If you are looking for a challenging experience, play anything else. After a few battles, you know how the AI reacts in each situation and you will win nearly each battle by using simple strategies. Difficulty level only changes the number of opponent full stack armies on the campaign map. Most of the balance issues are fixed in the meantime, but there are still some slightly overpowered units (a unit of Oathsworn can kill almost 3 Roman legionary cohorts) and some, which are completely useless and consequently unplayable. Sea battles are a bit notchy.


In view of the hundreds of joyful hours, I had with Rome 2 TW, I definitely have to recommend it even 9 years after its release. But keep in mind, that there are problems, which won’t be fixed very likely in the future. For me the positive side predominates.",1652881349,1652881505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However in saying that, I do not believe it is the best total war game.  While I love it very much, I fully acknowledge that previous total war games twice it's age still were doing better in many aspects of play, and enjoyment.  Though I don't think that means this game is a total let down, as I genuinely love it with a passion, and my complaints while sometimes major aren't deal breakers.

My first main complaint by far is difficulty.  This game is often times far too easy, as some factions will not stop steamrolling once the ball is rolling.  Rome itself is apologetically overpowered, and while they are the literal name of the game.  The problem resides that it makes Rome almost unfun to play if you know what you're doing, as even a 12 man garrison of a random town in Africa, will often have over a thousand legionaries more than capable of holding of 4000 of a mid tier enemy army.  Which leads further into difficulty, as the AI will almost never field high tier armies, often opting on some occasions for mid tier armies, and almost always resorting to a low tier spear units that at best roadblock you from progress for 5 minutes.  To some this might be a bonus, but I think it hurts replayability very much.  You can only have so much fun killing spear units that do a whopping 13 damage to your 105 defense, 60 damage, javelin volley throwing maniacs known as almost all mid tier sword units, let alone the high tier ones you'd surely field after decimating spear armies for so long.  

What should be mentioned is this is not always true, as for some factions, the difficulty is actually quite good because the early game is challenging, which makes the mid to late game steamroll feel rewarding.  Almost all celtic factions suffer from public order very badly, and as such, make it very fun as you have to manage your budget, and armies accordingly to prevent revolts.  Empire divided for me personally has the best Rome experience, as Aurelian's rome is horrifically hard early game, and the subsequent unholy steamroll that follows if you don't give up, is immensely enjoyable.  

A few other complaints I have are missile units feel very poor compare to older games in regards to sound design and animation.  This is admittedly small, but noticeable.  I encourage you to watch medieval 2 gameplay of archers vs rome 2.  You'll notice a very noticeable decrease in quality in sound design, animation, and even graphically.  A game almost a decade older outperforming a new game in the same franchise is borderline unacceptable.  I am willing to forgive it as ultimately archers in Rome 2 I believe preform far better than in medieval 2 in terms of combat effectiveness.  Usually being honestly op in some scenarios if you really focused on bonuses just for them in mind, but I digress.

On to some positives that make me come back to this game a lot!

Rome 2 has many, many factions.  A total of 117 (DLC included), however many share a lot of the same roster, and culture, but often field a few unique units and buffs to them exclusively.  Regardless of the of the ""samey"" kind of feeling many factions can offer you due to similarities, it still is a lot, and even just half of them being good is more than enough to satiate someone's lust for replays.  However, I want to immediately highlight 6 in particular I think deserve recognition.  3 I've personally played, and 3 I think look extremely unique and fun, DLC included.  

(Factions I've personally played)
1. Kush (Desert kingdoms dlc) CA went far too hard for the desert kingdom dlc in general, all of the factions are glorious, but Kush stood out to me in particular.  Fielding one of the most unique rosters I've seen, and that is almost always capable of being improved.  All while being in an amazing start position.  Makes this faction an absolute treat to play. 

2. Aurelian's Rome (Empire divided) As mentioned, this is Rome, but challenging.  I imagine many won't like it on that merit, but to those who do.  Aurelian's rome was one of the most difficult, and rewarding campaigns I ever played in a total war game. 

3. The Roman republic (Rise of the republic).  Once again, Rome but hard.  Very hard, however it usually steamrolls very quickly once you take care of the pesky, but numerous neighbors immediately hostile to you.  The roster being of the very early Roman republic, which most would hesitate to even call a professional army, feels incredibly different from base game Rome, and empire divides.  

(Factions I plan to play, and believe will be very fun)
1. Carthage.  Carthage is the only playable punic faction, and one of only two factions to have 3 dynasties to choose from to get a variety of different faction bonuses.  This coupled with it's free upkeep merc army capabilities with enough dedication, makes it seem like a constantly changing and unique army builder.  

2.  Nabataea. (Desert kingdoms dlc) A desert faction that embraces Hellenistic culture, and solid cavalry.  A dream come true for me, as Hellenistic and desert factions are by far my favorites.  The roster including pikemen, desert hoplites, and axe and sword units seems like truly a treat to behold for battles.  That in the income trade bonus is actually amazing if you really take advantage of the Mediterranean.  

3.  Macedon.  Probably the ultimate greek faction, giving you all of what you could want, with what I believe is the best pikemen in the game.  Coupled with hopelites, and fairly good cav.  The hammer and anvil was never better than with this faction!

Overall, I think I've ranted on enough about this game, perhaps to an unhealthy degree.  

My ultimate take is, I love this game, and I almost wish I could go even more in depth.  I however do fully admit, it might not be for everyone, and that's okay.

So this was the first of the total war games that I have experienced, and if i'm being completely honest it's way better than i thought it would be and i'm hooked. The game has a rewarding single player campaign where there are hours of gameplay not only dedicated to RTS gameplay but also a reasonably well implemented politics and economy/settlement management system. Granted, sometimes the settlement management and political stuff can be a bit tedious, but it makes the game a pretty cool simulation of the political, economic, and military climate at the time. I'm a sucker for realism, and of course the different factions, settlements, and tactics you can use in your gameplay of the campaign feel very real and open ended. Once you start learning how to manage troops in battle better, you can hike up the difficulty and things start actually feeling challenging. Granted it's not a perfect game, and I have heard bad things about the price to quality ration of the DLC(although I have not bought any yet myself), but if you can catch it on sale I'd say it's a good buy and a fun single player experience.

Edit: Ok so after additional time I definitely have more criticisms of the game and am overall less optimistic lol. Not a huge fan of the AI just straight up ignoring a lot of the obstacles players have to deal with(like public order and money since they can mysteriously turn up with a full stack mercenary army a turn or two after losing their last settlement :P). In addition to this problem the AI also gets very repetitive in battles just running straight into the opposing line and paying no attention to unit types and whatnot. Also from what I've gathered CA has made some controversial decisions in ""streamlining"" the game to make it more accessible and less complex. Now I don't know how true this is but I have definitely noticed in some of the older fan made guides that a few old mechanics or terms are used. All in all not bad but has a few annoyingly glaring issues that I wish CA would address (and I know the ai issues are complex so i certainly dont claim to know anything about how to fix that). I haven't played with many mods yet but I've heard high praise for the Divide et Impera mod so I may go check that out next since it appears to add some needed variation back to the game and change the way the campaign events and ai work.

- Also, look into the DLC before you buy it. The faction dlcs can be either really good or really bad and the new campaign scenario dlcs are only worth if you want something other than grand campaign.",1615021341,1649356938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When it comes to Rome II that's yet another game that's fallen into the trap of over-complication. It is nearly impossible to win while keeping finances balanced, which rips the joy out of everything. You need to be keeping an eye onto all sorts of stuff and can't really delegate administration of your settlements to anybody. However you do have annoying advisors who will provide all sorts of futile information while bringing very little actual value or contribution to the task of military conquest. Can't understand why the advisor doesn't provide any information of value regarding deployment of military units, formations and how to counter opposition armies.

Another issue is how time consuming the game is. There are no convenient options to save games so once you're under way you are pretty much stuck with having to complete many turns.

The combat mode falls short in that it does not really give an indication of whether you're winning or not. Much of the combat looks very even until suddenly one of the competing forces gains an upper hand, out of the blue.

This is not Age of Empires: it is meant to be a game that is inaccessible to all but except a tiny minority of seasoned gamers.

Some factions might be too easy to be interesting to play and others might have mediocre geopolitical issues, but there are some factions that are gold in this sense. Strongly recommend the use of mods to tweak some mechanics.

I'd strongly recommend the Getae faction. You start really small with pretty weak units, but it only makes your expansion and development the more fun. The faction also start pretty neutral with the many neighbours, but within a few years, you will be forced to pick sides in war (or sometimes you don't even have a choice given how things play out), whether it becomes east vs. west, north vs. south, you against all, or all neighbours united against the aggressive and expanding Macedonian faction. It is a lot of fun.

You won't always win with Getae, and that's the best part. Seeing your or another thriving empire expand and collapse through strategic and regretful decisions is the pinnacle of strategy.",1648865279,1648865395,True,5,0,0.559748470783233643,0,True,False,False

Update.  I have the brain to handle the complexity of the game (99th percentile on the LSAT and have read and understood 1,000 page insurance policies and even had to prepare an Appellate Brief back when I practiced law).  I am not having enough fun.  My favorite games have been, going well  back, Citizens: Kabuto, Knights of the Old Republic, The Mass Effect Games, Skyrim, Enderal, and Dragon's Dogma.  I have been playing WoW since inception and also enjoyed many other MMO's.  I have fond memories of TWMII and will have fond memories of this game and TWWH III, where I also played the prologue.   I regret that these games are just not my cup of tea.

I absolutely retain my recommendation of this game.  If you have a head for the complexity and enjoy this remote challenge, get this game, or another TW game.  I enjoyed my time with TWWHIII a lot more than my time with this, and I enjoyed my time with Rome 2 a lot.  But they are just not for me.

Medieval 2 set very high standards for Creative Assembly to follow. Both simple and complex where it needed to be. Rome 2 is the exact opposite. The politics system is pointless and unrewarding while forcing you to dump money into it otherwise it creates a snowballing effect of rebellions, secessions, and more secessions. Do not get me started on the AI and pathfinding. More often than not, the units will do the exact OPPOSITE of what you tell them to do. The game is much more micro intensive than it should be due to the broken unit AI which is more than content to stand there allow themselves to be shredded by skirmishers that are not even 10 feet away. This is just a fraction of the issues you will run into on any given campaign. As for naval combat, I cannot even put into words the amount of frustration you will experience just trying to get your units to WORK not even half way through the battle. I will close my rant there because I have not even begun to scratch the surface of what is wrong with this game.

However, I cannot give this title a bad review because despite all of its many, many flaws, it provides an experience that most games fail to deliver. There are a few improvements from Medieval 2 that this game brought (a lot based on preference) such as the large amount of unit and faction/cultural diversity throughout the game. Most playthroughs will prove to be a different experience. Instead of 20 major factions, you have roughly 70 city states/small kingdoms with a few minor empires to start things off, which is quite a lot of variables for different outcomes in each campaign.

Aside from the broken aspects of the game, the main problem however is how hard it is to finish a campaign. Once you conquer half the world, the only things really stopping you from further conquests is time, patience, and public order. It's a very repetitive process and turns end up taking longer and longer as your empire grows. Anyways, after 700 hours of gameplay, I thought it was about time to write my review.",1648517258,1648587362,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of things I don't like about it like the AI mostly, you have to constantly baby sit the units or they will try to run through enemy formations. Then there is the Player bias, that computer AI has.. there is The ally system that sucks, coordinated not really.. because you coordinate an attack but the AI just ignores it. Why it is even there when the AI just basically ignores the order I don't know. Why does your allies stand next to a town being attacked and not help I don't know. Most of my issues are just with bad AI.. and it's not that the enemy AI is bad, the enemy AI is great but make them your ally and it acts instantly worse.. So it's like fighting the game because it's using every way it can to just make it harder on the player. Including having enemies gang up on the player. I can say it's not bad if your not trying to get the total war achievement etc..  The AI is kind of trash, and can be frustrating..  It will spam the player with agent actions, but if you make anyone an ally the AI gets instantly more dumb.. I think the main issue I have with many of the total war series is that Computer players never have the same rules the player does it seem.. they don't seem to have to afford the units, or go by any of the same rules a player does.

At the time I found Rome 2 highly enjoyable due to its fun battles, interesting factions, and the only real complaint I had was the cheating AI, something veteran Total War players, and myself, can tell you is simply part in parcel with the series. 

Over the years, Rome 2 got more DLC, more expasions, more content, and has now matured like a fine Cyprian Wine. Its bugs have been addressed, its bare bones politics system completely overhauled to the point of being utterly indistinguishable from its original version, and its even received a few additional DLCs long after other Total War games have been released and discarded by CA *cough* Attila *cough*. I can safely say that by now it is well worth the cost of it and most its DLC, especially when you factor in the still quite vibrant modding community.

While a good portion of my hours are from vanilla Rome 2, the lion's share comes from countless modded campaigns, first with Radious, which makes the game more fast paced and adds loads of new units, and then as my tastes matured, with the Divide Et Impera Mod, which makes gameplay more tactical while also adding loads of units based on historical accounts, instead of what just looks cool. All in all, its an excellent game which has, unfortunately, exceeded its predecessor's successor, in quality and content, if only perhaps due to its long tenure of DLCs, bug fixes, reworks, and startlingly effective modding community.",1648097905,1648097905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first the game-play was so different that it was almost daunting and I longed back to the earlier simpler titles I got so used to already. But I forced myself to give RTW2 a chance because there were some very promising features. And boy was it worth it.
My favorite features that I appreciated immediately:
* Minor faction system. I always hated the generic ""rebels"" in earlier TW titles. There was never ""no-one's"" land during history, but this is what the ""grey area"" felt like: land you can take without consequences. This is gone now, the entire map is filled with life and you have to consider the diplomatic effects of attacking any minor factions. This is so cool.
* Army limit based on empire size. If you ever had to deal with the mindless army spamming of the AI (with 2-3 units each) and the resulting battle fatigue, then you'll appreciate this immensely. It also results in more strategic play, as you now have to consider where you will commit your limited number of armies. You can't fight on all fronts!
* Huge variety of factions, troops and mercenaries (bonus: you can levy troops from you vassals).
* Much improved AI, especially on the diplomacy front. You can actually make peace with a loosing AI and even force them into Vassal status.
* Naval battles (although I suck at them).
* Much larger map, with many more settlements.
* I also appreciate the nice looking graphics.

Features that I frowned upon initially but have grown on me since:
* Province system, with minor settlements not having walls.
* Food system.
* Growth system.

Overall I think this is by far the best TW game I played so far. Note that I got into this long after the initial release, so I didn't experience the bumpy start.",1646050844,1647933637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lucky for all of us, CA didn't give up on it... after having initially given up on it. Would love to see it done again but as Medieval III and perhaps and even more dynamic population and political system.

That said, after 5000+ hours and a lot of trying out different things, I think the the game is overall very dynamic and cinematic. If you take time to learn how upgrading your generals, politicans, and agents works, along with the political and economic systems, you can spend multiple turns planning out the logistics of an invasion so that your armies aren't just brute forcing their way through enemy stacks holding their settlements. Makes you feel like a real commander that has options and it makes leveling up your characters and agents very worth it.

Although you can pretty much brute force your way through the map especially as Rome as the AI tends to make dumb moves sometimes even on Legendary. That said, there are plenty of mods that can fit a variety of needs to make the AI a bit better and to fit any other tastes people might have. From the hardcore Total war and history nerds to the ppl who just want an enhanced vanilla experience, the mods for this game are great and abundant. They are a must if you want to get the most out of this game.

I have found that the slow grind and increased time span mods like Divide Et Impera (DEI) are just not for me, but I have finally found a collection of mods that work well with each other to make the vanilla experience much better aesthetically and in terms of combat. The list is below for anyone interested. Note that it does not include the particle effects mods nor does it include any of the graphical enhancement mods that are popular on the steamworkshop for this game. I run it at 1440p max settings so the game looks great to me and I just haven't gotten around to trying the particle effects mods.

MY RECOMMENDED MODS:
- NordoPic: 3D Unit Cards (uses 3D full color unit cards instead of the Greco-Roman 2D art style)
- Rivers of Blood: Gore Edition (DLC required - pretty self explanatory)
- Rivers of Blood: Realistic Edition (also self explanatory?)
- AAA: Generals - Romans (dynamic generals that age and change clothing - other factions available too)
- Reskin Roma.Pack (part of a comp that reskins ever unit to look more historically accurate)
- Reskin Unidades (part of reskin comp)
- Uniform Colours Remastered replaces jarring bright colors from vanilla and reskin w/ more modest colors/tones)
- Any Unit as general (for unit testing in custom battles)
- More and Better Armies - without AI bonus (AI builds more and varied armies w/ better units when able)
- Closer deployment zones (I only use for testing but compatible w/ campaign)
- Realistic cold steel 1.4 (new mod and best mod I've found for vanilla to make unit stats, unit AI, and combat more historically accurate)",1647671721,1647671721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure it's got diplomacy, army management, dynamic relationships between factions in your nation, and character progression, but none of it is really good. You don't actually have to pay attention to any of it and I don't because it's boring and most of your problems can be solved by pressing a button. After a few playthroughs I still have not had a:

-civil war or secession attempt
-war that was hard enough that I was at serious risk of permanently losing territory
-character that I actually cared about or mattered for my faction
-ally that was worth the effort I put in to securing them
-ally that I didn't immediately invade/want to invade after I was done with them bc I realized they were worthless
-client or satrapy that I didn't start the game with bc they're worthless except in maybe a few very specific situations
-food or public order issue that led to a revolt

So the gameplay loop is just invade > secure territory by building the right structures (which is easy and repetitive) > grow army so you're ready for next enemy (also easy) > invade next enemy

And that's it. That's a tutorial for the whole game.

There is some good, the battles are fun to watch and if you're in to roleplaying the expansion of a nation state in antiquity then you can have some fun watching your empire just keep growing. There's just nothing to hold you back or make conquering your 357th nation interesting. Your expansion will be very one sided in your favor after a few hours of gameplay. If you want something like a civil war, revolt, network of alliances, etc. you can do it but there's really no point outside of rp. So my history fan side is like ""okay, this is mildly interesting,"" but my gamer side says ""this is the same thing you did last time, why are you still doing this?""",1647102452,1647102452,False,5,1,0.493185669183731079,2,True,False,False

I bought this when it was released in 2013. It was awful then and it is still awful now. I have yet to buy another Total War game after playing this one. 

The UI is horrible. In the previous games it was clean and easy to read. Now it is a mess with rough ""cards"" to display buildings. The soldier ""cards"" aren't descriptive either and don't provide enough of a difference between units.

Other changes, like requiring generals to move units, limits the player freedom that used to be enjoyed in previous Total War titles.

I can say that this lives up to the Total War name. Off the bat, I'm telling you let the lady give you all of the tips in the campaign mode even if they are annoying at first.
