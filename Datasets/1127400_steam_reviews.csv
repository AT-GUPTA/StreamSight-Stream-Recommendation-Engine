A lot has been said about the option to essentially code unit behavior in the game. I dabbled in this a bit, but wasn't particularly interested. It isn't required to succeed, though I imagine it might matter if you're into competitive pvp multiplayer.

The game is criminally under-priced. While I might not have initially picked it up at a higher price, at this point I would gladly pay triple or quadruple. There's also still new development being done, and I'm excited to see what the next version is like.

Version 7 added another planet with a whole new campaign and set of blocks/buildings and units. I have mixed feelings about a couple of details, but overall really enjoyed it. I would say the factory mechanics in the new planet (Erekir) are more complex and challenging, but as a result also more engaging. The new units also feel more different from each other, and the differences in how they path around terrain makes for challenge in the variety of paths you have to defend against. The new Erekir campaign is much better designed than Serpulo, feels like a natural evolution and improvement. That said, I'm glad that Serpulo is still there; I still enjoy it for it's different style of play.

My nitpicks for Erekir:
- Visually, I think it looks amazing. But I also sometimes struggle to tell at a glance what's going on. The changes to make routing more challenging are annoying, but make sense to me. I just find it harder to tell which building is which, and most importantly what is being carried in each duct. Surge conveyors are also visually more ""noisy"" than plastanium conveyors.
- The new ""RTS-like"" method of unit control is nice, and much more convenient. However, I feel like this has led to a shift in the overall tone of the game towards a more RTS style of play, and thus away from tower defense. I'm undecided on how I feel about this. I think it's a net improvement, but I prefer playing tower defense overall.

There's now a V8 coming. At this point, I think the game is worth double what it costs, and if V8 is as good as it looks in the sample videos, it will be worth triple after release. ",1631411132,1708185498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is by far the most addictive game that I know.
Both campaigns are well balanced and have different tech trees and topology. 
Each battlefield unlocks new tech, which scratches that upgrade itch.
This pushes me for just one more hour, away from actually having a life and being productive.

To give you an idea, I restarted this mission Intersect 7 times, spent maybe 10 hours because the enemy AI kept attacking weak spots with aerial. Then when I get those plugged I counter attack one of their 3 bases, big mistake, they had amassed about 200 tier 3 units which razed my base. That was my 5th attempt. 
On the last attempt I get nearly pulverized but my long range canons saved the base, unfortunately aerials took out 2 out of the 3 reactors so all resources came to a grinding halt. So here I am, as the one surviving is busy taking out my inner walls, I reroute the magma to bypass Nitrogen reactors and fill the chemical power plants, shut down the secondary mining to reroute enough power to kick start beryllium production so that I can rebuild the conveyors to some inner guns to take out that last mech. 
And just when I get back to positive power output, a second wave storms in.
It took 3 hours just to get back on my feet and I went to bed at 2am.

It combines factory/resource-management, tower defense, and exploration all into one big game, with dozens upon dozens of sectors to explore.
The controls are simple enough, and the mechanics are easy to get used to.
For people who struggle with certain aspects of the game, there's also a catalog of sorts always available at the player's disposal containing all sorts of useful information about every single unit, tile, resource and status effect in the game (to my knowledge, at least.)
The sectors are all split up between five difficulties and two different types- Attack, and Defense, which helps spice up the game even more.
There's also online multiplayer, as well as community-run servers, and said servers also have numerous 'game-modes' of sorts of their own, and the users (at least from what I've experienced) are friendly- but that shouldn't drive you away from the campaign.
After all, it has a lot to offer, and I'm sure an unreasonable amount of effort went into making the game, as well as every single update.

All in all, I've loved the game from the start, and I still very much enjoy it now. There's updates every once in a while, and within the last year there was a major update which overhauled certain mechanics or systems and added an entire new planet with all-new objectives, tiles, units- Basically, it's like a sequel, but in the same game. Final Rating: 10/10.

Developed by Anuken, Mindustry challenges players to not only defend their base from waves of enemies but to also manage resources, construct production chains, and optimize layouts to ensure efficiency and survival. This review explores Mindustry’s key aspects, including gameplay mechanics, level design, replayability, community support, and innovation, providing a detailed overview of what makes the game both engaging and challenging.

1. Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Mindustry excels in its gameplay mechanics, seamlessly merging elements of different genres into a cohesive and engaging experience. Players must gather resources, build processing units, and create defenses against relentless enemy waves. The game’s depth comes from the need to balance resource collection with defense, requiring strategic planning and quick adaptation to changing situations. The mechanics encourage creativity in designing efficient production lines and defensive layouts, rewarding players for innovative strategies and optimization.

2. Level Design
Rating: 8/10 - High
The level design in Mindustry is varied and challenging, offering a wide range of environments that require players to adapt their strategies. Each map presents unique geographical features and resource distribution, pushing players to rethink their usual tactics. The procedural generation of maps in certain modes adds to the replayability, ensuring that no two games feel the same. Some levels, especially those later in the game, can feel overwhelming due to the difficulty spike, but this also serves to maintain a high level of engagement.

3. Replayability
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Replayability is one of Mindustry’s strongest suits. The game offers multiple modes, including campaign, survival, and custom games with adjustable difficulty settings. The procedural generation of maps and the ability to design and share custom maps with the community significantly enhance the game's replay value. Additionally, the continuous challenge of optimizing and rethinking strategies to improve efficiency keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging over time.

4. Community Support
Rating: 8/10 - High
Mindustry boasts a robust and active community that contributes greatly to the game's appeal with STEAM Workshop. The community-driven content, including custom maps, mods, and schemes, extends the game's longevity and adds layers of depth to the gameplay. Developer engagement with the community, through regular updates and responsiveness to feedback, fosters a positive environment that encourages player investment and content creation. However, newcomers might find the vast array of community content and the intricacies of more advanced gameplay slightly intimidating at first.

5. Innovation
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Mindustry stands out for its innovative approach to blending genres. The game takes familiar elements from tower defense, RTS, and resource management games and combines them in a way that feels both fresh and familiar. This innovation extends to the game's open-source nature, allowing for community contributions that continually enhance and expand the game beyond its original scope. Mindustry’s emphasis on efficiency, strategy, and creativity sets it apart from traditional games in its category, offering a unique and captivating experience.

Overall Summary and Score
Overall Rating: 8.6/10 - Excellent
Mindustry is a testament to the depth and engagement that indie games can offer. With its excellent gameplay mechanics, challenging level design, high replayability, strong community support, and innovative approach to genre-blending, Mindustry provides a rich and satisfying experience. The game encourages strategic thinking, creativity, and adaptation, appealing to both casual players and those seeking a deeper challenge.

The game also has a built-in map editor, so you can create your own maps using all of the features in the game.

Mindustry is VERY different from factorio, it's more of a tower defense game or RTS game (depend on defense or attack mission) with a ""little"" factory element. I'd say the tower defense aspect is the most fun and refined, the towers are cool, the enemies are cool the maps are cool, and the strategy elements with the all three combined, are very good and fun. 

But the other two aspects (RTS and factory) are both the quality of an early access title which lack significant quality of life feature. The RTS unit control system is borderline unplayable, but at least we can pause and take it slow.

The factory aspect ... well ... just ... just play factorio if factory is what you want. This game doesn't have a proper automation feature but simply jammed a assembly interpreter into the game.

This type of game play encourages you to grind out so many troops/units that you destroy the base on your first attempt. In other words, the game encourages you to waste a lot of your time building a crap ton of troops. This will be fine and all if the game had a save and load function, but you can only save upon quitting. This means you waste hours just to build up your troops, fail to destroy the enemy base, and then get ridiculous amount of enemy waves as you watch everything you build get destroyed.

The old review remains (with a couple of additional thoughts), as it still reflects my thoughts on the older, original campaign, which is still in the game (you can freely switch between them while playing). I more strongly recommend the new ""Serpulo"" campaign.

New review (New campaign, Serpulo):

Overall, pretty good. It lacks some QoL features and the controls are a little janky. But designing and building the ""factory"" is fun, similar to Factorio.

The new campaign changes the learning curve and unit/building availability (and art) significantly. It's the main reason I haven't permanently put the game down.

I haven't yet had nearly the same level of frustration with controls and UI that I have with the old campaign. But...
* Lots of the blocks/buildings still look somewhat similar. But at 12 hours into the newer Serpulo campaign, it's not nearly as bad. Have not had to build or pickup containers yet (not sure if this building/transport method is part of the newer campaign).
* Still have to drag and drop items from my ship to the core. After thinking about it a little more, it's really not so bad.
* Placing belts still not fun.

New complaints:
* I wanted more than a wave defense game. While the older campaign had levels that weren't all wave defense, the new campaign seems to be ALL wave defense. It's a little bit vanilla
* Related to above - the early game seems to focus VERY strongly on building towers. I've beaten maybe ten levels so far without building a single mobile unit. I would like something more dynamic
* Configuring factories for units to be rebuilt into the next level unit is still a PITA.
* Dealing with severe space constraints on some levels isn't that fun to me.
* Can't decide if I like the fact that larger ore deposits can't be 100% mined, due to having to place belts over parts of the deposits. It adds a little more challenge to selecting belt and drill locations, but it frustrates my desire for efficiency. And when deposits are combined with space constraints and/or very close to walls, that's worse. Some deposits just can't be mined because of where they're located. That seems like a waste. Perhaps later in the campaign there are buildings to address this.



Old review (old campaign):

I want to like this game so much. But the controls and UI are REALLY bad.

* Half of the buildings look almost the same. It's so hard to see within few seconds the type of building I'm trying to make.
* I need to drag and drop items from my ship into the core in order to use them to build things FROM THE SHIP? Why can't I just use what's on the ship if it's needed?
* Placing belts still not fun. Should be more like (and better than) Factorio.
* Picking up containers using the keyboard is/was a dumb idea. I can't just CLICK it?? And I can't just BUILD one on top of an empty container transporter/cannon? I have to build it somewhere clear and THEN pick it up and drop it onto the transporter using two DIFFERENT keyboard buttons? I'm trying to relax while playing this game, not hunch over a keyboard and mouse and hunt and peck for special keyboard controls. The default keys need to be different or something.

Overall pros:
This game is like a Factorio clone, that doesn't do Factorio as well as Factorio, but does enough other things differently and right, that it's still unique and fun, and not just ""a standalone Factorio mod"".

Overall cons:
Block/icon graphics aren't very unique and can be confusing.
RTS unit control is clunky.
Mod community and availability is still pretty weak.

The absolute worst crime this game makes is something essentially all RTS games have had figured out since Warcraft 1: DON""T CHANGE THE BLOCK LOCATION AND ORDERING! It's extremely irritating that most new blocks reorder and relocate all the old blocks. This is especially bad on Erekir where all the block graphics/icons are so similar and losing the location-memorization means you have to slowly hover and re-read every single one, and re-write your memorization. And then just when you're starting to get used to the change, a new one is unlocked and BREAKS EVERYTHING AGAIN! Extremely irritating. Happens on both planets, but it's especially bad on Erekir.


Overall Score 6.5/10:
I put almost 200 hours into it over the holiday vacation. It's no Factorio, but it has a lot of interesting and unique mechanics. Mindustry has more RTS elements where Factorio is more (veeery zoomed out) solo-adventure. The planetary region exploration, multiple planets, unique features, all make it a worthwhile game to check out for people bored with Factorio, and looking for something a little different.

Until I figured out that it was designed just differently and got comfortable with it. That removed the biggest obstacle.

I play it both on the iPad and the PC and actually played it more on the iPad simply because the PC is not always available. The interface is a bit different but otherwise it is the same experience.

I love it that it can almost seem impossible to do some levels. And that they just leave the memory of what you have build before, or even remnants. It makes it so much more enjoyable to retry levels.

I played on the v7 update, enjoyed Erekir, felt like Anuke learnt from the mistakes of Serpulo, up until missions were taking me literally several hours to complete. Siege took me 9 and a half hours before I realized that I wasn't playing a Tower Defense-RTS hybrid, but instead, I was playing an overdeveloped idle game that can't even satisfy, or give me progress for going offline.
I never beat it, it only got halfway there before staring at another actual hour of doing nothing but waiting for my army to rebuild so I could push the enemy, destroy another literal 12 buildings, and potentially just be back to square one again.

However, it seems Anuke didn't learn from every mistake of Serpulo, I'm a patient man, I think a mission taking 3 hours is a good medium for every single mission, asking the player for anything more than that is you taking the piss.
Your game takes too long to play Anuke, to quote the great Chef Ramsay; I wouldn't even serve it to a freaking pig.

EDIT: Review isn't wrong and it's still fully accurate, I'm just adding more because a new campaign, Erekir is here, and while it's a somewhat more condensed experience, it's got its own special slew of problems.

1. Fluid pipes work differently, for absolutely no reason, routers wil not connect to bending pipes directly adjacent to them, a pipe must travel in a given direction for 1 tile and then bend for it to connect, this blatantly sucks and causes pipe layouts to become excessively more cumbersome, obnoxious and downright infuriating to deal with. Bridge to pipe connections and junction to pipe connections don't operate this way for absolutely no reason. You cannot convince me that turning an Erekir pipe router into the same thing as a serpulio pipe route would degrade the campaign.

2. Ducts are the replacement for normal Serpulio belts and they lack junctions, requiring the use of bridges, which happily and heavily combines with the above point to make later bases, for all intents and purposes, absolutely confusing because A. You cannot toggle the visiblity of various graphics via in-game menus (seriously put checkboxes in the bottom left, there is functionally no need for that part of the screen to be empty when this QoL feature can be there for great effect) but those same graphics indicate power transmission as beam towers, (a new feature and a different way power connections are made which I prefer (ISH). And B. Combined with pipe routers working badly like that, it results in your base effectively turning into more of a confusing mess of belts and pipes that communicate almost nothing when it comes to figuring out the actual problems in them due to it having to become so utterly convoluted for the base to vaguely function past the first ten levels.

Cool thing: Erekir is linear (more or less) so there's (almost) never a question of which mission to do next

3. The later the mission in Erekir, the longer it takes. Anuken seems to think that if something takes a player more time to accomplish, it means it's more difficult. The game can be paused, in the mission I'm in as of writing, it is the 5th time I've played it, a grand total of 2 playthroughs that got this far, with 4 total playthroughs, it is Level 10, and this mission by itself takes 2 hours just to get to 7 of 24 waves because the map is both so huge, and the waves can't be sent while enemies from a wave still remain (for no reason, just make the victory condition be that the final wave has been reached, no cores and no enemy units remain, actually simple) which means that it will effectively take you, this is including pauses because the pipe system and belt system on Erekir is not well implemented, approximately 7 hours to beat it.

Seriously Anuken, your game takes too long. Why did I delete my previous save? Because I got to the point where Tier 3 walkers are usable, and by this point I had been playing maps with terrible resource layouts that ultimately resulted in me having really messy belt layouts, because the armored belt for no reason whatsoever, just has more armor and health and not...

More speed, the thing that'd make it vaguely good because generally if your belts are being attacked, you're already dead, because that means there are no turrets left between the enemy and your core.

In this level which sends T3 walkers at you also has artillery turrets capable of annihilating more things on the ground with impunity. They are located in a position swarming with anti-air turrets, both of which are also defended by very small heavily defended chokepoints. I had played on this map for a total of about 12 hours before effectively rage quitting because, for all intents and purposes, the enemy could not kill me, and never would.
And I couldn't kill them and never would, I'd know, because I explored that Entire Map and at the time, found no way to crippled the air defenses, and not matter how many ground units I sent all at once, the artillery would kill most, and then the chokepoints would mop the rest.

I believe it's only 6 levels where I am now, and I believe there are still many more to play on Erekir after that.

I simply have a single question. Is it possible to beat the last mission in under 4 hours? If not, I'd like to ask Anuken specifically why he thinks that's a good design decision in the slightest. Nobody really cares how much of a game people play because ultimately people will play whatever mind-slaves them the hardest regardless of quality.

The only solitary reason I still play it is because I am working on my own campaign (very slowly) and would like to brainstorm while playing, and to drag my friend along for the ride in the level I stalemated in because ultimately I'm unsure if that level is badly made, or if I'm just being dense.",1669195081,1702893686,False,0,0,0.395114898681640625,0,True,False,False

There are 3 major game mechanics:
1) Production - collecting resources and using them to manufacture increasingly advanced and useful products.
2) Defense -  building towers, generating and delivering ammo to the towers, generating and delivering liquid cooling to the towers to protect your base.
3) Offense -  using raw resources to create groups of controllable units, which you control and mobilize in the style of RTS to infiltrate/destroy/capture the enemy base.

The campaign is robust. From what I  gather, there are two distinct campaigns with distinct resources and tech trees. It feels like two games worth of content in that respect.

Both tech trees are quite massive, as is to be expected with a factory management game. As you progress through the campaign(s), your options for how you create raw resources evolves significantly as you unlock more advanced tech. Lots of new ways to generate power, generate and move liquids, generate and move solids. Some ideas are pretty unique and really change how you plan each mission as you unlock higher tier tech.

There are tons and tons of missions. The campaigns are quite rewarding and challenging. Once you get through the initial 5-10 tutorial missions, the campaign opens up and gives you more freedom to choose your next mission among multiple options. Most missions boil down to one of two objectives: 1) survive X amount of enemy waves (so a more typical tower defense objective), or 2) infiltrate and destroy the enemy's base(s) (so more in the style of an RTS.)


The online co-op is essentially seamless. It's wild how some games have so much trouble with netplay, and then you get a game like Mindustry where you don't even think about it because the netplay  just works. No obscure way of hosting/inviting. Literally ""open menu-> host server"" then ""open menu-> invite friend to server."" Invites go through steam like all steam supported games should. Super easy like all netplay should be. In about 40 coop hours playing with friends, we have had 1 single instance of desync, which could just as easily be the result of internet lag. Beyond that, we've had no drops, no rubberbanding, no difficulty joining or accepting invites via steam.

As a big fan of Tower Defense games. I'm very pleased with the tower defense aspects of the game. I could easily imagine a lesser game including basic tower defense elements and calling it good. Not Mindustry. So far (have not beaten the purple world campaign yet) there are at least 10 different towers with very different use cases. Many towers use  a variety of different ammo types, which gives you agency as a player to choose the best ammo for your mission, and also gives you the choice to evolve to better/different ammo as the mission progresses. I also really appreciate the water cooling element of the towers, which allow towers to fire more rapidly, but further complicates the way you build your defenses, which makes it all that much more satisfying when you come up with a really efficient/aesthetically pleasing design.

Overall, a great game for fans of resource management, base building, tower defense, and RTS.",1702421392,1702421392,True,1,0,0.523305118083953857,0,True,False,False

1127400,152664594,76561198008875566,0,4,1441,0,1412,1701455780,"I came back to this game after a year or two. I played it on steam, later even got it on mobile. I saw RCE play it and got excited and I am shocked. The game actually feels worse and barely improved.

First the good parts: I like that you can choose between different planets and each gives you a different experience. I like that you have more control over mobile units in the new mode. The idea of multi-stage sectors is also neat and the enemies having bases has some great RTS-vibes, even though I think of this game more like a factory-game and less an RTS, but if that's the devs vision it is totally fine. I never got into multiplayer or schematics but I hear people love it.

The not so good parts: I dislike the new system. Yes, I can always play the old one, but firstly, even the dev implies that it's the ""worse experience"" as in unbalanced. Forget that, they explicitly state that the new campaign is the better experience. And I'm not expecting them to work on the old system anymore. So I play an abandoned, unpolished, unbalanced mode. But also most devs will not give you this choice and that's a still a big plus.

But back to the new system. It's... not great. Some redesigns are fine. The wall drilling is interesting and the huge turrets are fun, even though (at least early on) it feels slow and not that great of an experience. I do not like the new minerals. The art, color and names feel wrong, somehow, but that's just my opinion and I can't really explain it anyways. 

But what I can confidently say is bad is the energy system. I hate it. It is clunky. And now you always need to work around those static, straight lasers. I also don't think it introduces any meaningful new challenge or gameplay. You already have a lot of routing management through the conveyor belts so why add this? What is its purpose and why choose it over the ""smart"" radius connection energy system of the old version? Maybe I am missing something, but so far it was more annoying than fun. 
Also why are there lasers connecting to machines when they have no power? I had many machines not running because I thought they were connected until I found the one segment where the lasers weren't connected. Again the visual language is unclear. 

The second thing are the new conveyor belts. What were they thinking? It is not only unsatisfying, because watching small thingies move is one of the big appeals of these kinds of games, akin to old sims like rollercoaster tycoon and the settlers. And now I can't, because they are obstructed by those arrows. Again, the old system solved it much more elegantly by just animating the belts. Am I crazy for feeling like they moved backwards? 
Next bad aspect of the new belts is: I can not for the love of good see if its a normal belt, a router or something else. Because that too is obstructed by these arrows. It's frustrating. The visual design is cluttered, much harder to read, both in type of belt part and what is transported. Not to mention that there are lasers everywhere adding to the whole readability-aspect. Theres also a glaring lack of adjustment options in the menu for these things. 

Lastly, what I think is absolutely terrible: The controls. They are bad. I actually, and I can't believe I'm saying this, prefer the controls on mobile. Why can't I move with a mouse click, unless I completely rebind many controls? Why is there no button to toggle the conveyor arrows? Why do I have to push ""shift"" for the unit control mode and why is there no toggle for that either? I had to rebind those because I got cramps from the hand contortions I had to make to move the camera with wasd, while pressing shift (I am a leftie). Why can't I move the camera independently from my character except with mouse 5?! Why is there no border scrolling? Why can't I zoom while I have build placement selected (just change rotate building to Q and E like most games do). Why can't I move the camera by clicking on the minimap. Also why is the minimap so tiny? Why oh god why is respawn on V? I respawned so many times while hitting space to pause. V is another key that is traditionally used for actions that are performed regularily like dodging, melee, etc. Is respawning really that important and used that often that you have it on V and not on something like F3 or Del? In general why are many keybinds so unintuitive? The controls have gotten much more convoluted and counter-intuitive since I last played. Why are there so many gameplay options that I don't know what they are doing and other more essential ones are missing? What is the difference between Hints and Logic Hints? Why does it say ""double-tap to mine""?`I am not playing on mobile. If I remove the checkbox next to ""Hold for command mode"" does it toggle then? Why name it in a way where it is already enabled but doesn't tell you what it does when you disable it? What does ""control unit"" mean? I though I control my unit with wasd and other units by holding shift, selecting them and right clicking? Why group left and right and forward and backward movement into pairs and name it X and Y? I am not on a controller. And as far as I know this game doesn't even have controller support. What the hell is ""Mouse Forward"" and ""Mouse Backward""? I deduced that its mouse 4 and 5 most likely but that naming scheme never came across me in 20 years of gaming. Oh, also what does ""Auto-Create saves"" mean? That one is actually funny to me because it might just be a translation issue (idk the native language of the devs, but I would assume that if english is not their native language by now they should have had a capable translator). I think what they mean is ""Enable Auto Saves""? And I hope I am right but if that is true then Why is that option not immediately below the ""Save Interval"" slider? In short: The options are a jumbled mess and need a serious decluttering and rework. Change default keybinds, remove or reword confusing options, add some more meaningful options and clarify existing options (maybe even add tooltips on a mouseover? But please give them a delay, because instant tooltips in menus that obstruct other lines are worse than no tooltips).

Yes, many people can and probably will say that ""just change the settings"", ""You'll get used to it"" and ""just don't play the new mode if you don't like it"" but that's often a sign of being too used to a clunky system or not knowing that it could be better. And some people might think that I say this because I hate the game. But I WANT the game to be good. I used to enjoy it and I do like some changes and I think there is lots of potential. But I am very confused by many decisions the devs made and I would love to know why they choose this instead of improving on the old system. Especially because many of the issues are quite obvious and also rather easy to fix. And even though this is somewhat emotionally charged I hope the devs, if they read this, can hear the honest criticism.

I want this game to be great. But at this point I can not recommend it and would rather play the old version.",1701454207,1701454207,False,7,1,0.577104270458221436,0,True,False,False

I am not gonna lie the first time I played Mindustry was on a phone, it was addicting, the menial task of putting conveyor belts to deliver the resources you need and not screwing it up with the routes. The simple task of combining and refining resources can be daunting at times, you just need to look at the (?) frequently to determine what do you need, defending the mines and base is secondary at this point

The music is designed well, if robots can sing by themselves, it would sound like this, not to mention that there is a number of tracks in intervals. Might be a timeless classic later on.

This can actually can be used to recover from brainrot such as TikTok, as it emphasizes on focusing and being attentive to where enemies go, what defenses should you use, utilizing all routes toward your base, ensuring no screw ups in logistic, thank you Mindustry for changing mindsets.",1701181423,1701181423,True,1,1,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

The lack of tutorials, explanation and just complete lack of new player help is bizarre.

That’s too far, Let me try again.

During 2018, I was bored and had no money to spend and a end of the run laptop. I was looking for simple free games on my phone. That's when I found a certain game. 

[h1] Mindustry [/h1]

At first it was a simple pixelated game with a basic goal of defending against some towers. What was appealing to me at first was the complexity already available to me. I could create a system of automated production to help me go against endless waves of enemies. The game continued to receive support slowly and then I soon discovered tiny servers of people playing as well. One of my favorite pastimes was to play this game on multiplayer learning new build ideas and try to survive as far as I could. I downloaded the game on my phone and showed it to all my friends. Sadly all great stories come to end. After a while I would play less and less. I tried to switch up my games and find new ways to entertain myself. The app stayed on my phone untouched, doing nothing. But then again I became bored. I played again and something spectacular happened. 

[h1] The update [/h1] 

My phone said it was ready to update. This update became the starting foundation of the current version of Mindustry. I was amazed by the new graphics, mechanics, enemies, strategy, etc. I bought it on steam and started playing non stop. The game received constant updates and support. 

[h1] The Good [/h1]

The gameplay on PC is very seamless. You have a flying ship that can move anywhere you want and you build anywhere to. Each game follows a similar progression of starting off with limited resources, trying to get top tier resources to build defenses and armys. but depending on gamemode or map it can change this. What is amazing is the amount of complexity you can include. The game gives you the option to use logic in your conveyor systems to help you maximize efficiency. If you are worried about having to manually build giant systems of factories and conveyors each game, the game has a system called schematics which allows you to save your builds to paste for later use. 

Once you master the campaigns your first objective is to play multiplayer. The amount of servers constantly running is amazing. There are PVP, Attack, and survival maps. Playing on these servers, especially PVE, will help with your strategy and schematics. My favorite gamemode is PVP. You must build as fast as you can try to take out other players with your own bot army. The scale of these battles can be team's vs teams or solo players battling it out in a royale. 

The game has a decent mod following already. The steam workshop is lacking in overhaul mods but the ones present are very good. 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

Sadly nothing is perfect, (But this is close) 

The campaign itself can be grindy at times. You have to gather resources and then launch (which ends the game) to collect them. Then you can research new items. This can get annoying if you don’t gather enough stuff, but at a certain point you unlock the launch pad which automatically launches items for you without leaving the game.

Multiplayer is one of the best parts of the game but can be the worst. A problem in the game is griefing. Every few games a griefer will join and try to destroy as many blocks as possible. Usually though it only takes 20 seconds before they are banned and the game continues. To avoid griefing you can join a PVP server with no teams but you can join when a game is halfway complete. You will instantly spawn on an army of bots that will destroy you instantly. But these problems are not enough to stop me from playing. Griefers aren’t common to ruin the game yet and hopefully before it gets worse, a better anti grief system is implemented. To fix the PVP problem just make your own game or try to join at the beginning of the game. 

[h1] Final Choice [/h1]

It should be no surprise that I highly recommend that game greatly. This is one of the few games that I constantly play. 

For a game that only six dollars it over delivers. And if you don’t want to pay six, you can easily get it on sale or just get it for free. But if you want to support the developer, I would buy the game. The game offers so much and will continue with more updates

[h1] Tips [/h1]

Check out the official discord, which can be accessed from the game, to get schematics and advice. 
play multiplayer to discuss ideas and builds.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
 
You like sandbox games with tower defense mechanics, buy this game. If not, its only six dollars.

Comes with both the 'Survive' mode, where waves come in and have to be eliminated, as well as Sandbox variant. Furthermore there exist PvP and Attack maps as well, where multiple parties have a core: here you'll be sending in waves and attacking the opponent's core yourself.

Do you like Factorio? Then you're gonna enjoy this game. Never played Factorio before? Then maybe it's a good idea to purchase this title to see if Factorio is for you ;)

The game is self-described as ""An open-ended tower-defense game with a focus on resource management."" The resources management part of the game is the one that is played like Factorio, but simpler. You collect some resources, you build something with the resources, and you collect new resources, and you build something new with the new resources, throw in some electricity management, and you get the gist of it. There is a tech tree in the game, but unlike Factorio, you only need to unlock it once to be able to use it in the future; technology limitation is usually caused by resource limitation (in sum and type) in the current map.

While you're building up your resources and facilities, enemies will spawn in waves, the longer you play the harder (in general) the waves get. This is where the tower defense part comes into play. Tower-defense gameplay usually starts with you building some of the cheapest towers near the enemy spawn point, after building up some resources you start upgrading your towers. You could also build some mech factories, where you can make some combat units with limited commands (either stay, attack, or retreat). Planning usually involves consideration of the geography (where land units will come from, where air units will come from), resources availability, how much space you got for the towers and it support (ammo lines, electricity, and cooling), and most importantly, how long do you plan to stay in the map. This brings us to the last point...

Open-ended. The enemy waves never end. Every certain number of waves (different for each map) you'll be given a chance to launch your core and leave the map, bringing every resource you have in your cores home; these is the resources you used to go up the tech tree. Depending on how long you stay in the game, you may also unlock the next map(s). This is one of the game's great points. If you just want to play some light game that won't last an hour, you can plan your game for several waves only. On the contrary, if you want to test your limit and play for hours and hours to mine every resource on the map, build every facility you want and tons and tons of towers and try to get that 500 waves clear achievement, you can!

In short, yes the game plays like Factorio but with a simpler system and much faster pace, but the same level of enjoyment (some would argue it's more!). The dev is also very active; new features are constantly added to the game. So again, with this price, there is no reason not to buy the game.",1573491109,1700653448,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Harder: This has 2 campaigns and both campaigns focus rather heavily towards combat in the later stages and it can be pretty brutal, getting your base up and running quickly while fending off escalating enemy attacks (with boss-level enemies thrown into the mix).

This game is kinda close to Terraria in my list for money spent per hours played. Have fun with it!

All three great games. Most of them fairly chill and even Factorio is more or less chill, with you simply having to advance in tech to defend yourself every now and then from not too threatening enemies.

This game was described to me as a combination of the three + RTS. And I wasnt too sure that I would like it. Well I think my number of hours kinda speaks for itself here. For 10 whole bucks, this game is genuinly worth your money. From the general level of creativity you can have as well as really engaging gameplay and a ever expanding level of difficulty the longer you play. 

New ways to defeat enemies, new ways to gather ressources. More ores, more liquids, ways to make more out of your ressources and even using other ressources to make the same you already have but without ever having to mine for the rest.

It is a fairly complex and fairly indepth game and I cant love it more. For 10 bucks, its way more than worth your money. Id even pay 40 bucks for this easily and this isnt something I say a lot about many games I played. Tho granted, 40 bucks would also likely set very different expectations so the price the game has also does a lot for its accessible popularity.

THE CONS
THE CONCLUSION
[/b]

The Pros

+The game has a semi active comunity
+average pricing
+a campaign
+steam workshop and mods
+just a lot of content in general
+offers atleast some replayability
+map creator

Now lets get into the worse part

The Cons
-half of the comunity is toxic
-unbalanced campaign
-boring gameplay
-surge alloy
-units
-unit factories
-lack of good servers

The conclusion

Idk it realy is just factorio tower defence edition but 2d and with more chaos. If you like towerdefences and factorio i would recomend it because... wait is that a flare unit heading towards your base? all jokes aside its a...

6/10

But even there, like, building up your base in factorio, encasing it in thick walls bristling with guns, then setting up artillery emplacements to clear out the next area for expansion, before you tower-creep your way over there and control another heavily-defended outpost in the middle of the creep... that's so much more exciting and engaging an experience than this game. Which is just, there are spawn points. Enemies spawn at those points at predictable intervals. And then you just build a wall at the spawn point(s) and they run into those exact points over and over. The maps are tiny and claustrophobic, with indestructible mountains everywhere; every successful map makes you start over from stage 1 with another boring basic spaghetti build, where you again have to set up all these stupid mining drills that only mine directly underneath themselves and block outflow from neighbouring drills so you have to directly place these stupid anthill-looking drill setups, to make room for all the belts, in the most unengaging base-building ever.
And after you've done all that, here comes the boss, and while the boss in the last level died in 5 seconds, this one walks straight through your defences, that so far haven't even taken damage in even the biggest waves (should've built those defences 3 times as deep as the level teaches you to build them!), and then he walks all the way to your core and destroys it. But at least when you re-start into the level all your buildings are still there so what was the point?

Even playing Starcraft 1 against AIs better captures both the defence-focus and the ""the factory must grow"" themes of this game. Just an absolutely failed execution of a great concept.",1698011844,1698011844,False,4,2,0.441313505172729492,0,True,False,False

Mindustry is an amazing game if you like factorio and tower defense games. Visuals, features, optimization, sounds ect. All of the indie games are non optimized and lack tons of features but Mindustry is a truly masterpiece. As a game developer, i can say the developer team did a such a great job. 

[i] You go to different places in different planets to gather resources while defening your base from robotic ailens. Its more on to defending side. Its very very fun with all of the different thing you can do. You can make a bit turret system that repairs itself. Or you can create a huge robotic army to destroy enemies. There is also pvp, co op campain or endless game modes. You even can mode the game! Like i said its a truly masterpiece like i said. [/i]

I have only 25 hours of gameplay at the time of this review but I saw something like 200 sectors.

If you enjoy complex games in wich you have to research multiple technologies to be able to upgrade your base into something greater, this game is for you. RTS genre has been dying and this game is such a nice revive to it that I'm really happy for it!

Computer hardware required: not even potato, I would say a potato sapling might do it.

Story: I'm not sure but there is no story, just annihilation.

Gameplay: kinda easy to undestand, very hard to master.

Graphics: old sprite glory!!!

The loop of the game consists in playing different maps in which you build factories to get materials to build turrets and ammo. As you progress you gain access to levels with new materials that unlock more advanced tech. 

Dealing with the enemy waves can be frustrating early on. Maps are built so they have a lot ot paths to your base, and predicting the route the enemies will take is annoying. Wrangling the enemies so they end up in your defenses feels more like trial and error and cheesing, than actual tactical thinking. The main gripe though is the lack of info in the enemy types. A very common occurence is that all the normal waves are ground enemies while the boss is a giant flying robot that just flies over terrain to your core and annihilates it. 

The point where I couldnt be bothered anymore was when levels have enemy bases and you're expected to destroy them. This is an extremely slow and tedious process of either advancing your turret line inch by inch into range of the enemy buildings (this has a limit as you cannot build near the enemy core), or building your own units, which feel tremendously weak so it's a very boring war of attrittion.

Only problem I have with it is, why does it round to the nearest .01 for drilling?

EDIT: the game's new update is awful.

-It's more of a unit management type game than a resource farm/tower defense game now, meaning it's kludgy unit management system is something you're going to be working with a lot.
-It got rid of your ship's gun. It was weak, but it was critical when you didn't have units yet (which are expensive) and some random enemy units walk past your defenses and starts shooting up your base.
-The level selection is unnecessarily awkward. I've spent way too much time rotating the globe looking for the next sector I'm supposed to play.
-The enemy is just not fun to play against. It's hard to see where the enemy is coming from, since you need aforementioned expensive units to explore the map.
-The starting resources on most of the levels are incredibly small too, while the computer gets a whole developed base to start with.

The base game had it's flaws, but was also a million times more enjoyable. Just play on Serpulo instead of Erekir, I promise you, you're saving yourself a lot of headache. If the new update is any indication as to the direction this game is going, then that is incredibly depressing, since there were just a few kinks in pre-version 6 that could have been ironed out to make it an incredible game.",1587890613,1695791759,False,0,0,0.528112411499023438,0,True,False,False

In particular, I believe it's stuck. After creating one world and never really polishing it, the tiny team creating it created a brand new game with significant differences, added on as a new world, and looked forward to the next content release.

Except the game, as it was, desperately needed polish, adjustment, and balancing that it will now probably never get. If you are one of the many people who, like me, start the game to find your cursor has vanished, you know that there are years-old game-breaking bugs that the developer just isn't interested in addressing. But the bugs are [i]very[/i] few. The code is fine -- you can look at it yourself and see. I can cope with what few bugs I've seen. My real problem is with design.

Because the original game and the new world are essentially not the same game, it's almost impossible to review them as a single title. This is, by the way, a design defect in my view. Mindustry has been around a long time, and it's one sort of game. One sort of game that needed work, but instead of doing that work, the devs took the path that pleased them better, which was to add content. This is the most common disease of small production teams in the entire world of indie gaming (if this game could be described that way, but they've grossed too much money in my opinion to merit the title ""indie"" at this point. Being provided sufficient time and money, by the way, removes any excuse not to polish your product. And this game has had enough of both to do better.

As I find myself saying again and again, creating shiny new content to please your fans is always going to be more fun than polishing, rebalancing, fixing, and tweaking an existing design. It's the behavior or someone working on their hobby, skipping from the fun part of one project to the fun part of the next project without creating something polished enough to present to the public at large.

The unit descriptions are garbage. They don't give you information about what's required for the buildings to run. The information about each unit is a single phrase that tells you nothing. Good luck figuring out what you need per building with the small icons that tell you nothing instead of unit names. There's no way to find out either. No documentation and no guides online. You need to memorize every icon in the game in order to read what's on the screen.

You can be as greedy as you like, and try to build a big factory to grab as many resources from a planet as you want. [b]But[/b], can you then [b]defend[/b] that factory from the inhabitants who don't want you stealing their property? I'm not very far into the game at the moment, only three hours in, and I'm going to be attempting the map called ""The Craters"" straight after I finish this review. But the learning curve and difficulty seems to be pitched perfectly at the moment. Looking at the screenshots on the store page, it looks like things will get a lot bigger and a lot more complex later on - just how I like it. 

And I must mention the price - this game is excellent value for money. I got it for [b]less[/b] than £5UK, and I can already tell that it's going to be a good investment. 

I think I'm going to be putting a lot of hours into this, and if you like living on the knife-edge of balancing exploration with defence, if you like factory-building games and tower defence games, you should too.

UPDATE: Well, I found the usual problem with a game which is developed by a small group or single developer: Lack of QA testing and lack of balance. Shortly after completing my original review, I started finding maps where the difficulty level suddenly jumped up by a BIG amount. You start with a time limit before you get swamped by waves of strong enemies. Instead of planning strategically, the player is reduced to simply spamming defences as fast as possible in order to survive. And unless you find the EXACT defensive pattern that the developer is demanding, you will get wiped out. So you have to repeat the map. Again, and again, and again, until you learn the right pattern. So boring and frustrating.
Many people compare this game to Factorio, so I will too. At this time (Sept 2023) I have 15 hours playing Mindustry, and I have 1,477 hours playing Factorio. That gives you an accurate illustration of the relative quality of the two games. Factorio is properly QA tested and properly balanced.

My biggest problem with factorio was ""progression paralysis"" where it took lots of comittment to find ways and room to retrofit your ""starter base"" with newer technologies and eventually ditching it to build the ""actual base for real this time"" that can be scaled to the end game, assuming you know how to design it efficiently. This game solves this problem by dividing the world into isolated regions where you set up and defend your mining and material production to reach a point where you can advance to the next region. In a region you have certain amount of enemies to beat in waves and new resources you can find to research better technologies.
In the beginning you supply your turrets with copper and lead ammo, but later you unlock new materials to create for use with the turrets for higher damage output. More mechanics get introduced like new buildings, electricity, logic elements and enhancements like water cooling.
Compared to factorio, his game has a more streamlined item transportation system with belts only having a single lane, but also more types of belts like overflow gates, routers/distributors and junctions that are contained within a single element. All this makes it much easier to work in the size constraints of your spaghetti factory.
You can also pause the game and set building plans that start getting built by your player drone when you unpause. You have infinite time to plan how you will build defenses, but you still have to worry if you have enough materials gathered to build everything in time before the next wave appears.",1694287316,1694287626,True,8,0,0.630872488021850586,0,True,False,False

The ""global"" feeling of being on a planet with sectors representing all areas is extremely interesting. Looking forward to more planets than just Serpulo and Erekir, as well as more lore.

Mindustry's gameplay is a unique blend of tower defense and resource management. The objective is simple: defend your core reactor from waves of relentless enemies. However, what sets Mindustry apart is the way it intertwines resource gathering and manufacturing into the core gameplay. Players must extract, transport, and process resources to build defenses and upgrade their production chain. This adds an engaging layer of depth, strategy, and creativity that is both challenging and addictive.   

Mindustry opts for a minimalist pixel art style, which may not be everyone's cup of tea. While the visuals are functional and clear, they lack the polish and detail found in some other games. However, the game's simplicity allows it to run smoothly on a wide range of devices. The soundtrack complements the gameplay well, creating a tense atmosphere during waves and a calming ambiance during downtime.   Mindustry's learning curve is steep, especially for newcomers to the tower defense genre. The game doesn't hold your hand, and understanding its mechanics and systems requires time and patience. However, this complexity is a strength for those seeking a deep and challenging gaming experience. The sense of accomplishment when you finally master the intricacies of resource management and defense strategy is incredibly satisfying.

With a wide variety of maps, each with its unique challenges and layouts, Mindustry offers substantial replayability. The game also features a level editor and a thriving modding community, allowing players to create and share their custom content. This extends the lifespan of the game and ensures that you'll never run out of new challenges to tackle.

One of Mindustry's standout features is its passionate and supportive community. The developer, Anuken, actively engages with the player base, listens to feedback, and regularly releases updates to improve the game. The modding community has also produced an abundance of user-created content, expanding the game's possibilities further. 

Mindustry is a hidden gem for fans of tower defense and resource management games. While its pixel art style and steep learning curve might not appeal to everyone, those who invest the time to master its mechanics will be rewarded with a deeply satisfying and addictive gaming experience. With its active community and continuous support, Mindustry is a title that can keep you engaged for hours on end. It's a must-play for strategy enthusiasts looking for a fresh challenge.",1692753055,1692753055,True,27,2,0.733217835426330566,0,True,False,False

I really want to like this game; It has all the elements I love, tower defense and crafting, but it just doesn't work. There's (effectively) no wiki so you have to teach yourself how to play as you try not to get steamrolled by the bosses. Until you reach endgame you need to rebuild you defense line on every boss wave which is some garbage.

Edit after update 6:
Update 6 really turned this game into what I was hoping to get when I bought the game. There's more of a progression system with a tech tree to unlock, there are more places to go on the planet, and the of course it's been completely re-balanced so no more getting steamrolled every single level.

Firstly, it becomes repetitive quickly. Sure within the first 50-100 hours you get bombarded with new content, but a lot of that content becomes obsolete as you unlock new things. Then, once you have everything you find yourself building the same couple of defenses in every level - and the game even encourages this with the schematic option.
The second problem is that the game makes you wait forever for resources. Maybe I'm just not good at optimization, but I'll spend up to an hour just waiting for my resources to fill up so I can start the next level without getting screwed over immediately. And the worst part is - you can't even AFK! When you tab out to another app, the game automatically pauses.

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] No speed settings, so there's no way to play at 2x, 4x or whatever. This is a big issue in a game where the goal is to collect resources
[b]#2.[/b] The save system is idiotic. You have ONE save slot and you can't just quit to the main menu without saving either, so you're routinely forced to overwrite your save slot even when you don't want to. Massively spoils the game.
[b]#3.[/b] The different sectors on the map are NOT connected and considering that you have literally dozens of sectors and you've built a base and factories in each of those sectors (which takes dozens of minutes PER sector), the fact that you can't even get resources from those sectors that you've already built, is stupid. It literally makes all of the previous work and progress you've done pointless, since you can't get resources from it.
[b]#4.[/b] A massive part of the game, involves defeating wave-after-wave of enemies, and since this is essentially a Tower Defense game, you'd expect an 'attack path' to be highlighted for the enemies to show which route they plan on following, just like you get in all other TDs, but this game doesn't have that, which means that you have to guess which way the enemies are going to come when you reach a new sector, and if you've guessed wrong, then you just die and have to start the sector over.
[b]#5.[/b] The game's conveyor belt system isn't logical, since it doesn't function like a conveyor belt, because it allows inputs from ALL directions, and this massively complicates production lines because now you can't have a conveyor belt that is flanked by production buildings.... you're forced to leave a space on one side of the conveyor belt. I don't know why the dev couldn't just make the conveyor belts function like conveyor belts in reality (or like it does in games like Satisfactory, which again, is based on reality).
[b]#6.[/b] Many technologies are gated by certain scenarios... and you can go where you want... so if you just keep on avoiding these specific scenarios on the map, then you will NEVER unlock specific crucial technologies in the game... so instead of having the tech tree function like a regular tech tree where you can research using points or resources, the dev instead opted to have it be gated by specific maps, which goes COMPLETELY counter to the open-world aspect that the game has.

While the aesthetics are admittedly nice, this unfortunately plays straight as a Tower Defense kind of game, but is also admittedly clunky. You're often feeling at odds with the gameplay because unlike the earlier mentioned Factorio, where you usually have some time to build up a base and figure out your surroundings before you have to engage anything, every level here plays on a timer. 

When you first get in to a level, you have 3-5 minutes to not just get your bearings, but get your resource stations built up, your weaponry online, and prepare for your first waves of opponents to try and tear you apart, with the understanding that resource management is a live and constant endeavor even in between rounds. 

It doesn't punish you too badly for failure. Every round you lose, everything stays where it is, but more beat up and destroyed, so you have to spend some time and resources rebuilding it. But that unfortunately means that the time limit the game itself imposes on you is meaningless, as you won't lose everything from total failure, and also that you will immediately be replaying the same exact level multiple times and progressing a little bit further in each wave, with each wave feeling exactly the same. And since you're focusing on not just base management but also expansion, you often won't actually be where the action is ( Not that your pea shooter of a space ship is particularly competent in battle ). This also means that when an enemy actually breaks through, though, that you won't be there to see it, and that the enemy has pretty easy access to your major supply routes from there. You could spend more time buffing up exactly one area so no matter what it will always be protected, but most of the time, you do not have the luxury of having only one choke point of a defense position to maintain, so enemies will inevitably get around your one blockade and just wreck your shop from there.

All in all, this means that you're going to be quickly resigning yourself to losing multiple times, not even caring because your extra attempts are all being made in the sake of progress. it makes the limits the game imposes on you less impactful, and at the same time makes you dread each subsequent playthrough of a level as you waste precious seconds rebuilding the damaged infrastructure so you can then ignore it and go back to any actual planning you were doing. In the end, there's no room for originality, and a combination of optimization and overkill is the name of the game. 

I honestly do wish I had better things to say. I do think the game is playing as intended, and that to some extent it can be fun, I just got disappointed quickly when I realized how quickly I was already repeating myself.

By the President of the United States of America:

A Proclamation.

Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:

""That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.

""That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States.""

Now, therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days, from the day first above mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively, are this day in rebellion against the United States, the following, to wit:

Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, (except the Parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James Ascension, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the City of New Orleans) Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth[)], and which excepted parts, are for the present, left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued.

And by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free; and that the Executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.

And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.

And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.

And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the City of Washington, this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh.",1689643421,1689643421,True,1,0,0.325413227081298828,0,True,False,False

I absolutely recommend it if u love these aspects but u have some patience for this game as it may get repetitive having to rebuild half of the factories in each new sector u land on. But if u can get over that its a nice game with a good curve on what is possible aswell on how to build more efficient factories.

If you need theres a few Mods adding a lot of content to the game aswell for further Playthroughs.

1 advice from me tho: dont play too much at once, spread it out a little otherwise the repetitive part gets annoying quickly if u play like 50 hours in a few days.
Aswell its not expensive and if u want u can check it out in the browser first (Free!) and then support here for steam server support and more.",1689201253,1689201253,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very solid conveyor porn with RTS and Tower Defence elements on top. Two planets to play on, with game mechanics so different between the two that it's almost like two entirely separate games. Gameplay does get a bit stale after awhile, as there's practically no story and only a few types of missions, but quantity and variety of maps somewhat makes up for that. Overall the game does a great job scratching the itch for resource management, logistics and number crunching.

The game largely revolves around a split between logistics to gather, process, and transport materials back to your core - the starting building which causes you to lose a map if it is destroyed - and unit management. The current map's resources are used for construction, but the global totals - all cores in all maps - are used for research, which is simply a matter of spending resources to unlock stuff. Tech progression is gated by how far you are into the game, giving a nice learning curve. The game starts out simple as a pure wave-based Tower Defense game but it soon gives you the ability to make units that you can order around like an RTS, opening up the concept of attack maps where you face endless waves until you go and stomp all over the enemy base with your army. From there things progress: better units, more materials, more complex recipes, upgrades, and so on.

Mindustry also contains what is effectively its own sequel, added to the game for free, in the form of a second planet. Erekir is very much like a second game in the same engine, except it's actually part of the same game: total shift in gameplay (much heavier unit focus), completely different resources and buildings, new mechanics, rebalancing, anti-cheese measures, and overall a very different experience. It's much harder than Serpulo (the first planet) but in a good way, requiring you to be good at prioritizing, setting up construction quickly, and picking your targets and attacks carefully.

Absolutely recommended, especially at $10 which is criminally underpricing itself.",1686325893,1686325983,True,30,0,0.735436201095581055,0,True,False,False

The management of one's base, resources, energy production and strategy to succeed are excellent and make it a highly recommended game (especially at the price it is sold at). 

HOWEVER, I think it would be good to focus on some ""flaws"" that could make it really better and in my opinion of a much higher level.

1. the movements of the units are not up to the mark: in complicated and crowded situations the units get stuck inexorably and have to be managed by intervening manually

2. I would have expected the classic controls on the units typical of RTS (said that here is very nice the possibility to command directly the single unit) that instead are lacking: attack, stay on defense, attack only if engaged, patrol a certain path, return to a point automatically (usually repair) if critically damaged etc etc (here there would be really a lot to do and it would take very little to make the game really superior). Lacks the ability to automatically deploy units on certain formations etc. It lacks the ability to tell for example certain units to follow another one to remain in its defense (example: it would have been very useful to allow you to directly command a vanquish and keep for example a locus team at a distance in its own defense) etc etc. 

3. also defense turrets side it would be nice to be able to give some more evolved commands... attack only certain enemy units (useless to dump or waste resources of powerful turrets on weak units...), attack only if the enemy enters a particular zone configurable for each turret, attack with a certain cadence a certain point in your range etc etc

Firstly the menus could be better if compressed or made more digestible. There's 2 ""generate"" menus and they could easily be squished into one. The only difference between the two I have found is that one allows you to apply the generation like you drew it onto the map, and the other does it when you play-test it (or publish it).

To add onto the compressed/digestible menus, the left side of the map editor, right below the 2 buttons ""Center"" and ""Walls to cliffs"" there's empty space. Some of the menus when you press ""Esc"" (or the button at the top left of the editor) could be moved there. For example the play-test, save map, and all 4 of the menus in ""map info"". It's not the best option for a new menu but it's something to start with.

I wish (at least some) modifiers are live in the map editor. The mirror modifier would be much easier to use if the changes were live in the map editor. I don't know the limitations of the engine, but it would be nice to be able to see the blocks do that blend effect live in the editor.

The blocks on the right side of the map editor are really messy and hard to find, the only thing that helps with this is the search bar above it. Making categories would help greatly in this regard- specifically separating the 2 campaigns buildings.

watching your defense shred enemies in .1 seconds because you went to 175 right after craters and unlocked mid game turrets in the early game.

Creating and optimizing solutions to problems is crucial, and each sector requires higher and higher levels of thinking. I bought this game after playing it for free (from the game's GitHub/Itch.io), simply to support the developer.

The campaign is well planned, thought out, and non-linear. You are a rogue mech, your faction has been shred apart and spread across the equator of a war-torn, spore-infested planet. On the poles lives the enemy. You must invade their bases and capture their sectors. Scavenge for resources, craft stronger items, build stronger defenses. You can strictly follow story sectors and never stray to other bases, or you can capture the entire equator before interacting with the enemy, creating mass production bases, eventually being able to launch those resources to your sectors under attack. It's an unparalleled experience I would never give up.

Engineering has a high precedence in this game. You need to build the most efficient systems you can, while still defending your base. You can make Surge Alloy, the most valuable resource, simply using scrap, found on nearly all sectors. Logic extends this tenfold by allowing you to control buildings based on conditions. For example, when a Thorium Reactor starts to heat up, you can disable it with a logic processor until there is enough cryofluid to cool it down.

Mindustry is a very easy but very extensible game to mod, due to it's versatile mod types. You can place configuration files and images in a folder and have a working factory for custom items in no time. You can then attach JS scripts for special behaviour. If you want to get more advanced and dig deep into the game, you can fully make mods with Java. Many great mods have been made that extend the limits of the game, such as BetaMindy and Project Unity.

Overall, I highly enjoy Mindustry, and I hope to complete the campaign soon.",1682010184,1682010184,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Mindustry is a good mix of tower defense and Factorio-like resource automation. You can either play the two big campaigns or use the Steam Workshop to find thousands of maps to play for free. Or use the map designer to create your own maps.

In Mindustry you have to free a sector by building up your defense and surviving mob waves. As you progress, you get to unlock new units, towers and technologies from the tech-tree, using the resources you harvested. Once you’ve freed a sector, you can move on to the next, but you continue to gather resources from a freed sector, allowing you to use those to progress faster through the tech-tree and get a better starting base.

[h1]Who is Mindustry for?[/h1]

If you do enjoy casual-oriented automation games AND/OR tower defense games, Mindustry might be for you. However, if you’re looking for a Factorio clone with heavy focus on automation, planning and doing some math, Mindustry won’t scratch that itch.

[/h1]Are there annoying/negative aspects I should know about?[/h1]

I am not a big fan of the pacing and the degree of difficulty: Especially in the early missions your defense will be ‘done’ by wave 8, but you need to sit through 35 waves total. And then suddenly the last wave will have a stupid boss or units you’ve not encountered before. They will not only wreck your whole defense, but also destroy your main base. So you will have to start the mission again, this time getting special defense for the last wave. Which is annoying and frustrating.

Also, some UI-stuff could be better, I guess.

[h1]Should I buy Mindustry?[/h1]

There are currently 18 different turrets, 35+ units to control and 2 big campaigns to play through. I bought the game in a Steam Sale for 2 bucks and I don’t regret it at all. The game is also free on mobile and you can find a free version on itch.io. The Steam version however has achievements, the Steam Workshop, and easy multiplayer access. If you want to play with friends, even 10 bucks is a fair price.

But there are some flaws that are very obvious and makes the game very tricky to play well and makes optimizing your base extremely tedious. 

A few of the problems are how conveyor belts, splitters and bridges work when places in vicinity to each other. If you build two bridge blocks close to each other, they will bridge whether you want it or not, so you cant place a splitter between two bridges. The unwanted bridge can not be removed without shifting it to the side, which means that making compact bases is very hard compared to similar games.

Another big problem, and the reason I stopped playing after 100ish hours, is the lack of graphs and statistics. If you have a huge base and power draw seems big, there's no way of seeing what buildings draw how much power. There is no way to easily switch off a building. You could remove the power distribution, but due to how they work, you'll probably disconnect a bunch of other things that you didn't want to.

There is also nothing that stops your factories from producing things that are no longer needed. You could have a full base, a full supply line, and despite not having the ability to absorb or use any of the materials, they are simply moved into your base and anything above the storage limit gets destroyed. That means your production lines draw 100% power, even when you can't use the products.

If you treat it like an RTS with tower defense mechanics, you'll most likely enjoy it. Unfortunately, it's right now being sold as a ""factory-building game with tower defense and RTS elements"", and these problems make the game fall quite short of this description.",1680720861,1680720861,False,3,0,0.51804119348526001,1,True,False,False

Mindustry is a genius approach of resource gathering and management with tower defense element. Don't let the graphics fool you! This game is Open-source made with small group and a huge community building mods and finding tricks and writing guides to be most efficient in the game. 

Surprisingly, this game is very addictive with giant tech tree to research, many units to create and control, vast resource gathering, procedural world map to select mission from and many other things. 

You can play this game online PVP or PVE or any other type of game anyone made but you need to play on dedicated servers.

About update 7.0:
WOW! I'm shocked with this amount of content the creator packed with this update. Update 7.0 adds a new planet with complete different buildings and units and mechanics. It can be its own separate game or be called Mindustry 2! I just started it but even at the beginning I was shock how mechanics are the same at their bone but in another shape.

On top of this, if you want to instantly have access to the all the items without having to deal with research (with the downside of not being able to go to new areas) you can use freeplay/custom mode to do this.

Public Servers

I spent many afternoons/nights in the past on servers problem solving & working towards constant growth.

This however did not last long. Ever since the implementation of schematics and the easy availability of absolutely anyone experienced or not in making use of schematics from places like the internet and the steam workshop very easily. This is a blessing and a curse. Most people who end up relying on them do not understand how they work/function and this really skews that past experience of collaborating with strangers while having a sort of expectation of who you will meet and what you can learn. Now it is an endless uphill battle if your goal is complete understanding like I do.

It went from moments of everyone trying to figure out problems through the challenges of the maps to most people having everything solved and right out the gate copy pasting a massive schematic that self sustain beats the level or solves a massive challenge of the level in a matter of a few clicks.

The Experience

This indeed is a game better with others, though at this current time, only with at least one or more dedicated friends. Trying to complete later levels on your own without proper planning and/or the use of some schematics ends up being quite the slog. Though being able to expect failure for the first go at a level will enable you to succeed eventually. You can easily rebuild with the ""B"" binding, this makes it still enjoyable and viable but suited to the more dedicated. The base of solo players to be able to go lengths with it will be very low imo.

As a casual game, this will bring good fun and challenge for a few sessions. Though expect if you want to dive deeper into the layered additions in additive content, the complexity will ramp up linearly. It's difficult to recommend this if you do not have at least a friend, (preferably more) of friends dedicated to learning at least a bit.

Disclaimers, Warnings, Counters/Rebuttals

Progression is not shared, all tech, resources, and world progression goes to the host. This is unfortunate and a shame.

There is a tedious loop that will bore many and quickly. The engaging nature of this game only lies when you push past repetitive parts that keep appearing in the game and new challenges appear only when you drag though that which leaves most and many to be bored and put it down. The more likely reality is a friend will drag you through their progression and you will be left feeling exactly that if you don't find your own charm in the game. You will feel dragged through dirt.

RTS elements and the UI is weak. The RTS is minimal at best, I have also found that I am asked where is this building where is that item all the time. The tutorial as well does a poor job in showing where things are. Most of the game's actions are hidden behind keybinds and smooshed into the bottom right of the screen. Unobtrusive & Immersive, yes. Unintuitive & Tedious, yes.

Who should play it and why

There is a little bit for each person whether it's the RTS elements, Tower defense elements, or Base Building/Automation & Resource Management elements. Some good complexity without being overwhelming or forcing you into a crawling state for too long. (You can skip waves at your own pace, if you fail you don't restart at zero. You see all your old builds and can use, ""B"" to quickly rebuild everything."")

I have no hesitation to recommend the game. It's base price was $6 USD but has moved to $10 USD, no doubt still worth it.

[b] Graphics: 4/5 [/b]
Simple, readable, runs well on lower systems, smooth. I enjoy it.

[b] Gameplay: 4.5/5 [/b]
Can get repetitive, though that's why in my eyes this game can shine. There are at least three distinctive ways you can play this game and it shines the most in Base Assault levels cooperatively with others. I hope you get the chance to dig into that and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

[b] Music: 3/5 [/b]
It's fitting and works, nothing special.

[b] Replayability & Longevity: 4/5 [/b]
Simple, I keep coming back to it. Such a small simple game that has depth and complexity.

[b] Quality & Experience: 5/5 [/b]
Love it, get a friend or community and play it. For the more hardcore, give it a try solo if you are patient. I have enjoyed it a lot in the past, I still have some good fun now.",1571757572,1680356629,True,4,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

- Add procedurally generated worlds (I do not remember, whether they were in the mobile version.)
- Also in mobile version there was this 4th gamemode, which name I don't remember. But in that gamemode you didn't have wave timer or infinite resources. So it was like sandbox, but you didn't have unlimited resources. I loved that gamemode and I don't understand why it doesn't exist anymore.

I will talk about Campaign because it is what I have been playing the most. In campaign the main goal is too keep control over many other planets. The way you do that is by first gathering some materials, second setting up a defense to ""take over"" the planet, to ""take over"" the planet you must finish off all the waves that come at quite a rapid pace so you cannot hesitate to start your defense. But after you took over the planet you can increase your production, research new things and also go onto the next island or manage previous ones.

It's made a single choice I intensely dislike and has some rough-around-the-edges programming, but the core gameplay is really good so it mostly makes up for it.

As far as logistics games go, Factorio is king.  It's a perfect blend between logistics progression and the tower defense mechanics needed to defend your base.  Way over on the other side of the spectrum, you have Satisfactory -- this is all logistics and building based, with almost zero threat.  There's also some fun exploration elements mixed in.  

Mindustry is kind of like taking Factorio in the opposite direction of Satisfactory.  What is Factorio was ALL combat and tower defense?  That's essentially what you have here, and it's done really well.

You will slowly take over zones, each a different map, by landing there, gathering resources, building towers to defend the waves, and the moving on.  Some zones have more or less supplies, or could be missing a key resource compeltely, changing how you have to defend.  They will also have harder or weaker defenses depending on how many enemy bases are nearby, but this is basically what you get -- repeat that clear-a-zone process for an entire planet and you got yourself a game.  

This is mixed up a bit by enemy bases, which are done in a really cool way -- they are functional factories exactly as you would build them that you have to invade.  This is the most interesting part of the game in my opinion.  You get these RTS-style units to take them down, which feel a little clunky at first but eventually I got the hang of them.  The factories are really interesting to approach, because they'll have a mix of air and ground weaponry and you have to use the right troops in the right way to get through.  An example would be that you might dive in and bomb the turrets, but you'll lose a lot of troops that was, so sometimes you can snipe out a single unguarded conveyor belt that is feeding those towers with ammo instead.   Then you can do strategic drive-bys to waste the ammo in the turrets and disable them that way.  Since so many turrets rely on an ammo input, water tube or electrical pole, there are a lot of ways to approach the factory assault levels and I find them really fun to attempt.

There's a bit of a grind to this gameplay though -- you're gonna want to be the kind of person that sees 100 pretty-similar maps and wants to clear them all to get the most out of this game.  I believe you can kinda streamline this and only target maps with enemy bases, but I haven't tried that.  The benefit of taking the whole map is you can start shipping out the resources to your newer factories, so it gives them some value to clear beyond just completionism.  I find the easier maps fun to do while watching a movie or doing something else to distact me, and I usually take on the harder maps for a more concentrated experience.

Now, for the bad.  One glaring issue is that this game is un-minimizable.  Why?  I'm very used to not being able to minimize my games, but that's usually becasue I play oldschool broken games that need Windows XP compatibility mode to even launch.  If I'm trying to run something from 2004 and it crashes when I minimize it, I blame myself for not having a computer from 2004.  Mindustry is a modern game with no excuses and seemingly no plans on fixing it, so if you're playing this game, prepare to have your computer held hostage until you're done with it.

The choice they made that I absolutely hate is the decision to erase all your plans when you die.  Oh my God, what a terrible design decision.  This almost ruins the game for me.

This game, in single-player at least, is very much a game of ""pause at the start and plan all your buildings out in schematics for 30 minutes"".  People that have started a bunch of new RimWorld colonies know the experience -- you barely start playing that game until an hour after going into creating a new world because of all the setup a new map requires to approach it properly.  This is similar -- you can plan out everything, and doing so is often very advantageous because you won't screw yourself on space or resources if you plan ahead for it.  I can't tell you how many times I forgot about one of the various coal byproducts and had to jam it somewhere stupid afterwards before I realized you can pause and plan it all out at the start.

The issue here is you can die and if you do, the game erases all of your plans.  Again, WHY?  What a terrible punishment.  You don't lose any resources, you don't lose any limited lives, you just lose all your planning work for NO REASON other than to be punished for dying I guess?  You might say, well don't die then, but it's not really about that in this game.  There is zero punishment to dying besides having your plans cleared and it's easy to do by accident.  This is a game where just looking around the map at the enemy's base can get you sniped out, or you can get randomly gibbed by passing enemies while you're in a menu looking for something.. the fact you don't typically fight directly in this game means you don't really consider your life very valuable.  In fact, the game doesn't either -- as I said, there's no punishment except losing all the time you spent planning, which is not even a mechanical downside, because you can just pause and plan it all again.  It's literally the game telling you your time is worthless to them and they don't respect you and basically nothing else.  This is doubly frustrating when there's a keybind to suicide your ship that will also kill all these plans.  WHY???

I've quit playing multiple times for weeks because some big base I planned for an hour got erased for no reason by a developer that doesn't understand how to add a compelling downside to dying and instead went for the most frustrating dumb solution they could instantly think of, and that reason alone (and partially the lack of ability to minimize a modern game) is why I don't recommend the product.  The rest of it is solid though, so if you think you can get past those downsides, you'll probably enjoy it.",1674592796,1678108696,False,0,1,0.462598413228988647,0,True,False,False

There's a lot of resources, then you refine them into more complex thing, you also had a fk tons of tower to defence your base with, the research tree ! It's like the chocolate box, you don't know what you can unlock next unless you know the spoiler, and watch online stuffs

But you extract, process, and refine resources from the terrain to build up your defenses, like it's a factory game.  The main planet has over 200 sectors.  In each sector, you must fight off varying numbers of waves to capture it.  Captured sectors remain safe until the enemy decides to attack again at some point if there's a nearby enemy base sector.  All sectors produce their resources simultaneously; nothing gets paused if you visit another sector.  Use your total accumulated resources to unlock new technology such as conveyor belts, turrets, walls, mining drills, combat/utility drones, cores (the building you must protect), and more.  The gameplay progression is quite long.  You start out small, having weak tech, but after many hours you may finally acquire more advanced things that are incredibly powerful.  Each turret, enemy, and combat/utility drone is of a certain tier.  I think there are six tiers in total?  I haven't gotten that far yet.  To conquer all available sectors, you'd have to spend hundreds of hours fighting off hordes of difficult enemies.  Some sectors are enemy bases, where you're the one attacking them, so you send in heavily armed drones to do the damage.  Also, there's PROGRAMMING LOGIC!  You can do so much with the very few tools you're given to program things.  There's actually almost no limit to what you can do.  It's incredibly versatile.

What sets Mindustry apart is its powerful scripting system. With this system, you can program your factories to operate with maximum efficiency and deal with enemy attacks. It's incredibly satisfying to see your automated system work flawlessly, and it's even more satisfying to know that you're the one who wrote the code behind it.

And it's not just the programming that makes Mindustry addictive. The game has a perfect balance of challenging gameplay and rewarding mechanics. You'll need to think strategically to defend your base against waves of enemy attacks while managing your resources and production lines.

The game also has an active and passionate community that has created some incredible custom maps and scenarios. But what really stands out is the level of detail that players have put into their scripts. From simple conveyor belt optimizations to complex enemy AI routines, the community has pushed the limits of what's possible in the game.

The developers of Mindustry have been consistently pushing out updates and new content, making it clear that they're committed to creating the best game possible. The game is well-polished and stable, with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to get started.

In summary, if you're a fan of programming and industrial automation, Mindustry is the game for you.

It's definitely got more of a charm than Factorio did in my opinion - a combination of the graphics style and the gameplay. I had a ton of fun playing through the new campaign, and beating the final enemy base with a friend was a great experience. The campaign that was recently released - version 7.0 - added an entire planet with a new system of enemies, blocks, items, weapons etc. - it's really well balanced, easy to get in to, and provides a good challenge from start to finish.

However - that's the new campaign. The game has two, the first of which being brutally difficult to the point of being borderline impossible. You begin with a small and modest tech tree, slowly exploring the concept of production and weapons and eventually power. Those three concepts power the base of Mindustry - get things into the core, build units and weapons to defend it. On a per-level basis - this is fine. Beating the final waves of enemies is fun, and capturing a sector is challenging but good. The problems begin with the 'invasion' mechanic. Essentially, you capture a main area of the game, and suddenly every hexagon space around it shows up in red. This means you need to go to every one of them and capture the sector there. So you launch, set up a base, and begin working. These areas are randomly generated too, so it's completely up to random luck if you get a decent base with good working conditions, or are almost immediately screwed over.

As you're playing, you'll get to a certain point and suddenly you get an alert at the top - 'sector lost'. Confused, you check the map, and the area you were just playing in has at some point been 'invaded' - the core will have blown up, everything around will be destroyed, and you won't now have the materials to rebuild. And the waves will be coming in every minute, then every half minute, and then eventually every 20 seconds. Sending larger and larger units, until eventually they're sending in enormous ships which just bomb the entire base and you can't do anything about it. You could build huge unit production facilities to build ships that are just as big - however once a sector is lost, you spend more time rebuilding it and getting it back up online than you do expanding it, so it just becomes a game of diminishing returns. Once you spend hours and hours building a base, just to have it randomly get blown up by enemy units faaaar above where you're currently at, you quickly lose interest in the game.

There is a 'pause' feature in the game which allows you to stop everything and fly around planning stuff, but you can only build when the game is unpaused. This is fine to plan things but it almost proves a point about the (unfortunate) way you're hinted to play the game - spend more time panic planning to have a slim chance of winning instead of just playing it in real time and having a reasonable amount of time to plan and defend your base. Even with two players pausing for 10-15 minutes at a time and building up insanely armored, back-to-back-gun defended areas of the base, by wave 90 they're sending in so many huge mechs and ships that you have absolutely no chance.

I want to believe that the new campaign was created and balanced with what I've mentioned in mind from day one. If that's the case - perfect. I'll still recommend this game even despite what I've said, but if you're wanting a laid-back fun base building game, this isn't it. You will be enraged to see 5 hours of your time get nuked by a huge green ship you haven't even unlocked yet. If you want a challenge, play the new campaign. It kinda breaks my heart to say this as I had tons of fun playing through the game with a friend, and over the weeks of playing the old campaign it turned from a 'let's play Mindustry' to just a 'let's see if we can get any further on that level' - to then just watch everything get blown up and give up and play something else. I'm always up for a challenge in these games, but parts of this game are borderline impossible.

Still very, very replayable.

The factory building is simple, like a slightly easier version of factorio, with more focus on tower defense. You do need to build a *lot* of factories if you're planning on actually beating the game on Surpelo, due to requiring a high amount of high tier resources to beat the last few sectors in the campaign. Erekir's campaign is more difficult and works more like individual missions instead of the 4X style Surpelo has, though it does feel a bit weird having a research tree on that planet when you cant transfer resources between sectors and thus progress in previous ones has no impact on the game beyond the research tree.

The pacing is fine at first, but gets boring quite fast, the waves are just growing numbers of the same enemy, so instead of wisely choosing towers you have to have multiple lines of defense, and design for density of towers and walls, which is fine, but rebuild times are pretty long so it quickly turns into routine.

The thing that made me stop playing further are the bugs, although I am playing on Linux so they might be OS specific:
Left click is constantly bugging out - instead of placing a single tower it starts ""hold"" behavior, two tile hold only places one tower and so on, very annoying.
When rebuilding with B, one in ten power lines are randomly not being connected and you have to demolish and rebuild them.

I have not yet had a chance to try it out.  This was already a positive review, just leaving this note that its out of date until I can try out the new features.
EDIT:8/22/2022: Unit control ain't half bad.  [strike]I have quite a few complaints about the new planet, but considering its in alpha, Ill wait for a full release before talking about it here.[/strike]
EDIT: 1/27/2023: Consider this a negative review of the second planet.  To keep it short, the new game mechanics are largely just a nuisance that offer nothing new, and the missions are EXTREMELY strategy forced and filled with trial and error.  It feels as if you are expected to play missions in the only ""valid and correct"" way.  You will constantly have intel hidden away from you resulting in you getting killed by things you couldn't have known about and prepare for.
Unit control is still cool.

I feel like I burned myself out with how much I played for the sake of achievements, but at $6 I would feel stupid not recommending this.  Campaign is a chill grind, online runs nice, good chunk of modded content to try out, can use custom wave survival for some sandbox replay value.  Base construction is simpler/more approachable than something like Factorio. Definitely got my moneys worth.

My main complaints:
-Many PvP servers allow schematics to be used, which personally makes it feel like the base layout aspect of the game is pointless.  Having commonly downloaded, highly efficient and compact schematics makes me feel like I would rather just play a regular RTS game.  
-Wish there was an easier way to copy snippets of code.  You can save code as part of a schematic or import from a text file, but I would like to import/save reusable snippets in game so I could quickly apply the same logic in different use cases.  Mostly because>
-Mobile unit control is so stupid and basic.  I know its not the focus of the game, but there should really be more default command options. In RTS terms, your options are attack move with the most direct path to the enemy core, regroup to the closest command center, and remain idle.  These options apply to ALL UNITS ACROSS THE MAP.

There is also modding to either change up textures and audio, or add full-on massive additions to spice up the fun of the game. Alongside it, the ways to play co-op like the campaign can be loads of fun and are a pretty nice test of cooperation with other players, especially friends.

It's very complicated, while being open enough to anyone patient enough to be far more accessible than a game like factorio. The tower defense mixed with the factory building mechanics coupled with the mid game ability to start sending resources from one map to another, allows you to create some truly wacky and ""unnecessary"" defense builds. Capturing a map and turning into another production line to feed into my war machine is always satisfying and sending my massive pool of resources to an enemy base to take it over with a hoard of my own drones, tanks, giga space ships, and mechs is just fun, seeing all the chaos of the ""final take"" unfold as you watch your armies collide. The pvp is fun and methodical and is a more simpler RTS experience than something like starcraft 2. The mod support naively and through the workshop is amazing, adding hundreds of hours of new content to the game, and the community servers are  very welcoming and I've been having a fun time learning pvp strats on them.

unit control has always been a bit over simplified or script driven, with the exception of leading units directly into battle...which allowed for unique strategies and successful destroying of enemy bases. now units will no longer follow you in formation and are literally too dumb to walk through a gate...units are now effectively useless unless you build up to max tier on each level because a coordinated attach with smaller units is completely impossible.

It has everything from tower defense, RTS units, a campaign map, multiplayer, and a brilliant/elegant machine/conveyor interface system that avoids the usual cludge of inserters or input/output slots. But the visual design was clumsy (a lot of grey squares with slightly different grey pixel art) and the campaign map, while a fine sandbox for the tools provided, quickly becomes unbalanced and unable to provide interesting challenges.

All of these criticisms were fixed with the release of Erekir in v7, down to the blocks having much more distinct design involving bold colors and readable silhouettes. Towers are bigger, more expensive, and more specialized (with less overlap) and units all have distinct niches due to their movement and attack abilities in addition to being more interesting to construct. The maps themselves take advantage of this more impactful design and are more like a professionally designed RTS campaign, complete with fully formed enemy bases that have their own (100% functional) factories and chokepoints.

If I have remaining criticisms it's that the build speed is too slow (waiting around for endgame structures to build might be balanced but it isn't fun) and that the line of sight on units is too low as many of them have attack ranges that are significantly longer leading to fights that you can't actually see.",1672200915,1672200915,True,14,0,0.670795857906341553,0,True,False,False

The game's first planet, before version 7.0, has better levels. There's enough things to do on a map for a group in multiplayer. The first planet has terrible unit control and objectives. It plays more like a speed-run puzzle game, as there are only specific ways to win and you are constantly against the clock with waves that get harder and harder.

The game's second planet, version 7.0, has, in my opinion, better mining, building, production, and unit control. The only flaw of the second planet, is that a new objective system was created that gates off the map until the previous objective is completed and you have no idea what the next objective will be. One map the game just tells you that your main base is going to be nuked in 5 minutes or so. If you have no resources, then you will likely lose and will have to play the whole map over again now knowing the nuke will happen and can prepare for it, which is just a waste of time... This is compounded with the fact that the maps are void of resources. It seems to be overly balanced for single player and to be intentionally limiting. There is just nothing for other players to do.

Overall, I enjoy building in the game and the combat of the second planet is fun, but the first planet's end game is atrocious and the second planet's resource-scarce, multiplayer-unfriendly and punishing secret objective-based maps are not fun.",1672114899,1672114899,False,0,0,0.473684221506118774,0,True,False,False

It can take hours to build bases in this game. Especially the further you get in the tech tree.

Instead of introducing new mechanics. The campaign throws some new unit at you that you've never seen before without warning that just walks in the back of your base, bypasses all your defenses, and kills your core. Forcing you to restart the level, 1-2 hours of progress. 

There are no save points you have to learn the hard way making you repeat hours and hours of game play.

The AI will bug out and stop sending attack waves. Which seems fine, until you realize these attack waves have still been spawning infinitely. So next time you attack the enemy base you'll be met with an army 20x the size of yours and it will crush any defense you've made and kill you. Restart.

They'll throw in random mechanics like, after spending 2 hours on a map, they'll just nuke your entire base. All gone, forcing you to start from scratch 2 hours into building, then 30 mins later throw new units at you that are three times as strong as the units you can make. (Again without any hint it's coming.) That, again, just fly over/past/around all defenses you have and kill your core before you can make any pivot to stop them. Restart.

If you could introduce new mechanics without resetting hours of progress EVERY TIME, that'd be great.",1671835923,1671838011,False,3,1,0.461821973323822021,0,True,False,False

 1. Mine for Cu and make copper cannonballs to shoot from copper cannons and I deliver said ammo to the cannons using copper conveyor belts. Watch enemy tanks explode.
 2. Mine for Pb and build antiaircraft guns that shoot lead bullets and I use the copper conveyor belts to feed ammo to the guns. Watch enemy aircraft explode.
 3. Mine for Coal, burn some in a combustion reactor to make electricity, compress some into graphite.
 4, Mine for Sand, make some Glass in the Kiln, make some Silicon in the furnace.
 5. Drill for water or use a water pump from a nearby stream. Water is used for cooling, putting out fires, hosing down enemy droids before you spark them with electric jolts. Watch enemy droids sizzle.
 6. Build a steam engine, a pneumatic drill for Ti, droids of all types, and a plethora of other items.
 7. Mine for Ti, Titanium is used for high-speed conveyors and other high tech components.
 8. Build massive steam-powered factories to mass-produce graphite, silicon, glass, droids, aircraft, tanks.
 9. Mine for Scrap, use as ammo in antiaircraft or meltdown into molten slag, store in tanks, use to spray molten metal on enemy droids, and send to an extractor for Cu, Pd, Ti. Watch enemy droids melt down.
 10. Mine for Th, Thorium is used in high tech aircraft and highly advanced technology.
 11. Mix Ti and H₂O to make CryoFluid, fill the CryoFluid tank. 
 12. Mix Th and CryoFluid in Thorium reactor to make large amounts of electricity.

At this point, the enemy boss shows up, blows up the power line that powers the water pump that fills the tank that feeds the CryoFluid factory, the CryoFluid tank goes empty, the Thorium Reactor continues to make vast amounts of electricity but with no cooling, it overheats, the core has a meltdown, my base explodes.

I need a fault-tolerant electrical distribution grid that maintains power for critical systems, we have a diode for that. I also need the reactor to be far away from my base. Back to the schematics for another try.

This game is extremely addictive.

[h2]Update after almost 2000 hours of play and release of v7.0[/h2]

There is only one way to play this game, the [b]ISO 9000[/b] way.

ISO 9000 is an international quality assurance standard which can be summarized with a quote from Horton from the book, [i]Horton Has an Egg[/i]. “I said what I will do and I will do as I say.”

So my suggestion is to use a notebook and regularly pause the game to evaluate, and record progress made, long-term and short-term goals, prioritize and schedule.

It is in the nature of the game that you must be able to multitask, but multitasking can also distract you from high-priority goals. Making a list helps you keep the most important things as the most important things.

When you first land on a planet, you are briefed on what to expect and how to proceed. But until you land, you do not know for certain what has to begin. Until you explore, you do not know the map, and until you engage the enemy, you do not know what to expect.

After you have landed, you know what you will be starting with and what facilities you have. Once you have explored, you know where the minerals are located, and once your base has been destroyed you know how they are going to attack.

You may go back to a previous base to do research before your return but when you return, you know what to expect. You have a plan, and you may even have the schematics as well.

SERPULO is a place where u need to build some cleverly designed factories to maximize production & transportation capacity in order to defense and build units to attack on a new sector (also late-game research could also cost a lot of high-tier materials [spoiler]and SILICON[/spoiler]).

EREKIR in v7 update, however, is a different place with a different tech tree and different mechanisms.

A note on the latest update: Despite the dev's best effort I still think the original campaign is still the best automation game experience. However, I can see how the new one is designed like an actual linear RTS campaign teaching you all the features in a sensible manner. And I see how these features are very streamlined which... honestly makes me want to try this version in PvP with friends. Like, it's not as good of an automation game but it's a much better kind of weird hybrid with a rts. (The research and grinding of resources is just useless in this new campaign tho, like please remove it, it serves no purpose.)

Last note, please add tags for the planets on workshop items, it's impossible to filter them if makers didn't put the planet name in the title.

Edit: Yes i keep returning every so often in hopes that the developer has implemented features that have cleansed the horrendous multiplayer experience.

Update Dec 4 2022:

Multiplayer is still toxic as ever. Trolls joining servers only to destroy production facilities and defenses resulting in the enemy overwhelming the map  destroying everything forcing the game to end, kick vote abusers, toxic children that clearly raised in the jungle without parents or proper discipline. The list goes on and on.


Update July 17, 2022

The new V7 alpha solo campaign is fun. The multiplayer community is still toxic as ever. Play multiplayer at your own risk.

Updated Review Oct 17 2020: 

It's been eleven months since I last played.  The community is still toxic as ever with it's  vote kick abusers and rampant griefers sabotaging multiplayer servers.

I will review again after the 6.0 update which brings major changes to the campaign.

Original review:

I have been playing Mindustry on Itch.io for over a year before the Steam release. It was quiet and fun and the community was very friendly. 

The single player campaign is fun but easy and can be completed in a matter of hours.

The Steam release ruined the game with Steams abhorrently toxic community. Multiplayer is now a toxic haven for griefers and people abusing kick votes.

The Steam release ruined multiplayer as it usually does for most games.",1575065860,1670191071,False,0,1,0.451127827167510986,0,True,False,False

I recommend it for people who like logistics-focused base building games, as the gameplay largely centers around gathering resources on the map and developing grids of conveyors, pipes, etc. to bring them back to your base or deliver them to structures that can produce more complex materials, ammunition, and fuel. These materials are then used to build your base and armies to defend against waves of enemies.

The recent update offers a different take on the gameplay basics with a second world to explore/conquer, offering a greater variety of game experience. While I've only just started with this second world, one thing I like over the first is the ability to control the units you construct more directly. Other changes include the way in which resources are mined, requiring different approaches to your layout.

One downside is that after you unlock a number of the structures and units via the Research screen, the maps can feel a little same-y. There's little in the way of terrain obstacle variety, apart from different map choke points and bodies of liquid. This can become tedious if you're trying to win all of the sectors on the planets. However, you don't have to start completely from scratch each time, as you are able to send resources from your other sectors to kick-start your new base's industry, or to bring in resources that are completely absent in the new map.

Overall, it's a fun game that's easier to get into than screenshots make it look. It's a good game for playing in sessions, then putting down for a bit and coming back later.",1669695758,1669695758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can have friends or strangers join your campaign at any time you choose to. There is also some PvP, though I haven't tried it yet.

The game keeps getting bigger and better with every update, it has been updated for years now, and it is still one of my favourite games.

Current campaign (V7) is excellent and extremely fun in its own right, but serves more as a tutorial for multiplayer, where the real meat of the game is. The community is tight-knit but easy to integrate with if you have enough time on your hands, and the modding scene is excellent. The game does have some unwritten rules (NO ROUTER CHAINING), and players seeking to start designing schematics may find little community support, but there are players who will help you learn the ropes. If you want, you can even DM me and I'll try to teach you. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, cerebral time with an incredible game that has practically defined a genre of its own.

Played it for several years.

The game is self explanatory, it has a great tutorial. Might seem a pretty dense  game but it's rather accessible with a good difficulty curve.
The sprites and effects are good and it's a very lightweight and replayable game. It even has multiplayer and mod support.

From many hour on the game, pre-steam bought and from itch or github builds

i can say that this game is majorly fun, but unfortunately as of now the lack of in game tutorial as of now, it would be a major learning curve for new players, thankfully i have taught my self, watched some youtube tutorials, played the older versions with the basic tutorial, but the learning curve aside the skill ceiling is really high from the solo campaign or maps alone, and even more with the creation and implementation of logic, and another if 1v1 and high player amount multiplayer hivemind is another kind of ceiling required 

would recommend! already spent like 292+ hour on itch before buying on steam to easily play with freinds

It's a base building game with unlimited resources but you can only harvest as fast as your harvest building is. So there is a balance.
Yes you will get faster belts and it will make a difference. After that it takes a bit too long to get new belts. Had to install a mod for it.

For the combat part. Turrets are everything. The Salvo turret will most likely be your go to turret for most maps in the start. It's powerful, uses Copper and has decent range. The ground laser turret is also neat. High damage.
You get stronger turrets later on and you can start using them.

Now for the Guardian enemy that shows up. There is no such thing as ""Too little Defense"". Can you fit more turrets into your choke point? Put more turrets there. That Guardian on later levels will eat up your bullets as if you are throwing pebbles at it.

I don't really regret the time I spent playing it and it was certainly very reasonably priced, but it is disappointing in a number of crucial ways that have caused me to lose interest in it long before I have unlocked all of the game's ""content"".

The biggest problem is that Mindustry seems to have quite a lot of contempt toward how valuable your time is. When you unlock a new tier of technologies the game [i]could[/i] simply give them all to you right away. Instead, it asks that you accrue enormous quantities of resources with which to buy them. And so you wait, and wait, and wait... eventually letting your factories run afk for significant periods of time accumulating the resources required. It doesn't change anything about how the game plays at all, it just adds enormously unnecessary dead time to the experience.

The ""campaign"" too, such as it is, comes packed with dreary and needless repetition whether you're just starting out or entering the endgame. Factorio for example asks you to slowly expand across a single contiguous game space, slowly unlocking new technologies and resources as you push deeper into an increasingly hostile world. This progression perfectly matches the cadence of the gameplay wherein new challenges come in lockstep with new capabilities. By contrast, Mindustry asks you to defeat a small play area so that you can... do that again under very similar circumstances somewhere else. There's some connectivity allowed between sectors, but this system seems like a clumsy fit for the moment to moment mechanics of the game.

None of this is helped by the extremely simplistic wave defence that forms the core gameplay loop. There's no indication of what units are about to attack and no indication whether it will be a ground or air attack, which is initially annoying until you realise it's utterly irrelevant. Rather than assaulting you in a pitched battle that attempts to penetrate your fortifications, the most threatening enemies appear to be the ones that can simply walk or fly over your defences and keep heading for the core regardless of where you have placed walls. The net result is that you end up arraying such enormous firepower against them that every single hostile unit is vapourised seconds after setting foot on the map. It's tremendously anticlimactic. If you were genuinely able to wall out your attackers they could be made much tougher, more numerous or both and result in longer, more exciting and more interesting engagements. In my play time a battle amounted to little more than a handful of hostile units spawning, being immediately bathed in the incandescent glow of a hundred laser cannons and vanishing almost immediately.

Mindustry is not a bad game and plenty of people will be (and clearly have been) able to overlook the issues I have with it, but I cannot give a ""neutral"" or ""your mileage may vary"" score, so here we are. There's a very solid foundation of attractively stylised and pleasingly complex factory construction contained within, but a lot of the stuff hanging off that core doesn't do it justice or seems actively detrimental to player enjoyment.",1668873401,1668873401,False,40,3,0.74603724479675293,2,True,False,False

It's the conveyor-belt hell grind mixed with building units to attack enemy bases. While surviving waves of enemies as a constant threat to your base, you have to manage resources and design efficient systems in order to survive. 

The complexity is just at the right level where it never feels like too much. I think the developer tried to make it more combat focused, where you need actual strategy in order to destroy enemy bases. There is a research tree where you unlock everything in a manner where you're slowly introduced to new mechanics each level. Different units are used for different purposes which allow you to traverse the terrain and infiltrate enemy bases in different ways. Oh, they have a super strong turret right in the front of their base? Just bait the turret with weaker units while sending your strong ones to flank.

Progression has a great pace. Combat is fun, involved, and requires planning/strategy. Resource management and building/designing farms and mines are simple, yet intricate. Multiplayer works amazing and is insanely fun, albeit much easier.

The developer just came out with a huge update that introduces a new planet and a completely new gameplay feel. This update is what makes this game so amazing and is what I'm basing this review off of. The older planet from the previous version of the game, is much different and not as fun IMO. So, everything in this review is strictly about the new update/planet.

You research stuff, based on materials you collect and supply to your core. This unlocks new stuff and materials to work with and you expand the production in order to get new materials and research. All while you have to defend your base from waves of attackers, creating chokepoints and defending your core. No need to design your bases/production layouts but you need to design defensive chokepoints, if you want them to hold enemy at bay.

Coming from a Factorio player, who enjoys complexity and the logistical challenge puzzle of building and organizing a huge factory, this gets really boring, really quick. I bought it from sale for 5 euros and it's worth it. I might play this on and off, but there is no ""Get sucked into this game"" kind of thing, like the Factorio has, at least for me.

I have finished neither game, though, but what can I say: Just play Mindustry. For me, it's much better than the former two, although maybe this depends on what you're trying to achieve.

In Factorio, you just have one huge map, and all you do for the most time is expand the production. You never have enough resources, and you always have to find new ore deposits, protect them, transport them and later use in production. Rinse and repeat. The optimal strategy for Factorio is just to build a straight line. Enemies? Just annihilate them. Cliffs? Explode them. Lakes? Landfill them. Space is almost unlimited, and the only problem for you is another building that you made. The optimal strategy in Factorio is simply to use a bus -- i.e. many conveyors in the straight line near to each other, so that every conveyor carries specific -- and just build all the production around it, getting resources from the bus and returning the result to the bus. When bus is not enough, you make city blocks, etc. Coming up with new design is always interesting, but at some point it becomes a game of Copy-Paste.

In Satisfactory, you just follow the research tree for all of the time, and the existing production is almost enough. I think that if keep just one constructor for making copper sheets on all the time, you'll have enough of them to the end of the game. The only problem in Satisfactory for me was logistics: when there's not enough resource deposits for your production, you need to go for 30 minutes just to find it and find the path to it, after what you can start exploiting it. And that means placing many foundations, many electric pols, conveyors, rails, train stations, conducting pipes and other boring activities. And there's no even copy-paste function out of the box, although it doesn't help much in context of 3D world.

Mindustry, on the other hand, plays differently. In Mindustry, you never feel yourself like a factory worker, doing always the same. Instead, Mindustry makes you build your factory under constant enemy pressure. You're never safe, and your factory is never safe, so you either think fast and understand how to restart the impact reactor that failed due to wrong distribution of fuel and lack of safety power plant precautions, or your surge alloy smelters fail and turrets are left with no ammo, and you'll have to witness how some other turrets are desperately trying to hold enemies. Oh yeah, and did you know that there aren't many turrets that shoot air targets? Well, it doesn't matter anymore because your core is on fire, and you don't have enough metaglass to build a system to extinguish it, so it's better to ignore that fire and get back to the impact reactor until the next wave has started, or maybe abandon it and just use another, worse yet simpler generator.
The production chains of Mindustry are all simple and short, but building a factory is not a trivial task. The space is always limited and there's no way to circumvent this. There's often not enough resources, as building is expensive. There's always a threat of a building being destroyed. Some buildings (like late-game turrets) take too long to construct alone, so you need to use helper robots to finish them in the limited time you have. And sometimes just having a defense is not enough: you need to *attack* yourself. You need to start building robots and rebuild them very quickly when they die.

Mindustry is a strategic game, and, IMHO, it's much harder to master than other factory games, and it's much more challenging (if we don't compare it to Factorio's death world, of course).",1666186103,1668704852,True,353,9,0.902562320232391357,3,True,False,False

I've been playing minddustry in the ""old"" version for a long time and actually find it a bit unbalanced.

The new version 7 is good in itself, but the graphics are really very confusing. Sometimes you can't even see why one
factory is not working. Unfortunately, the appearance of the transport routes is not very successful at all.

I hope there will be an update.

The classic graphics and gameplay is much better.

A really nice game despite all that.

If you are a fan of Base building, tower defense, and/or RTS games, this is a huge win of a game. The 7.0 update makes it even more so able to be played like an RTS, which really just means you can utilize your units instead of them being lemmings. 

Unsolicited commentor advice: I will say that if you are someone who wants to super optimize and go FAST on Erekir, consider slowing down and playing at the pace the game sets for you. Resources are, in general, extremely limited. The game is paced to be fair based on what you have available to you, so don't rush! I found myself waiting on resources more often than not, or running on 50% power the whole time because I wanted to tech up and build up industry at the rate I could at a maxed out campaign from the first Planet. Obviously, that didn't work very well. I almost got frustrated with things a few levels in, maybe by level 5 on Erekir, at the pacing of things, but eventually as you get better tools, it really opens up.

The first planet is kind of able to be cheesed a lot, which is understandable.
Erekir, however, has actual requirements, and progression to each level. You might not have all of your resources for the whole of a mission, and you need to go defeat your enemy to be able to advance. Once I learned that the game was entirely differently paced from the first planet, I started having way more fun.

All in all, I absolutely recommend this game, and had a ton of fun playing it. Heck, it's even 50% off when it just had a MAJOR content update. That's awesome! So, thank you to the Dev for making such an enjoyable game!",1668612521,1668612521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having a boss enemy just fly around your chokepoint would have been fine if any prior enemy had done so or there was any warning of it. The game is divided into levels so you don't get the factory expansion experiance nor can you use new researches on prior levels because they generally require new resources instead of just additional production lines. Failing a level is also just a timesink. Only half the factory is destroyed and the other half is ghost blueprints you can auto rebuild just by flying around.

While there are some games I've played longer, I can confidently say that every hour I've played this game, I have been having some sort of fun.

As far as gameplay goes, while many will make the comparison to factorio (a valid comparison) I would say that it's closer in nature to a tower defence game, like many classic flash games. The primary distinction between Mindustry and tower defence games of course, is that you have to supply all the material and ammunition for the turrets yourself, destroying enemies only protects your currently existing factory, it does not give you resources. With the release of the new planet, the game instead takes on RTS elements. having played through a few levels with a friend, each level, rather than being a factory building simulator, has become a strategic campaign.

The addition of a world map has added a new dimension to the gameplay. While in most games of similar types, whether that be factory managers or tower defense, once you are finished with a level, all your progress resets, in this game however, factories built in other levels persist, and can be used in a variety of ways to assist your progress, whether through transferring resources between levels, continuously producing material for research (even when you're not in the level) or providing a fallback base in case you lose a level, everything you build can be at least marginally useful throughout the game.

The world map has also largely changed the way that the AI affects gameplay, whereas before they were just a continuous nuisance until you had repelled a certain number of waves, now the AI spreads across the planet just as you do. In the case of neutral territory, land claims by the AI are simply on a timer, but in the case of player controlled territory, the player is given an option to either personally defend the level, or to build automated defenses to protect their territory, either way, the AI does a fantastic job of proving to be an excellently balanced challenge for experienced players, and an impetus to learn for less experienced players. On the new planet, the AI has become a *much* more significant threat, and less vulnerable to cheesy tactics.

This game is genuinely fantastic, and the dev is charging very little money for the experience, if you're on the fence, trust me, I was too, but the care, quality, and content put into this game far exceed expecations for the cost. With the recent release of the second planet, I find the general opinion of those I play with (myself included) as asking, ""Why was this not a sequel or DLC? I would have bought this again for the full price of the game.""

TLDR; This is a great game, with a blend of elements that you've probably seen before, but with nuanced twists. 10 dollars genuinely seems unfair to the developer, especially with more content on the way.",1655160405,1668476968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 I have played hundreds of hours in Satisfactory and Factorio, plenty enough to quickly understand concepts of automation in Mindustry, but it still required me some experimenting with duct systems.

RTS aspect didn't impress me as well, I feel that even early RTS games (Dune and Warcraft 20 years ago) were more fun to play. Well, maybe it gets more fun on later stages of the game.

If you enjoy the complexity of building a factory, and you're more motivated by defeating the enemy (and robots that go boom) rather than just hoarding resources, then get this game. it's well worth it. 

While it may seem that this is a tower defense game, I would argue it's more of an RTS with tower defense maps. There is an attack mode, where turtle strats pretty much won't work. but you have plenty of time in the first campaign to learn and understand the base building before you have to worry about that ;)

the campaigns are able to be played coop, along with custom maps. Honestly, the tower-defense style mixed with factory building makes for one of my favorite coop RTS experiences. 

It can be tough to learn, but we already covered that you like complexity :) regardless, I do recommend doing the campaign to get exposed to the different mechanics at a more digestible pace.

Anuke has managed to beautifully combine a factory simulator, a tower defense, and an RTS into one amazing game. There's several hours of content on both of the planets, with each having their own incredibly cool, unique take on the original ideas. Serpulo is very open-ended, and is more focused on the factory and tower defense elements of the game. It's a really fun campaign to play with friends, and the whole planet is available to siege and take over. Erekir is also an incredibly cool campaign, being much more involved with strategy and launching carefully crafted attacks to slowly break through the enemy defenses.

Core game:
The core game is split into two parts that depend and benefit off of each other: Combat and Production. Each map asks the same question of what to do with your resources, to spend them on units/defense or producing more resources. The game boils down to a compromise between the two and planning your builds/attacks ahead. Want to capture the enemy base that has good resource deposits? better plan ahead to optimize your resource belts so they can support more resource flow, build/plan a generator that can supply the increased production, set aside resources for a new line of defense to protect your new base and produce some units to counter their defenses. Do any of the above wrong and your base will somehow find a way to pop out of existence. This game's tough learning curve and high skill ceiling makes it very satisfying to play, and the constant pressure along with the countless ways to optimize your base gives it very high replay value.

Singleplayer:
The campaign is pretty long and can be very difficult without prior knowledge of the game, I suggest messing around in sandbox or load up a survival map to get the hang of this game's mechanics, picking a couple early game schematics off of the mindustry discord can also help tonnes but is not mandatory.

Multiplayer:
Multiplayer is one of mindustry's greatest strengths, in big thanks to its diverse line of units, turrets and resources to manage. Pvp gives off heavy RTS vibes with the objective of out-pacing your enemies and to cripple their buildings with constant pressure from your units. Pve is a great way to learn the in-s and outs of the game as it's basically a more hands on tutorial given by the community. Multiplayer is also a great place to find schematics.

If you are unsure weather or not the game is a fit for your taste, search 'mindustry itch.io' to find the official itch.io download of the game (which can be bought for free). You can try the full game for free and decide if you want to give the devs some cash.

You scale up a factory while fighting off waves of enemies but the depth is so much more than that. The defense towers have to be given ammo and each ammo type does something different.

Serpulo sets the game mechanics (that work allright: build mine>process resource>mix>get the end result.)
there's things like drones to speed up the process (which is quite frankly mandatory) and bots that can be used to attack (and are needed to finish capture)
there's a certain meta when capping the map... let's just say that once certain techs are unlocked (which takes forever, even with multiple maps and 50+ factories doing that resource) you can pretty much cheese the game to the hardest difficulty. with one pair of turrets, running mid/high tier ammo, and some ducting.

and there's blueprints if you struggle with the relatively iffy routing design (things like bridges are just terrible, connecting automaticaly lanes that shouldnt, and links and sorters that feed omnidirectionnally, thus requiring specific resources to make tight constructions. 
Thanks to drones, once you got the process in mind, game's a cakewalk. it has less than a fifth of factorio recipes and all require 1-3 resources max.

erekir is so grindy it's cancer. 
almost all resources are different, mining is worse, power production is worse...
Everything needs to be built by hand (because drones are locked for a massive proportion of the campaign)
YOU ARE FORCED to idle by design (objectives are triggered by base cap, so you can pretty much decide when you get to the next phase on most maps)
and on top of that, you're choked on water, fuel or energy on every single map.
And the ai gets repair drones.
every now and then the game introduces a f*** off mechanic that makes you loose hours of progress, 

it's not that hard to set an alarm when your base is getting hit, especially when it's large.... 
But this game doesnt do that. so you're stuck getting forward inch by inch, setting up a ton of turrets that will be obsolete before you know it (because the devs think hard = hiding ennemy bases and giving them cheaty advantages, thus getting you hit from virtually anywhere) and backtracking constantly because you never know, one of these flying drones might have bypassed your defences and blasted your mines.

If you want a logistics game with tower defense aspects you will probably enjoy this. Not sure if it is still in development which is sad because there is so much room to grow with this.

Update 9/9/22:
I still enjoy playing  this game and I still normally play this on my android with S pen. Not so much on PC. I decided to add to my review to say that I am not a big fan of the v7 update. I welcome the new game play and buildings I feel it is a step down in other ways. The ducts/belts in the still in development version are not enjoyable at all. The power nodes are more annoying. Before they could provide power anywhere in a radius not they only provide power to buildings directly above/below left/right of the node and the animations can be intrusive.

The enticing things were the Factorio style logistics, the expanding resource and tech tree, and the nice look and theme, the fact that it slowly unfolds from a Factorio-clone into an RTS.

The highly unsatisfying parts were:

1. the complete lack of in-game help regarding things like power and ammo etc. Sure, it's on a wiki, but I want it in game
2. the horrible mobile-port style UI and controls
3. but most importantly: lots and lots of  waiting around, which made the first few maps I played really dull.


I'd really like a fast forward button (yes, yes, I know you can skip waves, but I want to fast forward time). And it's on that point that it gets the thumbs down, I guess.

------------

Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. 

Excellent concept (what if we had dueling Factorio bases?) and clearly a labor of love, but needs a serious gameplay overhaul.

Campaign was exceedingly weak: the first 8 defense levels (all that I played) are effortlessly winnable by copy-pasting the cheapest turrets (ground/air) and the cheapest ammo. The first ""enemy base assault"" level you just mass artillery. There's no forced adaptation, no tradeoffs, no creativity; just build a lot of what works and then wait. You can start with a couple thousand copper each time and immediately build defenses that will hold for the remainder of the level. Alternatively, you can start with minimal supplies and go through a near-identical bootstraping process each sector.

For meta-progression, you could play a base-optimization game to maximize throughput; or you could just let the game idle for 10 minutes and buy the upgrades anyway.

--------------------------------------------------------

To the dev: my biggest complaint is this constant waiting. Please rebalance so that gameplay is continually engaging. Consider moving tech unlocks to depend on resource throughput rather than resources accumulated. Consider have fewer ore patches and simpler maps, but more diverse enemies to encourage the re-tooling of supply chains.

I want to see this game prioritize ONE genre, rather than being a wishy-washy mix. Here's some possibilities:

Real Time Strategy -- Make multiplayer the default play mode, add skill-based match-making, collect data and actively balance units. Keep single-player as a gradual tutorial. Something like ""Starcraft"" or ""Age of Empires"".

Tower Defense Game -- Add enemy variety, make players rethink approaches each map. Have discrete challenges where the player needs to restart several times before finding a winning strategy. Something like ""Kingdom Rush"" or ""Creeper World"". 

Base Building Game -- Make the map ""live"", have constant attacks on established bases, have ongoing inter-base logistics (transporting rare resources back from an outpost, hauling expensive mechs to the frontlines). Something like ""Factorio"" or ""AI War: Fleet Command"".

-------------------------------------------------------

If going the multiplayer route (eg Starcraft), keep the enemy as is. Otherwise, please make an asymmetric enemy such that the AI doesn't need to design/repair/understand complex bases. Look at Factorio's biters, or Creeper World's creep, or Slay the Spire's monsters. Hold a simple baseline and let the player optimize a complex system to surpass it. Offer a difficulty progression system to bump up this baseline for added challenge.

I recognize that some of what I suggest (attacks from enemy bases) is already in the game, but I didn't get a single attack within my first 7 hours of gameplay. If ""live map"" is supposed to be a core game mechanic, please launch a tiny invasion 30 minutes in to inform players ""this is a thing that happens"". Likewise, I assume that at some point in the progression I'll be forced to use more advanced turrets and ammo, but that should happen earlier and more frequently.

I'll revisit Mindustry on its next major release, and I'm hoping for a big improvement.",1609803292,1661895769,True,0,0,0.483870983123779297,1,True,False,False

Still love the game, it's amazing & you should play it
Knowing that you should play it,
I feel like the game was better before the last update

There is so much replayablility in this, and a small change in map & resources can impact the game a lot

Now I feel like I can't build up everything before I have to leave for another place that gets attacked
Feels a bit like whack a mole now
Still, if you can pass the initial phaze & ignore the 3 attack alarms, the game itself is great

The only real 'problem' is that you can't seem to make use of overproduction of low tier resources
Maybe you should be able to use these on 'funding the other regions' or 'delay attack time''
or just plain allow 'a huge amount of t1 garbadge units'?

And the gab between having & not having titanium is huge
I can't test around with it anymore, cause time is costly now
The growth in difficulty was smoother before 

There are also a lot more flying units now, that could get through at the beginning of the game
And sometimes you just don't know if 1 block got destroyed somewhere
At the midgame you can build units that build them back for you, so that's not a problem
But at the start you have to manually build everything back up
A yellow arrow pointing to broken things & just auto starting to rebuild them when you get close would resolve this

The ground units can still get stuck if you build them in, which can be anoying if you want to have front defeces + build the units at the front + some recources are over there
The new build system will take some time to play around with, and takes up a lot of space
This once again conflicts with the locked pathing & the space at the front
I just build flying units due to this

I feel like some crazy slow water/sand filters giving you titanium would be a great addition
That way you can always brute force it, like you do for coal

If you have a huge front line with a huge line to provide ammo, you might accidently touch a mine or something like that.
This would fill up the blocks with the wrong type, but you can't see the one wrong block blocking everything
A transparent  ammocache block a bit more resistant to damage & holding a bit more ammo might be nice
You could nerf it by filling up the gun, then to 100% reserve before you pass to the next ammo block
Also, autorebuilding allows you to not make mistakes when building back

Every time I played the game, the Ai handling of my units changes
It's not that intuitive, and I don't feel like it adds a lot of value for money over just putting them on attack
I feel like the AI should be set by making the unit being transported in the ai block
Pass a few aircraft into the AI block, configured to 'partrol skies & hunt down the aircraft'
Pass a few ground units into the AI block, configured to give ai 'protect the front line '
Make a unit without the ai configuration, and it just does random stuff like walk to your backline or go away from your frontline to attack all on it's own or just take a 1 min nap

Right now it goes from mini unit, to better unit, to even better unit
Would be cooler to build factories in a correct pattern 
2 diagonal corsses to form a spider & select set it to build up 4 legs & a control unit
Giving you the spider
Or build up 3 in a T for and get a fighter pilot
Make it wrong, and you get a badly working abomination, like a huge fortress dragging itself forward at low speed
Or a crooked build that has a laser that shoots less accurate

I look forward to the next, polished up version of this game
This game does not get the reputation it deserves

I thoroughly enjoy this game despite its lackluster explanation of how to play the game. It has a strong basis but has a crutch of relying on either immediate set-up or sending materials from other locations. The first requires intensive initial planning and use of partial schematics to create a usable material supply. The latter requires going to another map to redirect shipments by map. On some of the more difficult maps, leaving the map (even before a wave is spawning) will cause the core to fall and to lose the map, making it impossible to abandon any location. The ""off-screen"" mechanics of other maps feels a bit over simplified. Some maps can be impenetrable while playing but will be lost within a few minutes of switching map. 

This game has great potential for end-game and further elaborating game play. Currently, it falls a bit short into a clunky ""can't reach the phone to call for help"" way. The expectation to build complex units while the enemy can spawn dozens of units at the start, doesn't feel like a consistent challenge. It feels more like an initial slog with higher difficulty that can eventually be overcome. 

If you would like a simple factory style building game with a good research tree, I would recommend this game. For more experienced players, I would say to put it on your wishlist for later.",1659801304,1659801304,False,2,1,0.492196708917617798,0,True,False,False

Purchasing this game was a good use of $6. It might look like a simple game, but the tech tree and quantity of blocks is really crazy. Calling this game a Factorio clone just because there's factory management elements is comparing apples to oranges; like comparing Valorant to TF2. My point being that both games specialize in very specific elements; sure they're similar at a quick glance, but they play very very differently. This game is much more small-scale and combat focused. The time pressure is very heavy. Like Factorio, this game has a pretty good modding scene, and sharing blueprints with one another is really streamlined.

The v7 beta update honestly does damage the fun for me due to some of it's ""QoL"" changes. It removes processor blocks (what you use to control units) on the new planet, and changes the old v6 unit control system for something honestly far, FAR worse, requiring much more micromanagement of your units. You can set rally points, but you still have to manually command them to attack... which is not very fun in a game where you're already micromanaging several different things and an entire factory; it makes attack maps extremely frustrating, because you can't command an army and plan out your big silicon expansion at the same time. The update does add some pretty cool stuff though at least.

There are a couple of things that hold this game back from being perfect, though. I'm a big proponent of being able to criticize things I like, so while I do love this game, I am going to point out its flaws:
- First, the time pressure is really intense. If you're in a high threat level area, expect to be multitasking like an insane CEO would, managing both a crumbing defense and poorly planned logistical nightmare on a pretty large scale; this is one thing the game's multiplayer really helps at (and is very engaging, to be fair).
- Second, also relating to the time pressure, is that most of the maps only go to ~30 or so waves. While this may seem like a lot, the difficulty scaling is kinda weird, and a wave typically spawns between once every 30 seconds to once every minute. The waves do NOT pause while you're fighting an already spawned wave, which can lead to a tidal wave of BS knocking down your entire factory.
- Third, the difficultly scaling is kinda wack. Base assaults are absurdly difficult in singleplayer; you have to both manage a defense against INFINITE waves that scale in difficulty very very quickly, AND manage to scrape together enough resources to produce an army strong enough to cause a dent in the enemy's fortress. This orients the game more towards designing good schematics and knowing when/where to place them down.
- Lastly, another issue with the difficulty scaling (even on normal wave maps) is that either a map will be really easy or incredibly difficult. There is rarely an intermediate, and this gets worse when you're playing with multiple people and there's literally nothing to do but try to speed through the waves. Of course, just when you start to feel safe is when you have to remember that there IS a guardian (the boss) that will most likely spawn from some awkward angle and casually walk around your defenses, defeating you on the last wave. Nothing more frustrating in this game than that.",1658542020,1658542020,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My favorite QoL so far is the : When you drag conveyors over obstacles, bridges are automatically placed over those obstacles, and junctions are automatically placed when you cross conveyors.  You'll still need to place things manually when making spaghetti, but making simple conveyors lines over long distances has never been easier.

The game is what it looks like, and it does what it tries to do well.  It's basically a simplified, streamlined Factorio that focuses on combat.  Did I mention that blueprints are unlocked from the very beginning?

Factorio is one of the shining pillars of base-building games; having to actually move your resources from one place to another to use them is a very novel idea and one that Factorio has pretty much perfected. In Factorio, everything is made to reward you for careful planning and frequent optimizations: resources run out, forcing you to replace your original builds with your new, better designs, and careful use of space & energy is necessary due to the aggressive bugs around the map that discourage rapid expansion.

Mindustry, however, rewards players for the opposite behavior, encouraging players to rapidly expand early on so that they can defend themselves from enemies that progressively grow more difficult. Bugs in Factorio simply serve as a tool to keep your base size in check, but in Mindustry the enemies are the main attraction! Flying units target vulnerable outer bases, some units climb over walls, and others are tanky but march directly toward your base. 

To help combat this, there are a ton of different buildable turrets, each with unique requirements that make some better than others on certain stages. All this makes the base building dynamic and sometimes a bit chaotic, which is a nice change of pace from Factorio. If you liked factorio but hated the combat, you'll probably love Mindustry.

Really, though, the TD aspect is only scratching the surface. Mindustry has a lot of really awesome mechanics (like the ability to manage multiple levels at once or send resources from previous bases) and some bizzare ones (RTS-style units that you can control *with assembly language*) that are fun to explore and experiment it with. For $6 you'll find it's well worth the money.",1657253544,1657253544,True,14,0,0.656328082084655762,0,True,False,False

It sparked a love for what's now become one of my favourite genres. I've got my sister into it now too. Mwahahaha

That being said, the difficulty curve is wild. And the progression is such that you have to eventually go back to all the old sectors and rebuild, because there's no amount of defences that'll ever hold. It becomes impossible after a while, and (even though I destroyed previous versions) I had to give up. There just wasn't any way to win. I remember packing like half a map with nothing but the best turrets, and coming back 15 min later to a ruined map. I'm really hoping v.7 will bring that curve to a more reasonable level.

This game does have quite the learning curve, but if you stick with it, you'll be rewarded with dozens, or maybe hundreds, of hours of interesting and challenging gameplay. Two quick tips for those who do decide to pick this up:
1. Pause early and pause often. This game (at least in single-player) has a super important pause function which you can use to help with planning. You can browse the map for the various resources while paused, but keep in mind you can't see the enemy spawn location unless you physically bring your ship there. Don't be ashamed to pause, because thinking through the placement of your construction is very important here (big surprise, I bet).
2. Stay active on the map. It might be fun to watch your carefully crafted defenses or units crush your enemy, but that's time you could be spending adding on more resource generation or working on other elements of your defense or offense. If you need time to think, refer to my first tip above.
That being said, I highly recommend this game. If you really need to try it before you buy it, go grab it on itch.io like I did (or on Github if you're somewhat tech-literate). But please do buy it, because this project is super impressive, and financial support is an excellent incentive to continue its development.",1655626691,1655626691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The enemies are very simple, and very simple to counter, so there is very little in the way of strategy against the enemy.  The strategy comes from utilizing the resources available at the given level.

If we compare it to other good games like factorio or DSP it's more than worth the price. While factory is 2.5D and Satisfactory and DSP are 3D, this is a plain top down 2D. 
Its like a combo of tower defence and factorybuilding/basebuilding. Similar to factorio in that aspect just that factorio is more factorybuilding focused and this is a bit more towerdefence and wavedefence. Another difference would be this has multiple smaller maps while these other games all have one big map.
You can have easy maps but there are also quite a few harder maps as well but it has a nice coop system (in public matches you just have to look out for griefers which unfortunatly exist).
Personally i like the game the griefers robbed me a bit of motivation but other than that i have nothing to complain about. This game is tiny takes almost no pc hardware to run and doesn't cost much and give a whole lot of playtime.",1655544265,1655544265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although I have some gripes with some of the levels, I'm never sure how to approach a level to make it work to my advantage, there isn't just one good choke point to use and sometimes there isn't any at all.
Also I have had troubles where I built to counter one enemy unit that was being spammed, and assumed that guardian would also be of that same type... It wasn't, and I lost a good run to it.

The game has quite a bit of content in store ranging from an robust campaign mode to custom games and even multiplayer. As the review currently stands, the game has an overwhelmingly positive score (Which is very hard for a game to get that type of score). There is a ton going for this game, but there are some pitfalls that can be seen from time to time

[h1] Breakdown [/h1]
[b] Score: 83/100 | Excellent! [/b]

[b] Graphics: 7/10 |  Great Quality [/b]
     The game's graphics is an arcade-style visual and fits the style of game very well. these graphics are visually appealing, especially the robots that you create and the responsive animations the machines uses. However, It is sometimes hard to distinguish certain buildings from one to the other. A good example of this is related to bridge and the junction blocks being close to similar in texture. even the bridges themselves look a bit similar. 

[b] Gameplay: 16/20 | Excellent [/b]
     This game nails the delivery on gameplay. the is a decent amount of content to go through as well as other options for you to do afterwards. The difficulty of the game is fairly stable in the difficulty curve. It is easy to learn but very hard to master for those who want to take optimization of the factory to the next level. One thing to note is that the campaign does take a long time to finish. Just be very careful as you might find yourself up at 2 AM in the morning optimizing a setup you created. It is very addictive to play.

[b] GUI: 13/20 | Inconvenient [/b]
      I do admit, the GUI of the game does need a bit of work. It is vary thematically appealing in visuals, but does have its downsides. It is sometimes hard to find what you want to place in the menu, especially with some of the visuals being similar (Look at Graphics for more info on that). The buttons are well Icon'd and placed conveniently, but can be repetitive to have to get a specific part you need. Fortunately, There are well placed tool-tips and even keybindings for you to help circumvent the issue which is not as problematic once I got it down. otherwise, the Graphic User Interface is quite robust.

[b] Content: 16/20 | Decent Variety [/b]
     The game has quite a bit of content to go through. There is the campaign mode which has a great learning curve to the game. you will be going through the early game quickly while quickly slowing down to mastering the gameplay as time goes by.
     For those who want a quicker or a command and conquer style, there are custom games for that! There are pre-made maps that suits to what type of game you want to play. Sandbox? Endless waves? PVE/PVP? They are all there along with visual icons that represent the mode they offer! 
     Finally: There is also a robust and well made map-editor. the editor is not as responsive as the other features, but it's quite solid where it stand at the moment. you can also edit in gameplay which works ironicly well.

[b] Stability: 18/20 | Bugs? What Bugs? [/b]
     For a developing game, the game is extremely stable! bugs are almost unheard of during gameplay and the ones that are currently in does not impact gameplay at all. Yes, all games do have bugs and there are a few that might be a tad-bit inconvenient, but otherwise the game is very well made

[b] Price 10/10 | Extremely Underpriced [/b]
    For a game like this, the pricing is extremely low! As of this review, the price is [b]$5.99[/b], which is way more than just a great deal. on top of that, there are occasions where the price went even lower due to sales, making this game way more than just worth the buy.

The whole create systems, improve, and engineering in this game is great. The difficulty curve is dumb. It gets to a point where you just cant make units strong enough to win. especially when later waves hit, you can defend for all eternity, but actually conquering and being successful is a different story.

It is absolutely for a certain type of person and you never know if you are the person, so give it a shot but don't force yourself into it.

The game is easy to learn but very hard to master, but it feels SO REWARDING to master it given it is a [b]FACTORY TOWER DEFENSE GAME[/b].

Stupid:
-Machines don't have outputs. So products will often jam up lines, even if the input has a don't fking put this here node. It won't care, and will put the thing you deliberately tell it DON'T FKING PUT THIS HERE into that fking node. So you're CONSTANTLY deleting and rebuilding lines that jammed up for no reason. I hate silicon. I hate it. I hate rebuilding stuff that randomly stops working, even after it's been working for the last 30+ minutes. Oh woooww... why am I out of silicon? Let's see.... Oh I see, I've got to rebuild a whole bunch of lines, because the DON'T FKING PUT THIS HERE node broke. Again. It makes no sense, why the hell isn't there an output node? This is an obvious and predictable problem. If you don't have an output, and the machine can ignore the don't fking put this here node, you'll obviously get jams. Constantly. From working lines breaking for no fking reason. Sorry, it's the dumbest thing in the game by no small margin, and it happens a LOT.
-Arbitrary unit caps.
-Most guns do crap damage(even endgame lvl/using endgame mats).
-Hidden mechanics. Apparently if you spray mobs w/ water, they'll take more damage from lightning. Even though water doesn't conduct electricity. Unless the water is filled with impurities, that are close enough to allow the electricity to pass through them, only then will it conduct, and it CERTAINLY wouldn't strengthen it.
-Everything will become spaghetti, as a whole bunch of nodes you wouldn't expect to do so, will eject on to either side, if lines run next to them.
-A bunch of machines(especially late game) need more than 3 materials. Why is that bad dev? Idk, maybe because some of them are 3x3, machines don't have fking outputs, the DON'T FKING PUT THIS HERE node only works when it feels like it, and a whole bunch of other belt nodes will offset to either side, even if you'd expect them to be unable to.

it's also open source on github, completely free in itch.io (steam has better multiplayer though), and it's linux native. very based. I can't recommend enough.

I came to Mindustry looking to get my Factorio fix and found out that Mindustry is all about fast-paced RTS gameplay before it is about automation and factory building. I will not be playing any more Mindustry given that I have now reached a point in the campaign where the time limits presented by the waves are insurmountable to a slower player such as myself. While the early game was fun and I loved, loved, loved setting up factories to supply turrets and machines, I could not get over the barriers presented by more difficult regions. 

That said, I cannot dogpile a game because I am a crappy RTS player. The game is incredible - it is a very cheap title for something with such engaging gameplay and a solid framework to build around. The game does an incredible job of combining RTS gameplay with Factorio's factory construction. The building mechanics, especially how items are moved into and out of machines, is quite obtuse but an understandable hurdle after some practice. The game has all of the systems of a factory builder that I would want to be present, I just suck at the RTS components too much to really enjoy the game. It looks good, sounds good, and has solid gameplay for a simple indie game, I'm just to bad at it.

Pros:
* runs well even on potato
* plenty of playtime and content
* learning curve is challenging but not insurmountable
* multiplayer is very entertaining
* zen game

Neutral:
* schematics allow you to save and share factory layouts. this makes building easier but also leads to people copying complex schematics instead of being creative themselves

Cons:
* the game includes ""logic"", which allows you to control units/buildings through a custom-built programming language. high-level play REQUIRES you to understand it (or at least copy logic schematics)
* both campaign levels and multiplayer games can last a long, long time (3+ hours)",1651192050,1651192050,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

As Einstein eloquently said once: As simple as possible, but no simpler. This game has done some things too simple. Perhaps the biggest source of annoyance is that every output connects to every single conveyor or other input there is. This makes logistics a hassle because the auto-connection means that to get things routed efficiently, you need a lot of space to avoid them colliding into each other. 

The research tree is something that just makes you spend a ton of time waiting for resources. It would be far better if the game just had a planned tech progression. This thing just makes it so that the player, in order to max his capability for the next level, lets the game run in the background for 20 minutes, buys a tech, then 20 minutes more, etc. That is horrible game design. 

UI is too simple too, making it hard to see what traits things have, etc. When every facility is dedicated to producing a single recipe, then you should be able to make UI elements displaying this in a neat way. Weapon systems also should be so that you can see what is anti-air, what is anti-ground, what is both. 

and dear god, the need to shove all the resources back into the main base that's so far away.... 

I also don't understand why the game lets you bring a high amount of resources along with you. Only worsens the whole ""afk to get resources"" trend.

In the same way people praise this game over Factorio, I found it not at all similar, except that it has transport belts.  This is less of a base building, systems engineering game, and more of a light tower defense game with logistics, more akin to creeper world.   The logistics portion of the game requires very little planning in earlier stages and can be slapped down without much thought at all.  The result is repetitive and somewhat tedious.  However the game scales nicely and the tedium of placing the same structures can be avoided by using copy paste and schematics.

Basically, this game is a tower defense game with logistics.  The downside is that the logistics aren't difficult to solve, and I wish the waves of enemies were more constant.  As it stands, sometimes beating a level is a waiting game.  All in all there are alot of units, structures, etc...  I enjoy it.",1578204850,1650145727,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,3,True,False,False

Mindustry is often tedious in the campaign, while it starts off nice it easily becomes just a chore to play. You need to go steal other people's schematics from multiplayer otherwise your schematics will be far too inefficient to make any good resources. Plus, most late game sectors are attacked by bases. For example, Nuclear production complex is attacked by FOUR different bases, all of which require tier 5 units when you probably haven't even made ONE tier four unit. This game is a chore in the campaign, and I recommend you stick to multiplayer. Just forget the campaign altogether. Use a cheat mod if you have to, this game's campaign is just a chore.

Oh yeah and the game doesn't really give you any helpful tips. I was duo (weakest turret in the game) spamming until Ruinous shores and Stained Mountains, and was surprised when I got wiped by the bosses because the game never made me make complex defenses, just encouraged duo spamming. I had to go to the wiki to find people to tell me I should be using Lancers. Thankfully, they no longer send a T4 unit to people on Stained Mountains, but the quasar isn't much better.

This game features a campaign, custom maps, map editors, and multiplayer game modes. But for the purpose of this review, I'll focus on the campaign (which is, to me, the meat and potatoes of the game).

The campaign features 2 different game modes: Survival and capture. You'll have hundreds of sectors in the in-game world to capture, and you'll either have to build defenses to survive a set number of waves, or build units (while managing defense) to capture an enemy sector. The game works in real-time so while you're capturing a sector, a sector you already captured may come under attack. The game does background calculations to determine whether or not it'll survive, so you can't just ditch a sector after you capture it; You have to build defenses.

Resource management is also a huge factor in this game. Some sectors are perfect for producing glass, others are good for producing plastic (plastanium, in-game). You'll want to launch to new sectors with the right amount of resources, so perfecting resource production is essential to this game. That's where I like to sink my time; Perfecting storage, extraction, and production.

I highly recommend this game for many reasons:
1. haha factory game go brr
2. Multiplayer is phenomenal
3. Campaign is very nice and fun, replayable too. 
4. So many schematics you can find on the workshop or make yourself.
5. Mods, so many mods on the workshop or their Discord. 
6. Many hours of replayability
Now, There are some cons, but not many
1. Game has a pretty large learning curve,
2. Multiplayer with other people other than your friends might get you carried instead of helping if you are new.

All in all I recommend you to buy this game and play it with your friends as its extremely fun and makes the game a little easier too, (Also, Dedicated Servers are a thing too, they're just on Anukens itch.io)",1578691582,1648142978,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I have 4 bases. The 5th base I continually try to take on has prebuilt defenses that my level 2 drones cannot get past. So stalemate right? No. Even after destroying all of the production surrounding that base for the enemy, they still spawn extremely strong waves of enemys that my defenses cannot handle, wiping out most of them. This is because after wave 53 you get a guardian every single round, along with the usual medium weight drones the enemy throws at you. So instead of being able to focus on how to up my drone-game, it turns into me focusing on rebuilding my defenses all the way into the next wave of enemys, creating a self-fulfilling cycle of defeat.

I also just learned that the quintessential base I need to take to unlock one particular upgrade that *might* help is on the other side of the planet and locked. 

I'm all for a challenge, but the guardian every wave bs pushed me over my limit with this game. The drones that help you rebuild your base automatically should be unlocked way earlier in the game. It does not make for fun gameplay to have the layout of your base put together so nice and neatly with logic processors to ensure it runs correctly, just to have it turned into a rats nest the next wave. I can't even focus on the main objective because I'm too busy trying to keep my base supplied and defended.

Also, air enemies spawning randomly some distance outside of the spawn circle is really becoming annoying. The spawn circle shouldn't even be there if enemies can spawn well outside of it.",1646927370,1646927370,False,2,1,0.479552507400512695,0,True,False,False

I am 22.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

This game was really good a year ago before ""V5"".  It was just a factory + td game and was fun to play.  Then V5+ came out where the dev tried to make this an RTS too.  There were some great improvements in V5+, but the core gameplay/maps became less about TD and more about your units/RTS.  This is why I don't like this game anymore:

1. Gameplay now relies heavily on ""logic"" (programmable code attached to units/buildings):  AI is horrible; can't control groups of units (like in any RTS);  can't give them specific orders;  units need 'sight' (you can see enemy units anywhere on the map, but your units won't respond unless a tower or another unit can see the enemy too) to do things.  There isn't any default logic from the developer - it is all player made.  Also good luck figuring it out as there is little documentation and the community can be unhelpful as well.

2. Power management is still awful.  If a power node is destroyed, all buildings connected to it lose power even if another power node is in range.

3. Pre-V5, building units was simple.  Now you need to move units from one factory to another to improve them - it is overly complicated imo.  This problem becomes more apparent when you reach max capacity for a unit type.  Pre-V5: the factory stops producing; doesn't affect other factories.  Post-V5: all connected factories/units stop producing (conveyor belt jam) unless you use logic/whatever to reroute the unit conveyor belts.  As far as I know, you can't make one unit and send it to a factory to be upgraded, you need low tier factories connected to the higher tier ones.

4. ""Smart"" pathing for conveyors is a joke.  It will often go through existing conveyors instead of pathing along side of them.

5. Upgrading conveyors to higher tiers is tedious.  There is no way to upgrade them in a single action - you have to manually build better conveyors over the older ones.

6. No way to disable night/day graphics.  This wasn't a thing in pre-V5.  The night time is too dark and can make it hard to see the terrain.  I found it straining for my eyes.

7. Can't preview enemies in upcoming waves.  On a certain level, there is an air boss in the last wave and it will likely destroy your entire bases - this is because the previous waves are ground-heavy and the air attacks do little damage.  So when the final boss is air, it flies over your ground-focused defenses and destroys everything else.  Since you can't save, you have to redo the level again.


With that said, this game has some good factory fun.  There is a lot of strategy for efficient layouts.  The tech progress is fun too (again, I feel pre-V5 was better for feel of progress/accomplishment).  The TD aspect of the game is a lot of fun.  Lots of cool turrets and utility buildings.  The enemies has good variety and some are quite challenging.  Controls are decent.  Workshop is great.  Modding is possible and you will even find recoding of the main client (not via workshop, look online).  Never tried co-op but people seem to enjoy that as well.

If you like factory and TD games, you'll probably enjoy this.  However you won't like it if you are expecting an RTS factory type game.",1643155624,1643155713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was expecting a relatively simple game that'd be maybe 10-12 hours of playtime, but boy was I wrong. The price point was great so I didn't really mind picking this title up on sale and letting it sit. After finally getting around to playing, however, the game devoured my attention: it's not a simple Factorio clone. The same guts are present, sure, in the form of belts and pipes and production buildings, but beyond the similarities is a clever, dynamic real-time strategy game with a phenomenal level of polish.

You play off the concept of capturing a planet by building factories in different sectors, and the progression between them is stellar. There's a total of 16 resources, all of which have interesting and unique quirks, but their introduction is gradual. You start off with simple mechanical drills and pumps, but more and more sophisticated tools become available as you move from map to map. Each time you change locations, you launch a new core with stockpiled resources, allowing you to move to new zones without the feeling of completely ""starting over."" Resources are very cleverly designed, and each map has unique challenges be it scarcity, tight corridors, or enemy factories to conquer.

Overall, the game feels remarkably rewarding as you move from simple copper and lead contraptions to gigantic assembly lines putting together walking battleships. While I do not think the game is overly challenging, it does have its moments and frustrations, and the power grid is balanced very nicely to make all your tools come with proper cost. Getting the biggest, baddest reactors, for example, comes with the need for large quantities of coolant and high-end fuel processing, and one slip into blackout conditions around a guardian span will give you a quick trip to restart. The maps interact with one another, and research steps beyond the factory on a simple map producing resources. True to its name, the game has a feeling of building an entire planetary industry, and the logistical challenges heavily avoid ""copy-pasting"" the same strategy map to map.

What really adds icing to the cake, however, is the sheer breadth of quality of life features that make the game an absolute joy to play. Placing belts is highly intelligent, and tools exist for managing required spaghetti in a quick and efficient manner. The end result is a game that clearly is an immense labor of love by the developer, and is absolutely worth your time if you're into the city building/logistical web genre like Factorio. Just don't expect it to be a carbon copy -- this title stands absolutely proudly on its own two feet, and comes at a pricepoint that seems ridiculously too low for the amount of content present.",1641734634,1641734634,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mindustry is a game developed and published by AnukenDev

The game offers some nice graphics and environments, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same and has a really great aesthetic

Mindustry overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good  tower defence strategy game and to play in short bursts

Constructive criticism:
*) Some of the in-game requirements to unlock features, abilities and maps, are just ridiculous and over-the-top excessive. This slows down your initial progress for no reason.

*) Losing sectors (maps) that you have already beaten and conquered, is very frustrating to the player.

Landed on an alien planet with but a humble home base and zippy scout construction drone, you must set to work scraping up ores, refining them into components, and building an industrial and defensive infrastructure before enemy hordes set upon your fragile conveyor belts. Be sure to keep your walls in good repair and your towers stocked with ammunition, or armies of enemy robots will quickly send you back to the drawing board.

With serviceable pixel graphics that would run comfortably on a pocket calculator and a pleasing drip-drip-drip of escalating power and enemy difficulty through the course of its campaign, Mindustry offers relatively punchy 30 – 60 minute encounters over Factorio’s staggering length and depth. This structure provides plenty of accessibility and lends itself to dipping in and out of a variety of scenarios, but also results in a repetitive early game worsened by a slightly fussy, clunky interface. A few more quality-of-life features, including perhaps the ability to automate some building placement and – especially – an auto-rebuild option, would be very welcome.

Mindustry nonetheless offers a generous and replayable campaign with a satisfying core loop, and for all its lo-fi trappings represents a unique and successful fusion of production line management and RTS-lite. More accessible than Factorio and a much more satisfying sandbox than most tower defence games, Mindustry offers something to both top-down strategy veterans and players looking for a jumping-on point.

To start off on the differences Mindustry works with smaller maps so it makes so that a good layout of industry and tech can make a difference. In the campaign you can hold multiple maps or sectors as the game calls it to load and stock up materials to supply the front line or send off the goods to make the stuff in a different area. Of course not all the sectors will have each resource available in one area or another.

Going on the next part the enemy of the game is another mining/military force. These guys will test your forces and strength to keep the sector. Depending the difficiulty of the sector you will have to deal with easy or hard enemies. At the same time if you capture a sector next to a enemy base. Those bad guys can send a attack force to take the sector from you. 

The main campaign is a fair good way to get a idea how the tech and buildings work, but also includes a sandbox game for getting a less stress way of learning how to use the tech. Or in some cases Teach you to make sure you have what you need before you have a spectacular failure.

it is a fancy and very creative pieces of work.

it reminds me of space, star wars, or any galactic world.
it is very atmospheric and did i forget to tell you that the music is lovely!

anyways i think this is a masterpiece, coming from a gamer for over 12 years and seen many and played many(300around)

now if they made a mindustry 2 i wouldnt be suprise since the overwhelming positive reviews and feedback are most certainly good.
also if they updated it with more troops, planets or modes.
last but least ill say you have to try it and i know you will love it if you love factory and space galactic principles.

can recommend, am addicted
it basically goes: average factory sim streamlined for combat while being raided by increasingly crazier enemies
good campaign, but it can get repetitive or grindy at times
IT HAS PUBLIC DEDICATED SERVERS which are (sometimes) quite innovative, like; your regular pvp, survival and pve. servers did a TD mode (enemies are fixed on a path and cant attack), siege (two teams, one can only attack and one only defends), rapid (all factories fill themselves magically) and more

conclusion: yes. its worth 10, if not 20$, and you should get it when you like factory games

For me, I wanted to know how this compared to Factorio. So that’s where I will focus.

In case you get bored reading the entire review, my findings are simple. I recommend both of them for different reasons. If you are looking for a unique Tower Defense Game with elements of RTS and resource mining, then Mindustry is the game to get. If you are looking for a resource management and automation games to challenge your engineering skills with elements of a Tower Defense Game, then Factorio is the game to get. Besides both having resources and conveyer belts, and some similar elements in the gameplay, these games are very different and will provide very different game experiences. I hope you enjoy both as I have.

First, let’s look at the obvious similarities and differences:

The player in Factorio is a person. When that person dies, game over so make sure to save often (and watch out for trains – the most common killer in Factorio). In Mindustry the player is a ship that respawns at the “core” building when they die. If the core building is destroyed, the game doesn’t end, buy your attempt at taking the sector fails. You can immediately try to retake the sector and most of the stuff you built will already be there giving you a huge advantage the second (or third) time round.

At first glance Mindustry looks and feels much like Factorio. It has an overhead view, patches of different resources like coal, copper, and iron. You build a miner on the patch of resources to extract the resources. Multiple miners can be placed to cover the entire patch of resources. In both games conveyer belts are used to move the resources to various types of buildings to produce advanced resources or units. 

One of the biggest differences between the games is the gameplay. In Mindustry, the game feels much like a tower defense game. Like is a tower defense game, the map begins completely revealed, and enemies come in waves from an identified ""spawning zone"". Thus the first goal is to get the “towers” built to kill off the waves. Each wave has a countdown timer and each wave intensifies in units and strength. If you successfully survive the set of waves, the sector (the level you’re on) becomes part of your territory on the planet. Also Mindustry has an RTS feeling to it, most useful when attacking enemy bases. Units of ground, air, and water can been built and either directly or indirectly controlled to attack.

In Factorio, the gameplay is very different. The end goal is to ultimately launch satellites, but I think most players would agree the real goal in Factorio is to make the most efficient, automated factories, and to have fun tinkering with the factories to make the smallest improvements. But there is an element of Town Defense in Factorio. As the pollution from the factories grows, the native bugs will begin to attack. But they do not come in “waves” with a timer, not necessarily always from the same place, and they grow in intensity only if you provoke them with more pollution. Although Factorio has a Tower Defense element to the game, it definitely does not feel like a tower defense game. Likewise Factorio does not really have units or the feel of an RTS game. There are vehicles the player can build to ride in, some of which have fire power, like the tank. But in the Vanilla game you can’t create 10 tanks and control them all in an attack. There are many mods that allow armies of units to be created in Factorio, but it still doesn’t have the “feel” of an RTS. 

Also, it is important to note Mindustry has “levels”, each with a static, completely revealed map, which can be seen at all times. Each level is a sector on the planet. Factorio is played on an endlessly generated map, which uses fog of war for areas the player does not have radar or another means of seeing it.

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s take a little deeper look:

In both games there is the concept of global resources. In Mindustry it is very simple. There is a “core” building and by sending resources to the “core” building, the resources become available globally. In Factorio the global resources are handled through the logistics system, which comprises of a number of connected Roboports to create a logistics sector, various types of storage chests to store things, logistic bots to transport things, and construction bots to build things. The most obvious difference is the complexity in Factorio. But with the complexity also come a great deal more flexibility in what you can do.

Both games have the ability to place blueprints on the ground to build buildings and conveyer belt systems to transport solid and liquid resources. In both games, construction bots (known as Poly ships in Mindustry) use the global resources to build the placed blueprints. 
In Mindustry, the blue print approach is the only way to build things. Also buildings are only used to create more advanced types of resources, electricity, defense structures, or to create units. In Factorio, many of the items and buildings can be built in the player’s inventory, and then placed directly into the world. Like Mindustry, the buildings in Factorio can produce advanced types of resource or electricity, defense buildings, and to create units. But Factorio also has a complete factory system, to automate the creation of anything in the game, from simple parts to locomotive engines to even creating entire bases.
Both Mindustry and Factorio have a blueprint catalog where the player can save a building plan. In both systems, you select the buildings to save and click create blueprint. I found both systems were about equally usable. 

Both games have a research tree. In Mindustry you simply “buy” a new technology. In Factorio you must create Labs and feed them scientific resources to research new technologies. Both games require more advanced resources for more advanced technologies. I felt Mindustry’s research tree was a little small for my liking. Factorio’s is much larger.
Mods can be applied to both games. Being around longer, Factorio seems to have a larger library of mods to choose from.
In Mindustry, focusing on Tower Defense, it has a good variety of enemies and bosses to defeat. In Factorio there are maybe a dozen (probably less) different enemies to defeat. It’s pretty easy in both games to setup a defense system that will protect your base.

Getting into the complicated parts of both games, both games have a complete logic system, where you can “program” things to happen. In both games you can tap into the properties of any part of the game, such as the total number of coal in the logistics (or global) network. Based on the number, you can choose to enable factories to start or stop consuming coal. In Mindustry, the system reminds me a great deal of the good old Assembly language, placing numbers into memory blocks, and performing actions on the blocks, bit operations, etc. Took me back to the good old days. In Factorio, the system uses more of a logic gate based system. But provides the same degree of control. The only real difference is Factorio’s has more things to control, and since the gameplay promotes automation of factories, the logic system fits more naturally into the game. Mindustry on the other hand, is simplified is so many ways, that such a complex logic system doesn’t fit naturally in the game, and many players have commented on never using it.

There is much more that can be added. Both game are good for different reasons. I personally prefer Factorio more as I really enjoy games that have an “Open World – I can do anything”, but that doesn’t mean I won’t pick up and play Mindustry every now and then when I feel like a Tower Defense game.",1636928047,1636929606,True,18,0,0.692050516605377197,0,True,False,False

Once you get to a point where guardians can spawn in random waves, it instantly goes from enemies not being able to do anything to not having any way to stop them at all in 1 wave. And unlocking new things is locked behind being able to complete these levels so you just hit a wall and can't progress. There's also no upgrades other than unlocking new buildings so if you get stuck, there is nothing you can do.

As there are no upgrades other than unlocking new buildings, it doesn't seem like there's much reason for improving your resource production after finishing a level other than if there's a new resource available since passive resource production from older levels is sufficient to unlock stuff in the tech tree.

Flying enemies somehow get past your defences, regardless of how many anti-air turrets you build, even if built in the paths they'll go over. You have to build them at their target in order to stop them but then the flying enemies will often destroy fragile parts like conveyors before they're killed.

At a superficial level it definitely resembles a tower defense, but the game also requires you to make units, manually direct them, and take out enemy bases, so I'd hesitate to put it into that category.

Most of my praises have already been sung better by other reviewers, so I'll mention some of the shortcomings I found. As of v6, the difficulty ramps up far too quickly near the end of the main campaign, and the enemy attempting to 'take back' their sectors in the last few levels can get quite infuriating. Micromanaging units is haphazard and would definitely be better served with a Starcraft-like control scheme; the workflow for making them could also use some polish, and would be great if it were possible to move units between sectors somehow (obviously would need to be expensive to be fair).

One last thing I can say for certain is that this game is criminally underpriced; most highly rated games with a low price tend to be pretty short. Not Mindustry; the main campaign will require at least 40 hours, after which you can continue on conquering dozens of optional sectors on the main planet (many of which are absurdly difficult), or move on to multiplayer/custom maps.

It's fun and is under active development, but the current version (v6) has a major flaw: Units are dirt stupid, and there's no convenient way to control them.  v6 introduced the scripting system, which you can use to customize unit behavior. But the default behavior is so simple-minded you need to learn the arcane scripting system to get any use out of them at all.  The missions that are essentially glorified tower defense are fun. The missions that want to be an RTS are not. v6 totally revamped the unit system, I'm hoping v7 (in development) does again to make the default behaviors useful.",1635635876,1635635876,True,8,0,0.580975353717803955,0,True,False,False

I've played somewhere around 30 hours before they've introduced such extensive programming to command units in 6.0. Now we don't have to just rely on belts. Nearly every unit can be used for logistics. 

I've also seen possibilities for programming other kinds of behavior for combat units. 

This is unique Real Time Strategy game with Tower Defense elements, but not just tower defense. In campaign it's kinda real time X4 strategy. Where you have to think which sectors to attack and which to defend with your direct control and where to improve infrastructure, as you can use Launch Pads to shoot materials to different sectors, and you can play in  no nonsense coop.

It's a lot of what I love from Factorio: defense and building new bases, coming up with designs and adjusting to your environment and doing all that while under the threat of being annihilated.  Building stuff (and tearing it down) is very fluid and satisfying.

The campaign is structured to send you to a new proc-gen map which each lasts less than an hour usually, building up a defense, surviving, exploiting resources, then you move onto the next, picking upgrades and new technology on the way, slowly accustoming you to more complex materials, buildings, towers and enemies.  It's paced really well.

Even in the early game, simple copper mines belting copper to copper-shooting towers, or a copper mine with several turrets attached, adds such a satisfying feeling of accomplishment to base design that most TD games can't even come close to.  Then you start using more materials, refined materials, start adding power generation and consumption, and later into the game, liquid cooling.  It's also very cool that many towers can use multiple ammo types, giving them a boost or different effects.

The only itch it doesn't scratch that the other automation games does is exploration.  Though you technically explore a world by visiting many new proc-gen maps in the campaign, it doesn't give me a sense of exploration, just expansion.

The developer(s?) seem to be actively developing the game as well, you love to see that.  Big update in 2020 which redesigned the campaign into what it is now, and content updates in progress.

First off, Campaign will certainly take a long time to finish, making it something worth playing for a long time.

Custom games where you can host servers to the rest of the network, or play by yourself by your own rules.

Multiplayer has an incredible community unlike any other, and the multiplayer experience is pretty hetfy in terms of the server bandwidth. You can either play games hosted by players, or servers, enabling you to play on any device and still play with others.

There is also mods. They either do a little or do a lot. Most may only be played with players who also have the mods that you do, while Multiplayer Supported mods can be used anywhere. For those who wonder how you make mods, there is a fully documented manual talking about the available types, variables, etc.

Not really into modding, and want to make it a guarentee of multiplayer use? Try the Logic Processor and many others inside the Logic category. With the way how Mindustry logic works, there isn't a single finite number for how many possible combinations you can make with one processor alone. Some mods even add more logic blocks, and even blocks that are used to boost processors.

-Both simple and complex: You don't have to be an engineer to play this game and have fun, but the super complex commands and schematics provide another way to get through and get more out of the game)
-Multiplayer: You can have fun with friends, do a solo campaign, or even play on online servers with lots of people.
-Campaign: Absolutely massive, with more being added in updates.
-Community: The Mindustry community is the nicest community of gamers (and programmers!) that I have ever encountered. (Ex: Most of the members of the Mindustry Discord server got on to voice chat one time. And everyone actually waited their turn to speak. That doesn't even happen on a server with 10 people.)
-Involvement: You can just enjoy the stuff the community makes, or you can make your own mods, maps, schematics, guides, and a bunch of other things with ease, using built-in support and the Github files. You don't even have to leave the game to download and make awesome content.
-Platforms: PC and mobile versions are available.

First off, the level-based design means you end up with a bunch of factories that you just leave behind, which sucks if you like seeing your factories grow. In addition, the tower defense part of the game is really weak. All you have to do is place a shitload of towers near the front (electric towers are best), place walls to funnel the enemies int a small area, add some healing towers, and you're basically set. This wouldn't matter as much if the factory part was good, but unfortunately it really sucks. The conveyor belts seem to connect their inputs and outputs for no good reason, turning logistics from a fun challenge to a fucking chore as you fiddle with the incredibly finnicky conveyor splitters, mergers, and bridges, as you set up 3 inputs on 1 factory. This could've easily been avoided by adding some sort of sorter arm, like in Factorio or DSP, but they didn't, so the game suffers a lot.

Why am I reviewing now?

I am reviewing for the single player element at the moment, I can't remember the multiplayer bit but if I recall I couldn't set a password for the match back then. (no idea if you can still, would have to look).

If you ever wanted to play Factorio but do not agree with their ""never put it on sale"" stance like me, this is the game for you. It's basically the same type of game. It's not dead easy and I think the waves are a little too close together for a newer player who has to constantly rebuild for 10 waves or a player using a touchpad instead of a mouse (yes people do that apparently).

What can you do?

Join a bunch of buildings up together with conveyers using crazy methods to try and reach your ""core"". At the beginning when you are hardly gathering anything you don't realise but your core is tiny.... really tiny, I have just unlocked a large core which means up to 16 lanes of conveyers can enter at once (4 a side) and the logistics around distributing the junk you chuck in needs a lot of thought.

You can join buildings directly to their output so for example, a mining building can be connected directly to a turret, you wont get as many turrets or as strategically placed but you can make quick and dirty anti enemy placements along their route.

Do I recommend, YES. I wouldn't have picked the yes option otherwise!

One caveat: It was disappointing to discover that inter-map shipping was broken as of the last time I played. Often I'd set up advanced production lines in safe zones and try to order supplies to the fronline only to see advanced materials barely trickle through or never make it at all. Make sure to set up good blueprints, and try to rely on inter-map shipping as little as you can.

After some digging I'd _guess_ that this is related to ""sending"" off-screen maps updating at a slow pace or not at all. While this makes sense for performance reasons, it would be wonderful to see 100% safe off-screen maps simplify their updates down to steady-state production (given the infinite resources and safe zones' inability to be attacked), instead of what seems to be a deeper if infrequent simulation as of now.

A lot of players compare this game to factorio, and the only comparison between the two in my opinion is that they both have factories and enemies. Nothing else is the same. Mindustry, in v6 added an entire planet for the campaign (Which the developer, Anuke, is working on! other things are more important but if you want to know more you should join the active mindustry discord!) which has tiles for you to capture. build up a base, have some tower defense action, and try to capture the planet! the multiplayer is really where its at, but its best to play through the campaign a little bit to really understand things. they come easily in this game and quickly, as opposed to factorio where you might spend hours before you make any real progress. i have bought this game for several of my friends, and i think 6$ is an absolute steal. again if you wanna give it a go, its free on itch.io. youll come buy it here eventually! :D <3",1631191187,1631191187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Immediately after that tough the game comes back alive and feels so fun to play.  The concept is solid, the game-play loop is active and engaging, the enemies are varying and I NEVER feel like there is one solution.

Mindustry is a much lighter game, with much more focus on tower defense, less on the production. But the production has enough for a casual player to meddle with. Since the focus is tower defense, the goal is very clear. 

In the main campaign, you play different maps. So it doesn't necessarily suck up endless hours. Usually I can finish one map then get to sleep for my day job. (unlike factorio and dyson sphere program).

Система развития и дерево технологий очень органично вводят в курс дела, не давая заскучать или запутаться в новых фишках, подталкивают к экспериментам и творчеству. 

Отдельно стоит выразить респект системе логических блоков, процессоров и запоминающих устройств, использовать их для прохождения основной компании не обязательно, но крайне забавно :)

Из минусов могу выделить только невысокую сложность большинства миссий компании (что очень быстро компенсируется пользовательскими картами) и собственный тупизм временами не дающий понять “откуда этот кусок угля на конвейере с титаном?!” :)

The building is enjoyable, being fundamentally simple but still allows for complex creations and contraptions when you put everything into place.
However, the problem arises within how enemies go about attacking your base.
Enemies will ALWAYS know the fastest, least-defended route to your base, even if it's their first encounter with it in your sector. On paper, such an idea sounds like it's a sensible thing to include in this game - but it leads to essentially wasting resources on the more defensive parts of your base due to enemies straight up ignoring them and choosing a different route, be it mid-wave or at the start of another.
This is also extremely frustrating; it doesn't feel all that enjoyable to put all this thought into the various parts and functions of your base in the hopes of making a base that can withstand heavy assaults while also being efficient at sucking up resources, and then seeing on the map that bombers just flew around the border of the game world to get to your Core. 
Sure - that just means that you need to plop down more defenses, but you can't really do that in early stages of a round because of extremely limited resources unless you draw from another base's stored resources - but even then, I feel like this'd defeat the point of expanding across a map if you need to constantly have rows upon rows of high-powered anti-air cannons and all-purpose turrets around your Core, because, outside of gaining more resources and protecting the sources of said resources, what purpose is there to place defenses in more spread-out portions of the map if there's a great chance the AI will just choose an obscure route towards your Core?
I think this issue could be fixed by giving the AI more goals/roles/etc. outside of ""go towards the player(s) Core and shoot at it until it explodes"" - perhaps only a certain number or percent of spawned enemies could be allowed to be on the direct offense, advancing towards your core, while others try to whittle away at the integrity of various parts of your base, be it by random selection or what the AI may see as especially threatening or hindering towards future progress.
The AI should also not be able to instantly find the most efficient path towards your Core directly after the start of the round - such information should be drip-fed to it as the game progresses, and should also be subject to change gradually. These changes could make combat/defense feel much more engaging, giving more purpose to the various emplacements you may make use of in base building as the AI may decide to try and weaken your defenses, as well as making the AI much more ""intelligent"" than ""artificial"".",1587476028,1630370099,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately after roughly 10 hours or so of Mindustry, I got bored and it never really made me wanting more. Even with a huge tech tree to unlock, the gameplay felt a little too simplistic - especially the combat. Also, the gameplay has you basically starting all over again every hour or so in a new (and small) map/sector, and you're starting all over building a whole new small factory and defenses. The one upside is that every few sectors or so, you should be able to build more involved factories than the last as you unlock your tech tree research. But honestly, this approach of having to start all over with another factory on another map every hour or so is much more tedious to me than it is fun. I'd be more interested in building and growing a single factory into something huge, on a huge map (like factorio and satisfactory), and then throw in a greater emphasis on weapons, combat, and tower defense to differentiate it from those two games.",1629680240,1629680240,False,3,0,0.418181180953979492,0,True,False,False

The constant attacks on already captured territory, the impossible maps with extremely limited water, and trying to code your AI; these are the settle-in phases of the relationship. 

Is this game worth buying even if not on sale? YES! You've spent more money on any meal you've ever eaten than this game. Just buy it and stop throwing your 60$ at pre-purchase ""AAA"" titles that are swarmed with hackers.

Would I have bought this game if it were more expensive? maybe not. 
Do these types of things typically lead to a bunch of paid DLC so the game lures you in then nails you with expensive expansions? oh sure.
Currently however, there's no DLC. You get 100% of the game for 6$ and that's an easy buy all day. 

Has never crashed on me. I swear some of the junctions/routers glitch out and mix their lines but, I also may not understand it well enough.

The logic and programming system your units is completely impossible unless you're a professional programmer. It's horrible and requires a lot of learning/testing to figure out. Your customers are not all professional coders. Personally it's the biggest flaw the game has. I love the idea of being able to give units complex orders and purposes but, w/e the duck is going on with the current system needs serious change.

That being said, I've made it almost to the end of the research tree without ever programming a single unit. Will I be able to continue deeper into the game without copying some youtube video line for line? who knows.

*Edit: The constant attacks on your territory are actually an interesting mechanic. Attacks can be defended without you actually going to the zone if your base is strong enough (by some calculation I won't even guess at). However, whether you show up or not the attack waves are cumulative. For example: you may have taken the area initially by surviving a match that started on wave 1/50 but, on the first attack after capturing the territory you'll start at wave 51/60. After successfully defending 4 attacks you'll be at wave 91/100 when starting the 5th attack. 

The difficulty increases tremendously in higher waves and you're compelled to continue developing the strength of every base. If/when the territory is lost you go back to starting at wave 1/50 when capturing the territory again.

Also, attacks only occur on territories adjacent to a territory which is occupied by an enemy base. Priorities, yo.",1629489018,1629599500,True,89,1,0.866568446159362793,0,True,False,False

1) Who the hell releases a polished, fairly bug-free game? Indie games are on Steam are meant to be borderline unoptimized and unplayable.

2) It has way too many features. Indie Games are supposed to be husks of a game built on mostly empty promises that may or may not get fulfilled 2 years later when the dev decides to abandon the project.

3) AND THEN the Dev has the audacity to charge $6 for a fulfilling experience? The Dev should be charging AT LEAST $50 for his base early-access game and dividing up the base game content into 4 different expansion packs for their early access game. 

4) Made his game open source? How the hell can you hide a bitcoin miner in your game code if everyone can see it? 

Absolutely Disgusting.

Game involves mining resources, building factories, towers, support structures, and units to either defend from waves of enemies or attack an enemy base. Each area presents different challenges with regards to available space and accessible resources. 

There is a campaign that revolves around securing zones on a planet and capturing various enemy bases while researching new units, resources, and buildings. There are also custom games to play with or again other players or bots.

Very fun game if you enjoy resource management, tower defense, or puzzle games.
The game supports up to 16 player multiplayer and has very good support for community content (schematics, custom maps, etc.) Definitely worth a try if you're into this kind of game.

The difficulty is insane and chaotic, the game explains nothing and gives you no warning of what you can expect on a certain wave. Even the first ""attack"" map is very tricky to get through while some of the defend maps are really easy. The planet sector system is very annoying and repetitive and I much preferred the older level based system.

The biggest problem though is that the game now has logic gates and microprocessors. I'm into Dwarf Fortress so it's not like I can't deal with a complicated game, but the microprocessors basically require you to program the behavior of your units in command lines. This isn't optional either, without programming your units they will just attack mindlessly and ignore enemy defenses. I'm not a programmer and the way the game worked before was fine, so I don't get why this was added in as a mandatory thing. It's extremely tedious and the game doesn't pause either while you program the processors or give you time to learn. Halfway through the game it's just like, guess what, you're a robot programmer now and forget about all the fun conveyor belt TD stuff. I hope it'll be improved eventually but for now I'm bummed out by the direction the game took.",1627760426,1627760426,False,49,3,0.667586266994476318,1,True,False,False

Pros:
Supports Mod
Regularly Updated.
Supports Steam Workshop
Available on many platforms
Is a unique game
Has many features
Includes Level Editor
Many Multiplayer Mods
Many items, blocks and units
Includes a sort of code system that can be used to make games

Cons:
Indie game so updates are normally minor and big updates take a while
Some achievements can be got unfairly on custom maps

But it has some of the most finicky, exacting, and opaque systems I have ever seen in a logistics or tower-defense game, and it is absolutely unforgiving of any player who does not immediately understand these systems implicitly. I have had to nuke my entire Campaign save so many times because it is so easy to write oneself into a corner and so hard to get out of it. An option to wipe/restart a sector would solve this issue entirely, but the devs seem resistant so such an option for reasons that I can only describe as Artistic.

Wave difficulty is terribly unbalanced, to the point where a defense that holds for an hour of gameplay (there is no way to Fast-Forward like in most Tower Defense games) yields 29 waves that are easily dispatched, and a 30th that undoes an hour of work. You respawn in the ruins of your last creation, so if your last creation was built on flawed assumptions, you have no choice but to spend an entire run tearing down your previous buildings before you can start fresh.

I like that, to a degree. It frustrates me intensely, but I have a lot of time to kill and a lot of desire to optimize.

The Planet sectors. Capturing sectors is fine, even though there are too many and it takes a long time to capture one since you always basically start from zero but with resources available. And the guardian waves. The normal waves tend to be either really easy or really hard as the enemy immediately starts dishing out T3+ drones at you in the first wave, as you don't even have time to build the defenses. So the game goes like - Jump in - pause - dish out every schematic for every material on the map and run it to the base, schematics for defenses etc, (this can take like 15 mins) unpause and watch your ship build it all, only to get rekt by 10 spider drones that just walk over your defenses directly to your base and set it ablaze. Or if it's easy, watch 49 waves of meaningless enemies die to your uber defenses in mere seconds, and then watch your whole work die to wave 50 because some random ass boss decides that he has bigger range than most of your defense turrets, sits on the edge and snipes his heart out. Or a Boss that ignores everything and rushes to the core from different side where you have no chance of defending. 49 waves of nothing only to get destroyed by the last wave's boss(or several).

The worst thing though is, when you capture a sector, it can easily get under attack and in matter of seconds gets destroyed and lost, ruining everything as you have to capture it again (yes, seconds). Great, now imagine you have like 20 sectors captured and 5 of them go under attack at once. Somehow your defenses can't hold on their own (I am suspicious that drones actually don't even work while you are not there, it seems like the structers just get damaged and destroyed no matter what you have there, even if you have it filled with repair drones and structures). So you have to keep jumping between all the 5 + 1(sector you are currently working on) every few seconds and reset the damages or you lose them all. Awesome, so much fun. You jump in, see there is literally no damage but it said the sector was like 50% damaged. Or you jump in, only to see that for some reason your whole defense is gone, your builder/repair drones sit idle at your base and start working only after you arrive there. Then you sit and watch as your defenses destroy everything without any issue. But if you were not there, it would get miraculously lost for whatever reason. 

Yeah, nope, that whole mechanic is garbage honestly. You either have to focus on a single sector cluster (is it even possible without progressing the tech tree which you can do so only by completing different clusters?) or get destroyed by this dumb mechanic. Unless they address this issue I can't recommend it since all the progress is basically meaningless.",1626526462,1626526462,False,5,2,0.509856998920440674,0,True,False,False

 As for Recommendation to others id have to say yes there I believe is a niche to this game that makes it wonderous a charm like no other.

The singleplayer campaign is perfectly adequate and can produce quite a bit of enjoyment, although it is a touch on the ""too easy"" side. So far as I've presently seen, I have not been impressed by the multiplayer, although there is definitely a lot of potential in this regard and the community has worked diligently to host a variety of serves with interesting plugins and game-modes.

Mindustry addresses a few problems with factory builders - where other builders are normally open-ended (or the only goal is to obtain X number of material over time), Mindustry instead requires you to survive waves or destroy enemy bases using your factories. With the recent 6.0 update to the campaign and overworld, your successes in each map even carries over to other maps. You feel that continuous success as you finish each wave or map.

Gameplay is deceptively deep. It seems straightforward at first (gather resource, move resource using belts, send to factories to create new resources, etc). Then you discover space-efficient layouts that can min-max different factories, turrets, mining, etc. Then you dig deep into different production/gather rates for each factory. Then you discover logic circuits that use a kind of programming language to automate and better control your factories. Or even display memes.

Mindustry also has tons of great features, including quality-of-life! It has multiplayer with massive maps with lots of collaborative fun. It has easy-to-use schematics that saves your efficient set-ups, and even allows you to import schematics other players have built (simply as a string of text!). Tons of rebindable keyboard shortcuts that lets you navigate menus quickly and raises the skill ceiling. Custom maps and editors allow you to make levels for you, friends, and strangers. Play through a whole variety of maps from the Steam Workshop!

The only problem is Mindustry does not have a great tutorial, and portions of the campaign world's mechanics (especially resources and their use, inventory, transfer between maps, etc) are not really explained or displayed in an intuitive manner. Otherwise, it's great.

It's the same kind of gameplay: resource collection and management, optimisation and automation. It also has some rts and tower defense elements mixed in as well. Still addicting, but it's a much smaller game that won't consume your entire life (hopefully) And for the low price point, it's worth picking up

-Visual style is unique, consistent, and pleasing to the eyes
-Controls are easy to learn
-Building is intuitive and also easy to learn. conveyors automatically link up, and most buildings are omni-directional, and inputs/ouputs are universal.
-Campaign gradually introduces you to new blocks and items as you learn the game
-Smooth fully-featured multiplayer

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1600114842,1624042852,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,2,True,False,False

Yes, you build conveyors, turret defence, bring ammo to the turrets, research for new techs, words are the same. But the dynamic is world-wide differtent. Here you think about all-terms efficency, you build many small bases each with its own specialization instead of one big, you capture sectors one by one, gathering new resources and finaly finish the campain.
Then there are three ways
1) Forget about the game. You've seen like 30% of content already, why do you need more?
2) Challange yourself in infinite waves mode and open up need for additional 30% of content
3) Face some weird multiplayer batalies and undestand, that it's a totaly different game. (do not go there without completing the campain plz)

Don't let the minimalist graphics turn you away - there is a deep game under those simple graphics.

Also, multiplayer runs really well and stays synced. 90% of my game time has been in multiplayer with friends. The only things I would say I don't care for are the sandstorms (you can turn the particle effect off, but the wind still blows you around) and the fact that in multiplayer you can't see the global map or tech tree.

Compared to the other two titles, resources and map space is limited - not by *too* much, but enough to induce some creativity on how to maximize resource extraction and how to best use what you get - and sometimes make decisions on if you want to use it for one thing or another.

The negatives, then:
- Among the factory building genre, it has the most toxic community I've seen by far.
- Past a certain point, it's less about defending and a lot more about leading armies/attacking. I don't think the game does this well, and it should have stuck to its basebuilding+crafting+tower defense core. I stopped playing when this became too common and obnoxious for me.

If  you like games like Risk, Bloons, Civilization, Creeperworld, Kingdom Rush, Gemcraft etc you will love this game.
It combines tower defence with some basic rescource gathering and a Tech Tree to prolong the gaming. The solo campaign is fun and long enough to keep you interested. I haven't tried the Multi player.

It is an interesting balance of escalating power and resource gathering vs Tech tree advances. As the tech tree requires resources that you collect on the maps as you are defending.  Certain tech tree developments then allow you to progress thru the solo campaign map progression.

Farming resources in earlier maps will allow you to  progress faster. Progressing the tech tree will also open up farming opportunities on earlier/ previous maps as the map designs have been  made to  facilitate that if you are a mico-manageer. :)

Protect your sides as flyer enemies will sometimes bypass your defences.... Area affect weapons are a must with faster firing/ constant fire for mop up.... ;)

There's a satisfying finesse to fitting your factory together in those cramped, confined spaces, winding and weaving conveyors and pipes and power around your machines, over walls and through lakes, to get everything running at peak efficiency, all while dumpstering so much ammo into your bullet wall of a defence that your base is both indestructible and unreasonably productive.",1619407291,1619407291,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

v6 (this) update came with so many QOL and balancing features its amazing
It kept me awake for 2 days straight after i dug it up in my steam library on accident.

It combines base building, resource management, city building and tower defense in a hugely impressive way.
Not only does it give you total freedom over the difficulty (starting each level with however many resources you choose), but is also quite challenging so dont expect absolute faceroll.

For example you get to keep all undestroyed buildings in a level, if you fail to defend it- making it quite a bit easier to get started next time you try.
Theres units that rebuild broken structures automatically- if you have enough resources.

1. Player may choose to 'save', 'load' or 'restart' one level whenever he choose to. Upon the current version of the game one can only wait for the enemies to destroy his base in order to restart one level, only to find the initial state of the map has been changed, leaving some waste of the previous try there, to be removed. That is tiresome.
2. The boss seems way too stronger than the previous waves, and such difference may lead to a sudden death just at the final wave, which can be frustrating. This is also why I strongly suggest to introduce a saving system. Maybe there can be a more smooth difficulty curve for the enemies.
3. It is absurd that, although I can gather the resources together in the researching panel, I have to launch from just one base to another region, meaning that I can only take the resources from that very region, instead of all collectively from all occupied regions. This lead to tedious work indeed.

OMG! I had to edit my review. Their recent over hall has made this game an unbalance, unplayable trash-heap.

I could not even defeat a single player campeign opponent due to the painfully low unit cap. Just 8 units! WTF? I could not push past the enemy's first line of defence with that and your own gun no longer damages things, so you cannot go in and do anything with your own ship!

Then... THEN! Some totally UNSTOPPABLE uber wave of bosses rocks up and stomps your base totally to nothing.....

Uninstalled. Will not be playing again. Regret updating.

The game is great, but has very serious problems:

1) The User interface: The game has no tooltips. This is fatal for the game flow.

a) If you want to produce a unit in a factory and the mouse is over the icons of the units, the unit name is *not* displayed when you move the mouse. Which icon is the unit ou need?? Can it attack ground and/or air units? You have to leave the game and ask google for the answer. :-(

b) If you have found the needed Unit and you want to produce it, the factory does not show which of the 20 different resources you have to supply to the factory to produce the unit. Solution? You have to leave the game and ask google for the answer. :-(

c) The game shows all the icons and their stock of resources you already have. But: If the mouse is over a resource icon, the resource name is *not* shown as hint text. So the answer, which resource is low, is again *not* given by the game, but you have to find out somehow, which icon is which unit.

c) If you are with the mouse over one of the many buildings to produce it, no hint is shown what this building does and which resources it needs for its work. Again, you have to interrupt the flow of the game and click three times: 1. click on the building you might be looking for. 2. click on the help. 3. close the help at the end.

So you have to constantly research outside the game what resources and units you are working with.



2) Balancing 

It happens all the time that the opponent attacks an already conquered sector and if you want to defend it, then after 3 hours of fighting the opponent unpacks the extremely much stronger units and defeats you within 30 seconds: Although your own units have the maximum available strength of the just available and weak tier 1, the opponent destroys your own 150 units and towers with 1 or 2 units.

The only strategy that could help here would be to defeat the opponent in the first 30 minutes. However, with tier 1 units this is impossible because the enemy's base destroys these units in a split second.

If the game either corrects the balancing or warns the user about such battles because the probability of success is 0%, then the game is great.

So: watch again in early 2022! :-) 




Das Spiel ist toll, hat aber ganz grobe Probleme:

1) Benutzerinterface: Das Spiel hat keine Tooltipps. Das ist fatal für den Spielfluss.
a) Will man eine Einheit produzieren, zeigt die Factory nicht an, welche der 20 verschiedenen Ressourcen man der Factory zuführen muss, um die Einheit zu produzieren. Lösung? Man muss das Spiel verlassen und google nach der Antwort fragen. :-(

b) Will man in einer Factory eine Einheit produzieren und die Maus ist über dem Icon einer Einheit, wird der Einheitenname bei der Maus *nicht* angezeigt. Welches Icon ist welche Einheit?? Man muss das Spiel verlassen und google nach der Antwort fragen. :-(

c) Das Spiel zeigt an, wie viel man von welcher Ressource hat. Ist die Maus über einer Ressource, wird der Name *nicht* als Hinweistext angezeigt. Die Antwort, welche Ressource knapp ist, gibt also wider *nicht* das Spiel, sondern man muss irgendwie herausfinden, welches Icon welche Einheit ist.

c) Ist man mit der Maus über einem der vielen Gebäuden um es zu produzieren, wird keinerlei Hinweis angezeigt, was dieses Gebäude tut und welche Ressourcen es für seine Arbeit benötigt. Wieder muss man den Spielfluss unterbrechen und drei mal Klicken: 1. Das vielleicht gesuchte Gebäude anklicken. 2. Die Hilfe anklicken. 3. Am Ende die Hilfe wieder schliessen.

Man muss also andauernd ausserhalb des Spiels recherchieren, mit welchen Ressourcen und Einheiten man arbeitet.



2) Balancing

Es passiert dauernd, dass der Gegner einen bereits eroberten Sektor angreift und wenn man ihn verteidigen will, dann packt der Gegner nach 3 Stunden Kampf die extrem viel stärkeren Einheiten aus und besiegt einen innert 30 Sekunden: Obwohl die eigenen Einheiten die maximal verfügbare Stärke der halt erst verfügbaren, schwachen Stufe 1 (Tier 1) haben, vernichtet der Gegner mit 1 oder 2 Einheiten die eigenen 150 Einheiten und Türme.

Die einzige Strategie, die hier helfen könnte, wäre den Gegner in den ersten 30 Minuten zu besiegen. Mit Stufe 1 (Tier 1) Einheiten ist das aber unmöglich, weil die Basis des Gegners diese Einheiten in Sekundenbruchteilen zerstört.

Wenn das Spiel entweder das Balancing korrigiert oder den User vor solchen Schlachten warnt, weil die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit 0% ist, dann ist das Spiel toll.

Also: Anfang 2022 wieder anschauen! :-)",1616326119,1616488848,False,3,2,0.48475608229637146,0,True,False,False

Having played Factorio a lot, I was hoping for Mindustry to deliver a similar experience. It fulfilled my hopes only partially. Let's start with the good things. 

The crafting system is nice and fairly complex without being overwhelming. There is a fair amount of variety. New belts aren't just faster, but work according to different mechanics. Buildings can be boosted with liquids and some methods of generating energy have their own mechanics as well, including a reactor that blows up if at some point it stops getting the cooling. The techs keep the game fresh and interesting thorough the entire playthrough. 

Building defences and defeating waves of enemies is satisfying. The visuals are a bit simple and dry, but functional and clear, and that's the important part. I really like the sounds of the turrets, they way they shoot and kill enemies is quite satisfying. 

But, sadly Mindustry is far from perfect. 

For starters, every time you try conquering a new sector you have to build your infrastructure from scratch. Resources generated in previously acquired sectors can only be used for research, but that's about it. You can take some resources with you from the old sector, but they'll run out very quickly. So effectively you end up setting up the same production chains over and over every 2 or 3 hours. It can get tedious and resulted in me just conquering mostly only the sectors required to move the campaign forward. 

The game doesn't have a proper sandbox mode. There's a freeplay, but the maps in this mode are fairly small. Forget about procedurally generated maps, or even levels that are very big. 

And that's the problem with the campaign. A lot of the maps in the campaign don't give you that much space. This is especially prevalent on maps where you attack, as the enemy base takes up most of the map usually. It's like the core mechanics are there, they are good, but the devs don't give you the maps to use these mechanics. Having to struggle with really limited space on attack maps can get frustrating. 

Speaking of attack maps. A base building game about tower defence that has attack maps. Not a good idea. Attack maps usually just mean you've got very limited space, and your tactic boils down to just sending wave after wave or units, hoping the AI picks the best route. It gets even worse when the AI base rebuilds itself. The attack maps just don't seem to fit into the game and feel like they were added to it as a hindsight. 

Difficulty is a problem as well, there are plenty of maps that are so easy it's laughable, and others where you can manage alright, but then the game spawns a Toxopid guardian and the last 1 or 2 hours of gameplay just go down the drain. 

I do like the learning curve of the game, but there are some things that I was unable to understand without using an outside Wiki or forums. And I still don't exactly know how launch pads work, despite having almost finished the main campaign, for instance.

Overall - a good, solid game, although I feel slightly let down by poor map selection and a mediocre, a bit tedious campaign. Would really love to see it with bigger maps and maybe a more accessible interface.",1616284186,1616284246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an engrossing factory/automation/strategy game centered around building increasingly complex factories and supply lines to conquer both handmade and procedurally generated areas. The core game loop involves building a base in a new area and supplying it with resources while also feeding those resources to turrets on the frontline to fend off waves of enemies, or to factories for building troops of your own.

As you play, you'll unlock new machines, resources, units, sectors, etc. But you'll also learn to optimize what you already have, designing your own custom schematics to abstract away a lot of the processes in the early game. You'll even get ways to ship resources between sectors, allowing you to create huge distribution networks to make sure every region has what it needs.

Maps vary between tower-defense style sectors where you have to hold your position against increasing waves of enemies, and base sectors, where you have to build units of your own to take down an enemy base. It's a clever twist on the typical tower-defense formula, rewarding you for understanding each unit and tower's strengths and weaknesses. There are tons of sectors to try out with varying sizes, difficulties, and resources, so you can really take the game at your own pace.

Overall, Mindustry exemplifies the best this niche genre has to offer, and with a free version available to download, there's no reason not to give it a try.",1615933092,1615933092,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Despite some misleading comparisons, the game play is very different from Factorio, being tower-defence at heart, but it still taps into the addictive nature of creating a supply chain then optimising it as you develop more complex materials.

To me, the biggest difference to Factorio is that, in Factorio, you can spend 100's of hours designing, building, and improving your factory and once you've got a well-defended core, you're pretty-much invulnerable and can expand as fast or slow as you desire.  With Mindustry, each level is self-contained but feeds resources into your plant-wide domination, allowing you to field bigger and better forces earlier in each level than you would otherwise be able to.  But equally so, as with all tower-defence games, if you leave a hole in your defence, you will get brutally punished!  Expect to get ROFLstomped several times as you progress through the game, when you take on enemies that outclass your current tech level, or when they field units you've not build defences against and they trash your base in mere seconds after you spent several hours carefully building and tweaking it...  And there are a [i]lot[/i] of levels to complete, all with their own challenges.

The enemy can attack a sector connected to the one you are actively attacking. I as playing on one of the areas right next to another area to defend against a future attack, but while I'm attacking that same sector I some how magically get attacked at my other site. Its as if my current attack does nothing.

And even though you can take command of units and command a small army, they get stuck on every little thing and make it very difficult to navigate. 

Oh and after playing a sector for 6 hours only to have a army get through your base and destroy your core because 1 power node is destroyed even though you have 4-5 redundant nodes around it which should be used as a back up if it was destroyed. But no that's too much to ask.

I enjoyed this game but it still needs a lot of work to smooth its edges. Even though its not labeled as unfinished.

The conveyor system also is not nearly as intelligently designed as in a game like Factorio, it can be annoying to work with.

You have a small thing flying around. You have a minimap that is mostly not useful unless you know what to see in it. 
You have a timer from where enemies come in and it is a bad idea to build things in it, or stay in it when enemies come.

So lets see... you start mining, copper and lead... then coal, start making graphite, silicon, metaglass. then you mine titanium and thorium and then the remaining resources. You make cool war machines. You make smooth and easy to arrange routes for items. You go on to learn more efficient technologies.

Mindustry was only a few dollars, so I did not expect much, but it has nonetheless become one of my favorite games.

I play the game generally in campaign co-op mode with one other person (which means no pauses or going back to old saves). I find the difficulty level to be perfect--often we get wrecked the first time trying a more advanced enemy sector, but then figure out some new strategies and win. There's always something to work on, so there's no ""down time"" while playing. 

In terms of complexity, Factorio is clearly more complex in terms of factory design, especially with add-ons. Mindustry is simpler, but there's a whole tactical element that keeps gameplay interesting. There's still optimization and logistics to figure out in Mindustry, however; it's not quite as in-depth as Factorio.

Most of the YouTube and other resources I've seen are primarily from the PvP players or the high end techniques.  

A lot of the little polishing things, like knowing the types of creeps that are coming (that's just play and learn, no pop-ups/howtos), how much hp's the creeps have (oh, they get shields now?), having to learn that the little blue square with bare slash in it is Graphite to the factory expectations instead of the almost blue grey circle with a slash (which is Silicon).

Then there's Fungal Pass (v6), which takes the game, turn it on its side, and makes it into a Zerg Rush through the side door.  You have no idea it's a complete change of gameplay and the waves start coming like a Typhoon while you're trying to wrap your head around it.

Having played numerous such titles, I figured something for 5€ probably wouldn't have that many features, but hey... might be fun, right?

45 hours and and a week worth of failed sleep later, i can only say that at 5€ i feel like I robbed the developer blind.

Sure, the basic premise might be fairly simple: mine resources to both build and feed towers to fend off attackers. You start with a small base and simple mining machines you place on the map, dragging out conveyors to both towers and the base itself to fund additional towers and miners, and so on. Mine enough resources and you can unlock new techs giving you better miners, faster conveyors, different towers, etc, to build. New resources to both make yourself and mine on the map keep the progression going, and every new map feels different enough to warrant going further.

However, once you start to unlock a few more techs and gotten some hours in you suddenly find yourself fiddling with a conveyor to juuust make it fit in where you want it, look up and realize its 4AM in the morning. The game has so much potential for tweaking details, optimizing the layouts and coming up with the perfect strategy. With the threat of enemy attacks a persistant issue, you always have a goal to strive towards. There is never a lack of purpose in this game.
The campaign is excellently paced, too, with unlocks always being interesting and worthy to pick up as you go; there are very few ""dead"" unlocks, they're all useful in their own way.
There's also a whole system for programming included, allowing the savvy gamer to directly control what buildings and units do and when they do it. It's completely optional, no level requires you to use it, and you pretty much _need_ some programming experience to understand it, though (BASIC is enough). You could also get by with a lot of patience as well as youtube videos to instruct you, but without prior knowledge of how programming is structured, you'll likely struggle (or just give up and download an already written script). I feel like i barely scratched the surface of this aspect of the game, but still managed to program my units to restock the front lines and buildings to send different resources across production lines with only a single belt. There is great satisfaction to be had in witnessing a correctly written program come to life as you expected it to (and great frustration when it fails).
A robust blueprint system makes sure that all your designs, programmed or not, can be instantly saved and re-used later with a couple of clicks, and seeing your blueprint collection grow over time is immensly satisfying, serving as an additional reminder of how far you've come compared to when you started.

All in all, Mindustry is a complete steal at 5€. The game could cost 4x as much and it'd still be cheap compared to what you get. Recommended to people who like Tower Defense and Factory games. If that's not your cup of tea, then you won't enjoy this, but if it is...

Well..

Assigned to take over the planet and reclaim it from the various robotic minions that will send periodic attack waves, and even boss guardians against you, you have the ability to build assembly lines, mine resources, refine resources, and use those resources to build more structures, turrets to defend yourselves, and expand your network until you defeat the enemy waves. 

Your ""avatar"" in the game is a flyer (later can be exchanged for a more powerful model) that can build structures in moments (often, less than a second) as well as having weapons to shoot back, but your shields are low and your craft is delicate, so don't take hits. Use PAUSE liberally to study the terrain and figure out your approach before committing to something. 

You start with a hub, which starts small, but as you progress through the ""campaign"" which sends you to various spots around the planet, you will gain access to more powerful hubs. EVERYTHING sent to the hub is put into storage up to the max limit for each type of resource, and they can be used for research (and unlock more items on the tech tree), or for constructing new units and/or structures. 

Your job basically is to build drills to mine existing resources, and ship them back to the hub using conveyor belts. But there are many alternate conveyor bits to help with efficiency... Like ""router"" and ""distributor"" can help you spread your input onto multiple paths. Router can divide one input into up to 3 separate paths, while distributor can go up to 7 different paths. There are overflow and underflow gates that let you control how much to send down one path. There is a sorter that let you separate different types of input from the same line. By the 4th sector you would have unlocked logic gates, micro processors, and switches that lets you create more detailed controls, as well as robotic minion units that you can give simple orders to, and there are WELL OVER 100 units and structures in the game! 

The drills start out simple, drill, and send back. But you may need to divert some to act as ammo for your turrets. And what's even more interesting... most turrets can do more damage or get greater range or other bonuses if you send it different material for ammo. However, the more advanced materials must themselves be synthesized / processed. For example, you can mine sand, but you'll need sand and coal to make ""silicon"". Use coal, sand, and lead to make ""hyperglass"". The more complicated synthesizers will need power, so you have to create a power distribution network by tapping some of your coal supply for combustion generators, then  distribute the power using ""power nodes"" (think ""relay towers""). 

Sounds complicated? Now do it under fire. That's right, each have have waves of enemies coming at you. you start with dumb kamikazes that just blows up when it his one of your structures. But later ones have weapons. You do have turrets, but some are anti-ground (surface) only, while others are dual purpose, and some may be anti-air only. And they obviously need different ammo. 

The main objective is for you to survive ALL enemy waves, without losing your hub. The hostiles go after your hub. You can build walls to protect your structures,  but they will explore your perimeter and find the ""thinnest"" spot to attack. You can take advantage of this by building defenses along their path, and/or weapons covering their spawn zones. to hit them as they appear and move down toward your territory. 

Oh, and your avatar flying unit has weapons too. But it's mainly designed to construct, not to fight. 

As you go further and further from your hub, your conveyor line gets more complex. And as each processing structure require more and more inputs, and some may require multi-stage assembly, it is up to you to fit your conveyor lines together efficiently. 

Oh, when I say conveyor, I guess I implied solids. But later, you will also extract liquids, which are needed for some of the more advanced constructions and enhancements. Many structures enjoy higher productivity if supplies with water and/or cryoliquid (super coolant), for example. Technically those are not conveyors, but conduits, but same idea. 

A lot of conveyors can criss-cross, and the game will automatically put in ""junction"" so they can cross each other safely. But there are also bridge nodes that lets you go OVER existing structures of terrains, and other more advanced conveyor bits, such as overflow gates and underflow gates. 

What don't I like about the game? The lack of automatic pathing. You have to adjust the ""heading"" of the conveyor belt by using the mouse button. Somehow the game doesn't really want to figure this out for you just by dragging direction. There is also no ""purge conveyor"" that simply empty whatever it was carrying. You have to erase the conveyor and rebuild it. Also, if you build a conveyor next to a structure, it automatically assumes you want to connect it, even though that is not always the case, and the only way to make sure this doesn't happen is leave a GAP between your conveyor and the structure. Some of the maps are REALLY constricting as there is VERY limited path leading back to your own area. It's also not very clear which structures need what and you need to go look for the info in the ""-pedia"" reference, which contains everything, even though half of the things it referenced you don't have yet (like ability to use advanced materials for ammo, or ability to tap fluids for improved performance).  There is also no tutorial that I can find. The game also had undergone HEAVY revisions (this is V6, with many UI changes since V1)

The learning curve is directly related to some of the elements that aren't intuitive - e.g. mine coal and direct that to a specific factory to make graphite, which is used to make certain other things... The game doesn't hold your hand, but doesn't abandoned you either; you just need to tinker, read a bit, and figure it out. While this can be frustrating at first, you're gifted deeper complexity, which changes your designs short and long-term...

Ultimately, the rewards come from fending off waves of enemies with sturdy defense design, while watching highly efficient networks you've built perform admirably...

This is a strategy/supply line/factory building game. I can't manage 2 factories at once on separate maps, why am I expected to defend 2 at once? Either I just defend 1 and hope the other one I built well enough or I try to split my attention which won't work.

The enemy base missions are truly horrible. Every time I come back to this game, get to one of those missions then ALT F4 within 2 minutes of playing them since the enemy has a full base set up sending wave after wave of enemies 30 seconds apart to the point I can't even build a simple factory quick enough. You need silicon to build units, but you are given a tiny coal deposit close to the enemy base to use? Come on, these levels are a joke and completely unbalanced. 2 minutes is barely enough to build a basic defense line, I'm getting attacked by 10 flying units with only 1 small deposit of iron far away. How am I supposed to plan out getting those resources and then build it in 2 minutes along with building the defense line? I cannot stress enough how insufferable these missions are, it's so bad to the point I'm tempted to go to the github and just tear out this garbage myself. Maybe I just don't get how to fight those missions. You can mitigate this a bit by going to a non enemy base map and building some blueprints. You can also just blueprint your defense lines to plop them down in the exact same spot and get defenses set up quicker the next time since you're going to lose a few times. 

On to the good parts of this game. The factory building is really fun and has a perfect amount of complexity. The combination of the factory building and defense can be super fun. On top of that some progression is added in the form of upgrades. There are quite a few non enemy base missions available, making this game still a thumbs up. A very angry thumbs down for the enemy base missions though.",1613247955,1613247955,True,1,0,0.496815294027328491,0,True,False,False

My complaint with Factorio was that the enemies waves were meaningless so there wasn't really any need to build up a defense.  This game is closer to what Factorio should have been.  Each wave increases in difficulty and you have time between them to build your factory and defenses. And then there are assault maps where you have to build mechs and ships that automatically attack the enemy base.  

I love that there's a point to replaying levels in campaign because you can launch resources and carry them to future missions.  My only complaint is that campaign is way too short.  I want to keep going and keep completing new wave objectives if not new maps.  Please add more content.

     1 kg mąki pszennej 300 g masła lub margaryny 250 g
     2 cukru 250 g płynnego miodu 
     3  1 opakowanie przyprawy korzennej do piernika (= 3,5 – 4 łyżeczki)
     4  2 łyżeczki cynamonu 4 łyżki kakao 1 łyżeczka proszku do pieczenia 
     5  2 łyżeczki sody oczyszczonej 3 żółtka 4- 5 łyżek słodkiej, płynnej śmietany 30- 36% 

     przepis na lukier (można i bez)
     1  1 białko
     2  ok. 150 g cukru pudru 
     3  6 kropli soku z cytryny 

     sposób przygotowania
     1 Masło, cukier, miód, przyprawę korzenną, cynamon i kakao przełożyć do garnka. Podgrzewać stopniowo, ciągle mieszając, aż wszystkie składniki się połączą. Pozostawić do ostygnięcia.
     2 Sodę oczyszczoną rozpuścić w 2 łyżkach wody. Wmieszać do masy miodowej np. trzepaczką. Następnie wmieszać żółtka.
     3 Mąkę wymieszać z proszkiem do pieczenia. Połączyć z masą miodową i zagnieść ciasto. Na końcu dodać ok. 4- 5 łyżek śmietany tak, aby powstało jednolite ciasto.
     4 Ciasto można rozwałkować od razu. (Można je również wstawić do lodówki i rozwałkować później). Rozwałkować na posypanym mąką blacie nie za cienko, na ok. 5- 7 mm.
     5 Z ciasta wykrawać foremkami dowolne kształty i układać je na blasze wyłożonej papierem do pieczenia.
     6 Chcąc zrobić witraże, należy wyciąć pierniczki z otworami w środku. (Otwór na witraż najlepiej wyciąć już na blasze). Do środka nałożyć pokruszone landrynki**. (Landrynki przełożyć do woreczka do mrożenia i potłuc wałkiem).
     7 Jeśli pierniczki mają być zawieszone na choince, należy przed pieczeniem zrobić otworki wykałaczką.
     8 Piec w nagrzanym piekarniku, jedną blachę po drugiej, ok. 10 minut w temperaturze 180°C (grzałka góra- dół). Pozostawić do ostygnięcia. (Szczególnie pierniczki z witrażami pozostawić do ostygnięcia na blasze, aby witraż zastygł lub po lekkim ostygnięciu zsunąć pierniczki razem z papierem na blat i pozostawić do całkowitego ostygnięcia. Z podanego przepisu wychodzi 9 blach pierniczków).
     9 Przygotować lukier. Cukier puder przesiać. Do miski wlać białko. Dodać sok z cytryny i cukier puder. Miksować mikserem ręcznym ok. 10 minut na niskich obrotach, używając mieszadeł (nie ubijaków to piany), aby niepotrzebnie nie napowietrzać lukru. Lukier powinien być gładki i lśniący. (Ilość cukru pudru zależy od wielkości białka. Więcej informacji o lukrze czytaj tutaj: ""Lukier królewski"").
     10 Pierniczki polukrować i ewentualnie ozdobić posypką cukrową.
     11 Przechowywać najlepiej w szczelnych, metalowych puszkach.

It's an interesting concept for sure, and your first couple runs will definitely be fun... but like all tower defense games, this one comes down to the same sort of core principle, it's basically the same game over and over and over and over. The difference here however is the balance is beyond broken and the core gameplay loop is more mundane than entertaining. Everything is either a cakewalk you can leave running in the background while you afk, or impossible unless you've grinded (which of course is really boring since there's so little variety in gameplay) beyond comprehension. Bosses are either pushovers or nightmares, and there's basically no inbetween. Every game's start is the same too, you do the same process over and over. Unlike your typical tower defense however, experimenting isn't really an option. There's not a lot of variety, just some occasional map limitations that make runs more boring rather than more challenging. It's too complex to feel rewarding and mostly just feels like a punishment when some overpowered boss comes and demolishes a defense you physically couldn't have made any stronger, but too mundane to actually be entertaining for the few times you have the mental will to actually try it.

I wrote this review when 6.0 was in beta, but now that 6.0 is out... my opinion has not changed at all. Even worse, the game seems to have gotten buggier and far more unstable, which is a bit counterintuitive. I remain somewhat hopeful, this game has a lot of potential. It's just... not there.

1,000+ hours in Factorio and yes - this is as close to ""Factorio Lite"" as any game is. The advantage is it has a more diverse set of opponent. But that is also the games current weakness.
The depth of things you can do in each world far outweighs the challenge any world offers.
You finish the challenge part of any level with loads left you ""could"" do... Interesting ideas for production and defence you could implement.
But no reason to do it - because the challenge ends a long time before.
Game is still early access, but what it needs (IMO) is an endgame and depth
Still a definite thumbs up. Well worth the pocket-money sum I paid for it.

Though it was only 99p for my Ipad... (I think it is still that cheap for Ipad) If your mobile device has a reasonable processor from the last 2 or 3 years you'll be fine. Though as Factorio users will know, because the game as so many objects each with their own rules that need to be processed every cycle, at some point CPU power and RAM speed and quantity are likely to become an issue. So the PC version might have better longevity. Even a 2019 or 2020 ipad has a fraction of the CPU power of a mid range PC as well as (normally) a fraction of the ram . That might play  into it if Mindustry maps start getting really big.

I played the campaign, which is fun, but it is a bit too linear for my taste. I found myself just spam-building the shock units (with anti-flying units as needed) and that seemed to tackle all the levels of the campaign I played (maybe half of it) without much issue. The maps are all very similar (you have essential resources nearby and have to creep out a little further to acquire the rarer ones) and the unit types, as mentioned, never felt like so much of a challenge that I needed to develop a new defensive scheme. I eventually started the next level, saw it would be go about as similarly as the last, and put down the game for a bit. 

The campaign itself is straightforward but some of the mechanics are a little odd or maybe just unexplained. You slowly gain territory around a planet but there's persistence, so you can revisit your old bases for... some reason. Each time you finish on a territory, you can send a rocket with some resources to the next territory. It feels like there's a framework here for something grander, which is cool, but they don't really do anything with it (as far as I know) so it ends up just feeling like a level-by-level resource management game.

But what a dissapointment. You defeat a territory and progress to next one, but the it get attacked from enemy base. So you come back and survive another 20 rounds .. difficulty is growing very quickly but the resources on the map are the same and without titan or thorium you get quckly overwhelmed. Ok, you should not let the enemy base attack your territory. So you attack the enemy base.

But you will find out that it's unbeatable. There is a base surrounded but towers and it's spawning repairing robots which builds back the base, Your units sucks so you must slowly destroy enemy base with your turrets where you must still defeat the waves of enemies. when you finally around 50 round destroy most of the enemy base, you find out that
1) you can't build turrets close to enemy territory.
2) your best turret (show or something) will not be able to shoot to enemy core that you should destroy.
3) what ever army your built ( I got about 200 units) it got wiped out in about 20 seconds, not even touching the enemy core
4) the waves of enemy are every 2 minutes and man they get stronger and stronger to the point that they will just destroy you.

so overall you find your self idiotically fighting for hours and you are just setup to fail.

Maybe if you go super fast and build much more units it can be done, but that was the first enemy base on the from ground zero.

I simply don't want to spend hundreds of our on such idiotic game.. sorry, but this game really sucks.
I pity the time I invested into it...

The game is made with such attention to detail I'd say it's worth 5 times the price!
It's packed with content especially in places you would expect the typical tower defense to become monotonous.
During the campaign it constantly pushes the boundary of what is possible - from your side or the enemies.
The pace of increasing difficulty is just right and satisfying - you constantly go back and forth saying ""OMG THEY CAN DO THAT!!?"" and ""OMG I CAN DO THAT!!!?"". After that there are maps where you'd ask the question ""How can I do all the stuff I want with so little resources?"" and it is yet another challenge.
For now there isn't a single thing I think of as overpowered - all my most efficient strategies have been overcome by some interesting traits of the enemies - or the environment. Everything I considered underpowered has it's valid use case.
After playing for 41 hours I think I unlocked about 80% of the technology but not even tried half of it - there is so much potential for improving my strategy.

Update 16 added in a new campaign system, a major overhaul of units, and a new programmable logic system.

[h2]New Campaign:[/h2]
The new campaign system is an expansion from the previous mdoe, where it was just a slightly branching tree of 16 or 20 or so levels, in a row. Now, on v16, the campaign takes place on a globe overlaid with hexes, each level is 1 hex. The previous levels still exist as distinct named hexes, while the rest of the globe, perhaps 100-200 other tiles, are randomly generated maps.

There is no longer a global pool of resources used for research, instead, each captured territory you have has it's own local stockpile of resources. Research, when unlocked, is automatically deducted from the local stockpile(s) of resources. It works, though it's kinda strange.

Instead of every map being endless, all* maps are completed after a set number of waves. 10, 15, 35, 60, whatever the number, after you reach this wave target, you 'win' the map and no further waves will spawn. This is a direct departure from the previous version, where all maps were endless until you decide to leave, which you were able to do every 5 or 10 waves or so.

When progressing to a new map, you must first 'launch' from an existing map. When you start a new map, you will have a pool of resources. Where you launch from controls where this pool of resources comes from. For the main, named maps, you can launch from any existing zone, no matter how far away, but for the randomly generated maps, you are only allowed to launch from an adjacent sector. This distinction is poorly explained and makes little sense. I give it a thumbs down for convolution. This also means that you can progress to the named maps just like on the previous versions, one after the other, and never do a single randomly generated map at all. Therefore, the randomly generated maps merely exist as filler, which is fine, but strange to have this obtuse set of 2 rules, one for named sectors, and one for random sectors.

*Additionally, the v16 updated added in a new concept: enemy attacks. Previously, there were a few 'enemy base' missions, such as Tar Fields, wherein the player didn't have to merely survive 20, 30, or 40 waves, but actively send attack waves of their own at the enemy base, to destroy their core. v16 expanded upon this concept a lot, adding in the possible event of a counterattack. Now, when there is an enemy-controlled sector directly adjacent to one of your own sectors, there is a chance for the enemy sector to send an attack wave at your sector. In practice, what this does is makes a previously secure sector insecure again, by adding on some waves to it. For example, a zone in which you originally captured after 40/40 waves, will now revert to an 'under attack' state, and be at 40/50 waves instead. Once you survive the additional 10 waves, the sector becomes secure once again. These attacks continue until you defeat the enemy base. This is a good concept, and I like it. It's only flaws are in presentation, as it is sometimes hard to tell which sectors of yours are under attack, as your only notification of such an event (besides checking the campaign map manually) are a popup notification on-screen which goes away after a short amount of time. If you missed it, you may never notice, and lose a sector without ever realizing it was in danger.

[h2]Unit Overhaul:[/h2]
To support the expansion of the mechanic of enemy bases, the units were completely overhauled. Now, instead of 3 or 4 producable unit types, there are 6 units types, each with five ranks. So, there is a tier 1 combat walker, a weak robot who shoots a few crappy shoots at medium range. This can be upgraded into the tier 2 combat walker, which is a fair bit stronger and comes equipped with a short range flamethrower instead. It can be further upgraded into a long-ranged artillery bot, a slow but powerful assault cannon-wielding walker, and even the tier 5 version, a giant brick with legs who could demolish entire enemy bases single-handedly. Naturally, though, it's quite expensive to produce these high tier units.

There are 3 types of ground unit, 2 flyers, and a new class of unit, sea units. It is worth noting that many of these units were previously in the game, but as enemy-only units. Now, there is parity between the player and the enemy, all units are the same for each side. In other words, all units that can attack you are also units you can produce, if you wish. This is a great feature, and easily the best feature.

Additionally, the player can take direct control over any unit they have produced, and even 'rally' several other units of similar types to follow you, allowing a lot more control over exactly how you assault an enemy base. It's still very rough though, and the AI is not particularly great. Outside of units you directly control, you still are limited to only 3 commands: Attack (suicide walk straight towards nearest enemy core), Rally (cluster up around the command post), or Idle (Stop moving). If these commands were expanded, it would help immensely.

[h2]Programmable Logic:[/h2]
Update 16 also adds in / expands upon the logic system in the game, adding in a new programmable language with which you can control your robots. Fully explaining what you can do with this is beyond the scope of this review, but it's a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's extremely powerful, which is good. You can setup your strongest turrets to only activate on the presence of a boss-type enemy, to save ammo. Or you could order your repair flyers to focus their repair only on a certain type of wall, or to wait to repair things until the attack wave is over. Or you could program the entire game of monopoly into it too, if that's your thing.

The reason I say it's a mixed bag is because of how powerful it is. Some things you can ONLY do with the logic block that should be much simpler. I myself did learn how to use the logic blocks and it helped so much, but I feel like the things I wanted to do should have been able to been done without the logic system. Stuff like: Turret targeting priority (seriously, other TD games have had this for decades), or unit pathing. To be clear, you CAN do these things with the logic system, but why does it require learning how to write and then writing 100 lines of code just to make my units follow me without getting stuck on a corner of a wall?

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Update 16 is great. If you liked the game before, it's better than it was before, and worth playing again. The campaign adds longevity, the new units add depth, and the logic adds optional complexity. It's the best $0 I ever spent on new content.",1610166019,1610166019,True,1,0,0.52602231502532959,0,True,False,False

Yes. I sunk nearly 60 hours into this game before I figured out:
 - Enemy turrets have unlimited ammo no matter if their supply is cut off: forget about trying to get smart
 - The game does not run ""real time"" between bases, it will make ""best guesses"" at how damaged your base should be if under attack, and how many resources it's consuming/producing
 - Guardians WILL spawn without notice. When this happens you do not get to see their health bar. Good luck!
 - Certain turrets are woefully over and under powered.
 - Bases will be attacked for dozens of waves before you get a notification that one of your bases is under attack.

On top of this:
 - The ""AI"" is dumb as rocks. I don't think it's fair to call the enemy behavior in this game ""AI"".  ""Attack? Walk straight at the enemy core. Do not do anything else.""
 - You cannot path-find for your units at all
 - You can only ""control"" 5 units at once, if the ""leader"" of that group dies, the rest of the units resume their super dumb ""Walk straight to enemy base"" no matter what.

Ultimately I'm sad I sunk so much time into a game where the mechanics seem to work well at first, but break down and become nonsensical when scaled up. Factorio does not suffer from these problems, neither does Satisfactory. Of course: neither of those games tried to tack on a half-ass tower-defence style game either.

The missions with enemy bases are incredibly frustrating. They are winnable but it takes a long time.
Problem 1: You units cannot be controlled like every other RTS every made. There is a building that can either rally your units or send all your units to beeline against the enemy, that's it. Want to select your units and move them somewhere? Not gonna happen. This is unacceptable, an RTS in 2020 needs to have basic commands that have been in games for 30+ years.
Problem 2: Pathfinding - it doesn't exist. If your unit cannot go straight to the enemy base then it will never, ever get there.
Problem 3: Enemy repair ships. If you blow up half the enemy base, within 30 seconds it will all be repaired, good as new. The range of these repair ships is massive. You end up slowly inching your way forward. So boring.

Then 6.0 dropped and we read the change log. The game added a ton of QOL fixes and other major modifications that simplified some of the gameplay elements and made it far easier to have a megabase. The region system that contributes to tech is a massive achievement and really makes the game much more enjoyable then afk farming a spot for 10 hours while you sleep with endless waves. 

Overall, they're asking for $6.00 and I can certainly say I would have been very happy paying more. Really looking forward to more updates on this game and seeing where they take it.

[b]And finally, there are ‘enemy sectors’, where you need to attack the enemy core in order to win. It has a big territory surrounding the enemy core where you can’t build. This means you need to attack with bots. One of the issues I encounter with bots is they can get stuck everywhere. And even IF you manage to build a huge army before you attack, it still can happen that you fail simply because their defenses are too strong.[/b]

[i]In this example, the enemy sector is supposed to be ‘medium’ difficulty, and before I attacked I filled up the entire path with bots. Still they all got blasted away.[/i]

The default ship is so nerfed now, good luck trying to defend your base if a few guys slip past your defenses, you shoot about 2 bullets per second now. The campaign resources are so few and far between, there is barely enough lead and copper to get the map and defenses going. Many of the levels send out enemies every 2 minutes and here you are trying to build up your weaponry when they come rolling in and you have to resort to your ridiculous pea-shooter, heaven forbid you get hit 3-5 times you'll blow up! Moreover enemies spawn from two locations (at least as far as I played) on every map no less.

The little tricks that worked in v5 are now ""fixed"" in v6. I had schematics to build massive amount of power or self runners easily. Since I was in end game and just playing it for fun it worked perfectly for me. Now the resources required to run combustion and steam gens etc are all screwed up.

The new weather, day/night time effects, on paper this probably seemed like a good idea but playing it in game is quite annoying.

The game's balance overall is the thing that is most messed up with the latest version 6 update.

The lack of the ability to save and reload makes the game quite unforgiving for new players. You are able to export your game data and import it later, but this is not the same. While importing does restore your buildings and the wave number you were at when the export took place, any enemies present before the import are still there afterwards. If you import when a boss (guardian) is rampaging through your base, it does little good.

The game doesn't prepare you for guardians - it tells you one is approching in X number of waves, but what does that mean? Sure, it's a tough fight coming up, but how and how much should you prepare? When one appears for the first time, you get a popup that says basic ammo isn't effective against them. Oh, that would have been useful to know 10 waves ago, when I could have prepared for it. 

The waves leading up to the guardian don't clue you in. There isn't a ramp up in difficulty - you could have a chokepoint defense in place that easily dispatches the waves but the guardian demolishes easily. It's frustrating going in to guardian fights blind - not knowing what kind of attacks are effective, how much defend, etc. The result is a fight that blindsides you and feels a bit cheap and unfair.

This seems like that kind of game that is a lot more enjoyable to experienced players - I can see it could be quite fulfilling if you know how to set up your defenses, how and how much to prepare for guardians, how to set up your factory, etc.

Right now I'm strongly tempted to move on and perhaps revisit it when a proper save/load system is implemented.",1608328112,1608400111,False,2,0,0.464227199554443359,0,True,False,False

To give an example of pretty much what happened to make me finally give up:
It has, without doubt, the worst conveyor belt system Ive ever seen implemented in a game. The belts and buildings are so sticky and break in frustrating ways. So a bunch of flyers came over my base, no problem, I have a crap load of air defence that wiped them out in short order... except one of them broke one side of a bridge before dying. The remaining side automatically glued on to the wrong conveyor and fed the wrong material in to my front line guns which stop taking on ammo without me realising.

This kind of thing happens _constantly_ you often dare not run conveyors next to each other for fear that any addition to them, any splitting, or bridging will result in resources pouring in to the wrong locations. Often it turns in to a hacked up mess as you try to keep things from mixing up all over.

Needless to say, my guns were effectively all jammed up, I had to start taking apart and replacing the entire system that was feeding them in the middle of the next wave, as the wrong material was stuck throughout. A boss came down before my ammo feed had filled everything back out, the boss went directly at my core, could fire far enough to go over my falls, did about 20x more damage than anything else could and killed my core in a couple of seconds...

One small structure gone, and about an hour of waves and a tonne of building progress was gone in 2 seconds. 
All of the levels are basically the same routine as well, so its making you grind out waves and build up similar bases over, and over again as is. Losing like that wasnt even enraging any more, just draining... and slow as I am, that was when I realised that I wasnt enjoying this in the least. The whole thing had become a chore. 

I thought the update may help, and it does improve a few things. Clearer resources, your core doesnt get jammed up like other buildings do, etc. but the core issues remain. 

I would strongly recommend trying something like shapez.io instead, it may not have the tower defence aspect, but its underlying mechanics are so much more solid, its interface so much easier to manage, etc.",1608149633,1608149633,False,2,2,0.466629624366760254,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Deep technology tree

+ Rewards replaying 

Cons: 
+ No save slots. You get one slot only. I really don't like that.
+ Interface is somewhat vague and clunky. A hotbar with customizable 'top 10' items would be great. Many of the icons / structures are very similar in appearance. Even with many hours under my belt I'm still hunting through menus a lot
+ Needs more explanation of mechanics and gameplay elements
+ NEEDS details on boss waves. No fun getting blind-sided because you have no idea what's coming.

Mindustry is a fantastic game that despite its tiny packaging, hits above its weight. Being a factory/tower defense hybrid, it utilizes both themes well to create varied gameplay across its maps and challenge the player. A research-based progression system, an entire planet, and various methods of production of complex materials offers much to do. A not-insignificant-feat with its one-person developer running the show.

You are the Builder Drone, arrived on Serpulo (somehow) and must construct your bases, secure sectors, acquire new materials, and recover lost technology. Every sector (game map) has a set amount of resources that you must extract, process, and then ship to your central core. Invading enemy machines will assault you every few minutes, up to a maximum amount of waves, that if finished secures the sector for you--unless they have an invading base nearby. To survive you must build massive turret arrays, supply, power, and fuel them, then launch a new core to another sector and continue your advance.

With a simplistic objective, Mindustry's depth comes from principally its factory side. All resources are infinite, you are limited by how much you can extract and how much throughput you can obtain. Thus, production ratios is the golden secret of the game, and utilizing simple overflow designs and smart routing becomes important for base design. What you ultimately make, and how much of it, affects your per-minute production and how much you can store in your core or fuel your turrets with.

As to the tower defense, the enemy logic is simple (functionally an attack-move command to your core). You can fully block off their advance or create mazes, both methods have their place. As one reaches more dangerous sectors later in the game, more advanced enemy units begin appearing, mandating heavier defenses. How to weave these defenses together is itself an artform, as map conditions and resources greatly change what you can use. You yourself can produce units (up to a limit) which can help mine, build, or defend your base alongside you (including boss units, if you can feed their expensive requirements).

There's virtually no story except small excerpts and whatever you can infer, which disappoints me as a lore lover. The music is okay, thematic but unremarkable, it doesn't hurt to listen to even for long times, so I regard this positively. The art design itself is functional and charming, and doesn't have much issue conveying important information to the player. Given that this game can run on a mobile device, that is strongly in its favor for those platforms.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
For its price point, flexibility across platforms (PC and mobile), refined game logic/experience, Mindustry is a great choice to pick up for factory/tower defense players. As of this writing it has on-going development, just recently putting out its massive V6.0 changes. The developer has great plans for the future and so I'm looking forward to what can be done there. Out the door, it has much to keep a person occupied. Notably having multiplayer co-op (up to 4 and more players) for PVE, it can also support PVP though I am unfamiliar with that side of the game.",1607624342,1607624457,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts out as a simple, yet compelling game with a few things to keep in mind and build, only to unlock more and more buildings and the theoretical ability to create complex production lines for high end stuff and while some maps get along by building the bare minimum, the moment the message ""Guardian in 10 waves"" the game is ready for a MASSIVE spike in challenge.
I lost several maps to those guardians because my sometimes several layers thick defense failed against them, while half a layer was enough for everything before that. 
Though the challenge might feel unfair, a lost map is not lost progress. Buildings get only destroyed partially, allowing for a quicker rebuild. And thanks to the new world-map-mechanic, you can not start with a gigantic ressource stack from a well developed world, once unlocked you can even send further ressources during gameplay.
I absolutely love this mechanic. Being able to use well developed areas to push my progress in other areas feels great.

I originally passed by this Recommendation in Steam but figured I'd give it a shot since it was so cheap. 36 hours later, I'm writing this review because of the impression it left on me. Mindustry (pronounced with a soft""i"") is a tower defense game with base-building/resource gathering/crafting like Factorio. It's like Factorio steamlined for bite-sized rounds with a structure like your typical tower defense. Players begin with limited resources and must craft their equipment to mine ore/produce machinery to craft more weapons, ammo, utilities. It looks very simplistic and retro but has a very hidden depth. You'll be working with conveyor belts, electrical poles, pipes for water/oil, just like Factorio. At its heart, it is a tower defense game and I was surprised at the variety of builds and control it allows you. You'll start on a large map with you on one side and the enemy on the opposite and its up to you to control the flow of the attacks and how to repel them. All of the maps are randomized even in the campaign. So its up to your imagination on where you build walls, place weaponry in order to wittle down the enemy. You'll also be gathering resources, sending it to your base, to upgrade your tech tree and unlocking new abilities. This game has more ""bang for your buck"" than many others considering I spent $6 and have gotten 35 hours so far.",1607227711,1607227711,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've had the most fun playing co-op campaign with some friends.

If you have played Factorio, this game is undeniably smaller, but I feel like a lot of what's missing makes it more fun. Two-lane conveyors make for some interesting setups, but Mindustry's one-lane conveyors are less hassle. Building and blueprints are infinitely easier (balanced against the urgency of the wave timer), and success is more bite-sized (individual levels). The basic item transfer mechanics are just different enough to make the mini-puzzles fresh (no inserters). Plus v6 added a lot of buildable units, so that's cool.

Campaign is Waiting Simulator 2.0. You just wait on every map until you have enough ressources to research everything available. This is already annoying, but you can also take ressources from one mission to the next, meaning you just wait to start the next map with lots of ressources.
I wanted to do it without, but at the 4th or 5th level you have no chance without taking ressources with you. You just have to straight build towers with no economy.
Whether the next wave is Air or Ground is hard to see, there should be some indicator for that.

Controls for belts are bad. You can use Ctrl to auto path belts, but it does something bad every other time. like just put belts on top of other belts or go farer than needed, go next to other miners which then mix copper in your coal belt.

All in all, the update brought some welcome changes and improvements to the game such as the possibility for the core to get rid by itself of resources that are in overflow.

I thought this to be a negative aspect since big bases were hard to take over ... but now I know better. No spoiler here, I'll let everyone figure the solutions to that challenge by themselves.

GAMEPLAY LOOP: Mindustry is a fun game that revolves around setting up mining colonies all over a planet. For each sector you attempt to claim, you have to first fight off waves of enemies until they give up. You have to gather resources to power your turrets, and to research new tech for an ever-evolving arms race against the AI. Once the AI gives up, you get breathing room to finish up your mining colony, and set off for another sector. The AI can target sectors you have previously claimed, which means you'll face harder waves in that area. 
The new update added procedural generation for optional zones, and it'd take quite a while to take over the whole planet, if that's even possible.
The game's worth it if you like tower defences and Factorio.",1606984852,1606984852,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

The most recent update made this game even better and fixed a lot of the scaling concerns as well as added much needed depth to the enemies and overall game progression. It can be very relaxing with friends (early game), but there are also many more strategic levels that require precision and optimization of conveyors and mining positions. Great game and well worth it's price, even before all the new (free) content.

With this said, public lobbies can easily be ruined by griefers. A much more strict ban should be placed on those who join and just immediately start destroying everything. I'm not sure why newly joined players can destroy anything in the first few minutes. Even if they weren't griefing, there is no way they would know the total pathing of everything the first few seconds. A player rating alongside the host's admission for newly joined players would greatly assist with this issue. A way to auto fast forward waves, with some sort of special bonus, would also be greatly welcomed. 

Don't be poorly swayed by the mobile graphics. The game, while aesthetically very bland, offers a great bit of complex and engaging gameplay; if you so wish to dive deeply into it.",1606982138,1606982859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Totally revamped the game into something that I 100% approve. Given time for mods to be updated there is hours of regular game play plus modded games. I played the majority of this game on mobile and mainly have been messing with mods on PC and both platforms run great and can help hours pass, you can mod on your phone but im not that skilled.

The game is a factorio style game where you have a birds eye view of the map and your ship. The idea is to mine, build, and defend. But the core idea is to get automated systems going so all you have to do is tend to defences. The 6.0 version now has an unending main story on a huge planet. Originally you started and ended missions but now you just continue to the next area making game play super smooth. Work on unlocking your tech tree to unlock better resources and systems for automation. They just added logic and computer systems which I have yet to even scratch the service on so id say as of now the skys the limit.

- In Factorio, I spend countless hours setting up even the most mundane factory network, including hundreds and hundreds of ""inserters""; with Mindustry, I can get a pretty decent assembly line off the ground in 10 minutes.

- I like playing campaign mode, because you rebuild your factory for each campaign and can make it more optimized based on what you learned from previous campaigns.

- The pause-time mode in Mindustry is awesome; it lets you lay out a section of your factory while time is frozen, and then automatically build it when you start time again.

- I much prefer the scheduled pace of attacks, rather than the random attacks seen in Factorio.

- And, as an added bonus, I like the graphics of Mindustry much better.  They run great on my MacBook Pro.

A great game to play with others, especially close friends. The variety of gamemodes with different ways to play each mode increases the game's longevity; Factorio to be pretty awesome but the charm ran out after a couple playthroughs.

The only complaints that I could level against this game is that I don't feel it has enough base-game PVP maps... but it does give you a level editor to make your own & the workshop allows you to grab some if you don't want to put in that kind of effort.

What do we all usually see in normal RTS games? You build some resource-gatherer units, build some barracks, and just wait for resources to come into the house, and just start production, and then destroy the enemy.
TD games? Put something close to the road, and it attacks enemy passing through automatically. That's all.
Resource Managment says by itself.

But Mindustry has some unique way to connect both of these genres, especially in gamemodes.

Survive gamemode - More TD, less RTS, all you do is just trying to survive as long as possible. 

PVP - Equally both, at it feels like playing chess, but you had to build units to attack (or attack opponent by yourself) and build turrets to defend against opponent's units. Win by destroying opponent's core.

Attack - Less TD, more RTS. Yes, you still need some defenses, because enemy always will attack (especially if along with waves, enemy base can make units by itself). Win condition same as PVP.

About units: You [b]HAD TO[/b] build them literally, building only barracks are not enough (expect for Draug, but it's miner drone without any weapons), because you need some more resources, and somehow generate enough power to atleast kickstart them. Also every factory has a little limit, so you need alot of them, if you really want to attack an enemy, because units by themselfs are not... Really... Tough. Toughest unit prob will make you ask me a question ""This one has 10k health, why do you say they are not tough?""
Remember, that in TD some towers deal with super-strong enemies? In Mindustry end-game towers are powerful enough to destroy any uniy. Just make sure you can deal with both air and ground at the same time.",1603736556,1603736556,True,0,0,0.491105973720550537,0,True,False,False

While I haven’t yet played the latter, for 6 dollars it’s insane how much playability and content you get with Mindustry.  After playing for hours I would still think about how to build and structure my bases long into my sleep keeping the engineering side of my brain tingling with delight.  
The game setting is comfortable and for the most part it moves at your own pace.  Progression is easily laid out and you get a good sense of reward when you reach a new technology you didn’t know you needed.  Once you build and maximize your perfect base you will notice a large swelling in your chest, don’t worry that’s pride because this game is difficult and stimulating and only for winners!  You should feel proud and show off your creations… what are you waiting for?!!!

I would say that 6.0 is looking like a $40 game, but they'll probably sell it between $15 and $30. It looks complicated, but its actually much more simple than Factorio, and waaaaay less grindy.

1. The game itself is really nice. Managing and building a small base out of nothing while flying all over the map to see where defenses are is quite fun. For the normal game-play when you are first getting into playing, really the only thing I could wish for is a better AI system for the enemy and bigger maps to create even bigger mega-structures on. Otherwise though it was very enjoyable and I had a lot of fun playing it. 

2. However, after you get past the initial progression (which is honestly quite short if you know what you are doing) then it can kind of drag on. At this point you can only really play on MP where people will either accept anarchy or already be in end game and just have the enemy waves boxed in which is not all that fun. There is PvP as well which is one of the more interesting areas I will concede. Overall I guess I can say I am just looking for more if anything and I hope that they can bring more eventually. One good thing is that apparently a new update is coming out soon for the game so that does give me hope, but for now I just wish there was more is all.

This game is worth more than factorio IMO. Factorio may be heavily optimized for things like Mega Bases which this game also has, but this game just plays way better from start to end. From it's music, to its minimal art style, to the synergy and well balanced trade-offs of every approach or solution, forcing the player to think about every decision, without being too heavily punished for taking the easy route. Every aspect of this game reinforces the idea that more!=better... better=better. Nothing in the game exists in such a way that it feels annoying, irrelevant, or useless. 

This game encourages experimentation because not everything is always as it seems on the surface. Discovering the hidden uses and techniques for some items can be very exciting, as you cant wait to start actually leveraging them in each run though.

I've been supporting this game since it was free and must say that its seriously a gem, unmatched by its competitors.

I also really like the quick mobility and freedom the player has right from the start. Very little is any player just waiting on for stuff to happen. They are either planning and staging construction with time frozen, or they are or actively doing stuff.

Something else that makes it better than Factorio, is that it forces the player to restart as enemy waves are actually a force to be reckoned with. Intelligent approach to base design is still a factor but enemy waves force TIME to actually matter. Every second counts.

I seriously look forward to every update, and cant wait to see what the dev(s?) has in store for 6.0

I believe I'm somewhere between 60-80% through the tech tree and I have another 5 or 6 maps to unlock, but holy moley, this game is BRILLIANT!  I love how you stockpile the resources from the current map to then help you unlock the tech tree, but only after you've completed a map, AND you get to end the map when ever you want, as long as your on the right wave.  

Some other tower defense games only allow progression during the current battle and once the battle is over progression ends there.  Not this puppy. You feel like your progression is continual through out the span of the whole game.  Resources gained from winning a battle translate to global gains which can then be carried over to the next battle if you so choose.   Sure you have to start over, but you can come in with a huge stock pile of resources to quickly get built up and ready to annihilate any mobs that dare show their puny little faces.

All of this game is amazingly built within a tiny little 86Mb package.  Did I mention AMAZING!!!  The extras that come with this game are equally AMAZING too.  I've been nerding out on this game non-stop for the past two days save for a few hours of sleep and pause time to spend with the family, and I only picked it up 2 days ago.  I haven't even touched the mods yet. 

For the price, you can't find a better game.  I'm super excited to see version 6 of this game as there's a decent amount of new, amazing features that will be coming.  I definitely can wait though since I have so much more to unlock at this point and no need to rush the updates as I prefer quality over quantity.  

I've only seen the huge guns in screenshots, so I'm excited and interested in finding out what they're capable of.

Despite my presented limited game time, I have been playing Mindustry for MONTHS using my phone (It's free on the Google Play Store, with no paywalls, no ads, the only features missing are the minimap and the ability to highlight areas of machinery for copy+pasting (and in fairness, I didn't even try, so there's a fair possibility that is in there too) and after enjoying what this game has to offer through the campaign maps and progression, I just needed to say thank you to the developers. Now onto the actual review. 

Mine. Manufacture. Mechs. This is a brief summary of this game. It's simple in art style and simple in premise, but the flexibility this style permits makes is wide as a puddle and deep as an ocean. It's easy to pick up and play with the tutorial being fairly basic and minimal, only covering the basics while the rest of the game you are free to unlock new blocks (gun towers, conveyor systems, new drill types, energy supply and transport infrastructure and mini self-contained factories) and to use them in any ways you can think to use them. 

The game has a wave defence core approach, the objective to survive the waves until an evacuation opportunity arrives (every 2, 5, 10 or 20 waves depending on the map) or you destroy the enemy core. Resources you bring into you core can be used for construction but leftover resources pulled out when you evacuate are saved for tech-tree progression and can be re-deployed on replayed maps, giving you the freedom to give yourself a head-start when replying maps. Defence towers come in a wide range that are slowly unlocked, initially a simple but flexible anti-ground/anti-air gun that requires you feed it a supply of copper for ammunition. More guns = more copper for ammo. As you progress you unlock walls you can use to block enemy bullets and ground mechs (which will become increasingly plentiful and immense as the waves progress) as well as automated healing towers that use energy to repair walls and turrets, force field projectors, you can manufacture your own drones and mechs and many gun towers can take multiple types of ammunition, meaning that if you can build up the infrastructure, you can make a battery of simple turrets into incindiary turrets just by supplying them with the pyratite instead of lead (which can also be fed to artillery towers, meaning streamlined supply lines and more fire! Just don't let your demand outstrip your supply capabilities or you may find you're unable to produce enough ammo). 

The game includes level editors that let you both trial designs in a sandbox mode and to construct even the finest details of your own level designs for challenges or fun. There is also mod support and multiplayer, which honestly scares me a bit (I'm not that good, barely able to beat the campaign yet so playing other players, while insightful, will leave me a wounded man). 

The fun of coming up with (or finding out about other's) new designs to make better use of your space or your resources is always rewarding, but then you start to gamble the value of spending more time gathering resources in a dangerous region or do you leave while you still can? Before something truly devastating breaks through your defences... 

The cons of the game do exist, there isn't much in the way of story at all (yet) and while the game is receiving regular updates on both mobile and PC and bugs are few and far between, the campaign levels are built on the premise of being replayed as there aren't many of them. There is no voice acting (no characters to be fair, and other great games have told their stories without words before, just look at Hyper Light Drifter) and the music, while very fitting for the theme and honestly kinda epic, doesn't last long and often leaves you in the relative silence of your droning drills and crackle of cannon fire. These things do seem nitpicky - and the are because I had to really think of these things to find anything wrong with it. Honestly a great game even at full price. 

Well, if you've had any interest in Factorio or SatisFactory, this will be the beautifully simple and elegant cousin to those titles at a fraction of the cost with oh so much to offer its shocking in this day and age of game development. For a mobile game it's shocking and damn impressive. For a PC game it's more expected but by no means any less fantastic than I've already given credit for. 

Well, if you've read this far, you're probably interested in the game... Go try it on your phone or buy it now and see what all this noise is about for yourself!",1598712255,1598712255,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They've made some good tweaks to support the format -- you can move around the map quickly, construction is fast, resources are mostly plentiful, and you can convert your avatar into other forms that are better for combat. Without those sorts of changes, I don't think the game would be as strong.

A lot of the difficulty is in figuring out the logistics of getting the right materials to the right place at the right time. Because you can try different approaches, there's a lot of replay value on individual stages. On some stages the starting point is randomized, which also contributes to the replay value.

Under the hood, though, I find them to be refreshingly different: to me, Factorio is ultimately an optimization game, and Mindustry practically encourages the opposite. In Factorio, unless you're playing on a death planet, your defenses will eventually far outpace the modest offensive capabilities of the biters. Mindustry, in contrast, is a tower defense: the longer the map wears on, the more challenging the enemies. So between the two games, your base develops in very different ways: whereas Factorio will have you throwing things together as you start knowing you'll have endless opportunities to improve, Mindustry to a great extent encourages careful thought about base layout through the midgame. As the map wears on, you'll spend more and more time shoring up the frontlines, with less and less opportunity to tweak your infrastructure. The changes you do need to make to your supply line become more and more haphazard, with conveyor belts crisscrossing each other willy-nilly in whatever arrangement is necessary to get things done quickly, consequences be damned. If Factorio is like programming, then Mindustry is pounding on the keyboard at 3 AM the night before the big demo.

As far as nitty-gritty technical stuff goes, it's worth mentioning that the game's multiplayer mode handles latency much better than does Factorio. If you want to play a factory-building game with a friend who's a long ways away, you're going to have a much better time with this.

The main focus is resource gathering, production chains and logistics, and that part of the game is really fun. It's not as complex as Factorio, but it's more accessible and fast paced.

I didn't like the actual ""tower defense"" aspect of the game. There's no challenge at all, which also makes it feel like the base building has no purpose. The main issues are:
- Building up economy is too fast. By the time the first enemy wave arrives you already have massive income and strong defenses, often completely skipping lower tier buildings.
- This is made worse by the fact that entire map and all the resources are immediately accessible. With the exception of couple of campaign missions and some custom maps you don't have to fight to secure them.
- No need to research tech during games. You can build the best stuff as soon as you get the resources.
- Waves mostly just increase the number of enemies, which doesn't matter because they all die to AoE damage anyway. Only boss units are a threat.
- Waves only start to become a problem long after you've maxed all defenses. You might have to wait 500+ waves to get there, which is boring.
- Enemies always spawn in same location so it's easy to just build a blockade around the spawn point.
- Enemy pathing is extremely exploitable.
- A lot of the combat mechanics, like different turret types and ammo, are  wasted, because some of them are much better than others in the endgame.

I did't try multiplayer, but I've heard good things about it. I downloaded some custom maps, and they seem to suffer from the same lack of challenge as the campaign maps. There are some good attack mode maps though.

The game is in active development, so I hope that they improve the combat in some way. Instead of trying to force the game into the classic tower defense format I feel it should be more like an RTS game.

It's much better than Factorio in some points, like: more (and early) ways to defend yourself, more different enemies, single waves, you don't need thousands of ""assemblers"" to have a full bus/convoy belt, ground and airborne units... and... and... and... and .......

This game has a campaign mode that will make you spend hours trying to research all the technologies (which I haven't finished yet), unlock all the maps (which I have done) and compete the configuration requirement for all those maps. You can spend atleast 50 or 60 hours doing that by yourself, but if you don't want to play the game by yourself, you can play multilayer on the campaign and in other rounds where everything is already automatically unlocked for you. There are a variety of game modes, resource tower defence being the main one - now don't get me wrong, this isn't your standard run of the mill tower defence game, it has a lot more too it. Different maps offer different resources which you can use to build your defences anywhere you want. It honestly is quite hard to explain but if you think tower defence games are boring, you won't find that this one is. You can also ay attack mode, where you attempt to destroy the enemies team base while defending your own, which on campaign is fine, but the devs need to fix the custom match mode where the enemy literally has nothing and does nothing, unless you build something of course. You can also have a battle with your friends in a pvp zone, which doesn't really need much explaining, and finally you can make your own custom maps and make any gamemode you want. And it's not that hard. You just drag and drop

I often find myself maxing out a resource node and pumping those sweet resources back into my core.  Then I see a enemy wave is spawning so I rush to build some defenses but end up shooting most of the enemies myself.  Then I overbuild defense and lack upper tier resources.  Then I realize I only have 1 wave until I need to JUMP off the planet to keep all my goodies I've pumped into my core.  Really fun and good learning curve, but a bit difficult for the casual TD player.  If you are greedy with taking resources it becomes very difficult, if you are safe and don't take much the difficulty is less.

The campaign maps I've played (about 4 or 5) have a good variation of resources, enemy spawns, and spawn timers.  I find myself using different tower types, harvesting different resources and replaying the same maps with different strategies.  I feel like I still have a lot to learn but having fun as I go.

The Short of it: Strangely fun and engaging. Makes you feel like an interstellar hive-mind mining corporation with a side of guns for hire; an awesome mix of Factorio and tower defense like I've never seen before. A+

Reminds me of: If you like tower defense games and want to take a step in a more in-depth direction, there's a good chance you'll like Mindustry.

Pros +
- takes pieces of fun genres and mixes them together in a creative and enjoyable way
- teaches you how to play WHILE you play, rather than drowning players in tutorials and wiki pages (the developers have a great sense of how to do progression right)

Cons -
- does involve a bit of grinding at times to save up resources, but I actually found the approach to the grind enjoyable in this game (though I know some people don't like to grind anything at all, nor do they like to replay areas they have ""beaten"" previously, so I am mentioning it as a potential con)
- some people may not be into the simplistic art/presentation style (though I thought it worked perfectly for the gameplay)

If you had told me prior to playing this game that I would like it as much as I do, I wouldn't have believed you. It looked tedious and complicated, with its low-fi pixelated graphics showing just [b]so much[/b] happening on screen.

But developer AnukenDev starts you slow, and allows you to generally take things at your own pace. The beginning enemy waves are generally manageable even late in the game with basic resources and setups, but the enemy waves provide enough tension to drive you into creating quick and efficient arrangements for gathering and combining materials and generating power.

The resources that you acquire in each campaign level will be shipped off with you when you finish, and you can then use them to acquire higher-level blocks outside of play in the tech tree in whatever order is comfortable to you. Feel free to hold off on purchasing something if it looks too complicated, or just dive in. One of my first purchases was the ""mender"" blocks that use power to heal other blocks in the vicinity, and these became a staple of my strategy throughout the campaign. Any purchases you make are then available to be constructed in the other campaign levels you play.

However, you'll soon become comfortable enough with the mechanics that you'll be itching for new blocks to buy and use in subsequent levels. You'll get better and better at creating efficient systems and upgrading them as you go.

In fact, my co-op partner and I (despite having finished the campaign) still find ourselves diving back in to collect more resources and unlock more advanced blocks. There is something immensely satisfying about just looking out upon the complex conveyor systems that you and your partner have created over perhaps 20-30 enemy waves. And there's even more advanced blocks we haven't unlocked and wave thresholds we haven't survived. I've done 100 (which took quite a while), but there is an achievement for 500 as well!

It's hard to make statements about Mindustry like ""if you like X, you'll definitely like Mindustry!"" because I haven't really played anything else like it (although now I am certainly interested in Factorio). Mindustry showed me an itch I didn't know I had, for a certain type of game.

So, if mindustry isn't factorio, what is mindustry?

It's a very arcade-like game, much more focused on combat and problem solving, than factory building

Yes, you do build a factory, but that's the thing, nothing's exactly practical, the fact nothing has a clear output makes building something optimised and compact complicated, plitters can slow things down, certain ways to transfer your ressources can stagger your ressources and you'll most likely have the case of a random ressource being on the wrong conveyor belt and blocking your entire production...

This is where the main part of the game is, it's more of a puzzle game if anything

Compare it to factorio, where the whole point of the game is to make those huuuuge, ultra optimised industries, with most threats really handled by simply having energy, here the whole point of getting ressources is so you can power up turrets in order to defend yourself.

The combat is a massive part of this game, less as in, you're gonna actually fight yourself, but as in, making defenses to manipulate the enemy AI and manage to deal with the (Very numerous and very real) threats the game sends at you.

Game's mostly got two types of enemies, grounded and flying, each having a bunch of various units, which you must defend against with (just as numerous) turrets, much like the enemies, each really fills-in a function, some deal with aerial enemies better than others, some can only attack grounded, some are more AoE based, some are literally artillery, and most of those turrets can drastically vary in use depending on the ammo you feed them, or if you manage to bring liquid to them or not

This game, simply put, is extremely good, but if you go in expecting factorio, you're gonna have a bad surprise.",1574277206,1595837623,True,1,0,0.500732660293579102,0,True,False,False

If you like Factorio or other factory building games, then this will be right for you. The campaign has a simple structure; Land on the site, mine the resources, choose to divert it to your front lines to load your guns or to your core for construction, then EVAC to claim all the resources in your core for R&D or to boost a future expedition.

The games art is basic, but its simple and makes it easy to identify things on screen. I never mistake a resource at a glance and can keep track of all my lines to find jams. The only thing that could use better is mech colours as the main body is the same steel grey.  The sound track almost sounds Risk of Rain inspired. The multiplayer can be crazy as everyone splits off to build factory sections. The game is also cross platform, where PC and mobile players can work together (Android and iOS)

And at $6 while this game is cheap and well worth the price given the workshop support and other steam features, the game is actually free and open source. The steam version just makes things like multiplayer, modding and so on more automated. If you just want to try it feel free to go find the game on GitHub or Itch Io.

I find myself going back and playing levels I've already played to farm resources and refine my factory designs. The focus of defense and industry feels like it gives you greater purpose then just build and build more the way that Factorio and Satisfactory do.

Compared to Factorio: Factorio has a more complex resource management and generated maps instead of standardized ones. You can make more impressive factories in factorio, but I feel like the game is more focused and 'fun' in Mindustry.

Compared to Satisfactory: The graphics in Mindustry are very basic comparatively to Satisfactory. One is top down java game, the other is a first person factory builder with graphics that can tax current gen graphics cards. While there are some 'threats' in Satisfactory, there's no real need to heavily fortify your factories, its mostly just building bigger and bigger.

One of the best thinks about this game, is that it’s like two types of games in one package. It’s an RTS, I call it a swarm RTS when describing it to friends. As well as a competent tower defence. Most RTS games are a balance of Micro and Macro management. Because of the (current) lack of direct unit control, it forces you to focus on the Macro game. It looks weird at first, but it’s amazingly fun.

Hotkeys that change whenever you unlock new tech. A volume slider that only works if you move it very slowly. Building mechanics that don't cooperate with the way things need to be built. Mindustry does you the double disservice of making building inherently un-fun and putting you on a timer. Even when it's nice (you can pause and look around and plan), it goes out of its way to be annoying. Pausing makes the camera very slow and awkward, like the developer wants to punish you.

Even if the UI issues were fixed, I don't think I'd consider Mindustry a good game. I'm personally of the opinion that highly non-interactive optimization puzzles aren't that fun to begin with, and that's really at the core of what Mindustry does. Player agency exists, but only in really stupid and gimmicky ways - the AI considers you a high priority target, and you can exploit this by standing inside walls, making the AI spread its damage out so your defenses function better. For the most part, there just isn't that much thinking OR acting to do, just pause, painfully queue up a bunch of building, and then unpause and painfully wait for it to finish.

I'll probably grind out the rest of the content out of some stupid sunk cost feeling, but I can honestly say I've only had fun a very small minority of the time I've spent playing this game, and the more I play it, the more that enjoyable percentage goes down.

If you like Factorio, this has many of the same ideas, but in simpler forms.  You're building a tiny economy to supply your turrets to defend your core while you loot resources.  It starts out quite simple, and ramps up quite a long way in complexity.  But the reward loop is phenomenal; after you figure out a new tier of goods and get a new weapon up and running, there are huge fireworks and life is amazing for a bit.  And then you're off building up for the next tier and even more massive weapons.  

I love Factorio to death; it's a much better building game.  But this has many of its good qualities in a simpler format, with a very strong element of time pressure.  It is, after all, a tower defense game.   And its weapons are a lot more fun than Factorio's....  there's something very satisfying about a new Mindustry turret that I never felt much with Factorio.  Factorio's laser turrets are super effective, but they're not *fun*.  Mindustry's are just fun to play with. 

They've really priced this thing to move; I would consider the price fair if it were much more expensive than it is.
