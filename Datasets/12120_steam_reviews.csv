Holds up ..fine in terms of its content - some is definitely of the early 2000s tolerance, but who cares? It's nostalgia, and it's just good fun. Yes, this is the one where you can oh, so controversially sleep with a hooker, then kill her and take back the money. And yes, you can also play for hours on end saving people around town as ambulance crew. It's like choose your own adventure, right?
Really, though, the gunplay surprisingly does hold up, and remains fun. The driving has been some of the greatest open-world vehicle fun you can have.
The feel of each atmosphere, each city is unique and memorable. Even the B-tier missions are fun, eventful and have fully voiced, fantastic character work. The soundtracks of each radio station only emphasise the point already made 5 times over. Again, it's the characters and the ambiance, not necessarily the incredible story or morals discussed here.

You just have fun. You load up this game and you have chaotic, old-school, good-hearted fun. It is full of violence, but hey, it's a video game - you're supposed to load off in these things, so as not to do similar in real-life situations.

First things first, I immediately downloaded ""GTA SA - The Improved Classic Modpack"" to hopefully improve the gameplay a little bit. Because I did try to play this few year back without any mods and I do remember it being very buggy on PC. But the modpack did not fix everything, probably helped a ton in the background. So be prepared for various bugs and issues.

For example: cut-scenes getting stuck where the car is supposed to exit a garage (driving against a wall repeatably). Taking a picture with the camera crashes (you had to disable some picture saving thing from settings). Random crashes mid-mission/game (remember to go save the game).

But I mean, there's no point to ""review"" this game as there are hundreds, probably thousands of reviews of this game already. We know the game is good. Just remember, save the game often, there are no checkpoints and just because of the crashes. Enjoy the game while playing. Took me about 35h to finish the game with all tags, oysters and horseshoes.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas stands as a testament to gaming brilliance, drawing players into the bustling streets of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas. The engaging narrative follows CJ's journey, complete with twists, turns, and unforgettable characters. The sprawling open world invites exploration, and the diverse missions showcase Rockstar Games' storytelling prowess.

The customization options elevate the experience, allowing players to tailor CJ's appearance and even modify vehicles. The soundtrack, featuring tracks from the '90s, seamlessly complements the atmosphere, enhancing the immersion in this virtual world.

However, the game's aging graphics, a relic of its 2004 release, might be a stumbling block for those accustomed to modern visual standards. The controls, while functional, can feel a bit cumbersome, especially during intense moments, occasionally leading to frustrating encounters.

The inconsistent AI behavior in certain missions and limitations in interactivity are noticeable but, in the grand scheme, don't significantly detract from the overall experience. San Andreas' depth and complexity may present a steep learning curve for newcomers, but it's a journey well worth taking.

For seasoned players, San Andreas is a nostalgic voyage to a bygone era of gaming. For newcomers, it's a chance to explore the roots of the open-world genre, forgiving its quirks in favor of the unparalleled sense of freedom it offers. Despite its imperfections, GTA: San Andreas remains an enduring masterpiece that transcends time, delivering a gaming experience that's as captivating today as it was nearly two decades ago.

Land of the heinous, gangbangers, and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing, even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast with the flag on the strap, that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get super cut or big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats, respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat, and sex appeal
You get clothes from Bincos and Pro Laps
Sub Urban, ZIP, Victim, and D. Sachs
Watch your back when you in rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survivals good (Survivals good)
Ducking shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out busting, gunning 'til they tuck their tail
It seem like I'm on impossible missions (Impossible missions)
Twisted predicaments hostile positions (Hostile positions)
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
'Cause the 'Dreas for the gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the 'bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains blow for how you do your fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones
Dump them out, bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with a shotgun
Hittin' them up what that Grove Street like

I highly recommend this game since 2004, but now its a must have because it seems this version is unavailable. 

I applied the Definitive Edition patch and made my control scheme on the steam input thing. I made the controls to be like OG Xbox with some changes to match the modern era. 
Here is the link:
steam://controllerconfig/12120/3131288755

I then went to my nividia control panel changed max frame rate to 60 and turned vertical sync on for the San Andreas EXE. Then within the game Draw distance at max, Frame Limiter off, Widescreen on, visual fx Very high, MIP mapping on, Anti aliasing 8X, and resolution 3840 x 2160 x 32.

Im playing in 4k 60fps no glitches. Best time im ever having.

Now that i'm older and returning to classics, i can't believe they removed this version but come here listen to Uncle Sweet. Do yourself a favor, if you can, get your hands on this copy through other means.... 💿🔑 or 🏴‍☠️, the choice is yours. 

Whatever you do, do not give your money to Rockstar and buy that dogsh1t version of San Andreas called the ""Definitive Edition"". That version is ass and we both know it, so don't do it.

The main story is long enough, but doesn't overstay its welcome. Apart from the main story, the game offers a wide variety of side content, none of which feels boring or repetitive, barring some of the collectibles. It features a large ammount of hidden content and you always feel like you're discovering something new. The cast is top notch, with very memorable charactes. The story is well written, but it does diverge from it's initial focus on gang violence and reverts to a more classical GTA experience at a certain point. It does, however, return to it's roots and closes it out with a satisfactory ending. Overall, I'd say the story is more focused on the protagonist's personal journey and is executed extremelly well. The map is very large and diverse, successfully making each part feel alive and different. The gameplay is fun but slightly dated. The vehicle handling is superb, but the combat leaves a bit to be desired. The weapon variety is commendable, however, the lack of a proper cover system does create issues. Overall, this is a must play game that is greatly recommended.",1703806284,1703806284,True,1,0,0.505617976188659668,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1662907760,1702906142,True,5,1,0.533654510974884033,0,True,False,False

You play as a guy returning to the hood after being away for some years for his mothers funeral. And things dont go that smooth.....
While the controls and graphics might be dated by todays standards, the storytelling and open world aspects are still top notch. The locals are incredibly varied and the atmosphere in some places is amazing, especially when driving around and listening to the radio.

You owe it to yourself to play this at least once.

-You lose all your weapons when you die
-First 2 hours of the game is bullshit and all the missions are bullshit and nearly impossible to complete because of garbage mission and game design
-Combat is inconsistent as fuck, sometimes your bullets dont register or the enemy headshots you and kills you in 3 hits
-CJ's starting health is abysmal and a fly farting in his direction will kill him.
-You just die randomly at times like when climbing over a fucking fence
-At random, you will get shot at by all of the rival gang members, even when only being in their turf for 5 seconds.
-NPCs become beserk when you accidentally scrape their car, so then their car gains massive speed and weight buffs and they will constantly chase you and ram you off the road.
-No checkpoints, so that combined with you lose all your weapons when you die leads to losing massive progress and starting at square one with almost no way to get weapons other than a shitty ass pistol within the first 2 hours of the game
-Depending on the mission, if you fail, you will be stranded in the middle of nowhere with no form of transportation.
-You either must play with 20 FPS, or uncapped FPS, there is no in-between. And uncapped FPS leads to massive issues with gameplay and the game engine.
-Some missions just dont work like the Cesar Vialpando mission being near impossible to complete since the buttons for the mini-game are switched, reversed and just dont register sometimes.
-You can no longer buy the original game on the steam store anymore, you must buy the definitive edition.

Land of the heinous, gangbangers, and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing, even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast with the flag on the strap, that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get super cut or big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats, respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat, and sex appeal
You get clothes from Bincos and Pro Laps
Sub Urban, ZIP, Victim, and D. Sachs
Watch your back when you in rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survivals good (Survivals good)
Ducking shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out busting, gunning 'til they tuck their tail
It seem like I'm on impossible missions (Impossible missions)
Twisted predicaments hostile positions (Hostile positions)
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
'Cause the 'Dreas for the gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the 'bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains blow for how you do your fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones

Listen for sirens, they don't got none

The cast of Friends, including Buffy and the Scooby Gang, sit on the couch. CJ from GTA San Andreas hands out game controllers. The door opens, and the MYSTERY INC. GANG (Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma) enters.

ROSS:
(holding a controller) Okay, so what's the deal with this game? Are we saving the world or just stealing cars?

BUFFY:
Actually, it's a bit of both. We're in the gangsta world of San Andreas, where CJ here is trying to save his family and take over the streets.

MONICA:
Gangsta? Like hip-hop gangsta or ""I just stole your pizza"" gangsta?

CJ:
Both, homie. Grove Street life, ya know?

XANDER:
So, it's like a combination of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and ""Breaking Bad""?

JOEY:
Whoa, breaking bad? Like, are we cooking meth in the game?

WILLOW:
No, Joey, it's more about drive-bys than drive-throughs.

(They all start playing, laughter and chaos ensuing as they navigate the game world. The MYSTERY INC. GANG looks on, confused.)

SHAGGY:
Like, Scoob, did we take a wrong turn at Albuquerque?

FRED:
This doesn't look like any mystery we've solved before.

VELMA:
And who are these people? ""Scooby Gang""? What kind of name is that?

BUFFY:
Hey, we've been the ""Scooby Gang"" way before you guys were solving mysteries.

SHAGGY:
Zoinks! We've got some impostors.

ROSS:
No, no, guys, we're the original Scooby Gang. We even have a Phoebe Buffay the Vampire Slayer.

PHOEBE:
Yeah, I slay vampires with my guitar and the power of weirdness.

SCOOBY-DOO:
Rikes! Rooby-Rooby-Roo, what's going on here?

DAPHNE:
I think we've entered a crossover episode.

MONICA:
(looking at Mystery Inc.) Are you guys from ""Friends"" too?

VELMA:
(confused) No, we're from ""Scooby-Doo."" But who are you people?

(The chaos continues as they all try to explain their respective worlds to each other. Matthew Perry, as Chandler, appears in the game as a virtual character.)

CHANDLER:
Could this game BE any more chaotic?

EVERYONE:
(laughs)

ROSS:
Man, we miss you, Chandler.

BUFFY:
Yeah, rest in peace, Matthew Perry. You brought so much joy and sarcasm into our lives.

MONICA:
Let's dedicate this virtual mayhem to Chandler!

(They continue playing, reminiscing and making in-game tributes to the late Matthew Perry.)

WILLOW:
Okay, can we talk about this game? The open-world concept is revolutionary! I mean, I just stole a plane, and now I'm flying over Los Santos. ✈️

FRED:
That's nothing. I found a mystery van in the game, and now we're cruising in style. 🚐

BUFFY:
And the story? It's like a mix of ""The Sopranos"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" CJ is on a quest for revenge and family, just like me. 🔪🧛‍♀️

DAPHNE:
Oh, I love a good revenge story. It's so mysterious. 🕵️‍♀️

(The MYSTERY INC. GANG looks at Daphne, confused.)

VELMA:
And what about the music? It's like a blast from the past. 🎵

JOEY:
Yeah, totally. I got in a car, and ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey started playing. It was like a scene from a classic rock opera. 🎸🎤

SCOOBY-DOO:
Rooby-Rooby-Roo, did someone say ""classic rock""? 🤘

XANDER:
And the humor in this game? It's Chandler-level sarcastic. 😂

PHOEBE:
Chandler would have loved this game. I can feel his sarcasm resonating through the pixels. 😎

SHAGGY:
Like, speaking of pixels, are we sure this is real life or just a game? 🎮

BUFFY:
We're all in this together, whether it's real or virtual. Let's make it a night to remember. 🌟

Gang Wars. You take over a territory, it's yours.
Robbing dealers for a quick buck.

Sure the game is kinda clanky in the way it plays at times.

I've completed this game so many times.

I had one just now that froze on a black screen and held my cursor. So I couldn't end the process in Task Manager, cause I didn't know how to do that without a mouse. It's delete (Del), btw.

So yeah. Great game, poor port. Again, understandable for a 20 year old game. But the nostalgia isn't worth the headache. It's much better to play the original on console or emulate it. Or get the remaster, I guess.

-----------------

For the most part, it's the game I remember. It's awesome, though it's age does show. 

I used to play this on PS2, and I feel like a few things are quite different on the PC port. Timers, for instance. Things disappear way too quickly. If a Balla drops a gun, you better haul ass to go get it or it's gone. Then again, if you remember some of the gun spawns or go for the tags, it really doesn't matter. 
Another timer that seems absurdly fast is the girlfriend one. Denise seems to call every day and when you don't go out, that bar drops fast, man. Again though, not sure it matters. I can never remember what you get from her, so it can't be that great.

What does matter though, is that the physics get quirky on higher frame-rates. I think it's different depending on the PC, but when I let it go above 60, cars start auto-braking when I let go of gas. It may affect the lowrider and dance minigames as well, but my timing could just be terrible. On the lowrider one, it seems that for some people, like me, the vertical directions are reversed. Up is down, down is up. Do if you see a lot of ""Bads"" that feel like they shouldn't be, try swapping those keybinds.

And the AI... god, the AI... But that was always terrible. You don't need em anyway. Just grab yourself an AK and make Los Santos green again!

So yeah, couple of quirks. Still one of the best games I've ever played, though. Enjoying every second of it again... when I'm not dealing with those quirks lol

edit: just leave the frame limiter on. Swimming doesn't work with it off either. Who knows what else breaks. Shame, but it is a 20 year old game.",1698527476,1698700864,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was 9 years old when San Andreas became a media storm, with game’s name being whispered among concerned parents as a threat they should protect their children from. My mum bought into the paranoia. One evening I was suspiciously questioned by her: “What do you know about San Andreas?” Sensing a potential trap, I played dumb to bring out her own thoughts and opinions first. This introduced a new era of parental awareness around video games and, in my mind, San Andreas represents one of the last victims of mature content controversy from a now bygone era.

Nearly 20 years on, violent titles no longer bat an eye. Their ubiquity, social acceptance and their transition to digital storefronts meant such games couldn’t be hidden behind shop counters. San Andreas isn’t just a time capsule for controversy, but also cutting edge graphics, genre foundations and pop culture references. Going into San Andreas, I wondered if such an aggressively 2004 game would still play well. It also represented the first time I’ve been able to play it fully, at my own leisure. Take that, mum.

San Andreas is a story-focused game and there are nearly 100 levels spanning around 25 hours to complete. You play as Carl Johnson, and each chapter is connected to a different part of the city, swapping up the environments and themes to keep the game fresh. The first chapter is mostly gangbanging around Los Santos as you represent Grove Street, affectionately termed ‘The Grove’. Story-wise, this chapter introduces the game’s most iconic characters such as the Eazy-E tribute Ryder, and wanna-be kingpin Smoke. 

OG Loc is a standout character: a studio gangster who you help cheat his way into the rap game. Immediately his missions are filled with standout lines, like when he’s released from jail:

[i] “Man, I ain’t free! My parole officer lined me up with a job” [/i]
[i] “Motherfucker always trying to keep a player down” [/i]

His wildcard energy matched with deep insecurity over his street credentials, and you’re responsible for stealing rhyme books for him while Grove Street pump money into releasing his debut album ‘Str8 From Tha Streetz (and ode to Eazy-E’s double LP ‘Str8 Off Tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton’) and his clothing line. 

While San Andreas social commentary is mostly satire, the unrestrained Catalina provides a surprisingly poignant moment of feminism, albeit in the middle of a crime spree, when she shouts:

[i] ""If we're passionate, [men] say we're crazy, if we're upset, you say we're hysterical, we sleep with men, we're sluts, if we don't put out we're frigid bitches."" [/i]

The rest of the San Andreas politics isn’t usually played so sincerely. Most crime bosses in SA are insecure, impulsive and hedonistic. However, I really enjoyed the Chinese Triad leader Woozie who challenges these expectations. Woozie is calm, relaxed and humbled by his blindness. He performs his role as a criminal boss with the least amount of bloodshed, is rarely angry, and always treats people with dignity and respect, including himself. I loved the occasional glimpses into his past times, which instead of involving hookers and violence, include mini golf and video-games, leading to a great exchange when he admits his blindness to Carl. 

[i] Carl: “Uh, one last thing. You do know that I'm black, right? And not Chinese.” [/i]
[i] Woozie: “I'm blind, Carl, not stupid.” [/i]

Woozie’s character teaches CJ to see past a person’s disability and instead value them for their intelligence and skill. In another instance, one of Woozie’s henchmen puts down two casino chips in front of him:

[i] Woozie : One's a fake. [/i]
[i] Carl Johnson : That's amazing. You didn't even touch them. [/i]
[i] Woozie : No. I just took a guess. Why else would he come in with two chips and sound so worried? [/i]

The first chapter of San Andreas is filled with admittedly funny stereotypes running the show, yet it feels the wittiest in the later chapters when it purposefully subverts expectations for its jokes. It doesn’t stop a car outlet being named “Wang Cars”, but the balance of juvenile and witty stops San Andreas from feeling pretentious.

As you might expect, there is jank. San Andreas vehicles drive horribly on KB+M (a curse for playing GTA on such an uncool platform) and the shooting features the worst targeting system you’ve ever experienced on a controller. By the second on-foot combat mission, ‘Sweet’s Girl’, I was already struggling to line up my character, select a weapon, lock on, and fire: all to kill a single enemy. To do a driveby, you have to press RT + B + A simultaneously while also steering your car - it’s hell. Eventually I settled into a 360 controller for driving, for the benefits of analog, while switching to KB+M for manual shooting sections, which felt much quicker to aim and shoot.

However, the characters and storylines carry GTA San Andreas. While the driving is merely okay, and the combat often downright bad, the memorable cast and humour gives the game a huge boost of heart and soul. Spending 25 hours with these characters is fun, and I haven’t even mentioned the Samuel L Jackson voiced Officer Tenpenny, who virtually reprises his role from Pulp Fiction. Make to use the mod GTA Classic Enhanced to fix some issues and restore 21 licensed music tracks, and this game is still worth playing now.",1697361116,1697361329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

San Andreas looked at all the freedom in GTA 3 and Vice City and gave us even more. A massive game, even to today's standards, stretching across 3 cities in a state based on both California and Nevada, and truly reaching a point of bizarre and grandiose with missions that GTA later took with the PSP games, GTA 5, and even Saints Row tried to copy before going way off the deep end. 

CJ is customsable beyond belief, with you being able to choose his clothes, hairstyles, give him tattoos, and even affecting his body weight and muscle mass. This GTA is easily the closest the franchise came to making an RPG, with skill levelling in operating vehicles and weapons. The freedom is unmatched and for the GTA with the longest storyline (spanning exactly 100 missions with a speedrun world record as high as 3 hours), it's also got the most that can be done post game - CJ can capture all the turf in Los Santos, buy out all of the many properties in the game, can customise and tune out his cars (later expanded upon in GTA 5), and rampages and 6-Star chases feel the most fun and satisfying in this GTA - start a run in Los Santos and see how quickly, or IF, you can make it to San Fierro and then to Las Venturas. It's a blast.

The game does have some minor moot points - the graphics despite this being the best looking base 3D era GTA still haven't aged particularly well and the trademark compressed voices outside of cutscenes also stick out a lot more than they used to. Some missions are just ridiculously difficult and despite the RPG stat system being welcomed, some missions are gated behind certain conditions relating to it which can become annoying. 

But all in all, this is the GTA that really showed that Rockstar are capable of masterpieces. Probably one of the biggest injustices in video game review journalism was this getting 9.9 from IGN and not 10. It's not my personal favourite GTA, but it's damn near a masterpiece that really pushed the limits of what the PS2, and any console or even PC games, could do at the time.

Why yes I am reviewing a game that's now pulled from stores! What's T2 going to do to me now? I can make fun of this game all I want because I can!

San Andreas has become a martyr of a game in the modern age, a hitching post for a generation of neo-boomers to sit back and talk about the good ol' days. Long before GTA V's painfully ironic humor, and before Rockstar realized the absolute money printer that was GTA:O, when they were making ""new"" games. The send off to the ol' 3D engine of the previous GTA games, SA was supposed to be bigger, better, shinier, more polished and definitely not an almost overly massive even for the time project that had to be cut back SEVERAL times in development.

You play as CJ Johnson, a banger who returns home from Liberty City to find his mom is dead, his hood has gone wild and his crew is either almost dead, turning state's evidence or being murdered by the Ballas. It's up to you to somehow figure out what's going down in Los Santos and don't question how this also involves you going to San Fierro, beating up Charlie Murphy and MC Eiht, then going to Las Venturas and robbing a casino and THEN going back to shoot Sam Jackson in the face. Intercut with the Legally Mandated amount of gimmick missions. And gaps in the radio from the original OST that was pulled because the license ran out.

No I'm not mad that Bounce FM is now decimated. Not at all.

San Andreas reminds me of something like Saints Row: The Third. It's a cumulative game, the coagulation of 2-4 different game's worth of content, ideas and gimmicks sandwiched between two oversized slabs of Texas Toast. It is, without question, very long and filled with so many oddball ideas that don't realistically matter. What does the gym give you? Why do you have to actually go and eat food? Is it worth making yourself fat or doing the low rider races? No one knows, nor do they question the plot bouncing around SoCal like a manic pixie dream girl operating with a corporate credit card. 

This game is bad in my eyes, it's janky, its plot is overly weird and bounces around the place. But in comparison to what's happened to both it and GTA, I love it. Every dumb idea in this game comes not from some corporate idea of making sure there's ""everything"" possible in it, it comes from a bunch of dumbasses in England thinking what'd be cool to render in their game engine. It's honest jank, intentional and stupid. And I miss that.",1696104232,1696104232,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

You play as Carl Johnson, an ex-gangster who returns to his roots after the death of a relative. Finding the city he grew up in covered in gang warfare and his family fractured, Carl sticks around to help turn things around, but is caught up in the whims of corrupt police officers.

Initially a satiric take on the gang warfare rife in LA in the 90s, San Andreas develops into much more than this as you progress through the main storyline.

I’ve been listening to the songs for a long time, and never once did I get tired of it. I’m not joking when I say that GTA SA has shaped my tastes in music. GTA SA is the reason why I even love hip hop, classic rock, electronic, soul, funk, as much as I do. I love it so much that I have its entire soundtrack on my phone and listen to it while I’m driving long distances in real life. 
Still the story is
SA was a lot bigger with a lot more stuff tagged on but it didn't do it for me like Vice, I didn't like the characters and overall the game felt a lot more clunky, especially combat is so much worse than Vice City, and the god awful gun sounds too...the story is a litlle bit repetitive but still 10/10 for the childhood memories.",1694726731,1694726731,True,1,0,0.503793299198150635,0,True,False,False

[h1]Replayability for Days:[/h1]

Now, when it comes to replayability, San Andreas is off the charts. I mean, seriously, you can sink hundreds of hours into this bad boy and still find new things to do. Whether you're wreaking havoc in Los Santos or just cruising around on your BMX, there's always something to keep you entertained.

[h1]Unique Mechanics Galore:[/h1]

But what sets San Andreas apart from the newer GTA games are the mechanics. We're talking gang turf warfare, mini arcade games, and the ability to build up your character's body and stats like it's an RPG. It's a smorgasbord of gameplay features that you won't find in other GTA titles, and it's a blast to explore them all.

[h1]A Timeless Story:[/h1]

And let's not forget about the story. It's not just a game; it's a cinematic experience. The tale of CJ and his journey through the mean streets of San Andreas is nothing short of legendary. Looking at it now, I can't help but think it would make an excellent movie on its own. It's got drama, action, humor, and a whole lot of heart.

In conclusion, GTA San Andreas is a bona fide classic that still holds up to this day. It's a nostalgia trip, a sandbox playground, and a gripping story all rolled into one. If you haven't experienced the glory of San Andreas, you're missing out. So grab a green bandana, hop in a lowrider, and get ready to take on the mean streets of Los Santos once more.

One time I was in a Burger King parking lot hitting some Reggie stuff. Sadly though my dealer had spiked it with LSD so when I went inside the Burger King I was in a different world. Unfortunately, I had Del Taco that morning for breakfast so I rushed to the bathroom. I still had a little bit of control at this point so I sat on the toilet and I pulled out my iPhone 5. While hitting the Reggie stuff in my Civic I was playing GTA San Andreas on my phone. Considering I was delirious at this point I just started playing it on the toilet. I was moving CJ around in the game and I came across a symbol. The symbol was a green Grove Street Graffiti tag. I gazed at it for like 5 minutes. I then stood up and then extruded a log and smeared it on the wall of the Burger King bathroom. The only reason why I probably continued was because I had the Del Taco that morning, so it was kind of green so I was sort of tagging the bathroom (For Grove Street). After I finished representing Grove Street I built up the courage to leave the bathroom. Considering I was high as a cloud I didn't consider pulling up my pants so I was pretty much Gone with the Wind. The manager was brooming in the dining area and so he started chasing me with the Broom when I ran into the dining area. However, I was partially immobile due to my having my pants hinder my traversal capabilities. I eventually escaped the Burger King with the manager chasing me and I entered my car still with my pants down. I somehow got home I rushed to my bed and I passed out. I was in a 36-hour coma, so a large amount of bacterial growth occurred during my slumber. So, unfortunately, I got a staph infection and needed to go to the hospital. The doctors cleaned me and fix me all up though. Sadly, it ended up costing me $38,000 for all of the medical expenses. I have permanent skin damage in that area and I learned a valuable lesson.

Today as someone with half a brain I am surprised how this game was popular. It was probably just the gore and open world, and still. 
Every single aspect of this game could be better, maybe I am spoiled with half decent gta5

Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get supercut and big and buff, nice and straight

You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps
Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bus' a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas's full of gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy

Don't let the few spare hours on this Steam copy fool you. I've poured hundreds of hours into the single-player, and thousands into the free mod ""San Andreas Multiplayer"". Over this time you really get to learn the game engine's intricacies over that time, such as the zones that limit vehicle speeds (Gant Bridge/The Strip), how to increase motorcycle speed, and the joys of flying a WWII plane upside down, for dogfighting or for aerial stunts.

The story is a love letter to 80s and 90s crime dramas, a stern acknowledgement of the crack epidemic and 1992 LA riots, and of course Rockstar's penchant for satirizing American consumerism.

CJ and friends go from the hood to the hills, with a lot of obstacles and crazy moments in between. The total story should run about 30 hours long. The concept of family and gang culture is well rooted, so well rooted in fact that the rival gangs become hostile if you're spotted on their turf wearing gang colors.

And customization of Carl is RPG-level. Everything from the hats and sunglasses, to the individual pieces of clothing, sex appeal, driving/flying abilities, weapon mastery, fat and stamina levels (which influence movement animations, how high you can jump, and whether you can begin certain missions). Eating at restaurants, working out at the gym, and going to the driving/shooting range all influence their respective stat values.


It is truly amazing how much depth they put into it. So much, in fact, that I think GTA IV and later games were right to scale it down. When I play single player San Andreas, I have to turn on the ""Never Hungry"" cheat, because I would never like to enter the fast food restaurants unless I truly wanted to.

But anyway - besides the main story, there's tons more to do. You had food delivery missions, gang wars, dating, triathlon races, gambling games, arcade games. But that's not all - you also had the police missions, ambulance missions, basketball, lowrider missions, and more.

From the rooftops and secret areas of Chinatown/Carlton Heights, to the stunningly accurate depictions of Las Vegas metro, intricate neighborhood dwellings of East Los Santos, Rockstar really took their time in crafting an SF-LA-LV experience all could appreciate.

On consoles, the two player mode was great, allowing tag-team gameplay that had you and a friend become a wrecking ball of destruction.

Definitely give this game a try. It's forgivable if you can only acquire the Unreal Engine Remastered Version, but the Renderware original has the unique charm and flying physics the remaster lacks.",1375418920,1691262176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, if you want more San Andreas content, there still is a vibrant multiplayer and modding community.

To me it's even better than GTA 5, cuz GTA San Andreas has three big cities: Los Santos (Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas) unlike GTA 5, which has only one major city (Los Santos) and the rest is very rural with a few small villages & settlements.

Another pro-GTA San Andreas reason is building interiors. You can enter nightclubs, bars, casinos, fast food restaurants and so on. In GTA 5 most buildings are inaccessible, which is pretty sad.

And don't forget that in GTA San Andreas you can actually build your muscles and make out the result, unlike in GTA V and improve your endurance in the gym.

Another reason, why I prefer GTA San Andreas is, because San Andreas offers a wide range of side missions like boxing, BMX and NRG-500 challenges, courier trips, lowrider challenges, truck missions, quarry missions and arena challenges, which I've missed in the most recent GTA release.

Eventually everyone has his own opinion about what he/she prefers, but I think it's not all about graphics each time, instead the gameplay and experience matters more, at least to me. 

It just has a bigger variety than GTA 5 and more opportunities to do things and mess around in general and also allows random incidents like shootings between the police and gangs/criminals, communications between pedestrians themselves and between them and the player to happen.",1480623661,1689782346,True,9,1,0.61258244514465332,3,True,False,False

It's a pity that Rockstar retired it from the store when Definitive Edition came out. Still, if you have this game in your library, I recommend it to you.

Compared to the killing machine Claude and the criminal Tommy, we play as a amateur gangster named CJ, who traveled back home to Los Santos (Los Angeles). With the help of his hood fellas, CJ will make his gang Grove Street great again. I consider it an excellent story. 

Luckily, gameplay aged better than Vice City's one. Now you can carry more weapons, drive better and increase stats such as being strong, having stamina... and of course, swimming. The only two things I hate from the game is the manual save every time and how primitive are the driving controls. Still, it aged better than Vice City.

I can't blame how the game looks, since it's a 2004 game, but remember that same year we got Half Life 2, which almost 20 years later it aged like fine wine compared to the cartoon style of San Andreas. The recreation of Los Angeles in the game is well done tho.

The sound in the Grand Theft Auto games never fails, and San Andreas is no exception. Not only the voice acting is good, but the music selected for the game is the best, truly the greatest music of the 90's.

Rockstar retired the game from Steam in order to let Definitive Edition replace the originals, so if you want to buy it, sorry. You can't.

As someone who played the game almost 20 years after its release, I can understand why many people consider it the best of the saga",1689703507,1689703507,True,1,0,0.520201981067657471,0,True,False,False

1. The story is extremly long and sometimes repetitive, i like games with good stories but everything has a limit. GTA V took only 2 days to complete the storyline, gta 4 took longer indeed but considering the game's physycs and mission design completing gta 4 was satisfying also because of how well the intrigue was made but san andreas's story is simply repetitive, u play as Carl Johnson ''CJ'' and u get to do some missions so in the end u get ur brother out of jail but these missions, most of them, are hard to complete due to being no checkpoints so if u fail a mission u must go back and restart the whole mission not to say that u gotta travel to the place where the mission is triggered wich is really a pain. This game literally takes months to complete and the physycs of it will really not make it enjoyable.
2. The controls of the original game are HORRIBLE, besides this the missions design is a very good one for its time even ahead of it but the problem is that  some missions are literally made in such a way that they represent a torture to complete, like i remmember that mission where i had to fly with a plane and stay low so the radar wont see me so i would die a  lot simply because flying controls are horrible and because i would get hit by trees that would not render cuz yes 2004-2005 game what ya expect? or zeros missions but at least these were optional. 
3. GTA san andreas OG version is not avaible anymore on the steam store and the only way to legit buy it is to buy  a key from eneba wich is extremly overpriced in my opinion considering that i payed only 3 euros in early summer 2021 for this game. The definitive edition is basically same game, same physycs, only with more bugs and better graphics and also checkpoints so u dont have to restart the whole mission (this is the only thing i like about san andreas remaster) but is overpriced too considering the normal price is 60 euros and on sale rn it only reaches like 30 euros. 
4.Some people play this game because of how easy to mod it is and for how many mods there are but i think gta 5 got an even better modding part than gta san andreas so just go buy gta 5 if u dont have it already and mod it, belive me it will be way more enjoyable.
In the end, gta san andreas was a game really ahead of its time but tbh i would not reccomend to try in 2023 simply due to how expensive the game kinda is right now for what it has to offer. I belive that the reason why this game is still popular is because gta fans  got bored of waiting for gta 6 since we didnt have a new gta 6 game since 2013 wich is true but i want to say that in fact rdr2 is ,in my opinion, gta 6 but in the wild west so really reccomend that game to try. Anyways, gta 6 approaches and it might come very soon and i can guarantee that if it will be a ground breaking game everybody will play gta 6 and most people will forget about gta san andreas and literally all gta games besides gta 6 ofc in general (thats what happened when gta 5 came out, gta 3 and gta vc back then were really really popular but when gta 5 came they died and i really thing gta san andreas is next).
If lets say this game would be remade and it would have modern physycs and graphics and the missions wont be a pain in the ass and made enjoyable then this game would probably be the best game but until that happens is just obsolete.

In my opinion, downgrade it, just look for GTA San Andreas Steam downgrader. (That's why I only have 42 hours, I actually played it a LOT more, steam just doesn't recognize it because the game folder is outside of steamapps.) If you need a tutorial, probably best that you don't do it or you're going to break your game. Backup everything, and start messing with it, modloader, cleo, go on the internet and look for whatever you wish, you can find a bunch of cool stuff really easily, it's really intuitive to mod it, and makes the experience so much better. Just SkyGfx for that PS2 filter and some bugfixes and you're good to go if you like the vanilla experience. If you don't mind the horrible Steam version, go ahead, download it and play it as is, you'll be missing out, but the game is awesome nevertheless. If you have experience with modding and/or have a triple digit IQ, you can probably make the game a lot better, without messing with the immersion and original feel of the game. I don't know if Rockstar or Steam cares, but it's a singleplayer 20 year old game, who cares if I mess with the files? My game. I bought it. I supported both Steam and Rockstar by buying it. Anyway, if you're looking for an honest review of the game, it's good, not perfect, as are all old games, but really awesome.

Welcome to San Andreas, I'm CJ from Grove Street
Land of the heinous, gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competin', even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast wit' the flag on the strap, that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get supercut and big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats: Respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps
Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bus' a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas's full of gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones, dump 'em out
Bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with the shot gun
Hittin' them up, what that Grove Street like
In a dirty slingshot and old Levi's",1685961132,1685961132,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

Each area is intricately designed, capturing the essence of 1990s California and offering a sense of realism and authenticity.

GTA:SA, the game that's streets I knew better than my own neighbourhood and still can find my way around today easier than I can reverse out my own driveway. 
Back when I was a mere console peasant, there were soooo many extra hours in a day back then. 
Bachelor hood was the life, work all day, come home to a cold beer, a fresh bag of cheesy puffs and some sweet mary-jane and then the sweet sound of a PS booting up and that intro music kicking in.
It took me 7 years to 100% SA back in the console days, now days I get too sidetracked destroying things!

GTA:SA is a great game. Sure there are newer GTA's out there, but SA was always destined to be different. To me, it's home. Grove street was where it was at, taking selfies with your homies, robbing houses in the night and cruising the streets starting gang wars in the day, listening the the best soundtrack ever made while flying through air to get that stunt bonus, riding a bmx up and down the mountains and realising your flying skills needed work, dodging tanks and derailing freight trains.... 

Nothing takes me back to better days that playing this game.

100% the greatest game I have ever played in my life.

Rating: ★★★★★

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas remains a timeless masterpiece that set the standard for open-world gaming. Released over a decade ago, this iconic title continues to captivate players with its vast, immersive world, engaging storyline, and unmatched level of freedom.

Set in the fictional state of San Andreas during the early 1990s, the game follows the journey of Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, a former gang member returning to his hometown after the death of his mother. The narrative delves into themes of family, loyalty, and the gritty realities of gang life, delivering a compelling and memorable storyline that keeps players invested throughout.

The sprawling open world of San Andreas is a marvel in itself. From the bustling streets of Los Santos to the rural countryside and the gang-infested territories, the sheer size and diversity of the map are staggering. The attention to detail is astounding, with dynamic weather, realistic NPC behavior, and a vast array of activities and missions to undertake.

One of the game's standout features is its unparalleled freedom. Players can explore the vast landscape, engage in side activities such as gambling, racing, and even customizing CJ's appearance. The ability to interact with a wide range of characters, each with their unique personalities and stories, adds depth to the world and makes it feel alive.

The gameplay mechanics strike a balance between accessibility and complexity. Driving mechanics are intuitive, gunplay feels satisfying, and the RPG-like progression system allows players to enhance CJ's skills and attributes over time. The missions are varied and offer a mix of thrilling action, clever storytelling, and creative objectives, ensuring there's never a dull moment.

The soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas deserves special mention. With an extensive collection of licensed tracks from the '90s, spanning various genres, the radio stations in-game provide an immersive and nostalgic backdrop to the gameplay experience.

While the visuals may show their age by today's standards, the art direction and attention to detail in the environment remain impressive. Additionally, the PC version offers a modding community that has breathed new life into the game, allowing players to enhance graphics, add new content, and extend the replay value.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a true gaming classic that has left an indelible mark on the industry. Its rich open world, compelling storyline, and unparalleled level of freedom continue to captivate players of all generations. Whether you're revisiting it for the nostalgia or experiencing it for the first time, this game is an absolute must-play for any fan of open-world adventures.",1684109288,1684109288,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

And memes warped one thing for me: I spent most of the game wondering when CJ missing or not following a train would be a major plot point.

Vice City is still my favourite, perhaps due to nostalgia and perhaps due to the 1980s vibe being done so well, but this game is undeniably better. It really is Rockstar (North)'s masterpiece. A long story, varied game play, flying planes (while still frustrating at first) is done well enough that it can be a part of a whole bunch of story missions, memorable characters. An absolutely glorious soundtrack. While this doesn't look great, given its age, mods can make it look presentable on a modern system.

The game's sprawling open world, compelling story, and memorable characters have made it a beloved classic that still holds up to this day.

One of the standout features of San Andreas is its nostalgic appeal. For many of us who played this game as kids, it brings back fond memories of late nights spent exploring its vast open world, causing chaos and mayhem, and engaging in epic car chases and shootouts. The game's vibrant and colorful setting, with its 90s-inspired soundtrack and iconic locales such as Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas, all add to the nostalgia factor.

But beyond its nostalgic appeal, San Andreas is also an incredibly well-designed game. The story is engaging and well-written, with memorable characters such as CJ, Big Smoke, and Officer Tenpenny, all brought to life by fantastic voice acting performances. The game's open world is vast and filled with endless possibilities, from robbing banks and hijacking planes to racing cars and engaging in street fights.

The graphics and sound design in San Andreas are also impressive, especially considering the game's age. The game's visuals are colorful and detailed, with decent character animations and pretty environments. The game's soundtrack is also top-notch, with a wide variety of music from various genres and eras, perfectly capturing the vibe of the 90s.",1682081718,1682081718,True,1,0,0.502242147922515869,0,True,False,False

The entire playthrough is just me waiting till it gets better but guess what, the community of this game agrees itself that the further you are in the game the worse it gets so better never came. the story was dogsheite imo so many stupid choices made for the sake of the story, not being able to restart missions doesn't add to the happiness of completing them like a lot of people say, it's just fucking annoying holding my breath near the end of every mission because i don't want to replay it again. I wouldn't mind replaying them if the missions were actually fun but it's not exactly fun driving from point a to point b to kill someone to drive to point c and finish the mission over and over and yeah there are exceptions (most of those exceptions still being bad lmao) but most missions are mainly what i said before with the point a poit b. this imo is the most over rated gta game in the whole franchise I seriously cannot see why anyone would recommend or even say that it's the best one out of them all. people praise the game often for the rpg elements but they're so mid? I myself like grinding and levelling up and stuff in games but in san andreas its just painfully boring, im sorry but going to the gym to spam 2 buttons repeatedly for a minute isn't exactly fun, even gta 5 does this better and that games rpg elements arent that great. if you have nostalgia for this game I can see why you're able to ignore the flaws and still enjoy it but I don't and I've come into this game after being spoiled with the modern games so I'm gonna be bias but I regret buying this. but I can't deny this game is what sparked a ton of great projects and took a huge part to getting gaming where it is today.",1681738119,1681738246,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a shame that the developer removed older game from Steam store. People would still definitely buy this if it was available, younger generations would discover this masterpiece. 
I'd like to add that it's false info you can't play SA-MP on steam version. It'possible you just have to search a bit ;) and even SA-MP playing hours count towards GTA San Andreas steam playtime, you just have to disable steam overlay so SA-MP doesn't crash.

But what really sets San Andreas apart from other games is its attention to detail. From the way the cars handle, to the different weapons available, everything feels so realistic. And the fact that you can customize your character's appearance and even build up your own gang just adds to the already impressive depth of the game.

The atmosphere they build around Los Santos is impeccable. The radio stations are etched into my brain. The story is memorable and the game just clicks after sometime.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Pro's
-Classic! This game never gets old and is always fun to paly
-Considering the fact this game was released in 2004 the content (Missions and side quests) are fun 
-This game has machanics i wish newer GTA's had for examples Girlfriends or being able to modify CJ (muscle,fat ect) are all solid features
-The beta content is fun to look at and add into the game 

Con's
-Having to mod the game to make it playable without game breaking bugs speaks for itself 
-This is the modding videos i use and recomend

-[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yn0kWkiToY&t=0s] [/url]
-[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbWqjtc4ME&t=0s] [/url]
-From Las Ventures the gameplay and missions feel quite dry the returning to Los Santos missions feel quite boring as well. Having to retake the teritory in Los Santo i just realy boring 
-Lack of content for Ryder. His death fells quick and as if he is a random NPC he is hardly mentiond throught out the game

Something I should have never needed to do in the first place and which I should be compensated for alone let alone refunded for the game itself. Pathetic. This platform is run by f*cking thieves, and is now confirmed. I can even screenshot their proud response telling me that they're happy to steal my money despite the game still being broken. 

F*cking cheap scumbags at Steam won't refund this BROKEN GAME despite it being a known issue in the Steam community. SAN ANDREAS CRASHES FREQUENTLY but they'd prefer to just rip off customers who bought this DEFECTIVE TITLE.

Just as a reminder, STEAM ARE A BUNCH OF RIP OFF C*NTS AND THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL HERE IS THE MONEY I'VE SPENT ALREADY. BUT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE A COMPLETE BUNCH OF MONEY-GRUBBING WHORES WHO CAN ALL GO AND F*CK THEIR MOTHERS DISEASED P*SSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ahem...

BROKEN. San Andreas crashes at the start of the first mission every time. I'm sure someone has made a fix somewhere but IF I PURCHASED A GAME HERE IT SHOULDN'T NEED A F*CKING GODDAMN FIX TO RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I grew up playing the first ever GTA back on the PS1 when it was top down and as years went by i remember getting all the newer GTA Releases year by year and loved everysingle one of them.




Some points i do have to note as of writing this review you can no longer obtain the Steam Versions of these classics anymore including GTA 3 , VIce City Etc instead they replaced it with the crappy ""Defective Editions"" but even then the Steam Versions werent really the best versions the original Retail Copys WERE THE BEST PERIOD. plus now it requires that awful rockstar launcher (Just like most games in this day and age) but overall i love Rockstar Games not necassirly GTA but all their other games aswell including Red Dead Redemption , Bully , The Warriors , Manhunt etc. 




Overall this game is legendary and no one can change my mind. Amazing Story , Amazing Gameplay , Amazing Music and Soundtracks. this is one of those games you just keep coming back and playing over and over and i never once get bored of it. Highly Recommend it but honestly now you cant obtain these perfect Classic versions anymore you should look around and try to find a Retail Copy of the game and mod the hell out of it you can restore the original orange PS2 Atmosphere and tons more and make it the best version to play on PC",1676132756,1676132756,True,0,0,0.43847241997718811,0,True,False,False

This game is a classic in the world of open-world action-adventure games, and it continues the Grand Theft Auto series' tradition of providing players with an immersive and entertaining gaming experience.

One of the standout features of GTA: San Andreas is its huge and detailed open-world. The game's world of San Andreas is vast and diverse, and players can explore every corner of it, from the bustling cities to the quiet countryside. The game's graphics are also top-notch, with detailed character models and environments that bring the world to life.

I always thought this game was the pinnacle of gaming, having never played it. The best selling game on the PS2 (the best selling console of all time)? My GTA experience was the HD generation of 4 and 5, so going backwards to play this felt very clunky in controls. The map design, for as well representative of the cities as they were at the time, doesn't even come close to the level of immersion in later Rockstar games. Even the story, featuring as many memorable characters, voices, and memes as it does (who can recite Big Smoke's order?), didn't keep me interested in what happens to the Grove Street gang when Rockstar has told better stories than this in the Red Dead series. 

Calling this a classic is deserved considering how monumental it's impact on the gaming industry it was when it released (see every open-world game after 2005), and how much it influenced public perception of later GTA games (the hate on 4's serious story and seeming lack of fun vs. 5's return to Los Santos and blockbuster action).

GTA San Andreas is the magnum opus of the GTA 3D trilogy. This game was so ambitious and I sure had a blast playing this from beginning to end. I told myself I would at least try to beat the trilogy without cheats and glitches and I gotta say sometimes I can't believe this game fit on a DVD disc with how much content this game throws at you. The story is probably my favorite out of the Trilogy Games. Missions are fair and managed to beat them the first time apart from ZERO. (DAMN YOU ZERO). Memorable Characters from Woozie, Big Smoke, The Truth etc. I admire where it takes CJ story wise in his miscellaneous adventures through the state that is San Andreas. I played this with the Definitive Project Mod installed (HD Textures, 60 FPS etc.) and I did not have any issues or errors for the game. It was smooth as butter which says alot due to how much stuff can be thrown into the game itself! If you are wondering if you should give this game a try again. I would say absolutely of you managed to pick this up before Rockstar pulled the games! This game will make you go ""Ahh shit here we go again""",1675740818,1675740818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

at the time of writing this review, i have over fifty hours of gameplay in this game, and i have just completed all the story missions. yet, according to the game, i'm only a little bit over halfway done with everything there is to do in this game. how the hell did they put so much content in a 2004 game?

GTA:SA is so many things at once
firstly, it's a driving simulator of 212 individual vehicles: various cars, bicycles, motorcycles, boats, aeroplanes, trucks with or without trailers, harvesters, tractors, tanks, helicopters, so on and so forth... each vehicle has its own personality and feel, and feels different to drive. 

it's an excellent single-player FPS, which often feels very similar to games like Goldeneye 007. the firearms feel great and shoot out missions can be very challenging, requiring great strategy, practice and planning

it's an endless adventure game. the giant map has so much to see and discover that, even with dozens of hours in the game, you continuously find new stuff you've never seen before

it's an open-world game. you can do whatever the hell you want and you genuinely feel like you're even more than the main character.

it has phenomenal writing and some of the greatest cutscenes i've had the chance to watch in gaming. the game is written much like an extravagant hollywood action film, and with how self-aware it is, it succeeds at doing that much better than a vast majority of hollywood films. each character has an immense depth, sensibilities and the player gets attached. let me just say that the ending left me completely jawdropped.

it is such a perfect satire of everything that is wrong with american society, and while its absurdism gives it a certain step back from reality, now that i've visited some of the worst ghettos in the american south, and the more knowledgeable i get about american culture and politics, i feel like GTA:SA got a whole lot right about sociocultural issues in america.

it's truly a masterpiece. it's challenging, it makes you think, and it is phenomenally written. a must play. will definitely get through the rest of this game to 100% it.

please note that if you own this original steam version of the game, i strongly recommend downgrading the game to 1.0 for better graphics and performance. there are many good guides on steam that teach you how to do that and it made the experience a whole lot better for me",1674767411,1674767411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thats really cool and amazing game with great gameplay, music, plot, humor, characters and all the insane stuff that can happen during your playthrough. For sure this is a diamond of a game industry.

I don't care how shit the port is, I've not had too many issues with it other than occasional annoying crashes. Honestly, the game is fantastic. A huge improvement on basically everything from VC. Great story, the best music selection in any GTA, the best characters in any GTA, really tight driving controls, quite possibly the dumbest AI in any GTA, brilliant and fun storymode missions, the atmosphere of San Andreas, its forests, its deserts, its three cities, is phenomenal. Freeroam is still fun as ever, just driving around, getting your wanted level up, trying to see how long you can last, classic GTA goodness. Only real complaints about the game are the offputting graphical bugs and a few annoying side missions, but other than that, it's a masterpiece.

It genuinely fucking pains me that the only way to officially buy this amazing game first hand is now is the absolutely abhorrent, terrible, piece of shit that is the definitive edition.

[h1] Original Review [/h1]
Definitely one of the best games in the GTA series. An Absolute masterpiece and relic of it's time.
I gotta tell you, playing this game after 12 years again gives me so much nostalgia. I can just vibe on a gloomy rainy day, chill and go through the story. Which is what I do with most games.

[b] Edited November 26th 2021 [/b]
I've changed this game from a thumbs up, to a thumbs down for the fact they removed this, along with III and Vice City off Steam in favour of the definitive trilogy instead of preserving the originals.

Would say that it is superior to Vice City in every aspect (even the map that, just for what it brings on Las Venturas, showed a lot of what made the Miami inspired ambience of the predecessor pleasant); the plenty of resources helped Rockstar on providing a diversity on missions gameplays that make them unique and, even with the action-movie-vengeance-cliché-writing, the game can be joyful even nowadays.

Shame that it is unavailable on Steam, but i still recomend action games fans to give it a try.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, developed by Rockstar North and released in 2004, is an open-world action-adventure game set in the fictional state of San Andreas. I was excited to play this game because of its reputation as one of the most iconic and influential titles in the GTA series.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay in GTA: San Andreas is primarily focused on completing missions and activities as you progress through the story. These missions range from simple fetch quests to more complex heists and action sequences. The controls are fairly intuitive and responsive, although there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to the driving mechanics. One unique feature of the game is the ability to customize your character's appearance and skills by exercising, eating, and participating in mini-games. I didn't encounter any major bugs or glitches during my playtime.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
The story follows protagonist Carl ""CJ"" Johnson as he returns to his hometown of Los Santos after the death of his mother. He becomes embroiled in a gang war and must navigate the dangerous and corrupt world of San Andreas while trying to clear his name and protect his family. The characters are well-developed and the story is engaging, with a good mix of drama, humor, and action. The pacing is mostly well-done, although there are a few slow points where the story drags.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
The visual style of GTA: San Andreas is gritty and realistic, with detailed character models and environments. The graphics hold up well for a game that is over a decade old, although there are some rough edges and texture pop-in. The sound design is excellent, with a great soundtrack featuring a mix of licensed music and original compositions, as well as high-quality voice acting and sound effects.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
GTA: San Andreas has plenty of replay value, with a long campaign that can take upwards of 40 hours to complete, as well as numerous side missions and activities to keep you busy. There are also multiple endings depending on your choices throughout the game, which adds some replay value. In addition, the game has a robust multiplayer mode that allows you to join or create your own game sessions with friends or strangers.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, I enjoyed my time with GTA: San Andreas and would recommend it to fans of open-world games and the GTA series. The gameplay is solid, the story is engaging, the graphics and sound are good for the time, and there is plenty of content to keep you busy. The controls can be a bit finicky at times and the pacing can drag in places, but these are minor issues in the grand scheme of things. If you're looking for a classic open-world game with plenty of action and freedom, GTA: San Andreas is definitely worth checking out.",1672788806,1672788806,True,1,0,0.506578981876373291,0,True,False,False

This game has been a staple in my gaming diet for almost two decades now and it still holds up remarkably well. From the moment I boot it up and hear that iconic intro song, I'm immediately transported back to a time where life was simpler and all I had to worry about was causing chaos in the streets of Los Santos.

Speaking of causing chaos, the replayability of this game is off the charts. Whether I'm trying to 100% the game or just messing around with friends online, there's always something new to do. And let's not forget about the endless supply of mods available for this game. From graphical overhauls to completely new storylines, the modding community for GTA SA is still alive and well.

But for me, the biggest draw of this game is the nostalgia factor. I can't even count how many hours I spent playing this game as a teenager and it brings back so many fond memories. And let's not forget about the amazing soundtrack, which has become a hallmark of the GTA series. Who doesn't love cruising down the highway with some old school hip hop blaring from the radio?

And let's not forget about SA-MP, the fan-made multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas. This thing has breathed new life into the game and it's a blast to play with friends.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

But yeah, all that feature does is it speeds up the game. And there's other issues like when you Alt+Tab your game gets stuck and you have to wait like 30 seconds for it to become playable again, but the longer you play the worse this issue gets so you might need to restart the game - I think this is also a Windows 10 issue. Rockstar needs to remake these old games because technology has changed, they never did that. And also because fans have connected so much with the Rockstar characters that they want to see them again in future games. They're supposed to put out remakes or sequels by now, but eh, I guess they don't care about the fans.

Don't get this game thinking you're gonna re-live your nostalgia and play through the whole thing, you're not. trust me. unless you're dead sure don't do it. its because after you play the new games such as GTA V or Red dead redemption 2, you will know how much better the newer games really are, mechanically, in comparison to the old ones. The controls are way better. Once you get a taste of these new games, you just can't go back. So rule of thumb: don't buy an old game unless it's on a serious discount cause you really can't go wrong if you got it for cheap.

Now this game IS still playable, but ONLY if you can play without Alt+Tabbing a lot. The Alt+Tab problem is VERY ANNOYING. trust me you'll know when you experience it. somebody needs to fix this sht lol",1576365702,1670014488,False,0,0,0.476597219705581665,0,True,False,False

GTA:San Andreas is the longest game in the triology with implementation of RPG elements such as personal statistics and its sub categeries for the character which is more of a sandbox style.The main story is huge and the gameplay is nice with many new features,better environment and character movements.There are few missions which are very challenging and overall game has better replayable value.

Completed 100% according to stats.For the completionists there are many side missions,collectables and finding all the collectables is also a big challenge as the map is large so that player need to play strategically. 

The game has widescreen resolution issues which can be fixed through installing recommended patch and widescreen fix.

[list]
[*]	Likable characters, like Carl, Big smoke, Rider and Caesar who are well voice-acted. Samuel L Jackson also does a fantastic job of voice acting officer Tenpenny.
[*]	Brilliant and well done cut-scenes which have a comedy element to them. 
[*]	Fantastic story, you re-build your reputation in San Andreas. The game is very well paced. Sub-missions, new areas and weapons unlock as you progress through the game.  
[*]	This game seems to have an endless about of missions. You have the main missions plus you have a shit load of sub-missions like ambulance, cops, taxi, Freight, arena, the list goes on. The sub-missions are very rewarding as well, for example, once you complete the ambulance missions your health increases to 150% and the cop missions increases your armour to 150%. When you complete the arena unique vehicles spawn in the arena car park. 
[*]	Plenty of things to spend your money on; like clothes, jewellery, businesses, cribs and cars. 
[*]	Large selection of vehicles to drive, from cars, planes, boats, and motorbikes. Each vehicle type also has its own driving school which when you complete unlocks unique vehicles. 
[*]	An amazing soundtrack. My favourite radio station was probably radio Los Santos.
[*]	San Andreas has loads of cheats. I remember me and my friend used to try out each cheat; good times.      


[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[*]	It's a same they couldn't have added more weapons to the game.
[*]	You will be better off using a controller for this game, because flying isn't easy with keyboard and mouse and you also can't use auto aim.
[*]	The original version of San Andreas has been replaced with a HD version from a mobile port and as a result 16 songs have been lost. The music hasn't been restored to the game. (link below to songs which have been lost).
[/list]

[u]Conclusion[/u] 

One of my all time favourite games and in my opinion is the best game in the series. San Andreas is up there with half-life 2.  If you like vice city, GTA 3 or any 3rd person open-world shooters, then I highly recommend you buy this game. Final In game progress 86.10%.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a service model.

Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.

Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017. The game generally received positive reviews, with critics praising its combat mechanics and the immersive open world but criticizing its simplistic endgame and monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a revenue of more than $4 billion as of March 2022.",1667978743,1667978743,True,1,2,0.479104220867156982,0,True,False,False

Take-Two's greed knows no bounds and they removed it from the Steam page.. why? To sell their broken mobile port Defective Edition, on their own shitty and dysfunctional launcher.

They were taken off of Steam in favor of Rockstar's flawed ""definitive editions"" of each game, which are based off the mobile ports and only available through Rockstar's own games launcher. End of an era, I guess. There are other ways to find the original releases if you're knowledgeable, but this is undeniably a blow to game preservation on Rockstar's part.

Rockstar had also changed the Steam version of San Andreas from its original release. It has native Xbox controller support and higher-fidelity graphics on par with the 2014 re-release, but also less resolution options, less music tracks due to licensing issues (check [url=http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=928747]here[/url] for a list of what was removed) and a couple other issues. You can find information on unofficial fixes for this stuff such as the highly recommended SilentPatch [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/12120/discussions/0/34096318964479523/]here[/url].


Anyway. San Andreas is the fifth game in the Grand Theft Auto series, released in 2004. You've probably heard of the series if you're browsing this website, but if you haven't it's basically they're open-world sandbox games that let you simulate low-rent gangster movies. This particular entry has somewhat clunky controls compared to more modern GTA games, and its graphics weren't great even when it came out, if still charming in their own way.

But I ultimately think San Andreas is the best game in the series, even one of the best games of the 2000s, and not just because it has 'the most to do'. Grand Theft Auto V is technically higher on the 'fun scale' with superior gameplay, superior graphics and more optional side activities; it's certainly fun to play. The titles [i]before[/i] SA are really more valuable as pieces of gaming history, since they were generally more janky & limited, and even more cliched, than SA. And while SA is a functional game that absolutely has its charm - I'm partial to its pastiche of the 90s myself - that's not the main reason I'm saying it's the best.


No, my reasoning has to do with the story and the tone. GTA V's story is interesting enough in a doofy crime capers way, but the tone of that game is ultimately aggressively nihilistic and uncaring about almost anything within itself. Not to say these elements aren't present in San Andreas, but they're not nearly as strong or disheartening here.

GTA IV is better than V in this regard, I'd say, but it's not off the hook. It tried to be more serious, and while it made strides in that direction, the weight of its open-world gameplay ambitions ultimately hamstrung its story. I didn't mind its more muted tone, 'realistic' driving and lack of cheat codes (for the base game anyway), but there's no getting around the fact that having a main character who bemoans the atrocities of the Balkan Wars he survived but is perfectly able to wantonly run over pedestrians is...odd. The final act of the story resembling a cheap mafia film didn't exactly help either.

San Andreas, by contrast, doesn't just exist primarily to ""poke fun"" at American society so much as it tries to tell a story about a West Coast gangbanger with a heart of gold, trying to do right for his lower-class neighborhood, family and gang within the moral construct (and repressive society) he was born and raised in. It's ultimately more genuine than V because it cares enough about its characters not to utterly derail itself every time the game displays pathos for them. It's also not self-important enough to pretend that it wouldn't be a bad thing if it [i]did[/i] do that. Perhaps most importantly, it's self-aware enough not to be stony-faced at every turn it takes. It also helps that the game's loaded with memorable quotes and characters.


The characters themselves might not be particularly more savory, and certainly there's stereotypical/exaggerated behavior going on, but at least SA doesn't furiously punch in every direction or practically flash ""LAUGH AT THESE SAD LOSERS WHO ARE ALSO YOU, LOSER"" on the screen every time you see them interact with each other.

Not that this game is a literary masterpiece by any means, but it's the closest the series has come to that level. And while GTA IV was also trying to operate on the same level, albeit with its own direction and its own flaws, V was just a step back in this regard. There's always been puerile satire of society and voyeuristic displays of women in the 3D GTA games, including in San Andreas, and it's always gotten disheartening if you played for long enough, but SA...isn't quite as bad in this regard, I feel. There's enough determination and hope in the story for the game not to crash and burn at least, although it's long enough that it does drag in parts.


I still resent whenever the game shoves boobs, 'sexy wimmins' and other series-standard female objectification in my face without comment, of course. Nothing is perfect. I also think it's still a bit weird that CJ comes across as a pretty decent dude, perhaps the most 'good' in the series, trying to do what he can and make the best of a pretty bad situation, and yet the game still gives you the option to go on classic GTA rampages.

Maybe there's something to be said for the tension between open-world game structure and any semblance of a plot. Whatever the case may be, San Andreas doesn't gel perfectly. GTA IV suffered from this problem too, and both games - hell, pretty much the entire series - also suffer from a number of frustrating missions. Following a damn train was never so difficult.


The game world is obviously not as realistic as V's due to the technological constraints of 2004, which means that the game isn't trying to sell itself as a perfect graphical model of Real Life™ that's fatally flawed by crazy AI behavior. The game looks enough [i]like a game[/i] that it's not [i]quite[/i] as jarring when something insane happens on the street next to you. (San Andreas' modding support is at least better than V's, and I say this because I couldn't find anywhere else in the review to stick it.)


While I don't know if I'd call this one of the best games ever made, it was one of the best of the early 2000s, and still an influential classic. Find a way to play the original release if you're interested.",1362583317,1663525713,True,3,0,0.565796852111816406,1,True,False,False

It brings me back a lot of memories, used to played it on the original PS2. I was amazed with the story, the music and everything in this game. Well, there's nothing to say anything about the game, the thing is this game is great.

The only bad thing I noticed from this game is the update, some features/music were removed or changed due to the expired music license and has issues with modern PCs. The game sets in a slightly stretched 4:3 aspect ratio, and my mouse somehow didn't work at all from the start (although it works on main menu). Frames above 60fps pretty much breaks the physics, even though this is already a bug from the start lol. So I decided to download a downgrader, and downloaded the widescreen fix and frame limiter mod to frame cap the game to 60fps, and some other side mods I'd never use it for the rest of my gameplay. The process may seem slow, but it's worth doing it.

Is it worth spending $10 for this game? Absolutely. I highly recommend you to get this if you haven't played it before and you should downgrade it before you play it.

I'll give this a 9/10

PS: If Sam Houser could make the next GTA as fun as this one instead of making a $60 ATM, I'd be more than happy",1562585297,1663516831,True,16,0,0.675726711750030518,0,True,False,False

Land of the heinous, gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competin', even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast wit' the flag on the strap, that's OG!
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get supercut and big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats: Respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps
Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bus' a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas's full of gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones, dump 'em out
Bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with the shot gun

12120,12870069,76561198000742599,0,46,8181,39,3533,1708223249,"Frankly, GTA: San Andreas is the game which got me interested in the franchise. Extremely well-written, expansive, innovative and incredibly fun. CJ is one of the strongest characters Rockstar has ever developed, along with the rest of the character list. The voice acting is incredibly well-done, the music selection is (or was) second only to GTA: Vice City in my opinion. The variety of things you can do in this game is arguably second-to-none in the entire franchise, which helps Rockstar in its portrayal of a truly open world.

The graphical stylings, while outdated by today's standards, still please the eye and many parallels can be seen between this game's environment and that of Grand Theft Auto V's more recent version of Los Santos which I can't help but think about as I play this game. GTA V's environmental design would undoubtedly have suffered in my opinion had Rockstar not made GTA: SA previously.

Overall, I'd consider it a must-play for anyone interested in sandbox games, GTA as a franchise or... hell, historically notable games. This game is widely considered one of the best of all time, which makes sense, considering it was the best-selling PlayStation 2 game ever.

EDIT: This review update comes after the release of the Definitive Edition port, the Steam Deck and its certification.

I gotta say these days that while Rockstar to date hasn't seemed to change much in its anti-consumer nonsense (hopefully with an office shake-up this will have demonstrably changed with GTA VI), this version of the game keeps on keeping on. Many of the old issues still persist (missing music, physics engine tied to framerate causing frame limiter gameplay bugs, etc). The Steam Deck compatibility is pretty excellent with the exception of cheat entry (I'd advise looking into a mod which reintroduces controller-based cheat code entry) and possibly an audio bug with the Definitive Edition user mod on Linux with the latest version of Proton. But is it satisfying, more so than the mobile port, to play the best version of GTA: SA next to the launch PS2/Xbox version? Absolutely, and it's now portable-ish with the Steam Deck, I'd recommend giving it a shot. It's a welcome dose of nostalgia and time-wastery on watch.",1415583950,1662085286,True,0,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

The primary reason is that the Steam version of San Andreas simply sucks. It's missing music, it has many bugs, it runs like trash, etc. It's pretty much worse than the original 2005 version in a lot of ways, which means that if you want the best experience, you'll need to downgrade it and get a couple of mods to make it a very enjoyable experience. Personally, I don't mind modding my game, but I can imagine many people probably won't bother modding or even know about how bad this release is, which would make them go ahead and mod it. It's been 7 years since the last patch and they still sell this busted version on Steam without fixing it. Awful.

There's also Take Two being scumbags and shutting down various mod projects, but other reviews already talked about it at length, so i'll spare you the talk here. 

Simply put, don't buy it on Steam. I recommend you get a used copy somewhere. If you don't have a DVD drive or if you absolutely NEED it on Steam, then downgrade this bad release to the original 1.0 version and get the mods. Even then, I wouldn't recommend supporting Take Two financially, so be wary of that fact if you decide to buy it on Steam.

If you'd like to know more specifics about why the Steam version is terrible, I highly recommend this comparison video made by Vadim M: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XESrzw62rlQ",1632581660,1661843133,False,225,2,0.903368353843688965,17,True,False,False

    Welcome to San Andreas, I'm CJ from Grove Street.
    Land of the heinous, gangbangers, and cold heat.
    In Los Santos, neighbours get no sleep.
    Beefin' with anybody, competin' even police.
    Four deep in a green rag with gold feet,
    blast with the flag on the strap - that's OG.
    Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights.
    Get super cut, or big and buff - nice and straight.
    You got stats: respect, weapon skill,
    stamina, muscle, fat, and sex appeal.
    You get clothes from Bincos and Prolaps,
    Sub Urban, Zip, Victim, and D. Sach.
    Watch your back when in rival hoods;
    they'll test just to guess if your survival's good (survival's good).
    Ducking shells at the Cluckin' Bell,
    jump out bustin', gunnin' till they tuck their tail.
    It seem like I'm on impossible missions (impossible missions).
    Twisted predicaments, hostile positions (hostile positions).
    Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me.
    Cop cars been on our ass the last past week.
    Because the 'Dreas for the gangsters, homeboy.
    Hands is the language for the 'bangers, homeboy.
    And it's dangerous, homeboy.
    Get your brains blew for how you do your fingers homeboy.
    Heat cocked, we popping hot ones.
    Dump 'em out, bend the block, shaken before the cops come.
    Listen for sirens... they don't got none.
    Back another lap, catch a straggler with a shotgun.
    Hittin' 'em up what that Grove Street like,
    in a dirty sling shot, and old Levi.

Id say the multiplayer community is still quite healthy although its marginal compared to how many people used to play it. But I think this is one of those games that will have a cult following and wont die off for many more years like BF2 for example.

In short, it's a terrific unending masterpiece of a game -- and one that will never fall victim to an over-exaggeration of its lofty status.

First missions, Wrong side of the tracks, Zero missions, Freefall, Learn to fly, Dance missions, Lowrider missions, and many more i fergot cuz there so many are hard due to NPCS being fucking too powerfull or controlls sucking or in lowrider the controlls being fucked up and not possible if u dont change up to down and down to up.

Second police, Police is too fucking annoying and will ram into you, Mostly when ur in a tank, Causing them to blow up and gain nothing, The bike shits are the worst, They are fucking mosqitos or how u spell it, Fast, Annoying, and worst of all, Not just with the police, NPCS can. can.. can... pu- fuck this, THEY CAN PULL YOU OUT A VEHICLE AND SHOOT YOU WHILE YOUR DOWN TRYING TO GET BACK IN! EVEN IN A FUCKING TANK! WHY CANT CJ LOCK DOORS?!?!?!?! 

Third vehicles, They are just, Too slippery, Like if u go on grass they think its ice, For fucks sake grass doesnt equal to ice, For fucks sake rockstar why did u make the worst decisions, Most small vehicles like the go-kart thing or forklift or some shit is soo shit cuz they are slippery, On any surface for fucks sake.

Fourth gang members, Ther AI sucks ass, In a drive-by they only shoot when ur like right next to the guys or something idfk its random and probably takes 5 years for them to understand that they need to shoot, Reaction time sucks for them, also on foot, All they do is throw gang signs and die.

What else really needs to be said? I sincerely doubt there even is anyone who has at least not heard about this game, considering how often it is referenced and the memes it spawns even almost two decades after release. I have replayed it multiple times, owning a disc copy, and later re-bought digitally, and will likely re-play it again a couple times in the future.

Now, it is - objectively - by no means a perfect game - even during its time, the graphics were dated, and physics were rather simplistic, and unlike other GTA games, the plot had a bit of a good guys vs. bad guys vibe, which did not really make sense considering the setting and the characters. On the other hand, the open world was not only considerably larger than previous GTA games, it was also more varied in terms of locations, and was filled with content - both missions, main and side, and a variety of minigames, collectables, challenges and easter eggs. The sound direction is great, especially in regards to soundtrack and radio track selection - I still sometimes listen to the OST / radio tracks on youtube as they are really good mixes. Also, it really shows that you can make a large game, and not have it an almost unplayable bugfest (though there still were some, and not all of them got patched) at launch - yes, I'm looking at you, Bethesda.

SA is truly the definitive GTA game of the 3D era, it expanded greatly upon the content of previous games not only in regards to the mission/story content, but pretty much everything else - I would say one of the most important introductions was the (pretty extensive, all things considered) vehicle customization, which has since been considered a requirement to have in this type of open world games, and has led to criticism of games of this type that do not have it.

Anyways, if you've never played SA, I recommend to do so ASAP. There will be a lot of jank, the graphics will make your eyes bleed at times - especially if you mostly play recent AAA titles, but you'll find a lot of enjoyment and fun in the game nevertheless.",1659614961,1659614961,True,3,0,0.34071001410484314,0,True,False,False

Set in either 1999 or 2013 in Anywhere City USA, you take control of Claude Speed, who works for different gangs around Anywhere city, across 3 districts, like the Russian Mafia, Rednecks, Yakuza, etc. The game has a ""respect meter"" where if the meter goes down, you can't do missions for that gang, so you gotta for example, kill their rivals to gain respect from them, then do the same to other gangs when you wanna do jobs for them, kill their rivals.

If you're coming from later GTA's like IV, SA and V, this will obviously be different, and despite the game having aged somewhat badly, like the controls and camera, as well as navigation, the game can still be a blast if you look past that.

So, naturally I wanted to play it again so I bought it on Steam and....

• I needed to relaunch the game 3 times to make it run cause it was stuck on a black screen and I got the same problem again
• The game was stretched as hell in 16/9 i couldn't find how to fix that (the large screen mode didn't fix it, it just did ""less"" stretches but it didn't remove them)
And other things that made me refund it to buy Vice City instead

Why ? Rockstar why ? The game was perfectly good on the CD version why didn't you just ported the game as it was on Steam ? Why breaking the game before putting it on Steam ?

But anyway, i Googled the problems and i needed to install mods to DOWNGRADE the game
I need to DOWNGRADE a game because the actual developers of the game literally broke the game 

I know it's because they had to remove some things like some tracks that got its licenses expired but they had NO reason to remove some features and breaking the game like that

What is the point of deleting the animations of the cars ? And the adaptive dirt on the cars ? The lens flares that makes the game cooler ? The reflections when it's raining in night ? and all the things that makes the game more interesting ?

I tried to downgrade it but it didn't work and I didn't want to mess up more with the game files

You can buy it if you really want to play it, there's a solution, there's a lot of people here in the reviews saying that the game is good etc because they fixed it, but i don't want to invest time on it cause I'm not supposed to

The game is a classic, it's fun and all that but the Steam version just clears all the fun from it.

Unless you want it to work and spent maybe 1/2 hours fixing it, then you're good, it's under $10, for Gta San Andreas, it's worth it.

Edit: My friend and I are sharing our Steam games and I saw GTA SA again, but this time, I fixed it. And it's super good now. I still don't recommend the game to buy as it is but if you're willing to do some fixes it's good. Also, the Definitive Trilogy edition is coming soon so, check it out !

A friend showed me this guide and is pretty useful 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=922313527

Edit again : 

Alright, so the remaster is 1 garbage and 2 is not coming to Steam anytime soon

I'm lucky for actually buying the game before its removal because I'm definitely not using Rockstar launcher, because it's poorly managed (see the Gta Definitive Launch on RGS), and even if it was good, just the fact that they're making those removal decisions to force you to buy their new outsourced money milker and that they're not even selling the legacy games AT LEAST still on their launcher is keeping me away from it.

Unrelated to Gta: San Andreas but it's still in the topic :

Also I love the fact that they told everyone that they're gonna put the legacy games back but with some conditions

• Only on RGS (Sure whatever)
• ONLY IF YOU BOUGHT GTA DEFINITIVE
• Between a certain date (If you missed the date you couldn't get the old games even tho you bought the demaster)

And of course that wasn't cause they love the community, they did that because people who bought the outsourced trilogy couldn't play the game. That was literally the least they could do

Also let's announce the ""Next entry in the GTA franchise"" RIIIIGHT after that in a random tweet instead of a badass announcement like they did with their classics to appease the poor investors, because that catastrophic launch is scaring them and we don't want Take two to loose them :((

I mean they could get some spare money suing random companies for having a similar name on a completely different media but that wouldn't be enough.",1599687793,1656723848,False,10,1,0.481910556554794312,0,True,False,False

From a 2004 you expect, a small map with some cars, shitty gameplay, poor storyline.
You get the opposite, a great story that you can play many-many times <3 <3, you can upgrade cars, u can buy over 30 house in 3 CITY!! there is life in the game there is a thing called (city variety) They made up real states in-game, Las Vegas-San Fierro-Los Santos. Each city have a unique style, in las vegas, you see casionos every 20 feet, where you can go into, and bet, roulette-blackjack-spinwheel or wtf is it. YOU CAN BET UP TO 1,000,000$! big house, like 40-70 level buildings-millitary base-airfield-canyon-desert,
San Fieroo, well, nothing special, it have a tram......Its not that special, there is a mod garage and a showroom.
Los Santos, ""where gangbangers and cold feet"" you get stats, weapon skills-stamina-muscles-sex appeal""
3 Gang, you can do bmx tricks on the field, Gang fights.

I think R* (Rockstar) Was the only company back then who are pushed out THE MAXIMUM, they pushed every single possibility back then what can be done!! Over 250+cars, 3 city, character customization, Real time shading, Car reflections, well ([""Physics""]) missions apart from Story, (submissions, I think GTA SA'll be the only game which had many cheat, taht we still remember today, it had a simplistic design, thtey rather went to the gameplay instead of just to the particles or any other useless things. I even have this game for USB in case i lose my account or my pc get attacked by a virus. I have a physical copy. I never gonna give it to anyone. I cannot even write down how great this game is. 
in some people eye its just a ""game"" but in my eye a forever masterpiece, which never gonna die. I went through all mission at elast 9 times, Im never get bored by this game, I remember every single one by its name.... Although, R* is a lazy a** nowaday, they did great sales back then, after the GTA TRILOGY UPDATE
I want to meet them to kick them in the face!!!!
yes R* u f***ed up your own succes, you f***ed up the models, caharacters. Every character lost their auqentic! Their appearance, is completly lost due to your mistake, You should add these to GTA 6 instead, I lost my faith in you. Im 100% sure, that if you releasing a GTA remaster again, im gonna hire a helicopter, drop down 70 C4 onto ur HR then blow the f**k out u, coz u are not normal, u area just going for the profit at these years. Ur GTA 3 was a big succes on the PS consoles, you was #1 After GTA 5 u been sleeping or what? u ggave us a horrifi release of our childhood :( then u went away, i really hope u working on GTA 6 
I really hope....Coz if you dont, expect a helicopter above ur HR, if i have to, i nuke the entire America.

Performance wise... it has issue especially on newer games it can be pretty janky to fiddle with the file because the settings in this game is not good to say the least. I couldn't even get this game to appear on OBS. I did hear there are some great mods to fix issue in this game especially with how rockstar never cared to future proof this game. It's also preferable you get the GTASA ver 1.0 but getting the raw copy is hard af. Worst part rockstar delisted this game for the remaster which is even worse. Either way which ever version you get the story still holds up like fine wine.

I want to point out a few things and its about the bugs that can break your save game.
1. The broken cheat: Theres a cheat in the game that makes peds more ""Violent"". After saving you just completely made a bug. this means that peds in script mission cutscenes and in game will break the game completely
2.Broken Gym:When you wanna become buff and go to the gym when you reach the limit you will soon realize that after you come back the game tells you that you have reached your limit. However if you want to avoid this stupid bug than just do not at all reach the limit. Luckily Silent fixed this bug with his patch.
3.Mad Dogg broken save: This bug happens when you save in Mad Doggs crib. you see there was a cool feature to play basketball. and Mad Dogg's crib had not only a save but also a basketball court. When you save the basketball in all areas disappear. The way to avoid this is to not save in the crib like in the ice cream factory in vc. Luckily silent fixed this bug as well. REASON: its because a save point is near a basketball so if you save I believe the game believes that you are playing basketball. But i could be wrong. Bonus: The pool game also features a bug where when you put a save pickup near the pool opponent Via mods it will also do the same thing.
4:Broken San Fierro Docks: When you are doing the import/export side missions you will realize that when you come back to the docks to bring a car on the list you real soon realize that the game will crash. unfortunately Silent was not able to fix this in his game patch.
5.Broken Territorys: one thing that Rockstar North featured is what we call ""THE ENDLESS MAP"" where if you take a plane and fly out of the city you were gonna keep going and going. but a bug happens where if you fly out to far for what some reasons various gangs spawn in areas like Ballas spawning in Las Venturas for example.",1656471300,1656471300,True,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

I played this game for 8 years, first started when I was 9 years old. I had a lot of fun with modding and just running around with rocket launcher and also played a lot of SAMP. After 6 years of playing I discovered that I had pirated copy, because it had no missions. I bought licensed copy and passed game twice.

And then I bought steam version... I was disappointed, I couldn't play SAMP anymore and all my favorite songs disappeared. I thought, maybe it's an error on my side, but after I googled it I found out it's not...

I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE. But... Find a way to install original version of this game. Don't just play steam version, it lacks content.

Just play it to enjoy it. If you want a 100% run that is not as challenging and can be fun, play Vice City.



Whenever I talked about Grand Theft Auto to any of my friends, they would always pull a few quotes from San Andreas. I never fully understood them until I played it myself. This game has a great story, and I was invested the entire way. There are some notes that should be made before people play the game. First, the game resolution has to be at a minimum level, because a high resolution will cause the game to crash. Next, lowrider controls have the up and down arrow keys switched, so don't get frustrated. Aircraft controls are janky, so be patient.
I recommend this game highly because it is a classic. After playing it, I feel encouraged to play GTA III and give it another chance due to Catalina's appearance in this story.",1608744323,1654696430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my sincere opinion, its simply the best GTA game, the ammount and features it has is bigger than any other GTA, while it doesn't have the best story or graphics by today's standards, its the most iconic game of the series and the one that left the biggest impact, they managed to make the gameplay deep here and even more satisfying than 3/VC, there are many more side stuff to keep you occupied when you want to take a break from the missions, the soundtrack is great and the characters are just iconic, thanks to the great work of tons of famous voice actors present here such as the muthafreaking sam jackson, its a hell of a classic, the game gets even better when you consider its modding scene, theres even a multiplayer mod if you want to go further, you will see how much better it is than what the grindfest pay-to-have-fun GTA Online has become, this is a must-have game to any PC owner, a great classic.",1528997036,1654559512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

although id be lying if i didn't say i wasn't a little interested in the new versions

update 5/29/2022

i am no longer interested in buying this new version of GTA SAN ANDREAS DE, it is NOT definitive, it censored a small amount of content, removed the atmosphere of the original game, broke character rigging, broke a good amount of the physics and removed songs that made the original great.

the deceptively named definitive edition now forcibly replaces the original PC port unless you were fortunate enough to have bought the steam version of the game here before the cutoff date. it is buggy and is not a worth while replacement to the PC originals that were here prior to this inferior slapped together port.",1645607390,1653877616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I suggest looking this up: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720460154]Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – Definitive Edition[/url], it's a package of bug fixes and some other cool stuff that will enhance your experience.

Rockstar/Take 2 have made it not available to buy this game, alongside with Vice City and III with the release of GTA Trilogy: Definitive Edition. It's not a cool move and I don't support it, however, what's even worse is that neither the original games, nor the remastered Trilogy is available to buy on Steam as of now, so in order to legally get the game, you have to buy it from their launcher. It's not okay that they don't allow you to buy any of these games on Steam anymore, since they have been available to buy for years.

work as a valet for 4 hours, go to the gym, get fat from too much fast food, manage your relationships, spread gang territory, cover up grafitti, do vigilante police work, train your lung capacity, we won't let you continue with the story until you train your lung capacity. a lot of this stuff does not work at all, the driving school is an absolute nightmare, but no other game does what san andreas does in that regard

There are some technical issues when playing this on a newer and more powerful pc. The fix to this without modding the game is to go to the folder where the exe is located and go to properties and set the compatibility to Windows XP and change the settings to have the frame limiter on (26fps) and there you go, you can play GTA: SA!

Like Vice City before, San Andreas perfectly encapsulates a certain Zeitgeist, this time of early 90s California, and combines it with an even bigger open-world. San Andreas is a whole state, at least four to five times bigger than Vice City, and accordingly has a lot more stuff to do and even more diverse locations to see.

Here you follow Carl „CJ“ Johnson, who comes back to his hometown Los Santos (probably the most accurate and lively depiction of Los Angeles in a videogame until the release of GTA V), after some years of abscence to find his mother murdered and his remaining family and friends deeply involved in gang wars, drug dealing and sinister machinations of corupt police officers. The story and setting are full of gangsta-yadda-yadda and ghetto clichés, so just like with Vice City, it kinda depends on your taste if you can immerse yourself into the setting and relate to the exaggerated and satirical characters. The music and voice-actors on the other hand are beyond any doubt once again. This time we got actors like Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Peter Fonda and Ice-T, in combination with the music of artists like Rage against the Machine, Soundgarden, 2Pac, Cypress Hill, James Brown, Rick James, Joe Cocker, Kiss, Rod Stewart, The Who, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ozzy Osbourne, Faith no More, Depeche Mode and Jane’s Addiction, and it doesn’t stop there. For movie- and music nerds, San Andreas is heaven and it has the best cast and soundtrack in the series to date.

As was the case with Vice City, San Andreas basically sticks to the basic principles and core mechanics of GTA 3 and just adds a sh*t-ton of content in a once again greatly expanded world. Most notable added features are a greatly increased character customization system (hair- and beardstyles, clothes, tattoos, etc.) bigger arsenal of both weapons and vehicles, and even slight RPG elements: The more your character runs, swims, excercises, drives cars or uses certain weapon types, the more efficient he becomes with those things. On the other hand, if he eats too much, he gets fat and looses stamina. Furthermore there are some limited romance options for certain characters and a „turf war“ system, where you can attack and conquer the „hoods“ of rival gangs, to generate extra money. Overall, where Vice City already had a lot to offer, but was still somewhat straightforward and manageable in terms of side content, San Andreas gets lost a little and i found much of its side content a little bit overwhelming or downright unecessary at times. I think i still haven’t seen or tried everything the game has to offer until this day. 

In contrast to the amount of content, the grafics only got a slight update when compared to Vice City. The textures are slightly sharper, there are some improved lighting and weather effects and the whole world is a bit more detailed in general, but in the end the technical improvements where minimal. Nevertheless, given the sheer size of San Andreas, it is quite impressive that they could manage to improve the grafics at all, even if it was just to a very small degree.

GTA V is an amazing game, but being the nostalgic old man that I am, Vice City and San Andreas remain my favorite GTA games. Literally the only things in those two games that are rather dated are the grafics and, to some extend, slightly clumsy controls, but measured against the overall quality of the games, those flaws basically fade away. San Andreas in particular is, in my opinion, the best open-world-game ever with some of the funniest and most creative missions you'll ever have the joy to play and that makes it easily Top-50-games-of-all-time-material. 

So, finally regarding Rockstar pulling the originals from the Steam Shop in order to sell their useless and broken cash-in Remasters: See Link below.

I get into the game and come across so many issues I don't even know where to start. First of all I can't look around at all so I quit then went back in and then I could look around for about a minute or so before it stopped working. Then I couldn't click anything either and had to use the enter button instead along with my lack of ability to look around. So the mouse not working is a typical issue that happens and any fix I tried to use DOES NOT WORK. So that's not to mention that tree graphics go blocky and black to the point that it looks like the texture pack is totally bugged out. When I'm trying to move forward in a straight line when using WASD the character will veer left or right so far that I'm asking why because all I'm hitting is W. Now this was before I encountered the black screen where I couldn't exit out of the game or interact with it at all, nor could I minimize the game to exit out that way. So I had to force shut down my pc because the task manager wouldn't come up or work either.

The reason I dont recommend playing San Andreas with the steam version is because the patch that steam uses is broken. You will have to either cope with terrible,broken physics or 25 fps locked because of the frame limiter bugs. You are not able to mod the game in this version, so no SA-MP or MTA and no game customization at all. Besides all, these there are some minor changes that kind of ruin the game, such as vehicles are mudded all the time and many more. I would suggest you either emulate the game, or downgrade it if youre gonna buy it from Steam or Rockstar Launcher (since rockstar uses the steam patch ver.). There are a lot of downgraders for San Andreas and many tutorials on YouTube you can follow for an optimal San Andreas experience. If you downgrade to the 1.0 version of the game youre free to do whatever you want. Basically mod it to your liking, like putting a 60fps frame limiter with fixed physics, and if youre not into that, you can keep it vanilla since this version is alot better than the sub-optimal steam one by just itself.",1586560426,1650988752,False,3,0,0.526727497577667236,0,True,False,False

more on that mission later), it looks nice at very high settings, stable too... so far, but i did die (because of a bug) once when trying to save Sweet's girl... all i did was try to jump over a wall by the bridge at MainBase (which leads to instant death at full health, really weird mission) & driving is a bit nuts in the beginning as well as the reverse camera control (on the mouse).

however, beyond that cool story, really immersive and this looks like an inspiration for WatchDogs 2, i see now why people love it. so please bring this back for the love of mankind! 

This game could totally use an expansion and minor bug fixes as well as a rework on the graphics,

i finished almost everything like 94 or 96 tags, got all my girlfriends to 100% except Catalina (in less than 150 hours), she is weird. but i miss her, lol... finished the main story too.

 hehe, also thanks for not deleting it from my library... really not into that because .....it's the worst. fo real ...addictive game even in the first 10 hours, it did not disappoint... the biggest issues were A.I. instantly gunning you down when you move into their line of sight and cars flipping over like crazy, but at the end of the game, those were no longer issues that bothered me at all. Only an issue for the first 100 hours, definitely enjoyed this game for all that it had to offer. 

I never did unlock that car-dealership though... by the garage CJ buys. but the guide says how to do it, as well as i thought there was an option to unlock more GirlFriends, i need to look that up too, the game is packed with stuff to do & it's not like older games, where things get boring, very cool... we also need a GIFT MAP, of all the gifts like flowers... and other things you can give to your girlfriends.",1637554515,1650814692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game so much. This was one of my first game in the series. However, I can't bring myself to recommend this version to anyone. Throughout my whole time playing the game, it just kept crashing every 5 minutes. Heck, I couldn't even get pass the loading screen and bam! Crashed. Not only that, there are also some issues with the widescreen implementation, some content being removed, and plenty more downgrades from the PS2/Xbox versions. 
 If you wanna play San Andreas, don't buy the steam version. 

If you still want to play this version, I'd recommend downgrading it and installing some mods to make it better. There are plenty of guides out there that you could follow to achieve this.

+ Immersion
This game wants to be explored. In Los Santos you want to go to the gym and get fit. You want to do home invasions to get money and infinite sprint. In Angel Pines you want to do the Ambulance missions, and you want to drive around on a motorcycle to improve your skills.
   In San Fierro you want to take pictures.
   In Las Venturas you want to collect horseshoes

+ Missions
In comparison to GTA III and Vice City this game build on the missions. They are more elaborate, more fun and have more things to do. The dialogue while going to a mission is great and truly make you feel like you are having a real team in San Andreas.

/Story
I feel mixed about the story. The game is a bit bipolar in the way that it tells several stories, and in many ways San Andreas is split into two games.
1. Los Santos/Grove Street. Here you are Tenpenny's bitch, you fight the Ballas, you wear green, you protect your brother and build up the hood. You're gangster and live in a poor Los Santos area hustling the neighbourhood. And then it just ends...

2. After 1/3 of the game you have reached San Andreas 2. You know do more of a Vice City style of game, you can't even go to the hood anymore or you'll be shot. You are no longer a member of Grove Street, deal with it.
   The missions become really fun, both in Angel Pines, later on in San Fierro. Then it gets ridiculous in the desert and Las Venturas in true GTA fashion. This is GTA at its finest.

Back to 1: the game don't know how to end itself and you're flung back to Los Santos to claim gang territory in the middle of a Riot (this is very tedious) and then kill the people threatening the hood. It's just that you feel so disconnected with the hood at this point that it just feels... off?

Silver lining: I save the Casino heist for last to go out with a bang. This feels like a better ending in my opinion.

+ Gameplay
Gameplay is amazingly fun, but there are so many times you need to learn something new
- learn how to breath underwater
- learn how to fly
- learn how to fly the Harrier
- learn how to sneak
- take over territories
etc. etc. etc...

I started, i was stuck in the Cesar Vialpando mission for the whole summer but that didn't stop me. Meanwhile i checked Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto Vice City and their DLCs on my PS2: Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories. In 2nd grade i received PS3 i was really happy about it,I completed my first GTA game on it: Grand Theft Auto V and after i completed it i returned to GTA SA to complete it for the 1st time.

It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X. The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows former gangster Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, who returns home following his mother's murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas).",1649007242,1649007242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a huge fan of the franchise, I beat the original San Andreas on PS2, the insanely buggy mobile port, the PS2 port on PS3, and on a lot of times on PC. There is so many things to praise about this game like the gameplay, the map, the side content, mission design (most of the time),... and a few things to point out that haven't aged the best (mostly the disjointed story),... but I don't feel like doing it as we all know how much of a classic this game is. It's such a shame that this PC port is garbage, and if Rockstar Games/Take 2 Interactive taking down mods and suing the creators wasn't enough, they removed this classic along with 3 and Vice City from all stores to promote their atrocious remaster.

I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like ""Nah, i wont like it."". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.
Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to ""win"" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.
So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it's rare that a game actually keeps my attention.

Story: You play as a man named CJ whose mother has recently passed away. He comes back home to realize that his family/gang isn't in good condition with the Ballas, the enemy gang. So you help restore Grove Street back to it's former glory.

Children/parents: This game consists of curse words such as ""F***"" and the N - word. This game makes a lot of references to sexual content. I recommend only adults or mature teenagers play. 

Graphics: Not too good. This game is over 10 years old so don't expect RTX graphics.

Rockstars recently delisted the original trilogy from the steam store and want people to by the (terrible re-mastered versions) Don't buy the re-mastered versions, they are ****.


Original review: Jul 3, 2019

First time I played Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was on an IMac and it had the same features from the PS2, but with this version on steam it is altered very differently for example: When the game startups it does not show the opening video or music which sucks and also the graphics are not what it originally looks like but, I was able to downgrade the game to what the PS2 looked liked. 

I recommend if you want to play GTA SA with the original way then just downgrade it. (Videos on YouTube)",1562214201,1646973530,True,1,0,0.518652260303497314,0,True,False,False

Pretty sure its the first game I modded too.

A really big step forward in the GTA franchise, very innovative, you could do anything in true GTA fashion. Colours mattered, lifestyle mattered, all in a game made for a console some feared could guide a missile... the PS2 dun dun duuuuunnnnn. 
Sadly this is all pulled back in GTAIV+. A lot more linear in freeroam. Take-Two can do one.",1646955143,1646955143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Land of the heinous, gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competin', even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast wit' the flag on the strap, that's OG!
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get supercut and big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats: Respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps
Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bus' a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas's full of gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones, dump 'em out
Bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with the shot gun

I started playing this game in 2010 and I played it very often in all this time, especially during 2013 - 2019, when I've got into SA-MP. In terms of statistics, it's worth to say that I finished the story of this game about 30-40 times and I should have over 15,000 hours played by now if I had had this game on Steam from beginning. Even if I spent about 2 years of my life into this game, I don't regret all that time as I befriended a lot of persons and I remained with a lot of good memories.

In terms of gameplay, even after all these years, the game is still fully enjoyable and always feels nostalgic. This title was the best advancement of Rockstar Games back in 2004 and introduced a lot of new systems and mechanics, some of them aren't even present in the newer GTAs such as the ability to change the body shape of the main character. The community of GTA: San Andreas has decreased over time, but it's still active, thanks to SA-MP (even if it's an unoficially modification of the game). However, this particular version of the game (the Steam version) isn't that well made as it contains a lot of bugs I've never met before in the other versions of the game I've played. Since the launch of GTA Trilogy: The Definitive Edition, this version of the game is not longer available on Steam anyway so I don't think there should be anymore reasons to criticise it due bugs.

In conclusion, this game will always be one of my favorite games of all the time so if someone hasn't played it yet, I highly recommend: Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - the GTA with one of the best stories of all the time and the most nostalgic radio stations.",1644079240,1644079240,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In the missions the main character is a thug that has little regard for anyone but friends and family. He murders cops and fbi agents in the hundreds without any problems. He can shoot down helicopters and bust fbi raids like nothing. But once in story mode Carl suddenly becomes a frightened bullied child who's pushed around like a moron and is unable to touch or even speak up against a single person that is oppressing him. It's surreal borderline retarded plot. Carl apparently can't even think of harming or attempting to fight back until his oppressors literally attempts to murder him. Then it's ok to fight.

The missions and the plot also get more and more deranged as the game goes along. As if some random blackmail would make the main character commit to serial murders and escalating violence rather then just face the blackmailing/blackmailers instead. Attacking military targets with stolen military equipment. One man facing the actual army, is in Carls eyes more preferable to attempting to attack some random blackmailers. The blackmail stunt goes on far too long.

The story also goes beyond fiction and some crackpot drug dealer suddenly orders him around attacking military bases. Just thinking about the plot in GTA san andreas is giving me a headache. There's zero decisions involved nor is there any kind of choice in the story missions from you as the player.

Most of the missions themselves are also made in the most over the top and annoying way.  
They can end instantly with some obscure bulls*it like loosing a trailer connection or running out of time. Constraints added mostly to annoy or increase difficulty instead of adding fun. Going to steal a car for your showroom? Of course there will lots of travel time to the target and then there will be fifteen henchmen guarding the car who's willing to sacrifice their lives to stop you, appearing just as you are about to leave. Why not arm them with bazookas and why not throw in some choppers as well, even better if you have someone to defend too. Failed? Oh well you just have to start all over again with the travel time and everything. 

Most of the missions I tried in this game was about as fun as pulling out teeth.
I'm convinced that the zero RC and plane school missions are made by psychopaths. 
No sane person would use controls that are that bad and unfriendly to players. 

The lack of fast travel is disgusting (the airport/train is nowhere near enough) and you often loose all your inventory again and again. Where is the finesse? Where are the quick taxis from earlier games? The game is actually devolving in some areas.

Like GTA3 and Vice City this game has a well developed city and good technological aspects but the script and missions are of disturbingly low quality.",1639833432,1643544785,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Back home in Los Santos for his mother's funeral, he plunges back into gang life and throughout the storyline unites his family, showing the other clans that the Johnsons are to be reckoned with.

He is hindered and aided in his goal by a myriad of characters: friends, enemies, idiots, etc. Not all of the characters are well written out, but there are no questions about the voice acting. Whether it's the corrupt cop Tenpenny or the awesome bitch Catalina, you won't feel the slightest bit fake.

The available territory is steeply spread out. In the fictional state of San Andreas fit California with copies of its two famous cities (Los Angeles and San Francisco) and a piece of Nevada, where a clone of Las Vegas has settled freely.

And at first, the plethora of things to do in this world is eye-opening. At first we learn that CJ has acquired personal data, learned how to lose weight and get fat, build muscle and even ... eat. True, the excitement fades slightly when it turns out that all the novelties, unusual for GTA - just children's toys, the appearance of real life (to the toilet, fortunately, do not go). In the spirit of The Sims. Of course, lovers of sitting in a snack bar over time will turn into a walking donuts, and adherents of bodybuilding increase endurance (it allows you to run / swim longer in the ""super sprint"" mode) and happy to defile the streets without outerwear, but die of hunger here can not, and drive and shoot fighters and overweight the same way.

In addition to the purely natural needs, our doppelganger has acquired Barbie doll tendencies. Players who are tired of looking at the same shirt can do grooming Carl - dress him up, cut his hair and put tattoos on almost all parts of his body (car tuning is not as detailed - a bunch of ""dodgers"", a modest selection). And in each city - a new assortment. It is frightening to imagine what would have happened if they had made a woman the main protagonist of SA...

The numerical characteristics of the game once again jumped, reaching the marks ""40+"" (types of weapons) and ""200+"" (cars, planes, boats, bikes and motorcycles with ATVs). The found dildo is a lot of fun to beat up townspeople, using it instead of a bat, and the harvester is not bad for bloody reaping. The physics of the car has changed slightly, as well as the damage model. But actually, not many people resented it before, either. But the ancient trick with cars disappearing behind could have been fixed.

The graphics in San Andreas are a hymn to juicing. Especially when you consider how old the Renderware engine is and how many games haven't used even half of its power. Correct shadows, which became a must-have attribute everywhere, have only now reached GTA. By the way, here they are not nailed down, but move according to the sun and other light sources.

And honestly was quite happy to be on good terms with Woozy and Truth til the end cause if I had to kill the only truly likeable characters I would've been pretty annoyed.

I love these games, especially GTA:SA and even though they're 20 years old they still work on modern hardware, with a few tweaks. That being said, I cannot justify recommending the new editions to anyone as they were very clearly rushed, and relying on Rockstar to patch a game after you have already paid for it is rolling the dice. 

It is very unfortunate that we live in a time with the best technology, and the greediest game developers. Eventually the consumer will realize they don't need to impulsively buy everything even if it is bad, but until then we are here waiting for devs to actually care about putting out a quality game, not just a remake made by interns. 

If Rockstar had done a legit remake/remaster, buying the Definitive Edition would be a ""no brainer"", but as it is right now, I believe you should pirate the older version of the games and then patch them over buying the new versions.

They named the re release of these games the definitive edition, which I find underwhelming. They missed out the opportunity to name the re remaster the Limited Edition, as in, that is the only fucking way you can get the games any more without pirating them.

Asides from that, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is one of the best video games of all time, including so many features, vehicles, and elements that other games of this era couldn't even come close to being this inclusive. It still holds up and is very playable if you are willing to deal with a lot of issues, one of them being not having the option to give rockstar your money anymore to play their game. lmao.

The first thing players will notice is that the mouse straight up doesn't work when you load your save file. You have to open up task manager, finger your butt hole, and switch back to the game like Indiana Jones with the sandbag in raiders of the lost ark just to get the game to work. And trust me, this does not work the first try. You will open task manager 5 times before you coax your game into working properly. 
Then you will get through about 14 hours of game play and hit a group of missions that have a lot more ridiculous issues that require other juvenile fixes to overcome. 
When you reach the amphibious assault mission, you will not be able to play it because you won't have the lung capacity skill built up enough to do the mission, unless you've been swimming underwater like an asshole for some reason. Which is exactly what you have to do for about 15 minutes before you have enough skill built up for you to be able to start the mission. 
But there is one problem; the swimming doesn't work. It just doesn't work. So you go on google, type in gta san andreas cant swim and what do you know, you have to turn the frame limiter on in order for the game to work, because if you have a half way decent computer to play on, you are playing at way higher frames than the game was ever intended to play on when the game was developed a nearly a whole 2 decades ago.
So now you are playing at 26 fps which is worse than accidentally drinking orange juice for breakfast after brushing your teeth, then you finish the mission and go on to do the driving school mission.
oh boy.
Mission 1, complete 1 donut in a vehicle. It just, it won't do it. I can hold w and s and do a burnout all day long but trying to get another key on my keyboard to activate just wont happen for whatever reason. I don't know if this is an issue with my keyboard or a general issue with many types of keyboards that possibly limit how many keys can be depressed at one second, but all I know is issues like rockstar not letting fans buy their game any more makes me big time depressed

Basically, this game is awesome and requires you to do some research sometimes to overcome small issues with the game being 17 years old this is to be expected and low key kind of nostalgic because I feel like that is the sort of stuff you had to do with old games of this era because not everything was made super easy and super clear overall great game, i would recommend u buy it but u cant lmao have a great day",1641541907,1641541907,True,31,3,0.722864091396331787,1,True,False,False

Land of the heinous, gangbangers, and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing, even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast with the flag on the strap, that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get super cut or big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats, respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat, and sex appeal
You get clothes from Bincos and Pro Laps
Sub Urban, ZIP, Victim, and D. Sachs
Watch your back when you in rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survivals good (Survivals good)
Ducking shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out busting, gunning 'til they tuck their tail
It seem like I'm on impossible missions (Impossible missions)
Twisted predicaments hostile positions (Hostile positions)
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
'Cause the 'Dreas for the gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the 'bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains blow for how you do your fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones
Dump them out, bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with a shotgun
Hittin' them up what that Grove Street like
In a dirty sling shot and old Levi's

It's shocking they're making an *actual* remasters this time around instead of hastily porting over the mobile version(s) and calling it a day like they did for the PS3, Xbox 360 and their future consoles, but why couldn't they have kept the original GTA III/VC/SA games up on digital stores for the sake of nostalgia and preference for the original?

At least Bethesda kept the original version of Skyrim up when they released the special edition, albeit hidden from the store page and only accessible via link but it's *still* there.

One notable downside of the Steam version is that some songs were removed due to R* not wanting to renew their music licenses from record companies, and yes I firmly believe it's them being cheapskates because let's be real here, just how much have they made selling Sharkcards on GTA Online? That's what I thought.

If anyone still has GTA III/VC/SA installed in their Steam library, back that sh!t up on an external drive bucko. You'd especially wanna do this if you want to install that fix bugs/improve what Rockstar were too lazy to do themselves back when this was first ported over.

Good game(s) but damn, it really feels like Rockstar *wants* us to hate them.

It's an awesome game with amazing graphics in the days it was created. For a game released in 2004 it looks great and has a really good story. I think the remaster of this game recently was a huge mistake on Rockstars side for corporate greed but nevertheless they are a wonderful company making great games.

You just have to try it for yourself, trust me. you won't regret buying this game and playing it how it's meant to be played or just having fun with mods or vanilla. Although this game has a lot of pros it also has some cons, because the game is almost 20 years old, and the Steam version is bad I would recommend you downgrading the version to 1.0 and installing some fixes like Widescreen Fix by ThirteenAG, SilentPatch by Silent, and GInput if you want to play on a controller (which I recommend. It will be useful in some missions), also the required thing to install, so that the mods above can actually work is Ultimate ASI Loader by ThirteenAG.

My only problem with this particular release is that Rockstar have done nothing to modernise the game and simply re-released the PC port from over 10 years ago. Make sure you lock the frame-rate, and take time out to properly bind controls as this game was a pre-XInput release. Mouse controls are a bit janky as there's no lock-on mechanism and the mouse seems to have 'steps' when aiming making it much harder than the controller. A few more options to prevent the model and texture pop-in would have been nice too.

Edit: Hoo boy, be careful what you wish for....",1485101338,1640211449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game blatantly rips off of Fallout: New Vegas. Characters throughout this franchise are blatant rip offs of Fallout NV's. Every hooker is just a prostitute from NV, every gangster is a ripoff of the legion, every cop is NCR. Not only that but they ripped off the M4, the shotguns, and the pistols. This game also blatantly rips the melee combat system in NV making this one of my least favorite titles out there. This game had the potentially to be something big, but found itself buried deep in my psyche as one of the worst rip offs of all time.

I didn't buy into the hype of the ""definitive"" trilogy, I figured it would be the same game with a basic ENB mod. I was wrong, it was SO much worse. I could have told you that if I knew beforehand that the devs they hired were the same ones who screwed up the PS3 port. Definitive looks awful, it looks like the simpsons hit and run. Seriously. Not even just that, but it isn't even sold on Steam because Rockstar is greedy and needs their extra couple percent. Jokes on them, because if it ain't on steam, I don't get it, and I know I'm not the only one. Regardless, Rockstar is obligated at this point to relist the old games. But they won't. Why? Because now the only way to get them is to buy their shitty ""remaster"" through their disgusting launcher and get them as a ""bonus,"" which they're only doing because it got a 0.5/100 on metacritic and they need to save face. Rockstar has no problem erasing classics, and they're suing modders for making their seventeen year old game look better than they could ever dream of.

[b]2 Cents[/b] 

Who hasn't played this game yet? I don't know a soul who has owned a computer in the 2000's and not had AT LEAST one play through of GTA San Andreas. This was our introduction to PC Gaming and is still one of the most memorable games I've played so far. 


Even though the game came out in 2004, I still believe that it holds up against today's AAA games in terms of sheer content, gameplay value and mapping. It features three huge cities along with stretches of countryside - and I still remember driving from Los Santos to San Fierro listening to 50s country melodies on K Rose.

While the story may not seem have much of a direction, it is CJ's journey and the gameplay value it provides is incredible. The mission variety can go from protecting your hood from rival gangs and working for secret government agencies. And it doesn't hurt that there is a lot of side content you can do as well - ranging from driving a taxi to conquering neighborhoods for the Grove. 

If you are not really bothered by graphics (which can be enhanced using mods) and haven't finished through even one play through of this era defining masterpiece - drop whatever you are playing and do this first.

Best thing he could've ever done. 
Since my father didn't want me to play violent video games I always had to be careful. 
at the time I didn't care about the violent and crime aspects of the game at all. I spent thousands of hours just driving around, enjoying the open world & modding the game with new cars. 

Later in the 2010s I began hosting a private MTA server with my bro [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198396581059]LSB[/url]. We had crazy amounts of fun with it throughout the years with tons of server plugins, car mods, handling editors, ect. 
The edited video footage I uploaded to YouTube at the time covers 700 hours of private server playtime alone. 
We had tons of fun, it's incredible. 

Now I 2021 after Rockstar decided to delist this game for their 'amazing' ""definitive edition"" I decided to reexperience this gem with all the classic features the 1.0 downgraded version offers.
I gotta Say, it's still great and tons of fun. really sad they decided to take it down but hey, at least I have it... :/

It has great likeable characters, an influential set of antagonists, some of whom are unexpected, an interesting story which is not trying to be the most realistic but iconic, some of the most memorable lines of dialogue of the entire GTA series and a decent soundtrack.

You play as Carl Johnson, a young black adult, who is forced to return to a life of gangs, drive-bys and corrupt cops in the city of Los Santos after his mother is accidentally killed in a drive-by shooting by a rival gang, originally meant for his older brother, Sweet. The story takes the protagonist on an expansive tale of adventure, alliances, betrayals, revenge, and poetic justice across cities, the countryside, deserts among other farthest reaches of the state of San Andreas.

The controls, considering how old this game is, seems pretty archaic at times. However, it is not a herculean job to adapt to the control scheme. Besides that, this game has a lot to do, and would probably take you hours to explore anything. Among the most touted features of the game are the ability to customise how the player looks in general and how the world interacts with him by eating, exercising at the gym, trying on different clothing, footwear and accessories and not to mention, haircuit. Further, the game lets you traverse the map on road, water, and in air. The vehicle selection in this game in gianarmous, including utility vehicles with functional add-ons.

Review section: in the game you play as CJ, the first black protaganist in a GTA game. The game takes place in I believe the late 80's early 90's era. So as a black protaganist there is a good chunk of racism that you may encounter for that time period, which is relistic. You also got to deal with gang wars, which are pretty fun to trigger to get teritories, and there are also betrayel that happens and some shady business with cops.

The game is fun, but it has it's own flaws (such as making a shitty remaster). If you would ask me, This is still worth your money. With modding, you can downgrade your game to the first release version (which is V 1.0). I can't put a link on how to downgrade the steam version, but it's pretty easy to search it off from Youtube.

That being said, I'm not buying that dumpster fire that is the Defective Edition, more so because Rockstar decided to delist the original trilogy from Steam and other digital stores in hopes of selling more of that steaming pile of trash.

The only thing they accomplished by doing this, is to further tarnish their reputation, and forcing people who'd like to play the original games to buy keys from resellers or better yet to pirate them. GG Rockstar!

Ao mesmo tempo que tem missões e histórias fodas, o fato de você ter que colocar mods de gráficos para deixar ele do jeito que sempre deveria ter sido, eu acho ultrajante para m jogo desse porte, vinda da época que a Rockstar não fazia tanta merda á respeito do lançava.
 Zerei o jogo 100%, foi uma ótima experiência no quesito de divertimento, consegui realmente fazer uma coisa que (acho eu) poucos tem coragem de fazer. Essa jornada foi foda, amo e amarei esse jogo sempre, graças á tudo que ele me proporcionou quando criança. E sim, digo isso pela nostalgia, mas admito que o porte da versão 1.0 para a versão 3.0 da steam é simplesmente porco, sendo obrigado a fazer downgrade para a 1.0, pois causa problemas técnicos de limitação de frames e também visuais pelos gráficos não terem sido bem-tratados de um porte á outro.
 Após tudo isso que passei jogando, admito que zeraria de novo, mas com mais moderação, porque 100% é muito puxado e demanda tempo. Se forem jogar, vejam o vídeo do FILIPE RAMOS de 5 anos atrás sobre os mods que ele coloca no gta san andreas, e só assim você terá uma boa experiência.

The original is much better than the shit ""remasters"" buy a copy off ebay or amazon and upscale it on an emulator like pcsx2. Or if you still have the original copy, mod the hell out of it, trust me, we all can make the game look better than rockstar could ever dream of. I also recommend doing that before they nuke whatever mods are still out there for the 3-d era GTA games bc they've always been butthurt modders do a better job than all of their ""developers"" combined, hence them suing modders. If you managed to get the steam copy of the game before they took it down, I also recommend downgrading it back down to it's V1.0 state. That way mods are compatible and don't instantly crash your game on startup. Since the steam release was the worse before these ""remasters"" were a thing.

- HDMI Upscaler $ 5 (Aliexpress Special, 5 bucks .. works like a charm)
- Thrift store copy of the PS2 version $ 10 (Got mine at a small stand at ComicCon for 7 bucks)
- PS2 Slim in awesome shape with controller for $ 35

Surprice mothaf**ka, you just spent $ 50 on a better experience.
Buy a hot coffee with the remaining $ 10 at your local massage parlor.

So I strongly recommend purchasing either a PS2 or an original Xbox and buying the GTA trilogy for your system, because they're the original games. No missing songs, no altered gameplay, ect.

All in the sake for a quick cash grab with a cheap hd-modded and bug-filled crap.

GTA SA has the peak from the trilogy, having the enriched story and gameplay from when Rockstar worked even the tiniest detail within the limitations of the PS2.

GTA iV and V don't have as worked the secondary dynamics within the game's campaign. Whar use is a massive world hen there is nothing that makes the player want to play more leisurely exploring the world at their time rather than just dashing through a campaign to be able to do something.

I hate that now people won't be able to enjoy the classic incarnaition of this title. 
Rockstar has incited Piracy of this classic to anyone who reallly wants that real San Andreas experience.

Yes, I do. It's an iconic game which defines an era of gaming we'll never return to. It was daringly controversial and tackled an assortment of political and societal issues through comedy and satire while delivering a compelling story with engaging gameplay. It was one of Rockstar's greatest achievements before succumbing to greed.

Since they've removed your option to buy it, and their overpriced remake is a broken pile of garbage, I can only hope you defy all odds and find a way to enjoy it through this torrent of criticism. If you ever find a way to emulate the enjoyment many of us fondly recall, I suggest you seize it.",1637360925,1637361147,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

+ Simple yet detailed art style that aged really well
+ Diversity of radio stations
+ Huge map with lots of detail
+ Lots of side activities to undertake
+ Great amount of customization for both cars and your character
+ Iconic voice acting
+ Stats for just about anything
+ Orange glow from the PS2 returns thanks to mods
+ High replayability despite linear mission structure
+ Huge weapon arsenal; I didn't even find all of them on my first playthrough
+ Gang Warfare; it's a great way to up weapon stat but also illustrates they weren't joking about others having AK's
+ You can recruit Grove Street gang members to help you out
+ You can skip the stats grind by completing certain Sub-Missions
+ Improved controller controls; targeting enemies shows their health and switching is faster/more reliable

Cons:
- 30fps lock with issues that can occur when unlocking it
- Physics issues such as Cesar's car flipping way faster than it already would
- When alt tabbing the game can lock you on a black screen requiring you to use Task Manager (set to Always On Top) to close it
- CJ doesn't hide his gun when looking forward in a car which looks rather silly
- Missions that replace your weapon also reset the ammo count; doesn't always make sense since a lot of them share the same ammo
- The recruitable gang members don't do much unless ordered and CJ's audio seems to bug out at times causing him to constantly talk to them
- Opening Steam Overlay causes hitching
- Assets still don't show on the map
- No autosave; this should at least have been optional for the PC release since it's way more prone to crashing/locking
- Texture seams (right word?) of the environment glitch out at times
- Buying weapons is weirdly slow since you have to wait for a few seconds each time
- Needing to use mods to restore several features such as the orange glow and missing songs

Despite the clunkiness, tech issues and occasional frustration from these things I enjoyed Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas just as much, if not more, as when I first played it on the PS2. 
I strongly recommend you to find a key from a trustworthy source or to buy the original game on disc somewhere!

A RE-REVIEW for this nostalgic gem. I do loved it, but working this game to work properly and functional is very difficult. After a deep research of fixes and patches and it's directory, I manage to get the game working. GTA San Andreas has been a wonderful masterpiece.

You play as CJ, an exile Gangster who ran away from home, because his brother Brian got killed, now return home because his mother died. In addition, the story progress towards ""The Hood, Families and Betrayal"". It's GTA, so you know, kill people, steal cars, racing and many-many more to do.

As a I said, San Andreas has been a very nostalgic masterpiece in the old era of Open World Games. From it's world, story, characters and gameplay. World is very large to explore, story is very engaging, gameplay is fun, while missions, well, it has flaws, particularly the Flying Plane mission from both Zero and Mike Toreno.

As for flaws, the game mainly flaws towards it's technical issues. Because of the removal songs (FOR EXAMPLE: Killing in the Name by RATM), the game had an issues from Audio, crashes and many technical error. For example, without THE PATCH ABOVE, shooting cars until they exploded can cause a serious of annoying crashes. Switching radio because of the missing songs can crash as well. Also, if you TURN OFF FRAME LIMITER, the game instantly broken. So, you have to play the game in 26FPS (With PATCH ABOVE YOU CAN ONLY PLAY IT IN 30FPS).

What else is there? Ummm, oh yeah. There are tons of cool mods in the GTA Community that adjusted the game that could best suit your play style. In any case, the game is still enjoyable, but downgrading and fixing the damn game are a really serious pain in the A$$.

Recommended to Purchase it with the GTA TRILOGY BUNDLE.

I would say I did enjoy my time with this game, though I do think the game ​length and open world scale and aspect to be a little too big for my tastes.

The story's pretty good. I like the characters and how everything progresses. As for gameplay, I would say it's better then Grand Theft Auto 3 and mostly Vice City. Though car handling is pretty mediocre in my opinion. The Atmosphere is there, but kind of lackluster in some places. The missions are more unique and enjoyable, but they do go on a little too long.

As for this PC port it's pretty poor. Playing this game with a custom soundtrack is incompatible. Half the time it works, half the time it just crashes your game. My first two hours was with me wrestling with the game, wondering why it kept crashing a lot and seeing what was causing my game to crash constantly. Turns out that the custom soundtrack was causing the problem. The other thing that was causing my game to crash constantly is to have the framerate limiter off. I did eventually find a mod that fixes this problem plus made the game compatible to run/limit the game at 60fps instead of 25fps, but this doesn't resolved the many bugs and performance issues at this game has.

I guess you can call the PS2 version the best one out of the bunch of other ports, but playing this game at a native 1080p or 4k at 60fps or higher is something that most people craves more instead of 480p at 25fps on old and mostly Expensive Hardware.

[i]GTA San Andreas needs a proper remaster desperately, because the only thing that's holding this game back is it's technical issues.[/i]

[u][b]Overall[/b][/u]
A really good game to say the least, but plagued with technical issues. [u]I would recommend installing ""GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition"" to fix most of the issues, but does not fix everything about this port...[/u]

[u]I would recommend this game to anyone that are fans of the GTA series or Open World Genre.[/u]

NEW REVIEW NOVEMBER 11th, 2021 POST-ERADICATION: Ooooooh yea I was right! Rockstar really IS a scummy, money hungry, greedy company! They removed the OG GTA's off steam to force you to buy the newer, more expensive remasters on THEIR game store, but then when y'all bought it they removed YOUR ABILITY TO PLAY! HAH! ! So I guess that's rockstar sayin' ""Screw Y'all!"" to all y'all GTA SA modders out there. SMH. The only reason these things got so bad was cause y'all Rockstar fanbois put them on such a pedestal acting like their still good even though they have pulled more and more BS this last gen than they had the entirety of the PS2/Xbox and PS3/Xbox 360 eras combined!

the definitive edition isn't even available for purchase at the time of this review

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was a classic, something I personally grew up with playing, from the countless myths and supposed cheat codes that we thought existed that spurred from this game, to the abundant amount of modifications you could apply thanks to the community - most of which has been taken down at the threat of a lawsuit from Take-Two Interactive / Rockstar Games... it's an experience I wish wasn't taken down from the Steam store, because now anyone on here looking to play the originals can't, they have to settle for the vain hope that the definitive edition comes out in better condition then what we got for all of a day.

Not to mention not everyone will be able to RUN the definitive edition, the requirements are MUCH higher and so anyone who was able to play the originals or met the specifications for the original may very well not be able to run the remaster.

A real shame, but there's very little that can be done. We can only express our distaste in Rockstar Games' terrible choices here and hope they listen and restore this masterpiece of a game on the Steam store as a (CLASSIC) version like many other games have done that have been remastered.",1636855727,1636855727,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

If they released the ""Remastered"" on Steam, DON'T BUY IT! save your money and instead just mod the original version! trust me, you'll be saving a lot of money! or maybe buy it then give a negative review and then REFUND IT!

[update""]
The Devs (Take Two) actually sued the modders because they did a way better job than them and for FREE!

Fxck you rockstar! bring back the original gta games! wtf happened to you guys? you used to be great back in the day! wtf is this bs!
Why even remove the classic version? You want us to pay for something that we already bought, for a full price! why? because you added some ENB and HD graphics mod that we can easily add ourselves and way better! you don't even bother to fix the bugs, glitches and or add new features! that'll make the game more enjoyable! You just polished it a lil bit and added some few mods and tried to resell it to us for full price!

I'll give you guys a good definition of a ""REMASTERED""
Mafia: The Definitive Edition
Resident Evil 2: Remake

There are probably many more and I know that's like a whole remake but at least! you know the money is worth it! Why? because they actually put effort in remaking it! not just a quick way to capitalize on people's nostalgia and make money and screw them over! It's like your ripping off your best customers man, must've think we're stupid or something!

Stop removing classic games! Don't you have enough money already? bring back GTA IV! ffs been wanting to buy it for a long time!

The phone port of this game was hilariously bad and I heard the remastered version is based off that version so yikes on that one if thats the truth.

I'm glad those titles have a modding scene.

I beat the Xbox 360 port of this game several times when I was in high school, and I watched a friend of mine beat it for the first time on my PC last year. This game is legitimately a masterpiece (it is much better than GTA V, in my opinion)...everything from the characters, the music selection, the voice acting, the story, the lore, the environments, and everything in between is pretty close to perfect. Even if you've watched gameplay of this title on YouTube, you need to pick it up (full price, don't even wait for a sale) and play it for yourself. Even beyond the main story, it's just fun to play and explore the environment. I believe most people who own this game (and are old enough to remember) will have fond memories of playing this game at 3 in the morning hunting for bigfoot or some other myth on Mount Chilliad with foggy weather/rain on at night in the game after watching too much DarkMythHunter on YouTube.

I played this game once in internet cafe and now I play it again just because of my nostalgia 
In this game player play as a character named CJ or Carl Johnson who has many memorable moments and funny lines
Player can play many missions whenever or whatever they want because surprise surprise this is an open world game just like other games on it's franchise
The open world in this game is very impressive especially for a 2004 game, the world of this game filled 
with many details even though most of them are low rez but still pretty amazing 
The atmosphere in this game is just 90's classic

I had previously played GTA liberty city and GTA vice city on steam, again, no modding.

Sadly as I hit 90% ish the game got taken down from the steam store, so if you're reading this, you already own it, as those who do not have this cannot access the store page (or if they can they certainly cannot buy it).

For reference I played this using proton as my OS is arch linux. 1080 GPU - 16GB RAM, i7-7700K CPU, not that any of that should matter for a game this old.
I used X11 and not wayland, but experienced the lack of stability on both when starting out.

The gameplay itself doesn't tend to be **that** buggy. There are still some ingame glitches to exploit (biggest one being infinite time on the bike challenge in the docks of san fierro next to the import/export. Interestingly I couldn't trigger it on the BMX.

In terms of stability though this thing is hell.
Going through any cutscene (that includes exiting and entering homes, shops, watching the cutscenes in missions) can cause the game to crash. The game doesn't always know it's crashed (usually not) and this requires killing it manually.
When loading back up it often glitches on the loading screen, resolved through completely killing the game and steam.
Other times it knows it's crashing and exits itself.

This means when destroying my own vehicle in a race to restart it, boom, crash (and as other races were not saved, had to redo those as well).

Did the first part of the last mission, flipped my car on the second part, crash. No ability to save inbetween, had to restart last mission.

Got to certain points in the last mission, crash between parts, have to restart last mission.

The story line is brilliant, the character development enjoyable, the game play and missions well thought through.
It's just a shame the steam version is SO unstable, and the developer seems to have hated a lot on mods, so getting this working if they ever make it available again seems unlikely.

I hope upon hope that the next GTA version is not so buggy. These bugs were not experienced in LC or VC.",1634734999,1634734999,False,1,0,0.459546148777008057,0,True,False,False

The graphics look dated (But what did you expect from a game released in 2004).
Many MANY mods to alter the gameplay experience, from HD textures to completely new story line.
The Steam version is meh at best but there are 1.0 downgraders available all over the web so that isn't a big issue for me.
Gameplay and physics also start to show their age, but then again, nothing that mods can't fix.

Everywhere, artists were striving to connect with the primeval self, the unconscious mind, and the hidden imagery of the subconscious. In the midst of this fervor emerged a trend toward calmness, born partially from a growing interest among many artists in Eastern philosophies like Taoism and Zen Buddhism. One of the most profound movements to grow out of this time was a game named Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.  

This work embraces color, while placing equal power on line. It embraces simplicity while simultaneously communicating vastness, complexity and a sense of interwoven interdependence. 

This games furious energy envelops the viewer and seems to burst off the canvas. There is a shocking vitality to it, aggression that transfers emotion and fury into space. At a time when many game company's considered Abstraction to have played itself out, Rockstar injected a powerful new life force into the style.

I personally as a fan seriously pissed at this fact, Rockstar Games is THE game studio i grew up with and all of their games mean a hella lot to me and countless hours i spent in them shows how much i was supporting them across the years. 

The current versions of classic GTA's are about to be replaced with ""The Definitive Trilogy"" collection which will also be a RGL exclusive on pc. On paper it sounds fine except Rockstar delisted the games before we have even saw any gameplay, release date or even a sightliest screenshot of how this collection might look like, it is such a scummy move from their side it feels like they don't even care about their games anymore nor the fans.

Exhibit A: Shutting down mod projects.
Take-Two reportedly sent ""private investigators"" to modder's homes across the US, took down lots of different modding websites and those who refused were heavily harassed by the Take-Two's legal team. Even when the mod requires a genuine copy of the game like GTA V's FiveM or reVC (a reverse engineered source port of GTA VC on different platforms) still got shut down even when they were doing everything according the rules Take-Two submitted themselves back in 2017 modders backlash

Exhibit B: Rockstar and Take Two's milking of GTA Online
As 2021 coming to an end the third re-release of GTA V (A GAME THAT'S BEEN INITIALLY RELEASED BACK IN 2013 ON PS3 AND 360) is coming closer and closer each day. GTA online had such huge, widely dynamic potential at the beginning and it just failed at every turn. Numerous bugs and issues that's been there since day 1 are still intact(loading times, griefing, ludicrous jobs, server connection problems, constant grind) and there's no sign of them being fixed. Yet people still keep playing it and throwing their money on micro transactions that gives them advantage over other players and gives them an opportunity to skip the grind. This shitfest has been going on since the release and whatever sells makes Take-Two push their devs to produce as much content to this already bloated game even further. It's just sad that there aren't any alternatives to GTA Online not even a close example. GTA Online is worst by itself but it's the best at it's genre because not even a single game in the world could even come close to it. The re-release for the PS5 is another way for them to prolong 
the milking for that dirty revenue.

Conclusion:
Rockstar's games were always great too bad that their decisions on how to run things aren't. This delisting of classical game is another example on how Rockstar is going AWOL against their playerbase for no absolute reason. Now tbh pirating this games will give you more benefits and playing the game itself would definitely be one of them. It's a shame that they're shutting down mods, delisting old games as a sign that you should just go and waste your money on some virtual gta currency in their broken-ass online mode.

This Steam version of GTA San Andreas wasn't that good in the first place anyway, being literally unplayable without mods such as Silent Patch.
Farewell my most lovable game of all time, it is so sad to see that it ended up like this. P.S. i don't feel like i should support this company anymore, after all these years they turned to greediness and sold out to their garbage parent company.

The Steam version is plagued with many issues such as
- Lack of mod support, most mods will crash the game when loading a file or starting a new game.
- Save files from older version straight up not working (which was broken by an update to this exact version!)
- Removed music, no Michael Jackson or Running Down A Dream for you, but hey at least you keep David Bowie and Toto.
- Lack of Windows 10 support, SA will straight up crash sometimes because it feels like it and the lazy idiots at R* can't be bothered to update this to work on modern machines meaning you have to download fan fixes eg SilentPatch.
- Widescreen is broken on this version, the aspect ratio was broken with an update and thus breaks free aiming as you won't aim where you shoot (GTA3 and VC also suffer from this)
- 60FPS bugs HAVE STILL NOT BEEN FIXED. This is a 16 year old problem and it has never been fixed, this applies to any Rockstar game on PC pre- Max Payne 3,
- Multiple fixes brought from the 1.1 PC version are not present here for some reason, including the fix for dirty cars.
- The minigames are out of sync and inverted, meaning instead of pressing the left arrow key you need to press the right and not only that, you have to press it JUST BEFORE it goes in the circle.
- Sometimes the camera will not function at all, meaning you have to spam ESC (or whatever your pause key is) whilst rapidly moving your camera to fix it. This was sort of fixed on the RGL version but it introduced another issue of the camera going crazy.

Pros
- It's on Steam I guess
- Cloud saves (it's 2021 for christ's sake)

Seriously, if you do buy it install all the fixes and the 1.0/1.1 exes and the old radio, it's practically needed to make this thing run on modern systems with no problems.",1618900826,1633936500,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From what I can gather, each games are masterpeices for their time, however, right now:

- High Framerates break several systems of the game, including making it so you can't dive underwater, making a mission later into the game impossible.

- Lowrider and Dancing challenges are impossible UNLESS you rebind controls because they aren't properly bound by default.

- The map can often be too confusing to navigate without the waypoint system from the HD Games.

- Due to the lack of checkpoints in missions, or the system GTA IV gives you (allowing you to restart from the beginning the moment you fail), failing the missions becomes too annoying to be bothered with, as you'll have to either drive from one side of the town to start again, then back to get a second chance, OR, drive from one side of the map to start, then back to continue.

- A lot of mechanics feel outdated, like how you switch through weapons or switch clothes.

- As of now, from what I can gather, the game's best played when modded.

For these reasons, and MAYBE more since I genuinely can't be fucked to finish it, I would wait to see if the rumored remasters are going to happen. If they do, get that one, not this one. If they don't, get this one and find some mods you'd like.

Though, if you want some positives:

- The Gameplay is different from newer GTA games in a good and fun way.

- The map feels bigger (despite being factually smaller) and more lively than GTA5, due to having multiple cities, rather than just Los Santos and two small towns.

- The characters are honestly great, and I heard amazing things about it's story, and from what I've seen of it (a little over half, I believe), I think I can at least back up the first half of the game before leaving Los Santos for being really damn good.

- Lots of customization with CJ, from him being skinny to muscular to fat, with different tatoos with different hair styles, with different clothes, plenty of good with this game.",1633642155,1633642155,False,2,0,0.494505494832992554,0,True,False,False

Land of the heinous, gangbangers, and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing, even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast with the flag on the strap, that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get super cut or big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats, respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat, and sex appeal
You get clothes from Bincos and Pro Laps
Sub Urban, ZIP, Victim, and D. Sachs
Watch your back when you in rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survivals good (Survivals good)
Ducking shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out busting, gunning 'til they tuck their tail
It seem like I'm on impossible missions (Impossible missions)
Twisted predicaments hostile positions (Hostile positions)
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
'Cause the 'Dreas for the gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the 'bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains blow for how you do your fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones
Dump them out, bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with a shotgun
Hittin' them up what that Grove Street like

Downgrade *all* your games files to 1.0, yes, even the 1.0 exe (but we will not be using that version. - Use this to downgrade your game: https://gtaforums.com/topic/936600-iii-iv-various-gta-downgraders/ MAKE SURE TO CHOOSE GTA SA AND NOT ANY OTHER VERSION LMAO)

Then goto this github link and download this: https://github.com/MrNiceGuy420/GTA-SA-1.0-HOODLUM-No-CD-Fix-exe and then put it in your gta sa folder, and launch the game from that ONLY

Once you have done that, install:

Modloader (https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25377)
CLEO (https://cleo.li/)
Limit Adjuster (I personally choose http://fastman92.com/11-fastman92-limit-adjuster-4-3)
The ""Essentials"" Mod List (By the way, some of these will already be included. Such as a limit adjuster being in this pack, modloader, cleo, an ASI Loader, etc. So what I recommend you do is install:

(by the way, make a folder called 'Essentials' in your 'Modloader' directory and put these files from the below section inside of there.)

NoDEP
RunDLL32Fix
Framerate Vigilante (Allows you to play the game at 60fps and higher w/o any game engine problems)
Cleo+ (Extract cleo+ to your CLEO folder and not your modloader folder)
SilentPatch
Borderless Window (Now you can alt tab w/o crashing :D)
Widescreen Fix (Can now choose 1920x1080 resolutions, or higher.)
Widescreen Fix HOR+ Support (dunno what this does but guess its nice to have lmao)
Silents ASI Loader (handy in case cleo messes up, great to use anyway.)

Optional Stuff to download and possibly use:

Fastloader (this effectively immediately boots you into the 'new game' or 'continue game w/ save file of choice' (iirc), handy if you're seeing if your game will crash with a crap ton of mods installed.)

Mixsets (I honestly saw that this caused more problems for my GTA than it had caused good, however if you manually change settings in the game for your liking, it can be pretty good.)

Aww well, you can install Multi Theft Auto, or SAMP if you want to play multiplayer GTA SA. SAMP supports mods like framerate vigilante and other mods, but MTA on the other hand is taboo to me, dunno if it  can support mods or not.",1577268666,1633194146,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is probably one of the most memorable PlayStation 2 titles most people will remember even to this date. Chronologically San Andreas is set sometime in the early 1990s, a few years after Vice City in Rockstar’s 3D Universe timeline.

Like its predecessor, San Andreas puts you in the shoes of a central character about to embark on a life of crime. However, CJ or Carl Johnson as you like it is no career mobster like Tommy Vercetti from Vice City. In fact, he's been away from “the hood for five years” to try and escape the gang violence that’s been plagued in his home city of Los Santos. He's brought back by his mother's untimely death. Hooking up with his brother Sweet and old friends, CJ is inevitably drawn back into the world he had left behind a world of guns, drugs, territory, casual violence and respect.

Rockstar Games took the satirical drama to the next level. The scope and size of the game is incredible. It will literally take you hours to explore the entire map on foot (which is pointless because of the large array of vehicles available). The story, mood and setting are heavily influenced by the hip hop culture of the 90s, and many rap artists are prominently featured on the soundtrack.

Rockstar really pushed the bar for video game standards with rich detailed open world with three expansive areas that feel very distinct from one another. When people say Rockstar Games is the “king” of open world games it’s because of this reason right here! It has got everything you would want in an open world game! The graphics, the music, the voice acting, the mini games, open world activities. When everything is put together it is phenomenal if you think all of this was possible on PS2!

We have famous voices such as Samuel L. Jackson who voices Officer Tenpenny, James Woods who voices Mike Toreno, Ice T who voices the in-game rapper Madd Dogg, and Chris Penn who voices Officer Eddie Pulaski. Our main character Carl, is voiced by Chiris Bellard who does a marvelous job of voicing Carl).

There are also many surprising cameos and references to Vice City and GTA3. This is one of the few games that managed to really flesh out even the small supporting characters. Hats off to the writers who took effort on character development for over 3/4th NPCs involved in the game’s story. The cast of characters, posters, memes, videos are some of the most iconic you’ll see on social media and internet.

Despite being a huge success, this isn’t a game I would recommend to new gamers simply because it hasn’t aged all that well. Some of the minor annoyances are:

-There are tons of problems with the Steam version. You might have to download some fan made patches, mods and fixes to make it work on your Windows 10 PC. There are quite a few bugs and glitches here and there that were never addressed by the developers. Additionally, bugs present in the Steam version were patched on retail version. Worse the steam version also doesn’t support the great mods so make sure to downgrade the game to retail version before trying to mod it. There are many detailed guides on this.
-Many soundtracks were removed on the game’s 10th Anniversary in 2014 to avoid licensing issues.
-The game is hard locked to 25 fps, trying to mess with it will fundamentally break the game and cause some massive physics glitches making some missions impossible to complete. Other classic Rockstar Games also suffer from this issue. Not a great PC port.
-Some of the missions can be a bit unfair and a real pain to deal with! There are no checkpoint saves so each time you fail a mission you’re forced to get back to the mission marker icon and restart the mission from scratch. Flying planes can be a real challenge and some of these missions also have mandatory training levels as well which can be a nightmare. You can’t progress the story forward without completing these.
-PC Controls are terrible and haven’t particularly aged very well in my opinion. Newly added features such as target aiming needed some polish and clearly shows the game engine being push hard.

Final Words
GTA San Andreas is a complete AAA package for 90s/00s gamers with amazing production value. The game sold over 25 million copies on PS2 alone. I think the audience response alone speaks volumes. Absolutely a great and fantastic way to have fun if you’re stuck with an old, low spec PC or a laptop. After checking out Cyberpunk 2077’s launch I can confidently that San Andreas offers more RPG elements and fun time than most actual role-playing games! It’s a cinematic story rich game, It’s a life sim, it’s open world game, it’s a driving game! it’s an immersive sim, it’s a fully customizable, moddable sandbox/playground! It’s all things combined into a single game! Highly recommend this game to everyone who missed out on this blockbuster title due to…whatever reason. Dude this is San Andreas!! Why are you even reading this!
