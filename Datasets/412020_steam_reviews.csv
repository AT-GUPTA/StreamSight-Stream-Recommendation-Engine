Exodus's gameplay is far more forgiving and action focused to the point where one should play on the Ranger difficulty just to have just a little-bit of the tense survival experience that made the two previous games great. With the new looting/crafting system and an abundance of loot/human enemies it is much easier to keep a stock of filters, ammunition and healing.  Filters and healing can be made at anytime so they are not an issue as long as one looks for materials. Shortages in anything only happen near the tail end of the game if one conserves their supplies and explores for loot. This change was necessary for the shift to a more open-world, but it fundamentally changes the game. 

The storytelling is also noticeably different. Exodus is the opposite of the previous two games that downplayed the political discourse and philosophy of the books to focus on the supernatural. There is barely any supernatural stuff in Exodus. The political and religious commentary is insanely blunt and over the top, but considering the history of Russia and Ukraine it is kindof understandable. Getting good endings is pretty straight forward with a balance of missions that demand you sneak around and some that let you gun down lots of bandits. Big issue with Exodus's story though is that the opening chapters are abit awkward, and that there is alot of idle unnatural expository dialogue throughout the entire story. There is also a few disconnects between the gameplay and story - such as the game telling you this is your chance to explore while your crew waiting for you is dying of thirst. 

Its a good game, but it feels more like some kind of Fallout/Metro hybrid than just another Metro game.",1708907341,1708923956,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It belongs to masterpieces like Half-Life, and separates itself from money grabs like COD.  

My previous problems with the game were: running out of filters.  Again, it really ruins the experience when you are gasping for air, where the game lets you soak everything in slowly.  I guess you have to play with the system, or lose against it.  Another is the Enhanced Edition: always crashing and no DLSS for AMD GPUs, but thankfully a FSR mod is available, letting me enjoy the game again in its ray tracing glory.

the story is immersive, I think you'd still get it even if you haven't played the previous metro games. be careful with your choices and who you're killing tho as it has a big impact on your destiny. you're in for a ride.

satisfying gunplay. stealth mechanism isn't the best but it's okay.

the graphics, the atmosphere, and the sounds, are gorgeous.

Most of the characters are interesting but unfortunately we don't really get to know some of them very well, since the game itself is relatively short. Some of them also talked too much without saying anything important.

the weapon customizations other than supressor and scopes, are somewhat unnecessary, I mean if every new weapon part is always better than what you had then why would you even need to keep the old stuffs?

I also found some bugs. the first one is in caspian map, I crawled in the air as if there was something bellow me. the second one is in the Sam's story dlc, I picked up an item then suddenly I was teleported somewhere else far away. 

the control is sometimes ""uncontrollable"" especially when I tried to sprint or jump out of a tight place. so to exaggerate a bit, instead of hoping me 2 meters ahead, it launched me to the outer space.

despite the problems, it's a very fun game, a nice experience.

There are great moments but because it's been turned into open world it feels like everything is just padding between them. A bit like Far Cry where you plod around from place to place. 

Taiga location was kind of bad. The forest was too dark so I just went around with my flashlight on constantly. They give you a crossbow and tell you you're not allowed to kill anyone if you want the good ending. I ended up running around entire villages knocking 50 people out, which got boring. The end Novosibirsk metro scene was 50% too long - just endless walking around being crippled by radiation. Oh and the railgun sounds like a wet fart. I'm not even kidding, it's ridiculous. 

The graphics are ok, but particularly lack detail in textures and polygons in the Caspian. I'm guessing they had to make a trade off between size of the map and graphics.

It's crash happy - once per hour. There's a bug where if you start driving before your map is completely put away your view will shift up and doesn't change unless you get out/back in the car. Some other floating object glitches.

Exodus has all that gameplay functions as the last two except there is no ""Military grade ammo"" you use as currency to buy upgrades and necessary supplies.

I know I can get much more satisfying gameplay from anything else.

Although, the world is absolutely stunning, and from what I've read on Wikipedia, the story is incredible, it just isn't enough to keep me captivated when the gameplay isn't fun, and the characters remind me of the Sims.

Here's what I liked:

* The gunplay is satisfying
* Gun sound design is really good, gunshots feel as loud and powerful as they should
* The story, while sometimes being a bit eh, is overall very good 
* Environmental storytelling is a big plus in this game
* Atmosphere is perfect
* The horror elements are well done, relying more on suspense than cheap shock value

Here's what I didn't like:

* The English voice acting is not great. The sound mixing for the voice lines is off, so voices appear too ""warm"" and close to you to feel right
* God, the crashing is insane. I had a rough patch where crashes were occurring every five minutes or so. It seems the game will crash for any reason, varying by user, so it's really hard to nail down a fix (I just trucked through constant crashes), it got to the point where I wondered if I could finish the game at all
* Stealth is sometimes weird, and one enemy spotting you for .2 seconds (before being killed silently) will sometimes tip off the entire encampment to your presence - it's easier to just start shootin'
* The story warms up right as it's about to end, which can leave you feeling blue-balled but in a good way

For the voice acting, the game lets you choose the native language for audio and maintains the translated subtitles. I ended up playing the game in Russian (where the voice acting is much better) and just relied on subtitles.

Overall, it's a solid game. For how cheap it is nowadays, it's worth giving it a shot. Just give the story some time to warm up and you'll probably love it. New Game+ support is also awesome with modifiers etc.

One was the lighthouse freeze, where the game freezes on the second open world map when exiting a cave. Which I had to fix by turning everything to low and walk out of the cave while looking at the ground and pray to all the divine that the game wont freeze. Too bad this bug is not in the first two hours meaby then they would bother to fix it. And no it is not hardware issue since the rest of the game runs on 144+ FPS on high. The second bug was in the DLC where the screen would go black and stay that way. That one was fixed by luck.

There is also the scuffed lighting which goes through some kind of grey filter which is most visible when taking the gas mask off as the filter is switch off and then on during the gas mask animation. And sometimes some grass just decides to float. But that is miner issue.

Otherwise, the textures and models are great. The game does look good. Too bad that it is supposed to be a game and not a painting.

So how is the gameplay? The shooting is passable, the crafting is pointless since there is nothing to really craft. Weapon upgrades you have to pick up from dropped weapons, suit upgrades you have to find. I have played on the hardcore difficulty and not once did I run out of ammo, filters or medkits. 

Say goodbye mutans and hello to generic zombies. Actually say goodbye to all interesting supernatural stuff from previous games.

The ""cutscenes"" (or more precisely unskippable dialog) are needlessly drawn out which would not be that big of a problem if the story was interesting. You go on a trip and meet religious cults, slavers, people living as one with the forest, cannibals, really it is post-apocalypse 101.

Some of the story could flow better if Artyom spoke. He does not. Why? He is not mute and speaks during the loading screens so why does he not answer direct questions? The DLC characters talk so why not the main character?

The Two Colonels DLC is one loooooong cutscene with little bit of gameplay in the middle centred around a guy you know is already dead. The flamethrower could be better.

The Sam DLC is substantial improvement over the first DLC. So it ends up being OK. It actually might be slightly better than the main game. No flametrower but there are cute bats. It is also the one part of the game you should definitely play with Russian dub. Or at least any other one then English. Since it might be weird when Sam the American switches from english to english.

The stealth and combat leaves much to be desired. Metro still suffers from it's previous iterations of stealth of, as long as you're in the dark you're an invisible assassin. With the same caveat of being screwed as soon as you get spotted with enemies having a 6th sense of where you are despite breaking contact and relocating. 

Combat is wonky at best with enemies just running around full sprint, suddenly turning 180 at an inhuman speed and doing a cod style no scope killing you instantly. Artyom is akin to a wet napkin when it comes to taking damage at normal difficulty yet enemies can take way more punishment outside of head shots. It takes roughly 3 shots from any weapon to just kill you outright, if you land in fire you die in 0.5 seconds so I hope you like looking at the loading screen. 

So let's get to the crashes and bugs. The game has frozen multiple times with it ever only successfully managing to launch a bug report once which is ironic. It seems that the longer you play in a session the higher your chances become of the game crashing. Also be ready to expect the game to say ""corrupted auto save please rewrite"" when you relaunch the game aka whatever progress you made before the crash is now just gone. Bugs are just enemies shooting through solid objects and spotting you through solid objects. My most recent experience is a mutant just phasing through a closed door because it had no other path so it said ""fuck it noclip enabled"" so it could get a free hit before dying. During the final cut scene the game crashed during the loading screen which was amazing it couldn't load a scripted cut scene. Movement is also weird with trying to sprint up slopes sending you flying and slowly coming back down like you're on the moon, stairs are notorious for this and sometimes stairs will just stop you dead until you back up and try again. 

Kind of speaks volumes by itself that only 27% of people on steam have actually finished the game as of this post. Good thing these jokers took Epics money to put it on their store exclusively for 6 months they need it.",1594282788,1708057775,False,2,1,0.517839491367340088,1,True,False,False

Combat feels smooth, crafting and equipment maintenance is ever present without being overly demanding. The writing and voice acting is excellent -- it has some of the most human interactions you'll find in a video game.  Philosophically the depth of story is found in the individual characters, cults, and warlords you encounter rather than Artyom's internal dialogue, which at face value is rather cliche.  The karma system feels more natural than previous metro games and you can pick up a lot of subtle hints and warnings from the other characters to guide you toward the ""right"" choices simply by paying attention to their dialogue. Playing a moral route also requires more diverse tactics such as use of stealth and understanding some of the faction politics in each level. However if mad listening skills and story are not your thing, the game is perfectly playable as a standard shooter blasting your way through everything.  The environments are top tier -- harsh hostile open world levels juxtaposed with the cozy sanctuary of your train as it rumbles through abandoned wasteland.

This game was pretty fun for a while, though i experienced noticeable audio issues like certain sounds just not playing where they should play, and npcs completely talking over eachother to the point where you literally don't know what is being said. Once I got to the later parts of the game, where you start to explore different parts of the map, I found myself uneasy with the fact that I couldn't go back and get more stuff. The map moves with the story but it was kind of upsetting. Also it doesn't help that I just got completely bored by the later stages. The characters are extremely hollow. Especially the main character. I don't know if it's an audio bug, or if it's just how the game was made, but the main character says nothing despite having constant interaction with the crew. I haven't fully finished the game, but I am on the last map, and I have to say, this game just isn't the best. It has some incredible features, like the crafting system which I liked except for the fact that the materials is just another ""grab scrap parts icon + grab chemical icon = new bullets and new filters for your gas mask. That part feels like it was kind of given up on. But the rest I actually really liked. A lot of little details like the gas mask damage and stuff were really cool to me, or like how the map was designed, but it feels like they focused on all the little stuff like graphics and the way characters looked as opposed to the actual characters personalities and such themselves. most of these characters suck. My wife is insufferable, most of the crew does literally nothing while you are out on missions, and they have boring dialouge. That is not all of them though, it is just most of them. There are like 1 or two characters I liked but considering the fact I can't even remember their names kinda shows you how impactful they are. I don't know. This game seems like it could have been way cooler. Super pretty graphics though. One last thing I thought I should mention is that the flying gargoyle creatures drop NOTHING when you kill them. I remember shooting one out of the sky  expecting my valiant efforts to reward me in some kind of way, only to find that I couldn't loot anything or grab anything from the creature, I merely wasted several magazines of ammunition trying to bring down something that looked more interesting than it actually was.

In the end I had a positive experience, but I also went through a sizeable slump of genuine frustration with it. I played on Ranger Hardcore difficulty for my first playthrough, and the game does not feel like it has been playtested enough for these difficulty settings to ensure a fully satisfying experience. I want to stress that the issue isn't so much the difficulty itself (it is very manageable and fun most of the time), but those moments when the difficulty clashes with other aspects of the game which are clearly designed with other difficulty modes in mind, like its encounter and level design.

As for the encounters, the first two major levels of the game ([spoiler] the Volga and the Caspian [/spoiler]) are mostly S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-like open world experiences, in which you engage with enemies or react to involuntary enemy encounters as you see fit, with factors like ammo and resource scarcity meaningfully informing your gameplay expression. I found these levels, for the most part to be extremely satisfying experiences. There is however, a scripted encounter towards the end of [spoiler] the Caspian [/spoiler], which is so close-quarters, deadly and narrow, that any amount of creative play becomes impossible. As any mistake is essentially punished with an instant death, you are unable to react to the situation in any interesting manner or roll with your mistake, and the entire encounter feels uncharacteristically ""arcade-y"" as a result, essentially asking you to find a way to perfectly execute the fight. The encounter is very clearly designed for a more forgiving difficulty level, but on Ranger Hardcore It creates a very different type of challenge than the game has put forth before that, and does not really play to the game's strengths at all, which made it very frustrating.

The second issue in [spoiler] the Caspian [/spoiler] is that game does not provide you with a reliable place to save (i.e. a bed at basecamp) out of the gate. On Ranger Hardcore, you cannot manually save the game, so you are reliant on autosaves, with the only way to force one being to sleep in a bed. Because of the way the game strings you along through the story segments at a pretty brisk place, this does not become a problem immediately, as the game automatically saves at key moments of these segments. However, once you go off to explore, those key autosaves are often all you have to fall back on, meaning that, if you die during exploration (i.e. while trying to find a bed to save in), you can get caught in a loop where you have to replay a specific encounter again, because the game saved right before it, then have to gather all the resources and ammo pickups from fallen enemies again, then have to return to basecamp, because the only workbench you know about is there, and then set out into the map again, to find a bed to save, potentially to just die once more and lose all this ""progress,"" which amounted to meaningless busywork. This can get frustrating really really quickly and could have been avoided if some more thought had been put into the placement of autosaves / beds.

Lastly, the [spoiler] Taiga [/spoiler] level has issues, which I expect are completely independent of difficulty settings. Compared to previous levels, it is intensely linear. This is not a problem per se (the game has other, really really good linear levels), but because it is presented in a similar manner as the previous two open-world levels, it is very disappointing to make it through the entire level, expecting it to open up at any minute, just to realize that the entire thing has ended (and was very short). This would not be as much of an issue if the level had been fun, however large stretches of it are spent stealthing past a faction of enemies, which are clearly not entirely antagonistic, and which the game explicitly asks you not to kill. As the only nonlethal option in your arsenal are stealth takedowns, this severely limits the ways you can engage with enemies here. This is doubly frustrating as the game takes away your entire arsenal anyways and replaces it with [spoiler] a cool crossbow [/spoiler], which I would have loved to actually use, at all, but as a result, never had a reason to, rendering the posed challenge of ""How will you survive without the weapons you're used to?"" completely mute. I suppose if you don't care about the game's karma system or ending, or don't have any issue roleplaying as a huge piece of sh*t, you could just rambo your way through, and it'd probably be a better experience, but I felt pressured into a specific, extremely boring playstyle. The stealth in this game is simply not fun and complex enough to support an extended stealth segment like this.

Despite all that, I think this game is good. It has very low lows, to me, but those are outweighed by the game's best moments and its excellent storytelling. But I'd recommend learning from my mistakes and to not play this game on Ranger Hardcore, unless you feel particularly resistant to the kinds of frustrations I experienced.",1707742582,1707742712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its not a metro game. Sure, it has the same characters, same gameplay and all of that. But atleast from what I've played, reaching the second level (the one after MOSCOW), theres no metro part of it all. No tunnels, none of that. 
The ammo scarcity isnt even there, I always had max ammo for all my weapons on the hardest difficulty. And the enemies were easy to kill. I dont know if I'm just not far enough in, but I didnt die as much as I did in 2033 and Last Light.

Metro Exodus is a game that I really wish I could've loved: A tactical stealth-shooter where you trek across the Soviet wasteland into parts unknown while battling raiders, mutants, hunger, and resource scarcity? Sounds like a good time to me! While the gunplay is satisfying, the locations detailed and interesting, and the vibes immaculate, I found myself stuck within a mediocre narrative I wish I could escape from and a tedious gameplay loop that left a lot to be desired. The game plays a lot more like an early 2010s Far Cry title than a traditional Metro game, except Exodus does away with merchants, currency, radio towers, and charismatic lunatic dictators. I can also tell there is a lot of inspiration taken from the Stalker series of games: radiation pockets hiding loot, strange floating anomalies, etc. 

The cast of characters here are serviceable at best, boring and uninspired at worst, and mediocre overall. Everyone is a one-note trope with zero room to grow. The dialogue is generic, boring, and poorly written, and the stilted and mediocre voice acting doesn’t help at all. Exodus has a strange problem where the characters all talk so much yet say very little. There is a LOT of exposition here - too much actually. I will sit and listen to characters speak for what feels like forever and when I think they're done and I begin to walk away they will continue yapping away. If I'm feeling bored to death by the people I'm supposed to care about then something has gone very wrong. Artyom, being a silent character, has no spoken interactions with his wife. What is the point of the player and her being romantically involved? Is Artyom supposed to be an avatar or a character? The game can’t seem to decide.

Enemies are pathetically easy and the AI is borderline braindead. Bandits be baited out of cover and can’t aim to save their lives. Mutants are zero threat and go down in a couple of hits. Demons and mutants in earlier games were terrifying, with large packs running around and terrorizing the player at their most vulnerable. However, in Exodus I could walk around most enemies and I never experienced any fear of dying to enemies. Similarly, I never felt like I was running out of medical equipment and ammunition, regardless of what difficulty I played on, because I could always craft more. I never found resources to be scarce and I hit more than enough headshots and took down enough enemies through stealth as to never drain all my ammo. I found that the feeling of being an impoverished scavenger turning over every nook and cranny for a single bullet did not return from previous Metro titles.

When I first completed Metro Exodus last year I received the ""bad"" ending. I lost all three of squad members and died after getting the medication. Part of this was me not paying enough attention to the dialogue and instructions from other characters and part of it was me not understanding that a morality system existed in the game at all. I won't blame the game for me not realizing this, and during my revisit to the Metro universe, I kept in mind to listen to dialogue ques and make sure to do good things and avoid harming people whenever I had the chance.

In my quest for the ""Good"" ending I've had to fight not only mutants, bandits, and cannibals, but also the games tedious and obtuse ""morality"" system. Based on your actions during missions, exploration, and interactions with NPCs, you can gain or lose what I'll refer to as ""morality points"". You can tell what kind of morality points you're getting based on the color of a flash on your screen after doing specific actions. For example, executing surrendering enemies and shooting slaves gives a black negative flash and freeing slaves and cultists gives a white positive flash. Simple enough.

The Volga area is very straightforward: If I want Duke to survive at the end, I cannot kill the merchants and cultists, but I have free reign to slaughter bandits and mutants. Bandit camps are also very clearly labeled with skulls and random gore and corpses. I checked my targets, completed some rudimentary stealth sections, and managed to get out of the bridge without a firefight.

The cannibal bunker known as the Ark is a shooting gallery where the dynamic and satisfying gunplay is given a chance to truly shine. There's not much to say about this area, it's a 20 or so minute underground dungeon where the Colonel makes himself look like an idiot for listening to the ""government"" on the radio. The player can see the danger coming from a mile away and I was not at all surprised by the twist of everyone in the Ark being a deranged cannibal.

The Caspian area is where I started having some trouble. The Caspian is a large desert environment with many open sight-lines and is home to three main types of human enemies: slaves, tribals, and slavers/thugs. I and many others (I did a lot of googling and forum searching for this section) had a very difficult time trying to differentiate between these three types of enemy. I've seen it argued that I should listen to dialogue to figure out who the slavers are in groups, but not every encounter has subtitled dialogue and it can be difficult to know who is speaking when everyone has masks on. Because I can't tell if killing groups of enemies would have me shoot a tribal or slave in the process, and thus net me an unknown quantity of ""bad morality points"" (which could ruin the good run I'm aiming for), I'm often forced to try to run away or restart from a save. I started quick-saving before every encounter not out of a fear of dying, but out of a fear of shooting the ""wrong"" enemies. Also, and I'm not entirely sure if this is a glitch or not, very occasionally I am in a  combat situation with a group of mixed enemies and I am not given the prompt to knock some of them out, forcing me to run away or try again. It's not fun, it's unintuitive, and it made this section feel like a slog.

There was a point where I asked myself, ""isn't it silly and perhaps just a little bit insane that I have to google which groups of slavers I can and can’t kill?"" Moreover, I've seen posts from people saying that Damir still left the train even after they had freed all the slaves, given Giul her family portrait, and spared Saul. It's never made clear just how much you have to do to make him stay, which is probably a contributing factor to why only 17% of all players have had him stay at the end of the Caspian, compared to 1/3 players managing to keep Duke.

The more linear Taiga area is much welcomed change of pace. This area is far more straightforward and features Artyom fighting and/or sneaking past a splintered group called the Children of the Forest. Two factions exist, the Pioneers and the Pirates. the Pirates are more outwardly hostile to the Spartans while the Pioneers, led by a mysterious woman of the woods, are less. You can avoid hurting this group much easier than you can hurting slaves in the desert, given the wooded environment full of cover that lends itself to sneaking around. Bandits are open season in this area as well. This level, as well as the final section in the city, are my favorite parts of the game, feeling much more like the older Metro games.

Final Score: 5/10. It's mid. Many such cases! I know I spent most of this review tearing apart the game but I didn’t completely hate it. I will VERY SOFTLY recommend it to anyone who feels they can put up with the annoying and tedious parts of the game. I seriously wish Steam would introduce a ""neutral"" option for these reviews, but since that doesn't exist, oh well.",1707467088,1707477899,False,4,0,0.518248200416564941,3,True,False,False

I played through the prequels several times and always enjoyed my time with them. The series has a phenomenal setting and really immersive gameplay that keeps you hooked in this desolate and mysterious world.

However, Exodus went into a direction that really put me off but it really depends on what type of player you are. Exodus is very much know for having open maps and encouraging scavenging which are honestly nice additions that enhance the overall strong atmosphere.

My biggest gripe with Exodus is that the game is so invested in its mediocre characters, dialogues and story that it becomes an absolute nuisance. Previous games always put you through cutscenes and some dialogues which elaborated on characters or a certain event. However, Exodus features characters that won't shut up for a minute. Every encounter with random characters is filled with extensive dialogues and you will often find yourself in situations where several NPCs are spouting out exposition over each other. In addition, the game loves to take the control away from you during cutscenes which are delivered in such a static way. The player will often be forced to watch cutscenes which take away all sort of agency and this gets infuriating because almost every mission or encounter has extensive animations which take control away from you. There is a serious issue where you feel absolutely disconnected with everything.

Now, this wouldn't be much of an issue if the characters and dialogues would be compelling but they simply are not engaging. Dialogues are contrived, stilted and clumsily delivered with a lack of nuance or even any sort of finesse. The devs obviously cared a lot for players to care about characters and the world but it requires a lot of patience to get through the extensive expositions dump at every occasion. The main character Artyom is treated like an absolute braindead child and at some point you realize that the writing won't get any better. The intro sequence is quite lengthy but even when the game opens up, it will still wrestle the controls from you and force you to listen to exposition. Every character is just a walking vehicle for exposition and absolutely mundane dialogue with no substance.

Naturally, this is entirely subjective and many enjoy the increased interaction but I honestly feel like the writing is to weak to really carry the game. It's absolutely boring and sometimes even insulting with the way that the game treats you. I usually don't mind these parts as much as long as the gameplay holds up but I'm sorry to say that Exodus left a really bad initial impression.

The open world is not as engaging due to the slow pace and encounters which suffer from absolutely braindead AI. Firefights and stealths are a joke due to the AI which just feels almost broken. The scavenging is enjoyable but the environment suffers from enemies with weak AI and the newly added zombies are such a joke that it breaks immersion.

The game looks stunning with amazing audio, it has some cool gun customization and there is lots to like. But there was a point where the constant forcefed dialogue was suffocating. The cutscenes took away all agency from the player and the actual conversations are stale. 

If you don't like old school cinematic cutscenes and overly long dialogues, just avoid this game.",1707438238,1707438238,False,4,0,0.522417366504669189,0,True,False,False

For Exodus, it comes down to the design. Every map is handcrafted, tree by rock by easter egg hidden in a shack you don't have a quest reason to visit. There are better shooters, better sandboxes, I think Redux has better atmosphere and that supernatural icing on this deliciously bleak cake, BUT, nothing out there makes me feel the way I do playing Exodus on Ranger Hardcore. It's greater than the sum of its parts, made with love and polish so this game punches way above the small dev studio's weight. 

I *love* how the level structure works, with claustrophobic linear levels alternating with the most fantastic open world levels I've ever played, made with more attention to detail than most AAA games marketed on their sandboxes. The shooting is weighty and if you're playing ""correctly"", you'll always be thinking about whether spending ammo in this particular fight is worth it so pulling the trigger has a kind of mental impact FarCry or whatever just can't match. I like the survival elements that are lightweight enough they don't hamper the experience, but cause you to always be scrounging, to go a little further out of your way looking for loot, to take your time looking around the stunning environments. I love the weapon design where guns look post-apocalyptic but not like they were cobbled together by Fallout raiders high on their supply. I love how the story revolves around a trainload of comrades looking for a better home. I love how you make choices through actions instead of dialogue options. I love the stealth, although it's much less of an emphasis than Redux.

Actually yeah let me throw on a couple other things I prefer in Redux: the supernatural stuff. I don't like horror games, but I love spooky, atmospheric games. Metro 2033 and LL struck that balance for me where I never felt like I could actually enjoy scary stuff for once. Another thing I miss is the lack of humanimals. They are everywhere in Exodus and are lame. They're just Fallout ghouls with less interesting visual design; boring to fight, annoying to encounter, uninspiring to look at. I would much rather have run across roving Watcher packs, maybe different ""evolutions"" depending on the regions. Librarians, Demons... ANYTHING else.

But when my only complaints are comparisons to its prequels that boil down to ""I don't like this one enemy"" and ""this non-horror-focused game isn't as scary""... well that kinda speaks volumes.",1707179573,1707179573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wish that the last 10% of the game was the entire game, that is the only part of this game that met the feel of Metro. Everything else feels like Far Cry. I like that they have moved this toward as a more open world experience, but I want to explore post apocalyptic nuclear winter Russia/Ukraine. Why they felt the need to bring us to a desert and a taiga is beyond me. There are a few core things that really made me not enjoy the game over all...

- The crafting at first feels cool... but then your realize... oh I can just craft a med-kit, or ammo, or filters almost anytime I need them. Completely killing that tension that the original Metro's builds by having to manage your very limited supplies. Hell, even having bullets as a currency which was such a cool idea, was scrapped.
- This also kills stealth. Stealth in the original Metro games were not entirely optional. You were out gunned and out manned. You took stealth more seriously because you couldn't afford to waste supplies in a gunfight. Gun fights in this game felt like a joke. The AI is far too dumb, the supplies you have are plentiful and as long as you have cover, you pretty much have unlimited heals. I never felt at risk, there are even times I would just charge the enemy head first knifing people.
- Crafting also killed the tension of gas mask as well. This was such a core part... the gasping for air... the feeling of not being able to linger because you only have so much oxygen. Pretty much completely gone and almost entirely un-utilized for the majority of the game
- Are there even any gas mask effects anymore? I don't remember getting my mask smudged with blood or water or snow in this game... only patching a hole and leeches.
- They pretty much killed the psychological horror aspects the game except at the very end - super disappointed in this. I loved the idea of the horror being so significant that it is imprinted on the location. I wish they had expanded on this.
- I found it way more difficult to be invested in the story. I don't even know why. Almost every dialogue with the exception of the end of the game felt more like roadblocks and filler than something meant to be there. I always felt like I wish I could skip it and get back to the game or wanting NPC's to get out of my way. I never felt this way ever with the original Metros.
- The in-game chatter dialogue felt was too sanitized... like this is a supposed to be an adult game, but the insults sound like something out of a pixar game.
- Some of the weapon design felt good, but some of it felt a little too steampunk and unrealistic. Even the AK just seemed to have a weird design.
- Also, forgot to mention that there are still some game breaking bugs. My first play through I like 80% the desert area and had a bug that prevented me from progressing the only fix was to restart the whole level from the beginning... which is like 60% of the entire game. My second play through was less buggy, the only major bug I had was being dropped out of the sky and getting stuck falling under the ground forever - I was expecting there to be a teleport plane, like most games if you somehow glitch under the map, but no dice here. Had to reload - not a huge deal but kinda breaks immersion.


- What I enjoyed was the combat and weapon customization. Although the AI was bad and didn't feel challenging or intelligent, the gun play felt fun.
- The desert map did feel a bit disjointed compared to the taiga map, but from a design aspect they did a good job even if it wasn't what I was looking for.
- They clearly put a lot of time and thought into the maps' progression and flow. I very rarely ever felt like I was picking up an new inferior attachment. Almost all attachments were actual upgrades.

To be clear this game isn't bad by any means. It is good for what it is, but what it is, is not a Metro game... It just isn't. The tone, the feel, and the core elements are just not there. I want to see a open world Metro game that has handcraft areas that are seamed together through a metroidvania style progression. I want the same brutality that existed in the first games. The starvation for supplies. The feeling of being at the bottom of the food chain. The uninhabitable unforgiving surface. Way more psychological horror elements. I want do dredge through the underbelly of the Metro. I don't want Far Cry in Metro. Sadly, I doubt I will ever see this game.",1706509766,1707166544,False,30,6,0.534600675106048584,0,True,False,False

Graphics and sound design are superb. And gunplay can be a lot of fun with high variety of customizations for iconic Metro guns. There is some replay value as well, with new game+ unlocking more challenging ways of playing. But other than that, I feel like Metro exodus offers remarkably little:
To start off with, there are five main maps/chapters in the base game, and just two of them are open - Volga river and Caspian sea. You can free roam, but there's very little to explore, apart from bandit camps, which you can either shoot up or stealth your way through, which is highly repetitive. The other three chapters are completely linear, much like the last two games.
Moving on to gameplay mechanics, Exodus, at times, is genuinely worse than Last light and 2033:
Movement is extremely slippery, melee attack is highly unreliable and glitchy, some realistic features like guns jamming and Artyom getting exhausted from running only end up making the game more tedious.. Resource management is basically non-existent due to crafting ability. Mutants aren't even remotely scary anymore, as you can literally just avoid them. There is also a boss fight against a giant bear, which was recycled from Last light.
Last but not least, story of exodus departs from the usual Metro storytelling and leads the characters to explore the world outside of ruined Moscow. There are a few interesting plot twists, but dialogue and character development is mostly underwhelming, since there is no ambiguity as to who's good and who bad.
Overall, I think this game doesn't offer much for its price and advertising as an ""open world"" title. Like I said, only get it if you adore the Metro franchise. And make sure you do so at a discount price.",1707151721,1707151721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story was pretty good, the weapons were satisfying (especially the crossbow), the mechanics were pretty nice...just everything. I have many pros for this game since I enjoyed it. But holy s**t this game had SO MANY bugs, glitches and fps hiccups here and there (also depending on some maps). I had more problems in the original campaign compared to the dlcs and also compared to the other games (2033 redux and last light redux) I saw a lot of weirdness.

[u]My complaints are[/u]:
-Glitches and bugs: I saw a lot of jankyness but there was one glitch that PI**ED me of was when my body became invisible, which ruined my immersion and literally made the game unplayable (and yes Im over exaggurating but still took me some time to fix this stupid f*****g problem).

-Quick time events: They are a joke, they might as well not even be here. Now you would think that you have to spam E button to complete quick time event...you know just like in any other games right ? Wrong ! You have to press AND hold E button...thats it...I mean whats the point. I didnt even knew this until I played Sam's story dlc at the begining where I experimented with quick time events where I found how it really worked, which made me depressed. :(

-Fps: Its inconsistent, somewhere you have 60+ fps and sometime's you have 40 fps, kinda sucks.

-Fall damage can f**k right off.

-Controls feel weird and a little bit floaty especially when jumping around and climbing over ledges, but I got used to it after some time.

Even with these problems I love this game. Is it worth buying ? Yes, but be prepared for some jankyness...just as a warning.",1615676253,1707004310,True,1,0,0.50602412223815918,0,True,False,False

Though I rushed the game a bit as I do with every game I play, ever so often I caught myself just taking it all in, the graphics are amazing, story line is perfect and with alt endings that you can attempt to go after, and the play style is not at all forced and you can be stealthy, aggressive, passive, or what ever. I played aggressively stealthy meaning I hunted from the shadows, but against my knowledge, this style lead to my moral level, which i didn't even know was a part of the game, being low and thus I got the ""bad"" ending, but this ending was amazing and by no means a bad or distasteful ending. I won't spoil it though. I will likely come back after a break to attempt another play through to get the other ending because I have a hole in my soul now that this game belongs in since I feel like I left it unfinished.
Overall, it is an amazing post-apocalyptic game with plenty of horror and suspenseful aspects while remaining strong with the story of which is able to end differently depending on your actions throughout the game.

It's the ""no interaction bug"" that corrupts the save files. Happened around 20 hours into my playthrough on the level Caspian. This bug breaks your game upon reloading a save file (i.e. via dying or playing on a new day) or upon exiting a vehicle/resurficing from water, where you can no longer interact with the world, shoot your weapons, activitate your flashlight, etc. - your primary gun (with custom attachments) is floating in the air, stuck to your body or simply vanished from the earth.

I really tried to give this another chance, but after another 2-3 hours that contained maybe 10-15 mins of mediocre clunky game-play, I just can't do it anymore.

I am so frustrated and bored with this game, ( and I will play anything) 

The movement is so painstakingly slow at times, and when some action does happen you sometimes don't get the option to use your gun when you are asked to mash a button and hit the thing with what ever you are holding, that is unless your gun jams after firing 3 or 4 bullets,   
This could have been fun if Only you could skip through the hours of cut scenes and dull dialogue

This game literally had me questioning whether I had any household chores I could be doing instead or whether I would have more fun picking out new wall paper for my sitting room.

Honestly I have had more fun waiting on a bus, I have had more tension and apprehension waiting on a dental appointment. In fact the best thing I did with this game was turn it off and uninstall it.

Now I am sure that the developers who worked on this put a lot of effort into it and are quite proud, it is a very beautiful visual game,however I bought this under the premise of an FPS shooter with fast paced action. When what I experience was the equivalent of having to sit through Uncle Bob and Auntie Ednas holiday slide of Bognar Regis while drinking room temp tea and nibbling on stale garibaldi's, While Bob explained how Bognor was originally part of the ancient parish of Pagham in the county of Sussex, with a port or haven on the Aldingbourne Rife.

First off I am not a big fps fan, so the fact that this still got a good review with me not being a fan of the genre says a lot.

I though this was just some bioshock/fallout knock off or something but its not at all. Post apocalyptic? yes. But nothing like the mentioned titles. 

It has a ton of little things that immerse you in the game. Drinking with your friends, smoking ect. The conversations in the game are awesome. You really feel like your crew is your family. 

The game play is great. I don't really care for all the passive stuff you need to do in the game in order to unlock certain things i wont mention because i don't want any spoilers but its still great.

Graphics for the enhanced version aged decent. I had zero bugs or crashes. 

The story was amazing. Even tho I prefer open world games and most of this game is linear with some semi open world aspects. It did not bother me at all. 

The ending was amazing. The small choices in the game are great. The fact that it was in Russia was also great. As an american i sometimes get bored of most games being based in my country. The collectibles were not overwhelming. Nothing in this game felt like a boring grind. I loved all the modifications you can get for your gear and choose how you want your load out.

I'm not gonna lie, the game has its problems, I dont mean problems like bugs/crashes as I didn't encounter many crashes or bugs during my playthrough, I mean problems like certain things in the game that feel kinda ""off"". Things that other people have talked about in their reviews like the fact that a silent protagonist doesn't work as well as it did in previous games or how it has at time repetitives dialogues for the enemies, most of that stuff its true and I can argue against it but GOD I just cant give this game a rating that is not 5 stars.

As well as the rest of the games I LOVE the atmosphere in these games, they always make me feel like I AM Artyom, the way I always get inmerse into these games is something i hadn't felt since I played TLOU for the first time. Many times I found myself listening to my fellow rangers companions conversations and sitting with them while drinking like if i was one of them, I love how they talk about what just happened in the previous level, or about stuff happening during the levels themselves, how sometimes they talk about their own desires and goals, I can confidently say that I listened to every conversation I could, with my fellow rangers, with npcs around the map, with Miller and with Anna.

I just cant explain how this game made me feel like I was into his world, I played the story mode over 6 times, got every achievement and still I find myself thinking I could do another playthrough again.

Spending more than an hour on levels like ""Winter/Autumn/Summer/Spring"" Triggerin every conversation I could, listening to every dialogue with Anna and listening to the radio for clues about the world around us is something I had never done with such feeling in any other game.

This game is just beautifull and a must play to me. The whole saga is a must play to me is really one of those games I wanna remember for the rest of my life, I just cant give it any other rating but 5 stars.

And a quick shoutout to Anna that was my favorite character in the game, I really love how she is a strong woman when needed but never stops being a loving wife to artyom and a great friend with the rest of the crew. Anna you're the best ^^",1706445894,1706445924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The slow movements and survival elements made for an interesting experience in the depths of the metro, but without this claustrophobic environement and the superb level design of the previous games, the experience feels bland and unsatisfaying.

In terms of writing, it also feels like a clear downgrade, from the premisce of Exodus it feels like a stretch, clearly derivating from the source material to provide an unecessary sequel.

Ive waited until 2024 to try this game, and ive still encountered various bugs.

On paper the game could have been very good, but it lacks ambition. Not enough effort was put into making this a true open world game. The weapon mod system feels lackluster, the train and relation management are practically inexistant. I feel like im playing a bad stalker mod for far cry. 

Perhaps they should have taken some time to fletch out the new mechanics, or make another game set in the metro. Or perhaps a sequel wasnt needed after all, Last Light being a perfectly good ending point in my opinion.

If I wanted to watch a low-rate animated film I would have chosen to do that - I thought I was getting a game but I was wrong.",1706063446,1706063446,False,2,0,0.441605865955352783,0,True,False,False

The game is set 2 years after the events of the previous chapter.

Our protagonists, Artyom, Anna, Miller and some former Spartans, tired of life underground and after discovering that there are other survivors living on the surface, embark on a journey on board a train in search of a place where they can settle a colony and start a new life outside the metro.

This ""exodus"" will mean that throughout the storyline we will visit a variety of different places, each characterized by its own peculiarities. The bombings occurred about 25 years earlier and therefore a large part of the territories are still highly irradiated, inhospitable, infested with mutants or in any case difficult to inhabit.

The game will let us discover many small settlements, each of which, following the wars and the absence of a central government, has had different events and has evolved and adapted to the circumstances as best it could.
This allows for a very varied narrative that is free from the setting of the tunnels, which bored me a bit after Last Light. And towards the end, when we’ll have to return to another subway and visit its tunnels, we will discover that even there events took a very different turn compared to what happened under Moscow.

Initially I didn't appreciate the first ""open"" level (The Volga), coming from the linear gameplay of the previous chapters I found it a bit distracting. However, once I got past the first adaptation phase, the game hooked me. In fact, it is not so much the gameplay that popped, but rather the various stories that we will gradually discover. Each chapter is somewhat comparable to one of the Fallout vaults, and so the thing I found most exciting was trying to understand what happened and how it got to the current situation.

The environmental narration also helps a lot in this, very carefully crafted, full of visual clues as well as the classic fragments of diaries scattered around. All this captured me and immersed me in the stories, I felt right there, sometimes inside and sometimes alongside Artyom, while I explored [spoiler] a settlement inhabited by cannibals, a desert inspired by Mad Max and governed by the ""Baron"" (Immortan Joe?), or even a forest populated by pirates and beast-men who live in the trees… [/spoiler]

All the characters have endured extremely hard stories, and are the often tragic fruit of their experiences. Despite everything at the end of each episode, however dramatic, there sometimes remains a glimmer of hope, perhaps reflecting the vision of Dmitry Glukhovsky (not having read the novels I can't say for sure, but I can certainly say that I felt like to read them while playing this title).
To all this I would add that aliens are not present in the main plot, unlike the previous chapters, and this makes it in my opinion much more linear and simple to follow, and ultimately I appreciated it much more than that of 2033 and Last Light.

Speaking of pure gameplay, however in this chapter we will have more freedom of movement thanks to the introduction of semi-open world hubs, where in addition to being able to decide whether to have a stealth or more aggressive approach, sometimes we will be able to choose the order in which to face the objectives.
This might be a bit reminiscent of the immersive sim genre, although in reality everything will be much simpler and more linear. The result, in my opinion, is quite balanced and enjoyable, and contributes to immersion in the general atmosphere.

Moving on to the graphics section, I must say that I also found this to be exceptional. I played the version with Ray Tracing and I found everything really well done, non-repetitive and with great attention to detail. As already mentioned, the environmental storytelling is really effective, also thanks to the beautiful graphics. The artistic direction is excellent, all the settings had a strong visual impact on me, without ever boring me, really managing to immerse myself in the atmosphere.

The same thing I can say about the sound, whose well-crafted effects amplify even more the emotions gradually transmitted by the environment, the tension of walking alone inside radioactive tunnels full of corpses or in a sandstorm. The soundtrack is also excellent, discreet and effective.

In conclusion, a game that I approached because I felt the need for a bit of a post-apocalyptic “fix” and which definitely exceeded all expectations, leaving me more than satisfied, and above all intrigued to finally read the novels on which it is based. Highly recommended!

The game follows Artyom, a survivor of the nuclear war that devastated the Earth, as he leads a group of Spartans on a journey aboard the Aurora train. Along the way, they encounter various factions, mutants, and environmental hazards, as well as glimpses of hope and humanity.

The game features four different regions, each with its own season, climate, and challenges. The regions are not fully open-world, but rather large sandbox areas that allow for exploration and side quests. The game also has several linear levels that are more reminiscent of the classic Metro style. The game gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach each situation, whether you prefer stealth, combat, or a mix of both. You can also customize your weapons and gear using a crafting system that requires you to scavenge for resources.

The game's graphics are stunning, with realistic lighting, shadows, and weather effects. The game also has a great sound design, with immersive ambient noises and a fitting soundtrack. The voice acting is decent, although some of the dialogue is cheesy or clichéd. The game's story is engaging and emotional, with multiple endings depending on your choices and actions. The game also has a lot of replay value, with different modes, difficulties, and secrets to discover. The game is about 15-20 hours long, depending on how you play and explore.

Metro Exodus is a must-play for fans of the Metro series, as well as anyone who enjoys a well-crafted and atmospheric FPS game. The game is a masterpiece of gameplay, visuals, and storytelling, and deserves a high score of 9.5/10.",1705339321,1705752828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

      Bullet resources are finite and most of time simply irrational. Human enemies contain like 1-5 bullets when looted. Yet wildlife is procedurally respawned. Killed a large winged demon thinking it would finally stop bothering you? Voila there is another one and always just one for you.
      The wildlife almost never display any interaction with each other yet are all willing to kamikaze you. You miss one shot from far away and somehow ALL OF THEM in the vicinity knows exactly where you are and go kamikaze. There is no dismemberment, no wounding/slowing down before death. The sheer quantity of wildlife to be killed - and respawned! - is unbelievable given that the story protagonist is NOT a pest squad. Did I mention HUNDREDS of male human somehow living inside a bunker expecting 10 or so outsiders to come as food?
       Different regions had either cliche Cult, Mad Max, or tree hugger setting but no real life to sustain it. There would be a slave economy in story but not a single resource caravan or patrol on the road. Just you and the wildlife in the wild. 
       The first few chapters have you collecting unique gears and upgrades which are fantastic. But just when you collected every upgrade, the story forbids you to use them, like it's just out to troll you. 
       They put a lot of work into the weapon modifications and lovable story companions. But to keep those companions alive you have to avoid using weapons in almost every specific level that is nicely crafted. You have to stealth, which the devs happened to NOT put too much work in.
       The story itself seems rushed. A power figure known to murder and rape would suddenly be reconciled and spared at the last and only brief time you meet him. Someone who has been fighting harshly against an external threat would suddenly be totally open to a new group of foreigners. Important characters pop out and give you long earful to stuff you with all the background settings at once.
       The tree hugger folks, according to story, are somewhat confused teenagers? Yet their model height and built is identical to the real grown-ups you have been seeing. Their voice casting, even in Russian, sounds unbelievably identical to the bandits and slavers you have been hearing.

I'm using a Mac Mini M2 Pro and the game is running on maximum graphics settings with a really good frame rate. The visuals are absolutely stunning - at some points in some levels it looks photorealistic. The mechanics of the gameplay (e.g. the various items you have to use such as the gas mask and the charger etc) feel really immersive and challenging. Altogether I've been absolutely blown away by how compelling the experience is of playing this game. The final level in particular is utterly mind-bending; the artistry of how the different themes (e.g. science-fiction, horror, surrealism, and an increasing sense of grief) all come together is stunningly well done. I've been playing on some sort of 'normal' difficulty and the learning curve has been just right i.e. it's been pretty hard on the first play-through and I'm really looking forward to playing through again on higher difficulty levels. There were some sequences where I had to use night-vision goggles to clear out some abandoned building in total darkness and it felt electrifying i.e. really intense and detailed gameplay and I was on the edge of my seat. The story feels artful and very thoughtfully written; it makes the cutscenes (which are quite long and you can't skip them) ok to sit through (!). My only negative comment would be that, on my operating system at least, the game is quite buggy i.e. it quits to desktop every 2-3 plays at some point; this issue is seemingly related to certain keypresses and/or the triggering of notifications within Steam (for e.g. achievement badges).

Incredibly streamlined and linear upgrade system. You just find straight-up better upgrades from the last for your gun. It's simple and outdated. It doesn't have anything to compare or compete with the unique system the last games had where you had to make tough decisions between when to trade in your gun and hope you loot a better one with more attachments in order to balance the in-game economy. It's just... You find a part somewhere and can slap it on your gun. Wow. Innovative. Glad we waited over 8 years for this. And it's mostly just linear upgrades. More stability, better damage. Very few horizontal upgrades.

Not to mention how buggy the attachments are. Had two green lasers, but can only equip one on shambler. Remove it from shambler, still only shambler can use that one, doesn't show up on other guns as an option. It doesn't make me confident of the coding in this game. Skyrim syndrome.

And many of the upgrades make no sense. You can't have a reinforced helmet and extended gas mask filters and reinforced mask glass. And you can't have an extended battery, brighter flashlight, and/or nvg upgrade.

Why? Why can you only choose one? There's no reason for this. There's no interesting or worthwhile tradeoff. The entire game you designed the weapon attachments to simply be more convenient as you progress... Why the exclusivity with the gear? Did you just not want to program in the capability to select multiple? Did you think constantly recharging the flashlight or constantly swapping the filter is a fun engaging tradeoff for... Increased armor or brighter flashlight?

But let me get to the real reason I decided to leave a negative review. All in all the game isn't a bad one, and it's a decent complete product.

Complete... Without a proper save system.

I got this game for my father. He really enjoyed the previous two games and was warming up to this one. 

He got into the whole semi-open world concept. He was off-put at first given the huge change from the first two games, but he got used to it. 

Well, at some point during the Volga chapter, he decided to do a main mission because it was just close to him, so he figured he'd just do it.

He had no idea it was a one-way street. There would be no way to return to Volga. Though there was no warning, no reason to really believe that, and it would put him into a huge linear section of multiple hours before just plopping him into the best semi-open section. And he had plenty of looting and sidequests left to do in Volga, he wasn't near done with that section. And he's not like, a veteran gamer. He doesn't have that experience that you need to check the wiki before doing a main mission to see if it is a point of no return.

However, this was no big deal. The beauty of the Metro games is that you can reload chapters. If you miss something, you lose 10, or 20 minutes maybe at most. It was a really nice system. It also remembered your progression. Sure those games had flaws too, but overall it was solid. 

So I thought ""Okay, he'll just have to load the Volga chapter, it'll be easy. Just like the last game you can just reload a chapter and play through it.

In this game, you CAN reload chapters... So what's the problem? The problem is, that you reload the Volga chapter... From the beginning. It doesn't keep track of your looting, your progression... You start AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VOLGA CHAPTER. The chapter that is a semi-open world that can take over well over two hours to loot the important locations and explore...

Okay, so what did they do to like, account for this? Surely something right? Like... Maybe they remembered where you were in that chapter and you can continue at the point before you entered the next main mission? Maybe you could choose to restart the entire chapter or continue where you left off?

Nope. Nothing. 

You see, the game doesn't have a manual save system. Okay... So what does it have? It has a quick save system. You can save up to 4 quick saves before they start overriding each other. Take my word for it, this was not enough. He had well savelocked himself out of returning to Volga.

The auto saves take up quicksave slots, and the game auto saves frequently. So it probably would've savelocked him out even if he tried to save very sparingly.

My dad did nothing wrong. He quick saved regularly, and in most games that is ideal. That isn't a detriment, that's a good thing! In no way should he have been punished for this behavior.

How do you mess up a game this bad? Like seriously, savelocking your players is one of the top concerns you should have had when making this game. Did no one think of this? Did no one care? You made larger, longer chapters than the last game... And didn't adjust the checkpoint or save system to accommodate it. And worst, this is a common complaint, and you've never fixed it!

""Oh you can play through it all again!"" Woohoo, my father can spend his already limited time replaying a game just to get that extra loot, those upgrades, and experience the game he should've been able to experience at his own pace and his own discretion

That should only factor in if you like a game and WANT to replay it. In no way does this excuse their lack of a save system, poor communication, and in general incomprehensibly incompetent progression design. 

He will replay a game he wants. (He's replayed TLOU on NG+, and I had to use a glitch to increase the difficulty for him because he wanted to try it harder difficulty, yet for some reason, you can't change it legitimately because players wanting to try a harder difficulty with NG+ is bad I guess? (Maybe they wanted to gatekeep those achievements.) Yeah, that was a stupid design choice, but at least it came at the end of the game and didn't ruin the entire experience.)

But that should be HIS decision. Not a requirement to enjoy a game that is inherently flawed by its very own design because he didn't know the ins and outs of a game he has never played, and he can do nothing to remedy his common, understandable, and minor mistake.

------


This is what EPIC dolled out cash for an exclusivity deal? In my opinion, the game isn't even finished without a proper save or chapter select system. And apparently, it's been unfinished for over 4 years.


--

UPDATE:

The game has a number of embarrassing bugs, some especially embarrassing given this game tries to be semi open world.... Because some bugs destroy the ability to backtrack. Like some areas are just bugged out and you can't return to the same place on the exact same map, even before it officially transitions you to the next chapter.

There are a variety of issues that could be solved with the game if it just allowed manual saving. I cannot tell you how many times the game can autosave. you out of getting a moral point, many of which make sense in retrospect but are kind of vague and hidden and you probably need the wiki for. Not too unlike the previous games. It's very stealth heavy. You don't always get positive feedback soon enough or noticably or even seemingly at all sometimes.

Corpses and loot in general often have abysmally broken detection boundaries. Your annoying metal detector (that you can't turn down or off and can't unequip on the field because you need a workshop bench to do so) will beep at a corpse and you'll be scanning his body until you hover over his 38th freckle and then it will be like ""press to loot!"" 

Loot needs a slight sheen like the previous games. There is plenty of loot that looks nothing like loot. Blends too well.

You lose the nvg in the taiga and you never get them back. Though in later chapters they sure would be handy. They make it excessively dark and annoying. Why?",1704673795,1705514969,False,2,0,0.461832046508789063,0,True,False,False

 I did not get the untouchable in SAM for some reason and needed to play it twice... was glad to.  SAM was blast... especially when I forgot to look for mines.  The party cut scene still makes me laugh.  

Update: Bugs plus long cut scenes make it very unpleasant to play.  Do not buy it unless you are ready to suffer.  Otherwise, the review below applies.  Too bad.  

I'm enjoying the game and highly recommend it.  I did not like a couple of things that I mention below.  I like the game but only mention the negative?  Sure, but just to give you a heads up so that it does not detract from enjoying the game.  (Just because I mention the negative does not mean I'm not negative.  I'm in California - double negatives and crazy are easy to come by.)

The quick save is wonky in that it's not reliable.  I like to experiment sometimes and finding all saves to be experimental is no fun.  My quick save rarely is the the ""quick save"" I want.  I have to guess and load several of the saves to find the one I want.  Noting the time of your quick save will help.  I finally created my own save-archive using PowerShell just in case all my saves are badly timed.  You can manually copy the ""C:\Users\*username*\Saved Games\metro exodus"" folder someplace safe once in a while - timestamp the folder if you like.  (It has to be done as a set because metadata in the files has to be consistent.)  If you have a backup (e.g., free Veeam), that works too.  Be sure to turn of the steam cloud sync of the game if doing your own restore of the ""metro exodus"" folder.  Can't have two processes mucking with files without mucking up the files.   

A few cut scenes are a bit long.  I don't know a way to skip them - no ""E"" (using keyboard) on them.  They are okay, but twiddling thumbs is not as fun as playing the game.  The cut scenes are decent and not offensive like some of those franchise killing ones in Wolfenstein II The New Colossus.  (I hated the Colossus cut scenes enough to give up on the Wolfenstein franchise.  I'm not some puppet that has to listen to their drivel.  Screw them.  Ah, I guess I'm still pissed at them.  Maybe someday I will forgive them.  But not yet.)

BTW Once a enemy is aware of you, don't count on a one-shot head-shot to kill with a pellet gun.  It will take many pellets once surprise is not a factor.  Died a few times because of this.  One-shot then buck-shot.  [Update]  I think some enemies are scripted to be extra hard to kill.  They are going to cause you trouble, so don't assume they are going to go down right away even if they normally do.",1703876847,1705301954,True,0,0,0,8,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The best section is the initial level in the frozen tundra at the start of the game and the final mission level. I originally played through this game and got to the desert map when i lost interest and had to come back to finish after a couple years of sitting in my library. 

The middle levels feel too linear while also lacking the atmosphere that metro made its name off of. 
The ai feels very rudimentary and brain dead when it comes to combat and stealth in this game. 
The movement and speed of the game play feels sluggish and clunky. 
The final mission brings back the spooky metro vibe and horror experience to save the game.
Graphically it looks beautiful but not enough to play just for that. 

Much of the story is forgettable and full of cut scenes with too much dialogue full of goofy Russian accented voice acting. 

So I would recommend buying this on discount.",1704998438,1704998689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2][b]Rating: 100/100[/b][/h2]

[h3][b]Gameplay (95/100):[/b][/h3]
Metro Exodus maintains the series' core survival mechanics while introducing a more expansive and open-world environment. The game combines stealth, combat, and exploration seamlessly, offering a diverse range of gameplay experiences. The addition of a dynamic day-night cycle and weather conditions contributes to the realism and unpredictability of the game world.

The crafting system, resource management, and the need to maintain gas masks and other survival gear enhance the sense of immersion. The variety of weapons and modifications, coupled with the need to adapt to different scenarios, provides players with a satisfying level of strategic depth. However, occasional AI quirks and minor bugs may slightly impact the overall experience.

[h3][b]Graphics and Sound (100/100):[/b][/h3]
Metro Exodus is a visual marvel, showcasing the capabilities of modern gaming technology. The game's detailed and atmospheric environments, from the desolate surface to the claustrophobic metro tunnels, are a testament to the developers' commitment to visual excellence. The lighting effects, character models, and attention to detail create a world that is both beautiful and haunting.

The sound design is equally exceptional, with a haunting and evocative soundtrack that heightens the emotional impact of the narrative. The atmospheric audio, including the sounds of the desolate wasteland and the eerie whispers of mutated creatures, adds to the sense of dread and suspense. The voice acting is top-notch, conveying the desperation and humanity of the characters.

[h3][b]Story and Narrative (100/100):[/b][/h3]
Metro Exodus weaves a captivating and emotionally charged narrative that follows protagonist Artyom's journey across a post-apocalyptic Russia in search of a new home. The storytelling is mature, nuanced, and enriched by the deep lore of Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro novels. The characters are well-developed, and their relationships evolve organically, fostering a genuine connection with the player.

The game's narrative is not afraid to explore complex themes of hope, despair, and the consequences of human actions in a world on the brink of collapse. The branching storylines and moral choices provide a level of player agency that influences the overall narrative, offering a sense of personal investment in the outcome.

[h3][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h3]
Metro Exodus is a triumph of narrative-driven gaming, combining breathtaking visuals, immersive sound design, and deep storytelling to create an unparalleled experience. Metro exodus accurately reflects the excellence in every aspect, from its atmospheric world design to its mature and emotionally resonant narrative. Metro Exodus stands as a testament to the artistic potential of video games, delivering an unforgettable journey through a desolate, yet captivating, post-apocalyptic landscape.

[h3]Metro Exodus Is Excellent [/h3]



[h2] Atmosphere [/h2]

the atmosphere is one of, if not the best part of the game. its the way it makes you completely immersed in its unfathomably well done levels, which paired with the audio and graphics amkes for an experience you cant really get anywhere else. it makes you completely lost in what is, for me personally, the most immerse video game world to date.

[h2] How It Makes You Immersed [/h2]

how is it the game makes you so immersed? its the way it makes you think about preparation and stability, in ways of making sure your equipment is ready, like charging your flashlight, changing you gas-mask filter, or pumping your guns. it makes you live in the world, it doesnt skip realism, it strives to make it a feature, and a good one at that. along with this, its the small things such as there being a seperate reload animation for stopping halfway through the animation, or water being splashed on your mask's glass, and then wiping it clean. its things such as those that make it just that much more impressive. 

[h2] Safe Houses [/h2]

i feel like safe houses in this game are so well done theyre worth mentioning on their own. its another example of how well these developers create feelings. after exploring around the levels and coming across a safezone, you can really see how someone couldve lived there. some of the safe zones arent really safe either, since its very possible that a mutant could come flying by, attempting to attack you, and it kinda makes it feel like you always have to be on the move cause youre never really safe, theres always a noise of a mutant just outside the door, or bandits thinking no ones there, and sitting themselves around a campfire just outside. and also, the places and ways they make the safe zones are impressive. it can be in a rusted crashed boat, or the top of a tree. i could go on, theyre well done, very much so. its worth stopping by them, just to adore them.


[h3]TLDR:[/h3]

Metro Exodus is one of the best games ive ever played, doing well in each of its parts, barely ever falling short on anything.
from its groundbreaking immersion level, to its impressively detailed landscapes, it does it all well for a studio not that well known. they really knew how to work with all this stuff, and kept it from being a very regular post-apocalyptic open world type-game. so if youre looking to decide whether to buy or not, also considereing its incredibly high price to value when its on sale, id say go for it.  like, 6 dollars for the game, 3 for dlc? incredible! its almost guranteed you'll get your moneys worth, one way or the other.

--However--

As someone who has played the whole series multiple times (on Ranger difficulty no less), there are a few gripes I have with this game comparing it to the previous one.

The movement feels very...floaty and unresponsive, it's similar in a way to GTA V. This makes stealth encounters a pain.

Speaking of stealth, it's..okay it's pretty bad. Unlike in the previous games, if an enemy spots you then  that's it, you gotta reload or shoot your way through, and if you're going for the good ending then chances are you'll reload either way, because in *two* major levels the game pretty much prohibits you from shooting people (Volga and Tundra).

The guns get dirty *wayyyy* too fast. You're telling me that 2 mags and my Kalash is already jamming? This is a very bad way to encourage stealth/collecting resources, because you're heavily gimped in forced combat encounters.

Finally - the enemies. They're way too tanky. Ranger mode is supposed to be 1 shot 1 kill. 1 shotgun hit, 2 rifle hits or 1-2 revolver hits and they're biting the dust....or in 2033 and Last Light that is. In this game for -whatever- reason, even if you get up close with a SHOTGUN, it might not be a one shot kill. a s h o t g u n. Rifles are pretty much useless unless  you're specifically going for headshots, but enemies can both dish it out and take it. Now, enemies that kill you in just a few shots wouldn't be an issue if not for the aformentioned bullet-sponge  problem, so what ends up happening is that your enemies are walking tanks while Artyom is a wet tissue.  And GOD don't get me started on the Humanimals. Cliffnotes - they're basically  the ghouls from Fallout 4...but without the interesting lore,  variety (Ferals, Glowing Ones, Sentient) or attack speed. They're just..kinda shambling zombies, It wouldn't be a problem if these fuckers didn't appear in every single location like a scripted Call of Duty gunfight, and couldn't throw bricks. Seriously if they're dumb enough to be shambling on all fours why are they able to chuck stuff at you? They're uninspired and annoying to deal with.

I don't hate this game, I just think it's very flawed. If both S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Metro, both games made by pretty much the same people can figure out their difficulties, then I don't see why this game can't

misc. ranting for the fun of it  lol.

The lighter flame no longer shows you  where your objective is (bummer).

Replacing the gas-mask filter is way too quick, in 2033 it  felt like something you had to do while alone or in cover because it took a few seconds, here it's like 0.3 seconds.

Artyom's bones must have partially melted from the radiation because he somehow manages to get damaged by falling off a small platform

He also seems to have developed asthma as he cannot sprint for more than 5 seconds and at a much lower speed.

Having a separate slot for your Tikhar *and* being able to craft ammo for it in the field is just too busted. It was already useful in 2033 (Being one of two only truly silent weapons).

Weapon variety is lacking, Sure you can *basically* make weapons from attachments (long barrel and drum mag for RPK, Box Mag for Saiga, etc.), But I also would have loved to see some more coventional weapons, it's not too farfetched to think that you found some post-russian equipment on your journey.

I miss the pseudo-P90 top loading mag of the Kalash-2012. The Bulldog is just an ugly-looking generic bull-pup (I don't hate bull-pups, i just think this one is ugly with all of the welding shit all over)",1704401332,1704401332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

so many things for the player to go discover and do (if wanted) in each of the missions. The karma system forces you to think your actions through especially if you want your crew in one piece by the end of the game. (sorry duke, that one was on me.)

The finale to one of the best series I have played. All and all this game kept all of the things the Metro series held to be known for, such as the immersive gameplay, realistic apocalyptic setting, and high quality cinematic cuts. This game took all that to the next next level and ended perfectly. For the money, if you bought this game full price, you won't be dissapointed, but on sale, an even better steal. I recommend playing the first 2 games first, to know the full story, but if you decided to just jump into this game, it could work as a story on its own, and you would not know it.

(Edit 01/02/2024)
Let me give a brief summary of the game cause I feel like I didn’t do it justice
METRO EXODUS
it’s like S.T.A.L.K.E.R but not

Story
you play Artyom who is a mute but also isn’t really mute, he talks in the loading cutscenes and has tons of special dialog for what you did as Artyom.
In the start of the game you are trying to look for other people since once on Artyom’s radio he heard a different faction talking to other people, Anna (Artyom’s wife) comes along one time to show Artyom there isn’t anyone left since everyone got nuked HARD (due to the war). When the weather gets bad in Moscow, you and Anna start running back home but see a train moving by and it shocks the both of you, a car comes up to you and tells you get in so they can catch up to the train, turns out they aren’t friendly and knock you out. Your stuck in their base and you break free only to break the radioprotecter, your commanding officer shows up out of no where to tell you he has been working with them to keep Moscow safe amongst everyone (basically playing dead) and now that YOU broke the radioprotecter Moscow is back into the war, 
You steal a train to find some higher power commanding officers to get info about the war and turn the radioprotecter back on.
(This is just two hours of the story out of 20ish hours)

Moral
In this game you are given a moral meter for whoever you kill, even if they are shooting you. The game likes to give options for stealth and highly encourages it but some stealth sections is more painful than shooting everyone in the head. This does affect many aspects of the game from dialog to characters, but not everyone causes moral to go down so you can still shoot some bad guys.

Combat
I feel like the combat is sorta lacking but thats because I sorta like close ranged combat and the game gives almost no options for that other than V(the knife/gun), but you are given MANY options for long ranged combat, from making you pistol into a shotgun or turning your AK to a sniper rifle.

Bugs
The game is sorta cheap for a reason and that because the game can be very buggy at times, I honestly enjoyed the bugs since it affected your movement rather than just insta-kills you and just makes you feel like your playing CS;GO serf map, the bugs that do affect your gameplay majorly are quite rare from my play-through and were quite annoying but it was easy to fix.

Maps
You are given three maps that are open world, the swamp, the desert and the forest. All of these maps are fairly fun to be around except for the desert which gets old fast, the last map is more linear and gives you a straight forward path but still fun.

Stealth
At some points it’s a waiting game and others matters how much patience you have, I don’t really like the stealth in this game (and in the forest level near the end it sucks) but I guess if you want go for it.

Rating

I'd probably have thumbed down if I had paid full price for this. And I'm glad I didn't upgrade GPU just to play  the enhanced version.

Scripted sequences became tedious to sit and wait through. I don't remember watching one that I enjoyed and didn't just want it to hurry up and end. Most of it felt like filler.
Not a single fun quick time event. Every single one was tedious, irritating, and immersion breaking. But none were more irritating than how helplessly unable to defend himself this ""warrior"" ""survivor"" is in multiple scenarios like when he is squeezing between doors or simply opening a door, and in no way was able to simply be ready and you are forced into a quicktime event.
I've never more appreciated being able to make a macro to auto press for quicktime events.
Player character never talks during gameplay, yet talks during mission load screen. This made his voice disorienting finally hearing it after the character is just voiceless during gameplay.
It's frustrating having no way to respond to people calling you on the radio asking for you to acknowledge. Seems like a carry over from the character never talking. The way this is dealt with from the character lines felt contrived.
Player character's physical capabilities are silly and immersion breaking, like how slow and clunky his crawling was.
Going into the water being mostly just a death event was irritating and immersion breaking.
That van ride towards the end with that anticipation music was boring. That kind of stuff in the game, boat rides and whatnot, felt like filler to bump the total hours of the campaign.
The monster and boss encounters felt like filler.

Let me start by saying I love the Metro series. 2033 and Last Light were amazing, and both ran flawlessly too. So I was really excited to play Exodus when it finally came to Steam. I was thoroughly enjoying it until all the crashing began. It started crashing in the Volga level, but would only happen rarely. However, in the following levels, the game began crashing to desktop more and more frequently, and at random times. I tried some of the solutions I found on the internet such as updating video drivers, updating Windows, lowering gfx settings, closing any monitoring software, disabling any overclocking, disabling hairworks, etc. The only solution I refused to try is switching from DX12 to 11. The game looks beautiful on DX12, so why should I reduce the graphic fidelity just because the developers couldn't get it together for the PC port? It's a real shame too, because I was really enjoying this game; it looks beautiful, and the story and immersion are great. But constantly worrying if your progress will get erased tends to completely ruin any immersion this game had going.  I can't get involved when I know a crash is right around the corner. I know it's not my system because no other games do this. Everything else runs perfectly. I am really disappointed in this game as it stands, and I am sad that I probably won't continue playing it, despite really enjoying it so far. It is just unplayable at this point. Dealing with crashing every 20-30 minutes just isn't fun; especially when sometimes it completely hard locks my computer and I need to reboot. 

So as it stands, I can't leave a positive recommendation in its current state. If 4A gets their act together and fixes this flawed port, I will change my review. I don't mean to sound like a whiny entitled gamer brat, but when you pay money for a game, it should at least be playable. 

EDIT: Ok Now I've hit a progress halting bug in the Caspian level. At the lighthouse after you kill all the guards a character is supposed to send a lift down...welp, not in my save, I guess. She just stands up there in the lighthouse doing nothing. Reloading saves does nothing. Apparently this is a well known bug that is a year old with no solution other than replaying the entire level and hoping it works. Well I can say I will not be doing that. If the devs can't be arsed to fix a glitch that's been reported for over a year now, then I can't be arsed to finish the game. That's the nail in the coffin for me.

The first one is New Game Plus (NG+) bug with My Weapon mutation. When Yermak gives you a gun, you won't have any guns at all. What should happen is that you get all three guns from your previous playthrough. The solution is to turn off Steam Cloud or play on Offline Mode. The second bug is on the Caspian and connected to Giul's Lighthouse. If you go loud and the bandits, Giul will bug out and look into the distance. She is supposed to lower the boat so you can get up. It happened on my Ranger Hardcore and my save has already overwritten to the lighthouse and I had to restart chapter. In ranger Hardcore, you can't manually save. It sucked so much. I have completed Iron Mode and it is worse than Ranger Hardcore by having no saves at all (no manual and auto, only saves between levels), it sucks so much. Sometimes the game crashes in random time, maybe due to my hardware no reallly strong. Still.. I don't know why anyone thought this is fun.
Aside from all of those, it is a great game. Great story, great characters, and great settings. I got attached to them through the story, and felt really bad when going through the negative moral playthrough and seeing the consequences. I don't really like open world stuff in general because I don't know where to start, but it is not bad in this game. Not really empty and not stuffed either, and there is guidance in where to go (I don't know how I will feel with Elden Ring).
Edit: I have played the DLCs. The Two Colonels is great. I would say more because it would be spoilers. Sam's Story is good with more open world stuff. I love Sam & Captain's interaction in the Captain's hideout, very funny.",1703683916,1703782318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I could have bare all of these bad gameplay experience if this game has a good story to tell, but sadly, this game's storytelling was SO BAD and CRINGY. During the first 2 hours of the game, the cutscene takes up nearly 1 hour of them, and mostly they are just talking about stupid and childish nonsense.

Nvidia RTX2080 8Giga.

+No crashes,no game freezing or black screen but i found kinda strange problem when you take pic by F12 and send it to friend you Cant write to steam chat on some time:)
+Graphic page is awesome but iam not sure why you need download extra 70+ giga as enchanced version.
And FPS are not that stable as on standard game.
+Story is great too as FPS action game/survival/horror sometimes.
+Price is great in sale,8E to get 27Hours with 2 DLCs.
+Very well done other world parts not always frozen Moscow but dunes,forest,swamps..all looks great.
+Sometimes game can be creepy,specially on end.

-Uhm...too good game?
-Maybe forest part can be bigger it feels soo fresh be outside.

Sams story DLC.
I really recommend play/buy this DLC you play as typical American with sense of humor also you get drunk with Russian and monster,what more you want hear?

Two Colonels DLC.
This one is kinda boring and meh,yes it give you great story end but most of DLC play time is about talking a lot and filling holes in story.

 Maybe many players do not like opened areas to not fit to classic Metro style but i found enjoying explore new places and feeling fredom.
I really recommend buy Gold Edition its worth time and money.
Also i found i make tons of pics from game,creepy places,monsters,Anna,worls etc.
Really F12 friendly game!

Pro tip:Standard AK is best,good all around weapon,just change barrel to short/long depend on situation.
Pro tip 2:I highly recommend on start use shotgun it never jam and it still punch hard,later you get 4 barrels!

- Looking at the open areas, quite a few locations are nailed, hella atmospheric. 
- The linear parts are very good, Metro quality.
- The music is good.
- The UI being your backpack is lit.
- Graphics are nice i guess.

Cons:
- Hella boring dialogues.
- The open world is terrible. It feels like an empty map most of the time.
- NPCs are incredibly stupid.
- NPCs shooting/seeing me through walls a million times.
- Mutants clipping through obstacles to hurt me.
- The bugs... Jesus Christ. I can't count the times I died due to being stuck in the ground and similar. People noticing me through walls.

I can't bring myself to recommend this game. The previous two had vision, this one feels like the marketing team slapped open world and open end on an idea that some actually competent people had.

First off, I love the game play. I love how it's open world to a point but still has a mission-based campaign. I personally found this very enjoyable. The world in this game is also really cool, it was crafted very well and a lot of backstory is put into it. I haven't fully played the first two metro games but I know of them (probably should have played them in order to better understand the characters). With that in mind, even not knowing the full backstory, I was able to piece together Artyom's relationship with the others, and found that they were quite good. The monsters and npc's are all pretty cool. Except when you look at them in the notes section in-game. They have some weird a s s names ngl. = 

Now onto the bad. The game constantly would freeze-crash, and I was unable to alt+f4 and/or task manager, end task. This would result in me having to restart my pc. Although this was fixed by lowering the graphics, turning on v-sync and tinkering, it was still hella annoying restarting my pc up to 4 times in a span of 10 minutes. 

Now what I personally disliked about this game is the dialogue. It was just so weird, sometimes the dialogue felt like it was straight out of ""The Room"". Overlapping and just being the most generic a s s dialogue I've heard. It was also hard considering Sam's voice (Steve Blum) was just his regular voice. The whole time I was questioning whether or not he was supposed to be American or if it was a half-a s s job at a Russian accent, which couldn't be possible as I know Steve Blum is an amazing voice actor. Also considering that the dialogue was mostly optional just felt out of place. I lost a lot of the story since I just went off to do more important things. Other than that there were a few minor annoyances but that's just me. 

Overall the game was a fun play, but I probably won't be playing it again for a very long time.",1703367493,1703455281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Completed the whole thing in 17 hours or there about. Would have liked to see more side quests and exploration in open world.

I find the cinematics a bit long winded and they tend to get in the way of game-play to the point where I quit the game and went and made coffee instead, but I guess its the only way to maintain the narrative throughout.

Graphics are good
Game play is tight in-between the odd crash here and there.
Did I mention it crashes a lot
Oh and by the way it crashes.
Just in case you didn't know.. It crashes just when things get interesting.

Other than that, quite enjoyable but far too short.

Graphics 8/10
Game Play 8/10
Cinematics 4/10 (too longwinded)
Game stability 2/10

Overall, enjoyable but not as good as I was hoping for.

Update
--------

Bought the DLC's again disappointingly short. 

Thankfully they were on offer, I certainly wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for them.

As for the two Colonels chapter; far too much cinematics and no where near enough game play.

Its still a good game but not without issues and while the story is quite good its just not long enough or enough side quests to keep it entertaining. Its a one time deal, unlikely I'll play this again for another year.

-Everything's great, couldn't list all see for urself
-The upgrade of the train from just a runaway train to the whole home mobile/HQ/base on track (wutever ya called)
-Some small cool activities like listen to music/broadcast on radio to play guitar, drink a booze cup, take a smoke with some crew guy or enjoying the view outside, read diaries/journals, to lovebirds time with Anna
-The developing of the crew
-OST, BGM dope!
-Girls character model design is pretty nice, especially Anna
-Last human enemy surrender feature, gunsmith are cool
+Dislikes:
-If ya forget to take back the night vision in The Taiga map ya will can't use it the maps later
-Half of the main game you just sneak around human enemies to get good karma to get good ending
-No manual save but at least have quick save
-Can't replay chapter when haven't finish the first playthrough
-Voice acting is well done but need some improvement, NPCs swearing, b!tching is damn good and clearly lmfao
-Some bugs, some crashes, some screen freezes during main game Artyom's journey and a little in Sam's Story, guess it's probably bcuz open-world, loading many things with graphic

Looks amazing considering it came out in the first quarter of 2019

VERY little story after the first part

In this particular one, it evolved significantly, starting from the graphics (which are amazing), to the gameplay, implementing the option to improve weapons, suits and masks at will, giving an innovative experience in regards to the saga.
The main story has ten missions and two endings of the player's choice. I recommend playing the dlcs, especially ""The Two Colonels"" since it is really worth it.
Although Metro Exodus takes place on the surface, I would have liked the game to be more intuitive, that is, among other things, having the ability to climb anywhere to be able to fully explore within reason and not be limited by this.

Exploring, interacting, doing side missions, all worth it in the end because of the engineered dialogues and scripted behaviors of the people(NPCs) around you. Whether they forgive you or want to attack you and give up, or because you did something that benefitted them like not kill people from a group they identify with, among other things. The way you interact with the world carries weight in determination of events unfolding as Artyom proceeds in his journey and you play in this world.

I fell in love with all the characters in the story but if you speedrun through this game and not pay attention to the dialogue heavy scenes then you may not feel the same way since it'll be tough to be influenced into having feelings for the characters, to make a connection, if you zone out on what they say or don't choose to listen. So take your time and stay and listen. There's so much dialogue and information shared between the characters in this universe. If you hear anyone speak just stay around them so you hear what they have to say, it was always very interesting how the NPCs interact with one another. I've never played a 3d fps game as rich in scripted conversation between NPCs as what I experienced in this game and part of that is because of the bond I formed with every single crew member in the exodus toward clear skies, and also characters in their respective locations. A huge chance of the player being emotionally invested in the characters is if the characters are written with care and thought and I think 4A Games did an incredible job at this!

4A Games retained the Metro feel and made it open world and it's marvelous. If you explore enough of the several open world locations you have a good chance of upping your readiness in the form of gear all to your advantage against the wildlife and dangers of enemy monsters in the form of human beings. The wild life is dangerous, icky or innocent, or all three combined because this is not only your world it's every survivor's world and also every new genetically altered lifeform's birth world too.

The world detail of Metro Exodus and atmosphere it creates is next level. If the graphics look this good on the non-Enhanced Edition I can't wait to see what the fourth Metro game will look like.

I'm so glad I played this game. Please play it if you are looking for a first person action adventure game that really takes you somewhere you have never been before, and leaves afterthought.(And play the DLC!)",1703121001,1703121001,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

He got so bad he went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the Feds decided that best idea was to get rid of him so they set up a special room to kill him, as inhumane as possible. And he sat there in agony for hours until he died. Now every week on the day of his death he returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00 a.m. He creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by pegging you and watching you bleed to death.

Not a fun game either 

It drags way too much , the story is boring past a certain point ...
The interface is designed poorly
Anything happening at the work bench can become tedious and just plain frustrating

Oh and it lack subtility , all the characters are way too cliche

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1702903856,1702903856,True,0,1,0.34161493182182312,0,True,False,False

- Stunning visuals and environment design. The image of Novosibirsk, it's grandour really gives the deep feeling of a ghost town.
- Original gameplay elements
- Minimal reliance on HUD, player interactions feel extremely organic
- You get to drive a railed cart
- The Sam's Story DLC is even better than the main campaign

Con:
- You get punished (bad ending) not picking stealth, in a game that has subpar stealth mechanics.
- Sometimes can be unbalanced, no strategic way to approach a larger enemy

Overall, I think this definitely worth buying and playing. Does it live up to the previous titles? Gameplay and design-wise, yes. From a story perspective? I don't know.",1702802632,1702803021,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't run the enhanced version of Exodus with my hardware, so I can't comment to say if it looks much better or not, but the assets aren't of what I would call amazingly high quality. That said, damn do they do a fantastic job with them. Regardless of the level of detail or quality in their assets, they utilize them in a spectacular manner, and there's many, many screenshot-worthy moments in this game.

Definitely has that ""Metro"" vibe, and oppressive feel, and I was shocked at how well they did the ""open world"" stuff, as I usually find most open world type games boring.

Being so heavily scripted also robs you of any replay value. You're limited in how you can solve problems or get through areas, because you're forced to move through the maps along a predefined route, like in a haunted house attraction. I also find the controls confusing. I got some throwing knives, and would expect them to be available in one of the numeric slots, like any other weapon, but they're not. The co-op with your NPC allies is also a nuisance, as they try to pave the way for you through the storyline, nagging you to ""push the button"" that is right in front of them, because at least you get to do that.

Without spoiling, Metro Exodus expands the world of the Metro unlike any of the other two titles in the series. The unique crafting system and the wide range of weapons that you can make, and the means that you can use to engage the enemy (both human and non-human) are arguably the best in the entire trilogy. Most of the same enemies in the franchise do return, and Exodus gives you an extremely well-balanced way to handle them as long as you build your loadouts correctly for the situation.

If you want more Metro, Exodus is definitely it. This is the single biggest Metro experience you will ever have if you've been craving more of it. Exploring entire maps and doing all the side missions and the campaign story objectives took me several days, and it was engaging and fun every step of the way. The only real gripe I had with the game is that the crafting system could be a little bit better explained, as it can be a little confusing for new players to figure out.

Metro Exodus plays a lot differently than Last Light or 2033, and the environments are GIGANTIC, so be prepared to run around a lot and go a lot of different places.

Graphics: ★★★★★ 
Metro Exodus showcases a significant leap in graphical fidelity compared to its predecessors. The game's environments are breathtaking, ranging from the hauntingly beautiful post-apocalyptic landscapes to the detailed interiors of makeshift settlements. Dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and realistic lighting contribute to an immersive visual experience that elevates the Metro series to new heights.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆ 
Metro Exodus maintains the series' signature blend of first-person shooting, survival horror, and atmospheric exploration. The addition of semi-open world environments introduces a new level of freedom, allowing players to tackle objectives in a more non-linear fashion. The variety of weapons and the emphasis on resource management contribute to a tense and strategic gameplay experience.  

Story: ★★★★★ 
The narrative in Metro Exodus continues the compelling story of Artyom and his companions as they journey across the post-apocalyptic Russian landscape. The well-developed characters, moral choices, and the exploration of the Metro's rich lore create a narrative that is both engaging and emotionally resonant. The evolving relationships among the characters add depth to the storytelling.  

Soundtrack: ★★★★★ 
The atmospheric and evocative soundtrack of Metro Exodus complements the desolate beauty of its world. The music, combined with ambient sounds and the haunting cries of mutated creatures, enhances the immersive experience. The attention to detail in the audio design contributes to the overall sense of isolation and tension.  

Level Design: ★★★★☆ The semi-open world design introduces a refreshing change to the Metro series. Each environment feels distinct, featuring a mix of urban ruins, frozen landscapes, and desolate wilderness. The level design encourages exploration, and the dynamic nature of the world, including day-night cycles and weather changes, adds depth to the gameplay.  

Replayability: ★★★☆☆ 
While Metro Exodus offers multiple endings based on player choices, the linear narrative and scripted events may limit replayability for some. However, the variety in approaches to missions and the moral decisions throughout the game may motivate players to experience different outcomes.  

Overall: ★★★★☆
Metro Exodus successfully evolves the Metro series, delivering a visually stunning and emotionally charged experience. With its engaging narrative, atmospheric world design, and strategic gameplay mechanics, it stands as a worthy addition to the post-apocalyptic saga. While some series purists may miss the confined spaces of the metro tunnels, the expansion into a more open world proves to be a welcome and refreshing change for the franchise.",1702628765,1702628765,True,11,1,0.624615907669067383,0,True,False,False

Alright, before you get mad, let me explain. The graphic, mechanics and gameplay are hugely improved in this one. But two greatest turn off for me are; NARRATIVE and LEVEL DESIGN.

- NARRATIVE - : Boy, where do i start, the narrative is such a convoluted clusterf**k, the dialogues are presented like a goddamn thesis. Too many infodumping unlike the first two where we learn the world through observations and actions of its characters. In Exodus, however, the plot is soo divided with barely any smooth connections in between. Te first train mission was great, but things started to spiral down as we go from Moscow. All of characters that are not even significant to Artyom are introduced. I'm ok with Katya, her kid and first engineer dude, but after Volga, IDGAF to almost everyone, like this one schizo admiral guy in Taiga. Giul was ok i thought she's cool but she's still useless to bigger narrative. And man, how much I hate Anna as the story goes. The only narrative design that I think is decent is short transit in Yamantau where we dont need much words to explain the horror that happened in that base.

- LEVEL DESIGN -: I'm thinking on uninstalling this after SECOND bear fight. It's just soo uncreative, so boring and souless. 90% of the game are about hiding, sneaking and infiltrating. You're not given freedom of playstyles unless you want the bad endings. The open world mechanic is such a drawback and poorly executed, which essentially removed the desolate atmosphere and claustrophobic survival vibe that I love so much about Metro. I thoroughly disappointed by Exodus playstyle direction after the previously two masterpieces.

Now, if you're not fan of metro, you prolly like it, 7/10-8/10 most probably if you cant ignore clunky a** movement. But if you're planning to play it because you like the first two story and atmosphere, you should carefully consider my words.",1702573465,1702574094,False,12,1,0.470406413078308105,0,True,False,False

Exploring these worlds at your own pace is really satisfying. The mixture of linear and sandbox worked well. It was a nice change after the last two games in the cramped Metro. 

Scanning the area with your Binos and then heading out to explore kept me interested the most. The environmental story telling is where it shines combined with a few good set pieces. The day night cycle + weather affects were flipping awesome too. At one point a huge electrical storm rolled over as I was climbing a crane in the Volga level which was atmospheric as hell. 

Still as a whole I'm not sure where I stand on this one in the series, because it felt so different. It got raving reviews which in some cases it deserved but not all. 

The controls are quite ''floaty'' and need some work. Artyom flies down stares and over bumps like he's attached to a pair of roller skates. (Which was annoying)

The story takes place over the course of a year but it feels kind of disjointed. The voice acting can be average at times and personally I think it's story was a bit overrated. If I remember correctly the original Metro 2033 took place over 7 - 8 days it total and the cohesion as such was better with a very clear goal throughout. 

Most encounters play out the same way, shoot people or don't shoot people. So they haven't really pushed the envelope there. Mutants feel samey and less threatening that previous titles. The human chameleon chaps you fight are ridiculous. With all these new areas I was hoping for new monsters and better iterations. 

The animation also seemed to be a bit more janky. (Looking at you flying gargoyle things). Once I've upgraded my rig in a few years time I'll come back to it.",1702242446,1702242446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Starting by the visuals, it is absolutely stunning, with lots of diverse environments (something I've missed in the original series, but that's not a con, considering it made sense with the previous plots).
- It has the BEST character development of all the games. All the characters from Metro Exodus feels like family, you grow attached to them. Their stories, personalities, backgrounds, everything was better constructed in Metro Exodus.
- I've played the original game and both the DLCs, and all the endings are beautiful, it's almost ridiculous. I'm a grown man and for the first time in ages I've shed a tear in the end of ""The Two Colonels"" DLC.
- Lots of side dialogues between NPCs. Really. Lots. If you try to listen it all, the game will get tiresome, too much information. Listen to some, pass anothers, play it in your own time, and in a future playthrough, listen to the others (there's a lot that you will surely miss in the first playthrough)

There's two cons, however, that bothered me during the game:

- Sometimes the game just crashes between levels. It's not a serious problem considering it autosaves frequently, but it can become annoying to reopen the game every time after you finish a level. And for some reason, if you have NVidia instant record enabled, it will ALWAYS crash between levels, so you gotta play with it disabled, or only enable it after the level already started.
- Some FPS drops in places that makes no sense to have it. In the big cities I've managed to get used to these drops, it made sense considering the amount of details in-screen, but there was also some stutterings in closed places with not really much happening. A little bit unoptimized in that aspect, but it's nothing so serious that it will make your game unplayable, as long as you have a decent setup (medium tier+)",1702183305,1702183305,True,2,0,0.529276728630065918,0,True,False,False

While Metro Exodus improves on the world and making it an open world exploration sandbox, i believe that the developers steered too far away from what they have titled their games.  You spend very little time for the majority of the game outside of the metro and more time outside which is what gave the old games such a good atmosphere.

The inventory system has been further improved from it's predecessors and weapons still feel good and true to the older games which i like. Soundtracks are also stellar just like all other metro games, with Metro Last Light having the best soundtracks by far out of the franchise.

The moral system in this game is FAR better than the older games, most notably Last Light. 
Last Light made the player play in a very specific way where one bad decision could well mean that you'd ruin your good ending, however in Metro Exodus the game is MUCH more forgiving which allows the player to make their own decisions (good or bad) while still having a good opportunity to get the good ending.

Minimum specs for the game are quite accurate but i'd recommend a 1650 for a more stable experience.

When I embarked on my gaming journey with ""Epic Odyssey,"" I had high expectations. After all, this title had garnered praise from players and critics alike across the internet. As I delved into this epic adventure, it didn't take long for me to realize that these expectations were not only met but exceeded in ways that I couldn't have imagined.

From the moment I stepped into the sprawling world of ""Epic Odyssey,"" I was immediately struck by its breathtaking beauty. The landscapes were awe-inspiring, each meticulously designed to transport players to a realm of fantasy and wonder. Whether I was exploring dense, mystical forests or scaling towering mountain peaks, every corner of the game world felt like a work of art.

Character creation is where my personal journey truly began. The ability to customize my protagonist's appearance, abilities, and background allowed me to craft a character that felt uniquely mine. This level of personalization created an emotional connection between me and my character, making me deeply invested in their growth and choices throughout the game.

The combat system in ""Epic Odyssey"" is an absolute joy to experience. It seamlessly blends real-time action with strategic elements, offering a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. I appreciated the flexibility it provided, allowing me to choose between adrenaline-fueled battles or a more calculated approach. This adaptability ensured that the game appealed to a wide range of gamers, regardless of their preferred playstyle.

However, it's the game's narrative that truly stole my heart. ""Epic Odyssey"" weaves a complex, non-linear storyline that allows players to shape their own destinies through a series of choices and consequences. The branching narrative ensures that no two playthroughs are the same, compelling me to replay the game multiple times to explore different outcomes and moral dilemmas.

The characters I encountered throughout my journey were equally captivating. Each NPC felt meticulously crafted, their stories and personalities adding depth and authenticity to the game world. Whether they were enigmatic allies or formidable adversaries, I found myself eagerly anticipating each interaction to uncover their secrets and motivations.

Visually, ""Epic Odyssey"" is nothing short of a masterpiece. The attention to detail in every aspect of the game is astonishing, and it's evident that the developers poured their hearts and souls into creating a visually stunning experience. From the shimmering waters of crystal-clear lakes to the intricate architecture of ancient ruins, every pixel felt like a labor of love.

The game's soundtrack deserves its own accolades. The music effortlessly sets the tone for each scene, enhancing the emotional immersion. Whether it's the stirring orchestral melodies during epic battles or the hauntingly beautiful tunes that accompany moments of reflection, the music heightened my overall experience.

I was particularly impressed by ""Epic Odyssey's"" commitment to inclusivity and representation. The game features a diverse range of characters, backgrounds, and relationships, reflecting the richness of the real world. This progressive stance resonated with me, and I believe it sets a positive example for the gaming industry as a whole.

As I became more engrossed in the game, I couldn't help but seek out the online community surrounding ""Epic Odyssey."" It was heartwarming to see players from diverse backgrounds come together to share their experiences, theories, and fan art. The sense of camaraderie and shared enthusiasm within the player base only added to my appreciation for the game.

Of course, no game is without its flaws, and ""Epic Odyssey"" is no exception. Some players have noted that the game's initial learning curve can be steep. However, I firmly believe that this challenge is part of what makes the game so rewarding. It encourages players to invest time and effort into mastering its mechanics, ultimately making the experience more satisfying.

Occasional bugs or glitches have been a source of frustration for some players. While these technical issues are not uncommon in the gaming world, it's worth mentioning that the developers of ""Epic Odyssey"" have been diligent in addressing these problems through regular updates and patches, which speaks to their commitment to the player community.

In conclusion, my personal journey with ""Epic Odyssey"" has been nothing short of extraordinary. This game has exceeded my expectations in every way, from its breathtaking visuals and deep narrative to its inclusive approach and engaging combat system. While it may have a few minor imperfections, they pale in comparison to the grandeur of the adventure that awaits players.

Just finished Metro Exodus, and I gotta spill the beans. This game is one wild trip through the post-apocalyptic wilderness.

Graphics? Holy smokes, they're jaw-dropping. The attention to detail in the wasteland and creepy tunnels? Top-notch. You'll find yourself stopping just to soak it all in.

Storyline? Buckle up! It's a rollercoaster of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll definitely freak out when things go bump in the dark. The narrative grabs you and doesn't let go.

Gameplay? Stealth or guns blazing, the choice is yours. The freedom to explore adds a layer of excitement. You'll scavenge for resources and feel the adrenaline as mutants lurk around every corner.

And the characters? They feel like real people, not just pixels on a screen. You'll get attached, so be prepared to ride the emotional rollercoaster.

Minor bugs? Yeah, every game has them, but they're like that one weird friend—weird but lovable.

In a nutshell, Metro Exodus is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece. If you dig immersive stories, stunning visuals, and intense gameplay, give it a go. It's a wild ride from start to finish",1701591817,1701591817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Top quality graphics, an interesting story that changes for good or bad depending on your actions, snappy gun play, simple but rewarding looting and crafting and a truly unique and varied but brutal world combine to deliver a rare gem.

I found Metro 2033 to be a fun game but couldn't get into it and never finished it, Exodus improves upon the first two games in every way. Whether you're tip toeing around religious fanatics that worship a giant mutated catfish on the Volga River or brutally murdering Mad Max inspired slavers on the dried up shores of the Caspian Sea Exodus always manages to keep you enthralled.

Both DLC's are also a great addition with their own standalone stories. Clearing out filth infested metro tunnels genuinely makes your skin crawl while fighting through a port in Ukraine to reach a submarine manages to make you truly feel like a post apocalyptic warrior.

There are many opportunities to complete side quests and explore areas off the mission's path. Exodus does a great job of developing characters and you will truly care about what happens to each of them. I will say that this is the buggiest game I have played in quite some time. Interact with a door and walk forward too soon? Stuck in the wall. Drive too fast and bump a guard rail? Stuck on the rail. Jump on a boulder without the interaction to climb up it? Glitch against the wall. All of these bugs result in you reloading your last save. If you were diligent, maybe your're reset 30 seconds. If not and you're unlucky with the last autosave, it could be 5 or 10 minutes back. The customization in your equipment feels great. Being able to craft out of your backpack is fantastic. Enemies are diverse, threatening, and horrifying. Some of these encounters will truly have you squirming or leaning forward as your sprint to safety. I loved the twists in the story and the freedom to choose how to deal with the heads of each faction. Stealth is another area that I have a problem with. If one enemy spots you for a split second, the entire camp will know you're exact location and be aware of you. Even if you kill the enemy immediately, before they can yell and expose you, the entire camp is aware. This is really frustrating because often times enemies are bunched up in the stealth areas. My final gripe is about the juggernauts. They're few and far between, but the fights can become extremely drawn out if you do not dispatch them with Molotovs and shots to their exposed wrists. The first one you encounter is without explanation so I wasted a lot of time and ammo discovering his weakness. Unique, but an unrealistic bullet sponge that seems out of place compared to the rest of the enemies. Overall, the game is awesome and well worth the price tag.

While there may not be as many interesting gameplay encounters from one open world to the next, its hard to deny that the art department and gameplay designers put a lot of time crafting a unique vision for how the game immerses you into its world. Still, kinda sad that some of the gameplay elements predate 9 year old games at the time.",1701183678,1701183678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can confirm that the story and presentation are less linear and has less of the carefully crafted and curated sequences that the previous games offered. Despite that, I will say this game is still a good entry in the series and is worth checking out.

It starts off a little slow but then very quickly picks up and really shines when it throws you into the first open world level (there are multiple, and the game journeys through all of them which helps keep things fresh). Its fun adjusting to the world and learning all the things you can do; like crafting, scavenging for supplies, getting weapons and attachments and much more. The fun kinda slows down in the halfway point of the game as it's repetitive and formulaic nature starts to really show, but it thankfully wraps up the game with a really strong final mission.

Overall its a very good game with a beautiful story and characters. Definitely worth picking up on sale, as it often goes for a bargain.",1701152020,1701152020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The conclusion to the Metro trilogy, Metro Exodus, was a huge leap over the previous games not just in gameplay but in story and other facets of the game as well. I could tell that this was the vision for the series ever since the first game dropped 10 years ago. It far exceeded expectations and delivered one of the best narratives in gaming history. 

Story: The story picked up just a year after the 2nd game's good ending. Where Artyom, our protagonist, having conquered the Dark Ones and the Metro politics in the previous games, is in search of other survivors of the war. What went down just within just the prologue of the game was probably one of the best plot twists in recent history. It expanded not just the lore and current story but also the way how the game played. After its amazing prologue, the story, over the course of many chapters, then perfectly encapsulated desperation and hopelessness in its narrative which I didn't expect due to how it differs in setting from the previous games. Although the ending was quite predictable, it fit the overall themes of the story. It also included two amazing DLCs which focused on two different aspects of the game. Two Colonels which focused on the narrative brings the gameplay back to its roots and delivered probably one of the best DLCs I've ever played and Sam's Story which focused more on the gameplay to be your typical shooter. 

Gameplay: Bringing the gameplay to a semi-open world was probably one of the best ideas of the developers. It helped in delivering the narrative and other gameplay adjustments. The day and night adjustments did not just provide visual changes but also gameplay changes wherein you are stealthier at night but there are more monsters. Shelters provided a way to clean equipment, change the time, and replenish health. Although the available weapons decreased, customization saw a huge overhaul with lots of new moving pieces,the disassembly, and cleaning system. Every part has also its downside so you can't make just one super-weapon until the endgame. Dissembling pieces means you have to sacrifice one item for another. You also cannot spam your weapons too much or go to dirty areas as it will affect efficiency. These were welcomed changes because it made players not be too overpowered over the course of the game especially on higher difficulties. Being in an open-world also meant side-quests which added an extra layer to the game. 

Sound & Visuals: The sound design is classic eerie metro but this time its more emphasized from the clank of moving parts to wiping a smudge of blood off your mask and Artyom's heavy breathing. They also fixed the inconsistent volume from the previous games wherein some chapters felt a bit too loud on the ears. Most importantly, the voice acting is now actually proper compared to the previous games where some characters voices did not have any semblance of passion and emotion at all. It also has amazingly good graphics for its current price.

More importantly the story is one of the best i have ever played in any game.

As in many other games Metro Exodus has a few missable Collectables which can be quiet frustrating when you have to redo the entire Chapter and loose hours of gameplay (dont ask  me how i know).
If you want to get all Collectables and Achivements,  there are some very good guides here on Steam.

Also I think they should have transfered the Steam-Achievements from the normal version to the PC-Enhanced-Edition.
I wanted to collect the missing Achivements of the old version when i replay it on a better PC, but when i upgraded i didn't want to miss out on the better Graphics.

Playtime:
I got 89.5 Hours in the original version and did 2x 100% playthroughs and the DLCs once each
At time of writing i did 1x 100% playthrough of the Enhanced Edition and Sam's Story

PS:
If you try to get the Child of forest Achievement, don't do it in Ranger Hardcore i think it is prettey much impossible (or at least i couldn't do it).

I know this Review is a little bit all over the place, but i hope it can give you a few different insights.

412020,151290826,76561198000119661,0,3,1431,0,483,1700825127,"I bought the game yesterday on Steams fall sale and paid $10 CAD. I have very mixed feelings about this game. I played the first game, but not the second one. I like the premise and the look and am really wanting to love it, but man is it aggravating at times. Whether or not you will like it will really depend on what you expect and are looking for. The many positive reviews are likely genuine and show that some players will absolutely love it. I am fairly early in, in the Volga chapter which is your first zone once you leave Moscow. 

Firstly, it's not really billed as primarily a stealth game, but it easily could be. Ammo is severely limited, and even early on it's very easy to be quickly overrun but canine type mutants that will tear you apart easily, or deplete all your ammo to defeat them. It's less of a concern fighting humans as you will loot their ammo, but the hostile wildlife, not so much. I'm on  the second mission of the Volga chapter, ""Get to the Port"". The objective is about half a kilometre from your start location and on my first try I ran into a pack of watchers which used up all my ammo to defeat. I reloaded and tried again and basically had to stealth creep half a km to avoid the rabid mutant canines (watchers). I just finished Cyberpunk 2077 and loved the stealth elements, but I found creeping half a kilometre to be tedious, your mileage may vary.

It can be very unforgiving which brings me to the second point. The save game system is quite limited. While the game is far from ""roguelike"", I would say it has semi-roguelike elements. You are limited to 4 save slots, and auto saves overwrite older saves. What that means is that when I realized I should have explored more on the first Volga mission and wanted to go back to the first mission, I found my early saves were gone. A quick google search revealed that my only option was to restart the chapter. Not too bad given that I was only on the second mission, but would have been really maddening if I was much further in the chapter. This leads to the next point. 

The game is missing many quality of life features that pretty standard in most games of this genre. I was surprised to discover there is no persistent mini-map on the UI. There is a map folder you carry and can open any time to view the entire map, so its not like the game is denying you the utility a mini-map would provide. However the game forces you to press a key to access it, and blocks your view when its open. It looks very nice and realistic, but the novelty of it wore off for me pretty quickly. Bizarrely, it and other functions require a long press of the key. Want to look at the map, long press M, want to open a door or loot something, long press E, want to open your pack, long press I. No idea what the obsession is with long pressing all these hot keys, but is serves no purpose I can see aside from wasting time. 

Another QOL design choice I find weird is that there is no way to skip through NPC dialogues. Given the limited saves option and the need restart an entire chapter to replay a previous mission as mentioned above, it's annoying that I have to sit through lengthy NPC dialogues I have already heard to play a mission over again (and man do these NPCs like to ramble on at great length). They have even made it so that if you alt-tab out of the game it pauses and goes to the main menu screen. You are forced to listen again to what you already heard. I literally restarted the chapter and went an took a dump, which seemed somehow appropriate.

Sometimes omitted QOL features can be fixed with useful mods, but the mod selection for this game is near non-existent. Nexusmods has less that three full pages of mods for this game and nearly all of them are graphical enhancement, re-shader type mods, one is a difficulty changer if you started on the hardest, and two to make Anna prettier and show her boobs (modders are so predictable in that regard). I would definitely have appreciated a mod for a basic persistent mini-map, more save slots and perhaps a greater ammo carry limit. At present I am limited to 90 rounds, so while I could have looted more from the previous mission against humans, I wasn't able to carry more than 90 rounds, easy to blow through fighting 5 watchers. 

The way weapons are portrayed is quick nice. They have a very cool mix of pre-nuclear war AK style rifles and the kind of hand build Fallout style custom stuff you'd expect. They are graphically very pretty, and from what I can see so far are incredible customizable, ie silencer and shoulder stock on the first 3 round revolver, reflex red dot on the AK. I expect I will be able to upgrade the AK's inexplicable 20 round magazine at some point. What I do not like is that they limited you to having only two standard weapons, and one ""special"" weapon. I am very much missing my holy trinity of pistol, shotgun and rifle that I have used in every shooter I have ever played since the 90's, and is literally used in professional and amateur shooting sports known as Three Gun ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-2maNktXKk ). The special weapon I have obtained so far is a souped up BB gun that has some potential and it's main feature is that it uses very cheaply crafted ammo. However at this point it is fairly weak, and requires you to reload both the pellets and the air pressure. It is also not a stealth weapon as it came stock, as it pulled a group of watcher I was trying to thin out are range. It will likely have a silencer upgrade later.

That's enough wall of text for now. I am still glad for the game at $10 and will keep playing it to see where it goes. Depending on what you like and what you're expecting you may love or hate this game.

EDIT

I came back to edit this review and changed it to 'would not recommend'. I am still in Volga but further along since the original review. I am on the mission to get the rail car and it is probably the most frustrating mission I have ever played in 30 years of PC gaming. For the first time in my life I will likely watch a YouTube walk through and pause it every 30 seconds to alt tab into the game and find the objective. I'm an industrial electrician by trade and have worked in many types of factories, rail repair depots and mills. No one would ever lay one out in the ridiculous way that maze is. I know some players will enjoy the experience, but I definitely do not. If you read forums and Reddit threads you'll find a lot more critical feedback than the Steam reviews.",1700736656,1700779389,False,11,0,0.516663193702697754,0,True,False,False

A new mutant type is introduced named 'humanimals'. there are few vehicles you can use in your journey like boat and a small car. there are ziplines. the weather can change and there is a day/night cycle. you can explore sleeping campsites. you can now freely explore the whole map for supplies, ammo and surprises. beautiful graphics and fun gameplay. last soundtrack is really good.

Rating: 10/10

I've never been a fan of story-driven games, but the Metro series, and especially Metro Exodus, touched my heart in ways I never expected. It's not just another game; it's an emotional journey through the Moscow Metro and into the harsh Russian wilderness in search of a new home. that hooked me from the start.

Metro Exodus offers a gripping narrative without feeling overwhelming. It strikes the perfect balance between storytelling and gameplay, making it accessible and engaging even for those like me who typically prefer action over plot.

The characters are well developed, and their relationships evolve throughout the journey. The choices you make carry weight, making you genuinely care about the fate of Artyom and his companions.

Lastly, the graphics and audio are top-notch. The game's visuals are stunning, and the sound design immerses you in the eerie and dangerous world of Metro.

This game proves that even if you're not a fan of story-driven titles, Metro Exodus can convert you. It's a rare gem that transcends genres and offers an unforgettable gaming experience that touched my heart and will stay with me for a long time.

Metro Exodus has a great story, atmosphere and graphics. It borrows some mechanics and ideas from previous Metro games and incorporates them nicely into several semi-open levels, along with some new mechanics like cleaning weapons, crafting items etc. 

It's not without flaws - I've encountered some bugs, including game freezing and floating objects. Floating objects are nothing serious (and rare), but freezing really went on my nerves. It started happening during the ""Caspian Sea"" chapter. Thankfully, the fix was easy - switched from DX12 to DX11 and the freezing issue went away. 

If you're interested in picking up this game and you haven't played previous Metro games, I'd advise you to play them before - it's not mandatory, but Metro universe is really awesome and it would be a shame to skip some (important) parts of it mentioned in previous games.

Final score: 9/10

P.S. DLC's are really good, so if you have the $$$ - pick the Gold edition

EDIT:

I've replayed the game this year, but this time it was the updated ""enhanced"" edition and I haven't encountered previously mentioned issues with crashing. Absolute recommendation.",1583875147,1700647227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: 10/10

""Metro Exodus,"" developed by 4A Games and published by Deep Silver, marks the third installment in the critically acclaimed Metro series, based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novels. Building on the atmospheric and narrative strengths of its predecessors, ""Metro Exodus"" takes players on an immersive, post-apocalyptic journey above and beyond the confines of the Moscow Metro tunnels.

Storyline : 10/10
The narrative of ""Metro Exodus"" is a standout feature, continuing the story of Artyom, the protagonist, as he leads a group of survivors beyond the Moscow Metro in search of a new life. The richly woven tale explores themes of survival, hope, and the consequences of humanity's actions in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse. The characters are compelling, and the narrative is delivered with emotional depth, making every step of the journey resonate with significance.

Gameplay : 10/10
""Exodus"" introduces a semi-open world structure, a departure from the linear corridors of its predecessors. The change is refreshing, allowing for more exploration and environmental diversity without sacrificing the tense, survival-focused gameplay. The blend of stealth, intense gunfights, and resource management remains a highlight, offering a dynamic and engaging experience throughout the vast landscapes.

Graphics and Atmosphere : 10/10
Visually stunning, ""Metro Exodus"" sets a new standard for post-apocalyptic aesthetics. The environments, from the desolate Volga River to the haunting Caspian Sea, are meticulously crafted with attention to detail. Dynamic weather and day-night cycles contribute to an immersive atmosphere that evolves with the story, creating a world that feels alive despite its desolation.

Sound Design : 10/10
The game's sound design is exceptional, enhancing the immersive experience. From the haunting echoes of distant mutants to the subtle creaks of abandoned buildings, every sound contributes to the atmosphere. The musical score complements the emotional beats of the narrative, elevating the overall audio experience.

Survival Elements : 10/10
Survival in ""Metro Exodus"" goes beyond combat, incorporating a day-night cycle, changing weather conditions, and the need to maintain your equipment. Resource scarcity and the constant threat of radiation create a palpable sense of tension, emphasizing the harsh reality of surviving in a world devastated by nuclear war.

Conclusion : 10/10
""Metro Exodus"" stands as a triumph in storytelling and atmospheric game design. Its expansive world, coupled with a compelling narrative and a perfect blend of survival and shooter elements, makes it a defining entry in the post-apocalyptic genre. The emotional journey of Artyom and his companions, set against the backdrop of a beautifully desolate world, creates an unforgettable gaming experience. ""Metro Exodus"" not only surpasses its predecessors but also sets a new benchmark for narrative-driven, atmospheric shooters. For those seeking a captivating and immersive journey through the ruins of humanity, ""Metro Exodus"" is an absolute must-play.",1700441262,1700510028,True,13,1,0.650418519973754883,0,True,False,False

I hope they would have another installment of these game so that I can still see some updates of my Bratukhas!",1700309009,1700309009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't think its worth £45 or an AAA title, very over hyped, graphics are ok but it just seems like a Fallout 4 mod, some of the animations are off and there are lots of glitches.
Playing on maximum settings, some of the graphics in the desert seem a little bland and there are no footprints in the sand or snow when you walk, seems to kind of lack detail in places. 

The character graphics are good, and the forest is ok, I think its more the animations and graphical layout of some areas that seem a little last decade.

I like the gas mask  feature the way you have to utilise it, and keep your gear up together, and there are some nice touches like emergency mask repair with sticky tape, wiping the grime off the mask and changing filters, getting the map out constantly is a bit tedious, even with the wrist compass.

General game play is fine and combat is good, you can't blaze away finding and using cover is recommended. The different weapons are interesting the modding of the weapons and finding different parts is well thought out.

The melee sound is hilariously shit! The sound is the same awful crack no matter what you are hitting, it sounds like they ripped a nut cracker sound using a commodore 64. The rest of in game sounds are fine.

I've seen some bad animations also, monsters attacking other monsters and not actually touching them, but seemingly lifting them up on invisible wires.
Lots of floating objects.
Creatures disappearing through walls.
Shooting at ghouls and had them flat out vanish into thin air in front of me.
Characters all speaking over each others dialog and not looking at you while talking (are you talking to me or him?)
I had someone who's gun was constantly firing, even when on her back.
Enemies stuck in walls.
Enemies able to see you through walls.
For some reason reading the map in a van makes you smash your head through the roof so you have to get out then back in to get the driver view back to normal.
Controlling is also a bit old fashioned, having to jump over tiny ramps because he can't lift his leg over a small step.
I've had less glitches in 300 hrs of Fallout 4 than 12 hours of Metro (which says a lot)

Also it's not very open world like Fallout or Skyrim is with a giant map to explore. It has different zones that you can explore but it tries to push you where to go, and having done some exploring there isn't a lot to discover that isn't map marked.
Some of the zones there is pretty much only one direction to go in which is slightly disappointing.

Because of the lack of dialog boxes I have no idea if an NPC has finished talking, so I just get bored of their waffle and walk off, only then to have to come back.
I got woken up by some thugs after a sleep, had a conversation. When I left they said 'oh going so soon?' So I came back presuming they had more to say, only to all stand around with nothing happening (have you finished?) Left again they said 'going so soon?' So presume that's how that conversation ends - It's not very clear when to leave and they do go on a bit.

The story hasn't really grabbed me and the people need to say their shit quicker, there are some very boring or cheesy wank cut scenes that seem to go really slowly and on for a long time, and some interactive driving - hold W do a bit of steering, none of which adds to the game.

Might be worth checking but don't pay more than £10 for it.

On the dark side of things; I think the game can be played only in one way and there are no meaningful choises.",1699784842,1699784842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my first game in the series. I've met a lot of people in my shoes, exodus just appeals more than the others  for some. Here are some tips that tie into the other games aswell.

HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR PLAYING.

1. Explore every optional objective, and investigate as much as possible. This ties into 3 (And 4 with the optional objectives) because more optional objectives and abandoned ruins explored the more resources, and lore can be unlocked. Make sure maps are fully scavenged!

2. When the game displays ""Save file corrupted,"" take that with a grain of salt. NEVER EVER FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST press that little 'overwrite' button. It probably wont delete your saves, however there's a chance in there that it will. 

3. Make use of your resources. Loot every corpse you find. Resources can be abundant in this game! however, sometimes your luck will run out. Conserve ammunitio, and make sure to clear locations of any goodies that can be manipulated at the workbench. Also, please make medkits, I cannot stress this enough. Deathloops are super easy to fall into, and make sure your weapons are CLEAN. 

4. Make sure to spare some people. I wont spoil anything, however I recommend you spare AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. This includes; Fanatics at the Volga, slaves (Even the mean ones) at the desert, and anyone else who is not 'evil' through the game. Think of it like RDR's honor system. However, unlike red dead the game will change drastically if you take this route. This will keep your favorite crew members alive, and you will reach a better ending.

Anyway, good hunting, Spartan. Welcome to the Metro, enjoy the endless frustration.",1699767395,1699767395,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So i think to myself i will get the enchanced edition, turns out it won't run on my pc, never had had that one before. So after wasting more than 70gb on that i downloaded the normal version, also have some problems but at least the game starts. 5 minutes into the game the game just crashes, not even Bethesda could hope to achieve that. Was in a cutscene where my screen went black and it seemed like it was part of the cutscene, but dialogue still went on, no subtitles and i could pause the game, hear the menu pop up but screen still black. And this all within 30 minutes of starting the game.

Gameplay wise it is not very ""open world"", more like open levels. Once you go to the next area you can't go back. In these areas you need to go from A to B, mostly just running. You can go to other points of interests, like bandit camps and such. The only real reward are equipment upgrades like being able to hold more medkits etc. The monsters or mutants respawn, making it useless to waste your precious bullets on that anoying game aspect. Traveling the map is tedious and boring.

also on a small note there are achievements that are locked behind DLCs

Immersion: Although the world looks stunning, the lighting effects are amazing and the sound design too, all allowing for some really nice stealth gameplay and it allows the player to really chose its tempo, who to kill and who to spare, etc..., But, being that it is now open world game, the iconic feeling of being trapped in cramped metro station hallways and passages is completely lost, with no real benefit, so overall, the whole open world aspect is almost pointless.

Guns: Ammo and attachment crafting is a good plus, but the choice of guns is terrible compared to other 2 games. A lot is removed, and the ones that exist just get boring really fast. 

Enemies: They feel generic. In last 2 games, there were clearly saparated factions, each with its own goals and needs and ways of liiving, which was really cool. In this game, everyone are just in some weird cult and they are all the same when it comes to the bottom line. 

Story: It is decent, but feels so rushed, somehow. I dont know how to feel, the core idea is good I guess, but it could be much better executed

Cutscenes: OH BOY, DO I HATE THEM IN THIS GAME. They are just so anoying and there is no way to skip them. Characters just keep on talking and talking, and you just sit there, literally waiting for them to finish, wanting to smash your PC. And this especially goes for anything that Anna (the in-game character) says, she is so annoying. And all this is 10 worse when you want to backtrack a chapter.

IMPORTANT THING

All these things would be a minor issues, if it was not for the following bug in the game:

At the arround half point in the story, you lose all your loot and guns, but you are supposed to get them back, and you are also suposed to have all old guns and attachemnts saved when acesing the work bench once this whole certain chapter is completed. The problem is: THIS CAN SOMETIMES BE COMPLETELY IGNORED< AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO IT TO CHANGE IT, EXCEPT REPLAY 2 ENTIRE CHAPTERS.

Meaning, all your supplies you saved up, all guns, all attachments, ALL GONE, right before the MAIN PART OF THE STORY. 

This one made me mad, really mad, to the point that I dont think I will even try finishing the game.

And I do not even want to talk about some other bugs, like pulling up the map while driving messes up the camera, terrain clipping and render bugs, inconsistant way of showing you how much HP you have, etc...

So overall: A buggy game that in no way can be compared to the previous 2 games. Overall, barely a 3/5 (average game, but being that the average nowdays is CoD and Fortnite, yeah, it aint good...)

Basically, if you want that iconic feeling that Metro games provide, just play the first 2 games, especially Metro 2033 Redux, they are 100 times better.

Update after completing the game: (Long overdue)

So yeah, I did backtrack the two chapters and completed the game.

The ending saved it so to say. Going to Novosibirsk to look for a medicine for Anna was fun. Being back in tunnels, radiation through the roof, feeling like everything is a trap.... I missed it a lot and was so much fun to have some of that too. And a 'Two Colonels' DLC really saved it, I highly recommend getting this DLC. '

I will increase the ranking to a 4/5 because of this, But still, my overall verdict stays: Compared to previous 2 games, it is weaker in its main story, and atmosphere. I can recommend it, but not beofre recommending the hell out of two previous games.

P.S. 'Sams Story' DLC is interesting I can not lie, I would play that part again too",1658105035,1699014374,False,3,1,0.492843389511108398,1,True,False,False

It's a title where you'll explore vast and beautiful wastelands that fasten you to your seat while at the same time realizing that this all feels a little bit too familiar for you to fully be present there. Occasionally, you walk into rooms where props are floating and you come across various seams lacking the polish that they once had. Now more than ever, this game feels like its progenitor series [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i] and along the way you will be able to tell the inspiration of various levels fairly obviously. This isn't to say that [i]Metro Exodus[/i] doesn't offer engaging places to explore and interact with, but, with little exception, the derivative elements were present enough to take me out of the experience from time to time.

The game also has the issue of not significantly rocking the boat for the series outside of its large, expansive levels. The enemies you face will largely be the same as the predecessors and many times certain gameplay sequences will feel borrowed from the previous titles. Unfortunately, it does seem like a lot of the creativity was devoted to transforming to a mini-open-world format rather than unique and new gameplay sequences and types.

Another major change in this title is the loot you gain from exploration. In previous titles, the fruits of checking inside and out for goodies were items such as ammo, health kits, and filters, which is immensely rewarding if you are running low on that specific resource. In [i]Exodus[/i], the main rewards you will encounter are crafting components which is both liberating yet a tiny bit boring. Inherently, it is more exciting to get resources you so desperately need rather than the crafting components for the same item, so even though you may be able to get what you need without stumbling upon resources you don't need, the exploration loop does not feel as rewarding.

There are also a couple of issues I have but they are largely present in previous titles, so if you are familiar with the series, you will more or less know what to expect. Just to briefly address them, here they are: video game-y narrative, poor English voice acting, and gameplay actions feeling tedious as a misplaced desire to be immersive. If you are new to the series, I would recommend changing the game to Russian and making the subtitles as big as you can (as a non-Russian speaker).

Despite the multitude of issues, I have a problem placing this game as ""Not Recommended.""  When the gameplay elements come together, you feel embraced by the world of [i]Metro[/i] and panic all the more when you hear a pack of Watchmen stampeding your way and you running out of shotgun slugs. And I can't say that anything else has immersed in the Eastern European urge to smoke cigarettes and drink tea with your lover the way this game has. You experience a great amount of lows along the way for this title, but at the end of the day, when the game works, you definitely feel the machine heating and steaming as it should.",1698973807,1698974015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It succeeds in immersing me into a post-apocalyptic world in a fresh new way compared to similar games of the same setting. This review is written after a playthrough of the hardest difficulty - Ranger Hardcore. 
I also played the previous games in the series and can say this is an improvement. 

Things I like: 
+ The feeling of travelling through swamps, abandoned buildings etc, is compelling and tense. 
+ The graphics are great and a testament to the beauty of nature clashing the war-torn ruins of civilisation. 
+ The characters and monster designs are great. Characters are detailed and all distinguishable. Monsters are visceral and terrifyingly awesome. 
+ There are plenty of weapons and gear to engage situations in different ways. There are an assortment of meaningful attachments for each gun too and you'll find them yourself along the way. 
+ The settings are great. There are multiple settings too. It's not always snow. Not always a city or a metro. It's not always linear too, there are a couple open world sections where you're left to explore plenty of areas alone. And they're well designed. 
+ There is more than one ending and it depends on how you play. I got the Good ending, the one I'm told was the best, and I was very satisfied. 
+ Combat feels satisfying. Kills feel they have impact. And there are takedown animations too. It doesn't feel like two choices of guns blazing or sneaky sneaky ninja. It's deciding on how efficient you want to be and what will get the job done in a way that minimises how many deadly shots they take at you. 
+ The end mission is epic. 
+ Story is entertaining. Quite a few memorable moments. Not hard to follow. And the ending is really nice. 
+ There's a new game+ mode with a few additional options for altering the experience for the second playthrough. Including an Iron Man mode, which only saves when you complete a level. 
+ Ranger Hardcore is the perfect difficulty. With scarce but plenty enough loot to have fun and try things out and fights that don't seem unfair, but challenging. Great job! 

Things I Don't Like: 
- You can only play the Iron Man mode when you complete the game. So after completing this, I uninstalled to save space. Then when I returned to conquer Iron Man and double my playtime, my saves where gone and I couldn't. 
- The movement. The way it controls is really off and sluggish. Climbing is really slow. Sprinting is very limited. Sometimes if you sprint and stop and turn real quick, you'll do an awkward slide where your feet are trying to catch up to what you want to do. 
- Sometimes the audio doesnt sync right. Like they'll be talking over each other, answering a question when they haven't finished answering it yet. 
- Audio mixing is also not great. Sometimes you wanna turn a radio up because every thing around it is so loud and abnoxous. 
- Another problem I had with the audio is some sounds are just a mess and don't sound very clear. I get that I've been pounced on by a mutant, but why does my ear drums have to be busted in the process?
- Some glitches here and there. Getting stuck. Characters weapons continuously firing, loud as fuck, when they're in a cutscene. Getting your map out in a vehicle and suddenly growing 3 inches in height so you can't see through the window anymore. Kinda annoying but nothing game breaking. 
- I wish there where more long dungeons to explore on my own in free roam. Seems like the open world ones are small and simple compared to story locations, where you'll sometimes have a companion walking you through it instead of exploring on your own, with the tension and your own pace. 

In conclusion: 
A great game! Some audio problems but it has very good story different from others, likeable characters, fresh locations, amazing immersive post-apocalyptic atmosphere, filled to the brim with loot, monsters, secrets and more. And an epic ending as always. 

Very happy with purchase.

In this game, players are transported to the desolate Russian landscape, embarking on a journey filled with moral dilemmas and heart-pounding action.

One of the game's standout features is its daring transition to open-world environments. This shift breathes new life into the series, allowing for unprecedented exploration and freedom. The dynamic day/night cycle and realistic weather conditions significantly impact gameplay, enhancing immersion. Metro Exodus introduces a captivating ecosystem where predators stalk prey, and the player's actions affect the world around them, delivering a level of realism that's both thrilling and suspenseful.

A distinctive element in the game is its morality system, influencing the story's outcome based on your choices. This system adds depth and replayability, compelling players to contemplate the consequences of their in-game decisions. Metro Exodus shines in storytelling, providing a straightforward and engaging narrative that newcomers can enjoy without any prior franchise knowledge.

While the game is not without minor technical issues like occasional crashes and lengthy loading times, these shortcomings hardly diminish the overall experience. Metro Exodus emerges as an exceptional post-apocalyptic adventure, exploring themes of humanity, survival, and hope. It elevates the post-apocalyptic gaming genre by focusing on execution over-familiarity.

In summary, if you appreciate post-apocalyptic settings, Metro Exodus deserves a place on your gaming shelf. It's an atmospheric and profound experience that excels in storytelling and gameplay.

Metro Exodus isn't as [i]epic[/i] as many reviewers have made it out to be. Compared to the other Metros, its quite bad. As a standalone game, it is decent but tedious and boring.

[h3]Should I buy it?[/h3]
No. Go play the first two Metro games. If you want a similar vibe and more challenge, play the three STALKER games and wishlist the upcoming one.

[b][u]PC Settings[/u][/b]
The variety of settings in this 👉[b]PC game[/b]👈 is laughably bad. It doesn't give you any option to change individual graphics settings, not even the AA, and the motion blur can't be turned off in game. Further, there's no way to save a game apart from ""Quick Save"" ([i]what is Slow Save then?[/i]) and the game maintains like 4 saves which, if you're in a combat zone and it autosaves, means you have no manual save to fall back to.

[b][u]Bugs[/u][/b]
Every game has bugs and I get that. However in Exodus, I've encountered more bugs in the first few hours than I have in the entirety of many other games. Some of these bugs persist throughout the game. Heck, even STALKER doesn't have predictable bugs all the time.
[list]
[*] Characters walking into you and shoving you out of the way. (persists)
[*] Characters talking over each other.
[*] Getting stuck on trash sticking out of the ground.
[*] Wrong location marker for 1 main mission.
[*] Stuck quicktime events where hammering E doesn't do anything.
[*] Taking out & closing map in car lifts your view to roof of the car. (persists)
[*] Characters stuck on ledges/railings will most likely spaz out. (persists)
[*] Save corruption forcing you to pray for a good save since no manual saves.
[*] Enemy AI at most times is blinder than a bat. Harder difficulty just means more damage.

If i'm being honest, I've never been so avid to get through anything in my life, but it was for 'Metro Exodus'. It went intensively brutal to me when publisher, Deep Silver removed it from the store all of a sudden and put it on further release date. Since then, I've been waiting every moment, searching forums for more info on it, checking store if it's back by wonder. But unfortunately, had to wait a complete year and then, I got it as soon as it released here in a heartbeat. So, here's how it went so difficult for me as a fan and enthusiastic. I had completed it once then and now it's second time.

[i]It is like the 'Interstellar' of video games, unarguably the best to me forever[/i]

[h1]Story[/h1]
'Metro Exodus' brought the continuation of the story of its series and inspired by 'Metro 2035' novel. I'm truly so lifted by it's noteworthy story-line. Let's just say, 'Metro Exodus' shares an endlessly heartwarming love letter to me, a beautifully written story. To say, the story has conjoined a lot of new characters with previous ones and developed them altogether which let them present to us like not just some bunch of associates, more like a family. A family always looking out for each other, supporting in every possible way, and obviously every one of them has their stories going on and build up developing from the very beginning to the epilogue. It is so overwhelmingly saddening to think about a certain one, yet satisfying about how Artyom and Anna's journey met its closure. So, all I'd want to say is, its story expands the diversity of this series and completes it beautifully. I really can't describe how exceptional it is to me.

[h1]In-Game Sight[/h1]
In-Game mechanisms, features, contents contributes same as it's story does. It has enough built-in to provide an immersive experience. Like a lot of interactive opportunities throughout the map, tons of weapons with lots of customization, upgrading gears, optional tasks to build up my morality and more. So, I had more things to allocate and finish alongside, not just story missions. In doing so, It felt so engaging and some undying urge for more exploration into it's beautifully crafted In-game world. About mechanisms, I mostly preferred stealth based movements as I had lots of opportunities to keep it down and knocking out, which worked out just fine. I usually prefer stealth based strategy, but in a very epic way and I profoundly had it here. Also it was necessary to pull out less bloodshed attempts, and keep my morality balanced. Though, I'm allowed to go violent when it comes to parry the mutants, monsters, beasts like beings and I did that.

[h1]Visuals and more[/h1]
Developers really deserves all the appreciation and compliments, like how they've mastered it's visual quality, brought it so close to photo-realism. It does look delightful, photo-realistic mostly at sunset view, worth of a capture. About animations, they're not done by motion capture, but finished as usual. So, those aren't so much appealing like Metal Gear Solid V, but however it is, It's beautifully presented.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
Any situations can be verily impulsive, shivering and gripping if given proper soundtracks. In this case, 'Alexey Omelchuk' the composer of this masterpiece, did it flawlessly with the diversity of his composing mastery. The whole of it, is breathtakingly beautiful, let me point out some of exceptional soundtracks. Like 'Main Theme', 'Race Against Time', 'Dawn of Hope', 'Atonement and Sacrifice', 'Exodus Blues', 'Overture', these are the once which I heard the most of all.

[h1]Impressions[/h1]
Well, 'Metro Exodus' is a love letter like masterpiece by Deep Silver and 'Dmitry Glukhovsky' which unbolts a verily engaging and beautiful story with well-polished visuals, flawlessly fine soundtracks and in-game built mechanisms, world designs. It has so much more to offer, compared to what 'Metro 2033' and 'Metro Last Light' does.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]
So, this is all I've got to say and I'm profoundly recommending it to everyone. With all that, I can assure you that, it's surely something exceptional. But what bothers me is how underrated this masterpiece is.",1620203060,1698248051,True,19,0,0.659402251243591309,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★

Metro Exodus is hands down one of the best games I've played in recent years. It took me on an incredible journey through the haunting and dangerous world of post-apocalyptic Russia, and I couldn't get enough of it.

Let's start with the visuals. Wow! The attention to detail is mind-blowing. The environments, from the dark and eerie Metro tunnels to the vast and diverse landscapes, are so beautifully crafted that I often found myself stopping just to take in the scenery. The dynamic weather system adds another layer of realism, and I couldn't help but feel completely immersed in this desolate world.

But it's not just about the looks. The storytelling in Metro Exodus is captivating. The plot follows Artyom and his companions as they venture out of the Metro in search of a new home. The characters are well-written and relatable, and their personal stories had me emotionally invested from the start. The choices I made throughout the game had consequences, and I loved that I had to think about what I would do as a human, not just as a player. It made the experience so much more meaningful and thought-provoking.

The gameplay is where Metro Exodus truly shines. It strikes the perfect balance between intense combat and immersive exploration. The gunplay feels solid and satisfying, and the stealth mechanics are top-notch. What I loved most is the freedom it gives you to approach situations in different ways. Whether I wanted to go in guns blazing or take a more stealthy approach, the game allowed me to play to my strengths. The open-world design was a breath of fresh air, giving me the freedom to explore at my own pace and uncover hidden secrets.

Survival is a key aspect of Metro Exodus, and I found the resource management mechanics to be both challenging and rewarding. Scavenging for supplies and crafting my own ammunition and equipment added a layer of depth to the gameplay. It made every decision count, and I always had to think strategically about how to make the best use of my resources.

The audio design deserves a special mention. The sound effects are so immersive, whether it's the distant growls of mutants or the creaking of abandoned buildings. It really added to the tension and made me feel like I was right there in the world. The voice acting was top-notch, bringing the characters to life with believable performances. And the hauntingly beautiful musical score perfectly complemented the atmosphere and added to the overall experience.

In conclusion, Metro Exodus is a must-play for any fan of the post-apocalyptic genre. It combines stunning visuals, a gripping narrative, and immersive gameplay to create an unforgettable adventure. The attention to detail, freedom of choice, and immersive world design make it a standout game. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or new to the Metro universe, this game will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Don't miss out on this thrilling journey through the ruins of Russia, where your choices as a human, not just a player, truly matter.",1680096180,1697810372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game constantly has you thinking about your resources and how many bullets you are using each fight, crafting is fun and modding weapons although straightforward and relatively simple is loads of fun, having to choose between a sniper rifle or being a badass with the revolver somehow was one of the most difficult choices I have ever made in a game.

Accidentally got the bad ending on my first run through, and to be honest I don't mind it just gives me another excuse to run through this fantastic game again.

At first really didn't enjoy, thought people talked too much and I didn't get enough independence but as soon as I got past Moscow I was having the time of my life, so just stick with it, it will make it worth your time.

Edit: 
I played it again and honestly It was beautiful, I think this is a fantastic game made by people who have a love of the craft.

The atmosphere of this game is THICK. You get drawn in so easily, the term ""immersion"" is thrown around so much that it has lost all meaning and basically just means ""realistic"" to most nowadays but this game is really immersive, it sucks you into the world and you can just get lost in it. Just thinking about Novosibirsk makes me FEEL ill, sick and withered inside, its fantastic. Each area really has its own personality.

Forgot to mention last time that the music in this game is fantastic and that the sound design in this game is fantastic.

That's all.

It may well be a reflection of the perpetually cheerless news cycle of the last few years, but the video game world is absolutely teeming with post-apocalyptic wastelands at the moment. They all approach their setting with a definably different mindset though, with many treating it as little more than a no-holds barred playground for ultra violence. The misery and hopelessness of the situation doesn’t always come into it, but you could never accuse the Metro series of shying away from the full implication of nuclear Armageddon.

Based on a series of novels by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, the first two Metro games (remastered a while back as double pack Metro Redux) were set in and around the Moscow metro system, where a small group of Muscovites have survived the outbreak of World War III and try to make a life in the tunnels while avoiding the nuclear fallout and lethal mutants above.

The original games were primarily linear first person shooters, but with a heady mixture of other gameplay styles including stealth and survival horror. They also had an impressively ambitious story (also written by Glukhovsky) that used the setting to meditate on humanity’s propensity for conflict no matter the situation, as the survivors gravitated towards the authoritarian extremes of communism and fascism and absolutely fail to learn the lessons that caused their situation in the first place.

Despite a wide span of obvious video game influences, including Half-Life 2 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chernobyl, the Metro titles have a very distinct tone that is very much their own. The scarcity of ammunition, and the need to craft your own, adds a light survival aspect and while there are no stats or dialogue choices the strong narrative drive and exploration also tempts comparison with action role-playing games. The key difference between Exodus and the previous games though is that the new game includes of a number of open world areas, moving between those and more linear sections as the story dictates.

As interesting as the previous games’ stories have been in terms of their allegory of Russian society – and ultimately human society as a whole – the storytelling often got a little muddled and relied too much on familiarity with the novels and reading every little note scattered about the game world. Exodus is a direct sequel to both the games and the novels but has a much more straightforward narrative, that requires no previous knowledge of the franchise.

You play as an elite solder named Artyom, who has become obsessed with the idea that there are other survivors outside of the metro – despite all evidence to the contrary. Set 23 years after the initial missile strikes the landscape around Moscow is less dangerous, or at least less radioactive, than the previous games and it soon becomes clear that Artyom is right and he and his team of soldiers, plus his wife Anna, end up commandeering a train that takes them east across the country. The story spans a whole year in game time, starting off in the Moscow winter and taking in a wide variety of other landscapes, from desert to forest.

With the constant changes of season and location the segue between linear and non-linear maps works very well, with the latter filled with secondary objectives and rewarding exploration. Like Fallout, you’re constantly on the eye out for resources to collect, but you can craft basic ball-bearing bullets and other perishables on the go from your backpack, as well as reconfigure your gun on the fly. This helps foster a great feeling of freedom as you’re given a minimum amount of instruction on what to do, with the game relying on clever signposting more than following the Rockstar route of prescribed instructions.

The open worlds feature a proper day/night cycle and dynamic weather, so it’s often best to wait until night if you’re facing human adversaries, who might be asleep or unable to see as well in the dark, but at the risk of certain mutant animals being more active. There’s a well-established ecosystem at work, as you watch predators attack and eat prey animals, or call in reinforcements (in what is clearly a nod to Jurassic Park’s velociraptors) if one of their scouts spots you.

Even with the ammo limitations it is possible to play Metro Exodus as a straight shooter, but we found it far more rewarding to use stealth. As with the previous games the weapons are jury-rigged antiques and although the gunplay is a little better than before they’re still not that much fun to use, and that seems to be entirely purposeful. The artificial intelligence is noticeably better though and stalking enemies from the shadows is very rewarding, especially as each map is riddled with secret crawlspaces and shortcuts if you take the time to search for them.

Although there are some more arcade-like sections (a grisly encounter in a nuclear bunker being one early highlight) Metro Exodus is a naturally slow-paced game and all the better for it. What particularly impressed us was how it handles ordinary human opponents. Most of the low level schlubs you fight are just doing their job and you have the option of merely knocking them out when you surprise them. They’ll even give up and beg for mercy if they realise they’re the last man standing.

Not only is this vastly more realistic than most other games but the other characters recognise whether you’re being merciful or not and this can significantly affect subsequent encounters and how you as a character are perceived. A good argument could be made that the game should’ve provided dialogue choices and a voice for Artyom (although he does narrate the loading sequences) but as with all its gameplay elements Metro Exodus prefers to keep the mechanics as simple and accessible as possible.

The end result is a game that feels considerably more mature and meaningful than other post-apocalyptic titles. And yet the atmosphere is not quite so cripplingly depressing as the previous entries. It offers a damning indictment of humanity’s willingness to follow orders simply out of a sense of purpose and belonging, but there is a sliver of optimism present in the story and characters that was not so evident before.

What flaws there are mostly centre around the slightly scrappy presentation, with horribly long load times, minor graphical glitches, and an occasional penchant for instantkill deaths that seem to come out of nowhere. On balance though these are fairly trivial concerns and the graphics are astoundingly good for a game whose budget is undoubtedly many tiers below that of rival titles from much bigger companies.

Easily the best of the Metro series, Exodus promotes the franchise into the top flight of action adventures with a blend of genre influences that combine to create an impressively unique experience. It’s the best post-apocalyptic adventure this generation and proof that it’s not how familiar an idea is that’s important but how well you pull it off.

Let’s be fair and square. [u]Want a good post-apocalyptic game[/u]? Yeah, pick it up.

It plays really damn well, has a lot of nice exploration bits and allows you to make it a challenge or a fun shoot-the-things journey. The story has nicer, quieter parts compared to the original two, and by the time you’re done, it’s easy to feel satisfied with the ride. 

There's an undeniable impressive level of attention to detail, not to mention the entire setting is presented with so much authenticity that immersion is practically given in a silver platter. 
The audio is pretty much excellent the whole way, with the lovable stock sounds making a cheeky appearance as well. The only jank I dislike at all is how if you run you slide across the floor on dead stop but that's the slavish specialty.

Gameplay basics aside, both the dub and original dialogue is well directed, and it's unlikely you'll not love the brothers in arms that are along with you for the ride. Every scenario is full of stuff to see and are distinct from each other, and some have their own special elements that make them stand out, even if Caspian outstayed its welcome.

So, yeah, to make it short, if all you want is a good, solid game, just pick it up. Enjoy it.

[u]You wanted a Metro game[/u]? Oh, I have bad news for you. 

The core issue is that 4A changed, tweaked or outright ignored everything that made Metro distinctively unique. When theoretically asked ""what's special about Metro"" compared to say, Fallout, Stalker or the like, three things would instantly come to mind :

1- Ammunition Economy
2- The Supernatural 
3- Central theme of humanity's love for self-destruction

First, say goodbye to trading. Like, at all. Remember having to think whenever to use crappy ammo or grade rounds when in fights, or save them to purchase weapon mods? Well not anymore, they outright aren’t a thing now. While the dynamic approach is welcomed, it was such an essential aspect of the first two games that missing it makes something feel off to me.

Weapon mods you ask? You can swap on the go, don’t worry about what suits you or making choices before heading on the field, and when in drastic lack of resources, just pop the bag and you now care prepped for whatever the game throws at you. Also check this crafting system that basically showers you with easy resources, making being conservative with your supplies even less important. If you explore a lot, you will never run dry, when in 2033 and LL even the most conservative runs had me hardly scraping by at points.
In a similar note, they completely nerfed the visual identity of the bastard and the shambler due to the weapon customization. They massacred my boys.

Second, gone are the mystical, more unexplained things that pitted Artyom against things beyond his grasp. The supernatural elements of Metro blurred a line between science and fantasy that was the most original aspect of both games, enhancing the narrative’s themes and giving the series something truly distinct from every other post-apocalyptic setting. Without saying much, for 95% of the game, there is absolutely nothing, and even then there is extremely little.

And last, a central theme of the original story was that humanity was either going to have to learn understanding or was doomed to kill itself for good. 
Both games use a morality system that encouraged you to be invested in the world, the execution was questionable (cue the jokes about guitars) but the point was that to save humanity from repeating it’s mistakes, taking it slower and listening was the way to go. 
This is especially relevant in Last Light, where the child would beg for your peaceful discretion and resented the inevitable fights against your enemies. 
Exodus does something similar with the message of humanity coming together to save itself (if you know how the good ending is determined, you’ll know what I mean), alongside trying to make judgement calls interacting with other communities, but to me it failed to also show compelling contrasting factions save for the cult in Volga. None reach the level of tragedy of circumstance like Pavel, or pure evil such as Korbut. 

The moral dynamic of Taiga's children is compelling but it still ends up being interesting worldbuilding rather than an exploration of this theme. Not only that, all of the small scenes were you can sit and just listen to an NPC dwell on and on with stories, while mostly compelling, don't expand on this much either.

The best thing about the handling of human flaw in the series was that it went at lengths to show there were not always inherently bad people outside your group just because they were different. None of the factions you find in Exodus have that element implemented as strongly, if at all, because for the most part you only interact with them for a single chapter.

So yeah. Overall I was quite disappointed with this game. 

If it is the last game in the series, this is a considerably low note for me to end it in. They strayed too far to make a more appealing game that I did enjoy as it’s thing, but is devoid of the heart and soul that I expected from this franchise.",1550247313,1697479930,False,6,0,0.578122437000274658,0,True,False,False

Cons: multiple game crashes where I have to restart my computer, some sequences are locked at 30fps, the main menu interface is clunky, quick time events, stealth sections, maximum of 3 gun slots only, short time for each air filter, can’t swim / water monsters, enemy AI pathing is hit or miss, rail cart glitch in Yamantau, looking at your map while driving a car can glitch your posture, some walls/windows/ledges can’t be climbed over, the bear sections in Taiga

The graphics are top-notch, gameplay is solid with satisfying gunplay, and there are plenty of upgrades to tailor your playstyle.

Now, let's talk about the story. I'd rate it 10/10, but it's important to note that this isn't your typical linear shoot 'em up game. You need to take your time, immerse yourself in the experience, explore extensively, read notes, listen to audio logs, and engage in dialogues. All of these elements contribute to the story, making it meaningful and providing the rich atmosphere you're seeking. I enjoyed previous games just as much as I enjoyed this one, and it's becoming increasingly rare to find a well-crafted, story-rich single-player experience these days.

Things I don't like:
Horrible playermodels you contantly shoot through. 

The way morality is being handled. I did all the important sidequests like for example the teddy or the instrument you had too search and bring back. I also knocked enemies out most of the time when possible but of course did not go full stealth and killed enemies when they saw and shot me. Also in the Desert level I did not specifically look for unmarked places where I could save people. 

I think it is quite harsh and sad to just have two endings, I still got the bad ending by playing quite normally even though I was doing A LOT more good than bad. However still Duke died and Damir leaves.

Incredible game with great characters, compelling story, and very atmospheric world. The open world mechanics combined with the travel system with the train is beautifully designed and allows for a seamless and natural progression through post-apocalyptic Russia. Getting the player outside of the Metro was just what this series needed to stay relevant and fresh. 

The very simple and straight forward crafting system gives you just enough incentive to loot around for parts without it feeling like a chore. I have seen too many games shoehorn a complicated crafting system in for the sake of having one. This is not the case for Metro Exodus. Crafting is easy, necessary and enjoyable. 

As with the previous installments the voice acting can be very strange and downright cringy at times but it's fun to laugh at and adds a level of charm to the franchise. The stealth in this game could also use some work but for the most part it does what it sets out to achieve.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

EUROJANK TO FULL PRICE.
Whatever peoples opinions about this game, its objectively not fully developed, movement and general quality of life functions is very misalligned(or not there at all) and to becomes way to tedious. 

The developer has this history where previously titles was almost unplayble until a ""Redux Version""(finished product) was released.

It still the same. This is my last Deep SIlver game until they prove they can release a finished product, that this version is considered final and dlc is released is greedy and spiteful, i hate the fact i paid for this.

Never again Deep Silver.

The fan made praise for this is misleading(the same with promo), i do not know why deep silver passes but Hello Games gets critique(both games promo was equally misleading in my eyes), the hypocresy in gamers is disgusting.

ALSO the loading times says it all, plus the unskipable introscene when the game is booted up and there is fifty fifty chance that game just breaks and crashes. How to actual fuck is this publicly considered an finished retail version?

ALSO, it got me, my car got stuck, handgrenades doesent work, it will apperently respawn at some point but im to bored to care, the caspian sea is a bad mad max/new vegas rip off with no charm or anything interesting going on. 

If they really wanted to do a semi open world and not trash their own story they could have opened Moscow up, a giant city fallen to pieces, if they had put their focus to one area then they could have made something there is well crafted  and has depth. This is a very shallow experience , the areas are mediocre but sometimes nice to look at. But that is not a game.

Now if Artyom will go back will he still be greeted with hope or the Metro will spit him out? I mean, knowing that they are already labeled as traitors the Metro people would probably just think they are good as dead. It's nice if Artyom would come back and evacuate all of the residents of Moscow Metro and end the terror of the Hansa. screw those savages. Anyway,


It's a new experience since they added Open World in the game and new maps too. It's just, ARTYOM STILL DOESNT HAVE IN GAME VOICE LINES!!!!!!!!!! Man's mute the whole game. Wait, No!, the whole trilogyyy!!!!!. ""He was just there, standing menacingly."" HAHAHAHAHAH 


For the base game I give it: 7/10 
DLC's
Two Colonels: 8/10
The base game follows the journey of Artyom in Novosibirsk, This DLC plays the tragic fate of OSKOM and the fall of Novosibirsk Metro. Narrated by Kiril, We play as Col. Miller. We carefully unravel what really happened on that tragic day. Damn, the ending made me tear up a bit. 


Sam's Story: 8.5/10
Now this DLC is a treat. The problem is, It's too short. It's the same open world but now we are in the eyes of Lance Corporal Samuel Taylor known locally as Sam or Uncle Sam. Situated at the port of Vladivostok. Sam looks for a way out of the country to go back in America in hopes he's father would still be there, waiting for him. I stated above that it was too short, because it was too damn short. So they had to make the plot predictable to avoid messy results. OR OR JUST LAZY WRITING!!!! *kidding* hahahaha and this is also what makes it more fun to play, SAM GOT A FROOEAKING VOICELINES!!!!!!!!! He would curse at the enemy constantly when we can manage a kill. Also, screw the Volga and their rowboats, we got rusty speed boats in Vladivostok. hahahahah

[h1] an FPS with diverse combat and environments [/h1] 

This is an FPS with optional stealth elements. Set in the dark irradiated world of METRO, an elite squad of soldiers burst forth out of the tunnels of Moscow, to explore the world beyond they thought was destroyed.

The story is pretty good. The dialogue is a bit odd in cutscenes, but it doesn't detract from the game. It might sound better in the original language instead of dubbed through english.

The gameplay is solid. In many of the encounters with human enemies you can either run and gun, or take a stealth approach, using silent weapons and hiding in the surrounding environment. There are an array of varied guns, each of which is heavily moddable, allowing one to make their own signature weapons on the fly to suit the enemy types of the moment.

The enemies are many and distinct, ranging from human grunts to all manner of mutated creatures which can fly, crawl, slither, swim and run at you.

The world is very detailed. The individual levels range from open-world pockets where you can tackle a variety of missions and explore in whatever order you wish, to corridor-style environments which were prevalent in the previous games of this series. The larger more expansive maps were a great addition, and really break up the pace in a fun natural way. They are packed with details, and often have their own specific enemies, ensuring  each location is refreshing in its differences from the others.
For instance, one of the maps is a desert wasteland containing giant gargoyle like creatures, ready to pick you up as soon as you exit the van you use for traversal. Another location is a forest filled with mutated wildlife such as wolves and bears, which roam the areas between bases.

[h2] If you have already played other Metro games  [/h2] then you will recognise a lot of what this game offers, and might be pleasantly surprised with the new addtions.

[h2] If you have never played a Metro game [/h2] then you can nonetheless pick this one up, but it might be worth your time to play the others first, considering they are excellent games in their own right.

I can highly recommend this title to fans of the FPS and stealth genres.",1695844888,1695844888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story itself is very interesting and there is a lot of content to the game. the weapons all feel unique and the combat is enjoyable. The graphics look pretty decent and comparable to similar titles that came out at this time. I only have two genuine gripes with the game. First are crashes, which happened somewhat frequently (often multiple crashes per session). Second is the dialogue. For one its very ""eye roll worthy"" at many parts. There are a lot of corny lines and bland interactions and conversely many depthy interactions. However I'd say there's more of the former. There is also many occasions where multiple people are talking or there are several people in a conversation and all of their voice lines would overlap or they'd start responding before the previous person was finished asking them a question. Or there would be people adding side comments that would be louder than the main conversation you are having and it would drown it out. Kind of takes the immersion away when 6 characters are cycling through their voice lines all at the same time. 
Overall this was a fun game despite the several issues i had with it and i enjoyed playing it. I think the story alone makes it worth a try.

First, there was the debacle with Epic when it came out, I was reluctant for years to buy it. 3 years after release the game still crashes at points. The dialogue is not great, the russian-accent english voicing is hideous. The level design can get frustrating at times. The save engine is mentally challenged, you can only have 4 savegames, including quicksaves, and the game autosaves all the time. I hate how the game forces you to be a puppy-loving pacifist, if you don't want a bad ending you will have to sneak, [i]a lot[/i] - had to sneak through an entire chapter. It's an FPS but you can't shoot anyone besides mutants.

HOWEVER. The gameplay is pretty good, so is the story. I really liked the small moments with Anna and the rest of the crew. The crafting and weapon customization systems were nice. The environment design is absolutely fantastic, very detailed. It's one of the games where every screenshot you take is wallpaper material. It has a strong atmosphere. And they nailed the most important part; the ending.

I have a love-hate relationship with this game but I do think it's worth giving a try.",1695552134,1695552329,True,1,0,0.518043696880340576,0,True,False,False

This could have been a masterpiece... But they just blew it.
When the game first released, it was so broken that I didn't last 10H before quitting, and I said to myself fine, let's wait a few years until they fix it.
A few years later? It's still broken. I would go as far as to say the game is simply unfinished.

The difficulty scaling has been messed up and very poorly though through.
The IAs are broken and robotic in so many ways... Breaking the whole immersion in the process...
The save system is literally one of the worst I've ever seen. I can't stress this enough. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SAVE SYSTEMS I'VE EVER SEEN!!!
The day/night cycle is broken not only because of light issues but it's also flawed by concept;
Do you really expect me to walk through half the map each time day comes to find shelter because if I'm not playing entirely at night every enemy will instantly spot me miles away? Seriously???
The ""cannibals"" chapter was the worst that ruined my game for good... This is not Metro... This is a slaughter... It doesn't make any fucking sense...
The ""tanks"" were bad... The bosses meh aswell... Well i mean there's the poorly inspired bear from last light... which comes twice... and yep, that's it.
Even the physics are messed up... I climb stairs and am suddenly sent flying like I've just been catapulted... And this happened several times...

The more I think about this game the more I realize the previous games just did better in every single way.
You wanted a semi-open world? There you go... You have it... Well I wish we had been given something else entirely.

The story do keeps up though, aswell as the characters, obviously the visuals are amazing, the beauty and deepness of the world is really what kept me going through the end, while the gameplay itself is just subpar in every other ways.

So many issues that they clearly never bothered to fix, the complete ripoff of what ""ranger"" difficulty used to mean... It's just sad.",1695485033,1695485033,False,4,0,0.504876434803009033,0,True,False,False

The game's beautiful visuals and ominous locations make for an amazing atmosphere, the presentation as a whole is top shelf quality. 

The story is interesting and well written, characters are genuine and you care for them, they are your friends, your family even that you embark with on quite the epic journey across the Russian wasteland. 

The gameplay hits just about right, combat is fun and engaging yet simple. Weapons are extremely well designed, modeled and animated so they feel satisfying to use. Looting and crafting is tasteful and enjoyable, never a burden.

The game's open world maps as well as the more liniar sequences are all done with a high visual fidelity and good level design.

My only one complaint, as with all Metro games, is the binary ending which makes no sense for this franchise. Overall though, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, it's a smaller and more intimate experience than your Fallouts or Stalkers but like I said in the begining, the few things it does, it does them damn well enough.",1695423305,1695423305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

doesnt have too many bugs. some purple light glitch and a corrupt save warning after quitting to the main menu which never caused a problem with my saves. one thing bothered me is hit-reg can be inaccurate time to time while ADS.

To pass the lighthouse bug where you exit the cave and your whole pc freezes you need to NOT LOOK at the sea, instead crouch and keep looking at the floor and to the right a bit so your game doesn't show you the sea. Slowly move forward without looking and once you pass the boat and you can see the enemies you are safe to look around.

When it comes to selling you a bleak, post-apocalyptic vision of the future, there is no better series than Metro, especially those abandoned cities, warehouses, train depos and the titular metro tunnels. When the game gets to those points, where you're left all alone in some dark, god-forsaken pre-war bunker full of dust, cobwebs, corpses and unspeakable horrors lurking in the shadows, it goes HARD.

While I completed the game 3 different times, the review will be from a perspective of my first playthrough on a ranger hardcore difficulty, which I recommend you pick, if you ever play this game. It's definitely the best, and sadly, simultaneously the worst way to experience the game. Ranger hardcore means essentially two things: no HUD and a ""realistic"" damage model, so everything that lives can die from a single bullet, including you. This game mode also highlights everything that's amazing about this game and everything that drags it down.
Let's start the positives. The list won't be long, but those are some of the highest highs in games. Metro Exodus looks beautiful. Every location, be it a forest, a snow-filled destroyed city, an abandoned tunnel, is simply stunning. The amount of details, the weather effects, the lighting and the ominous shadows. You can take wallpaper-tier screenshot anywhere you look. The game's looks enchance another thing: the aforementioned atmosphere. You can only truly get it, when you're crawling around a damp, ""empty"" tunnel with little ammo, hearing distressing sounds all around you and then, suddenly, your flashlight starts running out of batteries. You'll never reach for that ""f"" key faster in your entire life. The enviroments are varied and believable. The gunplay feels smooth and tight, the sneaking mechanics are simple but mostly functional. We gotta talk about the flaws tho, because there's a lot of them.
Remember how I praise the atmosphere of the game? Well, it's great... as long as no one is talking to you. Because the NPCs in this game are pretty terrible. Not only is their dialogue a kinda awkard attempt at literally translating russian manner of speaking that only sometimes works, there's just WAY too much of it. Everyone is constantly talking. Exploring an abandoned bunker? HEY ARTIOM I MADE THE COMMS WORKING! Exploring a flooded train depo? HEY ARTIOM WE'RE LOSING YOUR SIGNAL COME IN COME IN. Please, shut the frick up and let me immerse myself in the game! To add insult to the injury, you can clearly tell that most VAs are English-speaking people trying to put on an awful fake russian accent (eg. Miller's VA). But there are also Russian-speaking VAs talking in English (eg. Krest's VA) and they sound great, so what gives?
You know what else messes with your immersion? Scripts. Blatant, obviously scripted moments. It feels like something scripted is happening every minute to a point, where you can, for example, completly ignore enemies, rush to a scripted door and suddenly everyone behind you disappears. Scripted ambushes, scripted monster encounters, scripted ""jumpscares"", scripted moments when you're found out while sneaking. And it all doesn't work because...
The game is now ""open-world"". Kinda. That's what the marketing says. You see, only 3 levels are open-world. Well, actually the third one is so linear and there's no point to backtracking, so I can't really count it as open-world. Those two levels are definitely the highlight, but at the same time... exploring those maps fully is something the game doesn't really expect you to do. Things you find are just tiny bonuses that don't matter to the game's progression. It's not like you're not gonna be prepared enough for the main quest because you skipped those optional places. The other 3 levels are completly linear. And the first one is more or less just a tutorial. So you're looking at... 5 levels in total. And while they take about 15-20 hours to beat it's because of...
A shitton of unskippable cutscenes. Every levels starts with like 5-10 mintues of cutscenes. Every single thing has to be a cutscene. Every dialogue scene - soft cutscene (you can walk around but have to wait for the NPCs to stop talking). Every time you find something new like a car or a new monster - cutscene. I think that almost half of my playtime is just loading times and cutscenes. And you know what makes unskippable cutscene even worse?
God-awful autosave system. You might think ""Hey, just save manually!"" right? Well, the Ranger Hardcore mode only allows you to use autosaves. They're so broken that it's not even funny. Combine that with the fact that you can die from a single hit and you'll be pulling your hair out over lost progress. Whoops, the last autosave was 20 minutes ago! Whoops, the autosave point was set just ahead of you spawn point, making you overwrite the save slot every time you load in! Whoops, every autosave is just BEFORE the unskippable cutscene! Sometimes leaving the saferooms autosaves, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you get 30 minutes of no saves, sometimes the game will save 3 times while you're standing still, listening to some NPC.
Other minor flaws include weird movement glitches (my car flipped on a straight, flat road killing me instantly and I once died while sprinting down the stairs...), tutorial messages not showing up on ranger hardcore mode (I had no idea you can turn around in a train cart and had to do that segment while facing the wrong direction the entire time), enemies not looking at you even though their guns are pointing at you, getting stuck on level geometry.

You know what's the worst part about Metro Exodus? Every single flaw of the game was already present in the previous titles. The autosaves, the cutscenes, the npcs talking all the time, hud elements not showing, janky movement, sounds glitching out and de-syncing, etc... People were complaining about this stuff back in Metro 2033 and after all these years two things have not changed -

- Metro series is still unmatched when it puts you alone in the dark metro tunnel, and it's still, unfortunetly, flawed as all hells. Give it a cautions try.",1695035728,1695036102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is great, immersive and very intense
though audio design in cut-scenes isn't the best but it gets way better as the game goes on

though be warned this game is best if you have an RTX or Ray Tracing compatible graphics card
since the Enhanced Edition is the most updated and polish version over the normal version but require Ray Tracing be on at all times

and i don't mean this lightly
Enhanced Edition contains FOV slider
more optimized settings
Forced DX12 and Ray Tracing (though theirs more settings option for ray tracing than in normal version)
better DLSS
no black haunted eyes in DX12
No more being too tall when using a map in the car
and a lot of Quality of Life bug fixes

these are the things you don't get in the Standard version, though it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game without playing the enhanced edition

if you like me downloaded the Enhanced Edition first and the game froze/crashed
don't delete it, open the game again, it's just the game loading shaders
Also if you are switching from Standard Version to Enhanced Edition please make backup saves cause i have to restart the casbain level all over again",1694175550,1694864466,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

412020,128700799,76561198090697492,0,81,3473,0,3473,1653148125,"Metro Exodus is a continuation of the story of its central, POV character, Artyom and thusly it is recommended that you play the first two, well, first. But its not necessary, as Exodus is somewhat unconnected to the events of the first two games. The first two deal with the fear of the environment and rising political tensions within the Metro, you leave the Metro within the first 2 hours of Exodus and don't deal with those factions anymore. Some characters return, but those who've played 2033 and Last Light will tell you that only 2 characters (aside from Artyom) are really important to the series as a whole: Colonel Miller, who you meet and work alongside in both 2033 and Last Light, and his daughter Anna, with whom Artyom works and starts a relationship with in Last Light. Both feature prominently in Exodus, as Artyoms commanding officer and wife respectively.

The story picks up sometime after the Battle for D6; Artyom, now no longer a member of the Spartan Order, but still close with former comrades and husband to Anna, is consumed by an obsession that atop the tower from the first game, he heard a radio signal, proving to him that outsiders to the Metro have survived and he intends to find out for sure-this obsession has led him to visit the surface numerous times at his own risk until one day, him and Anna encounter a train on the surface and their Exodus begins.

From here the story evolves naturally as the goals of Colonel Miller and the group Artyom takes with him change along their journey. The writing is generally excellent, with compelling characters and conversations. The game alternates between its semi-open world levels and confined narrative levels on the train as you travel. During these more confined levels, the interpersonal writing gets to really shine as the player can either skip the level and move on whenever they want, but immersing yourself with these people for 30 minutes leads to strong characterization as your mates drink and cook together, or you can have an impromptu jam session with another character, you can snuggle with Anna as she vents, have a smoke with your mechanic, or take over for your friend shoveling coal into the engine. On the other hand, the semi-open levels have well written factions within them, plenty of good environmental storytelling, etc.

Gameplay is similar to its predecessors, being a shooter with an emphasis on stealth--the AI is smarter than it used to be, and the stealth feels less buggy as well, and as a shooter, it feels all around more responsive and fluid than earlier Metro games. Artyom comes with a variety of throwables, including grenades, molotovs, distractions, and knives. A new feature to the series is the backpack, itself a mobile workbench that allows you to make some items and tools on the fly and modify your weapons attachments whenever; for example, you may find yourself in an unintended combat situation, and quickly switching your silencer for a long barrel or something can make the difference. Most weapons are heavily modifiable as well, meaning the simple AK platform can be turned into an AKM or an AKS, silenced, turned into a marksman rifle, etc. the only flaw is the weapon pacing. 2033 starts you with the most basic weapons, while slowly granting you access to the better ones through combat encounters and vendors and Last Light allows you to just choose your starting loadout, but still then removes them after a period of time, reverting you back to the 2033 style. Artyom starts with the AK by default, and most people will be hard pressed to want to switch that out as until its directly upgraded with the modern version, its the most versatile weapon you have. your secondary is largely up to you, and your choices also include a Nagant Revolver, a break action shotgun, a better shotgun, and a bolt action rifle.

Graphics are excellent, with 4A using a strong style of realism. the improvised weapons of the Metro look possible, are well textured, and gleam nicely in the light. Character models are highly detailed, with lots of bits and bobs on each of your friends' armors, helmets, and plate carriers, enemies are often given a similar treatment. Textures do suffer slightly, as they are pretty old now, but you'll be able to look past them easily thanks again to style and atmosphere. In the Enhanced Edition, Ray Tracing actually works with little impact on performance--looking out at the Volga atop Krest's crane and certain indoor scene with lots of different sources casting light do send me into the high 40s, but those are when it would be most taxing so its fair enough. 

 The Metro series are a rare example of ""story first"" FPS games and Exodus is no exception, there is only one level that is a straightforward shooter level, all the other levels are meant to be chewed on and approached with nuance. Like the older games, ""moral points"" feature somewhat and influence the ""good"" or ""bad"" endings, but they feel different than older games. In 2033, moral points were almost all tied to subtle choices you made through the game, like accepting or rejecting a clip of MGR as payment, or paying a kid in a station to lead you around. In Last Light, moral points were more often scattered as rewards for exploration, but occasionally with choices too, like sparing Pavel or killing a surrendering enemy. in Exodus, they are a bit more tied to doing side objectives and also how stealthy you are in certain situations. When escaping from a religious groups stronghold early on for example, not getting caught will get you a point. In the same area, there are points tied to rescuing prisoners from the bandits in the area, getting a little girls teddy bear back from a mutant that took it, or finding a guitar for another friend. Enemies will surrender in combat if they are overwhelmed but im pretty sure you can kill them with impunity.

On Ranger hardcore, with full immersion, as long as i played stealthy, i never found the game too hard, even in its all out shooter moments. the only exceptions to this are a section at the end of the Dust chapter when you confront the Baron, and the bear encounters in the Taiga chapter, all of which can be somewhat frustrating. Explore most of whats around and again, be stealthy, you shouldn't run out of ammo or anything. Remember to sleep to nightfall if you're having trouble getting through an enemy camp. The hardest thing about Ranger Hardcore are the moments when Artyom has a range of interactions with a item (like at his desk where he can use the radio and read his notes, or getting ready to sleep) when you can't see what each interaction is.

SERIES SPOILERS AHEAD

Exodus does a great job of immersing you into its atmosphere and vibe, and its generally well written. What it doesn't do so well are its cast of characters. For one, you've only Miller and Anna returning from earlier games (Artyom too), the rest are all new creations for this game. the downside is obvious: none of these characters are known or have an interesting relationship with the player. Duke, Alyosha, and Idiot had no connection to what's happened in the prior two games and Sam was SUPPOSED to help in taking D6 during the first game but was sick or something. That wouldnt be a big issue if these characters didn't have such an established bond with Artyom but they treat Artyom as a war hero (and he essentially is, from the last 2 games, but from rando unknown characters it feels off.) Funny enough, the best characters are the two who don't really know Artyom, Krest and Yermak. They are written as complete outsiders, Yermak having been supervised by Hanza and Krest being from way outta town. These two are the most fun to interact with because they don't reference earlier games; they are here and now. Krest is smart and personable, just glad to have a group of like minded people around him, and Yermak is like Artyom, disillusioned and tired of the Metro and the groups in it.",1671247766,1694549950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A bit weird in the series of Metro, with some weird decisions made that are a bit too outlandish compared to the previous games. The storyline could have been so cool but the damn cheesiness and the weird camaraderie scenes just make a lot of it fall apart. The amount of times I went ""Ohhhhh ffs really??"" is a number I lost count on.
That's not completely why were here though. My issue with the game isn't specifically the sketchy animations or the weird lip sync. The game has so many bugs it's not even funny. If you've played Shadow of War you'll know what bugs can do to a game. This game is so much fun, actually. Weird, yes, but different and new enough that I wish I could keep playing it. But that's the problem, it's absolutely unplayable now for me and I'm on the ""Taiga"" level which is like level 4 or 5 or whatever chapter. The game didn't let me load into the game, but now when I press continue at the start menu it freezes and crashes slowly enough that my whole pc won't do anything.",1694243601,1694243601,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Super basic stealth gameplay, a joke compared to Deus Ex, Dishonored or even Hitman. Gunplay is very standard just like the set-pieces that tie the maps (open world) together. Some set-pieces straight up feel like copy/paste form the first two games. You'll find tons of re-used assets, aka you're fighting the same enemies with the same guns from the first two games, just in a dead open world. The gametime padding  is super obvious: forced exposition, walk&talk cutscenes, traversing the maps is super tedious and hold ""use"" to open containers or interact. Last but nott least tbe controls are jank. You have to select throwables over a ghetto-ass weapon wheel because of the lack of hotkeys.

[h3]Bugs/Glitches[/h3]
I had multiple crashes and bugs where I had to reload because npcs got stuck. If you open the map while driving your car, your camera gets stuck in the car's roof. Enemies spot and shoot you through walls, while sleeping or having their back turned towards you (fun stealth gameplay).

[h3]World/Level Design[/h3]
""Open World"" in this game means a couple big maps with some smaller levels sprinkled inbetween. Each map has like 3 bandit camps and barely anything else. Luckily there is no point in exploration because all you find are  basic crafting materials and the occasional gun mod that isn't a game changer. You'll find the later from basic enemies anyway.

[h3]Story[/h3]
A boring and predictable story accompanied by one-dimensional characters that mostly revolves around fetch quests. The dog shite morality system is still in the game to force you into playing a certain way unless you want the bad ending.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
The game isn't terrible but redundant, you aren't missing out on anything if you don't play this game. This feels like a cash grab on the Metro ip. They didn't have any new ideas, so they made the game open world and called it a day, because that's what sells. This game only makes me want to play STALKER or Fallout: New Vegas again.",1694170341,1694170775,False,3,0,0.517893314361572266,0,True,False,False

The graphics look extremely detailed and will easily give most medium to high end PCs a run for their money. Textures and water look great, smooth camera flow and great physics improve the overall look of the game.

The gameplay is fun and engaging. Every aspect of the game makes sense in every way. Gunplay movement and camera movement is brilliantly integrated into the open world and cramped environments. The day and night cycle works great and the weather effects are gorgeous. Sound for guns and the environment is great.

I disagree with a lot of people here, who are calling it a masterpiece, since it has its fair share of flaws. The biggest ones being the writing and voice acting. Its all rather... simple. Something you would find in a 2007 game. The story was serviceable, and the best thing about it is that players new to the Metro series would also understand it, although a quick recap video won't hurt.

The best thing about this game is its optimisation and atmosphere. Runs great on my 3060. The dread when you're exploring a run down building with weird voices in the background is amazing. The exploration is fine, although it is little more than going to question marks and clearing the area. The end of the game is very linear but very atmospheric, so I guess that compensates for it.

Gameplay is fantastic, one of the best in my opinion when it comes to linear story-driven FPS. There's a great variety of enemies and ways to deal with them that makes every encounter feel special and unique. Your arsenal is vastly improved from the previous games letting you now customize so many parts of your guns on the fly thanks to your backpack where you can also craft throwables, cures and ammo.

Just finished the main story, had a lot of crashes on linux but solved that by toggling on and off vsync ingame, unplugging all usb devices except keyboard + mouse, force use steam linux runtime, dont use advanced physx.
Its was worth my time, going to play the dlc next. 
Like any trilogy changes which make it more arcady start to accumulate, cumbersome looting has a .. certain borderlands feel and isnt like 2033, where every single bullet almost had a history. The weapons are not terribly well balanced, but all fun nontheless. The story and characters are all there and I can see where this was going to go, but Im almost certain that in an operation this big costs started to go bit overboard and they rushed their inhouse art team to populate maps or smth instead of finetuning character exposition. The worst example for this is the drive down from the lighthouse, thats her character sheet. Dont dump that on the player. Anyhow, the story still stands up. Atmosphere not so much.

The gunplay was one the best parts of the game because it was so awesome plus the gun customization was very unique and fun to use, try out all the different gun parts and attachments for your suit and other cool things that give perks (some are hidden in secret areas so the game motivates the player to explore the world more) . Also an interesting thing is the UI, because it is all in the game world without any popup windows. The last thing are the graphics, they are beautiful and surprisingly the performance is quite good.

1) ""open world sandbox survival"" is just a lie. There are no survival elements and the world is definietly not open. Just some bigger maps with linear missions.

+ I love this game, I never wanted to quit it. :-) Spent over 75 hours yet. 
+ Story, characters, Spartans.
+ Optional choice of stealth progress, as always in Metro games. I think it teaches that more difficult and time-consuming approach to problems can be also a challenge and fun, and will pay off with good ending. This principle may work also in a real life!
+ 1911 pistol feel in Sam’s story, especially with upgrades. 
+ Possibility to upgrade weapon anywhere by opening backpack.
+ Easy “puzzles” and most of locations to find updates.
+ Rich player can destroy gorillas/librarians at the end of main story. 
+ Beautiful forest areas, I made tons of screenshots. Metro games always seemed well optimalized to me. 

[b]Negative points:[/b]  
- I missed Vintorez and Clapper sniper rifle from Last Light. Any non-lethal weapon with range (or shooting enemies to legs as forcing them to surrender) would be good too.
- Restricted choice of third weapon in the main story (Tikhar or Hellsing, but never none or both).
- Passivity of human enemies, many of them did not explore area that much, even if they knew I am around and I am a danger to them.
- Some of dialogues were too long. 
- Looting should take less time. I catched myself collecting things again and again, and I believe it was NOT purpose of this game, even if the brain of the player perceive it as “reward”. We should focus more on fighting and stealth than collecting stuff from XYZ caskets and boxes.
- Looting again – it is not very efficient to add some weapons to the last part of the game, when there is almost no time to try it, like the railgun from Miller.
- Level design in Sam’s story was strange, some locations were blocked even if they did not look like blocked.",1693317976,1693319507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: A small and amazing VR indie game inspired by the metro series, but using all original assets and content called Paradox of Home - which was being developed by one single person - was sent a cease and desist by, presumably, 4A Games or Deep Silver. Either way, the game was taken down, and a developer has lost their source of income. This is unacceptable behavior, and copyright trolling like this should not be permissible by any devs. I will change my review if the situation changes, but as of now, I cannot recommend anyone pay money to any of these games.

KEEP IN MIND I TRULY LIKE THIS GAME. I love the metro series as a whole. However, devs can't keep getting away with this literal bullying of small dev teams, especially when Paradox was done by one guy. Played through it, bought the DLCs, and the works. If I could refund it at 55 hrs just due to the bullshit that Deep Silver pulled, I would.

They haven't fixed a great many of the bugs I found when I yarharred this game when it first came out. Nevermind the reason why I yarharred it in the first place (looking at you epic exclusivity). But recently they C&Ded a indie Dev making a metro inspired rogue lite for the VR.

The game was heavily inspired by metro, but was utterly made from scratch. The single Dev would have compromised by changing whatever models Deep SIlver wanted him to, as this VR game was his only source of income and he had worked rather hard on it.

They denied him that and now Paradox of Hope can no longer be bought on Steam.

If you're new to the Metro series and just intend on jumping to Exodus, I wholeheartedly suggest you to play Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light first due to the new perspective you'll get on Exodus.

Despite being the third game in the series, it does not try to be anything it wasn't before and stays true to its core, not only that, it builds on what it may have lacked previously.

Truly well-acted and immersive dialogue, each character has their own story that just swallows you in, amazing graphics even for today's standards, great variety of maps and level designs where one map (chapter) is totally different from another with several types of biomes and approaches for each map.

The entire trilogy is one of its kind and Exodus lived up to its previous games.

I think they've made the best game that can be made with the technology that's available at the end of the age we're in. 

Love, betrayal, friendship, and Russia.

The flow of the story flows so well that suddenly something happens and when you say ""what's the relevance"", the answer is given instantly. We go with the flow and we see very deep traces of the real world; human reactions, death effects and so on. 

Politically, Russia's loneliness, being lost in itself and not trusting anyone, as well as the class divisions, betrayals, conflicts and more. 

It felt more like a living environment than a play, and the use of everything very judiciously and in its place felt very natural to me.

There is only one thing to criticize and that is that Artyom never speaks. [b] The answer to this is as follows: Just like Gordon Freeman never speaks (Half life), this is just like that; because you are Artyom.[/b]  I think it's a very reasonable answer, but the fact that he doesn't react at all during all the emotional and exciting moments seems a bit lonely, at least for me.

why dont we see s.t.a.l.k.e.r sending a cease and desist for coping the setting and even blatently stealing anomalies such as the 'tesla' anomaly, a ball of electricity that follows a closed loop and shocks anyone who walks near it, which can be seen in this game in the first open area near the train tracks. its because its ridiculous to claim something like that can only be owned and used by one person.

the sender of the cease and desist is still yet to be revealed but i feel its pretty obvious who sent this as there is only one big studio who owns a big ip that uses this setting in the last half a decade. im leaving this review not only because im not very fond of this game compared to the rest in the series, but also in protest of this blatant injustice.

Metro Exodus is a well made stealth and survival, apocalypse game based in Asia. I like to refer to it as a Fallout lite with a better story. The open world is more linear and not as in depth, but story and voice acting is phenomenally better. 

Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition provides a fantastic improvement on what was already a beautiful game. The graphics are not next generation. However, they hold up very well and present a beautiful game that disguises its age well.

The audio is a bit of a mess. Despite having fantastic audio and excellent voice acting, the Enhanced Edition did not do anything to upgrade the audio. As such, many of the new drivers and format delivery can cause the game to crash. As such, you may find that your headsets, newer surround sound systems and sound bars could crash the game. This has been the only issue that I have run into. I turned off the spatial option, played the audio through an older driver and it stopped the crashing. I have had zero issues since.

Metro Exodus was already a highly recommended game, in my opinion. The Enhanced Edition releases a beautiful enhancement to the game, making the experience fantastic on my 84"" television. This game is recommended for those that enjoy apocalyptic story lines, or even a good story game. You do not have to do the open world aspects, but I find them enjoyable as well.

In short, Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition is recommend as a fun gaming experience that holds up very well to today's games. Fallout-lite with a better story and more compelling linear experience.",1610311098,1693034730,True,4,1,0.526985347270965576,0,True,False,False

I think I'll downvote this game since it's fair. I enjoyed it but not to my satisfaction.

Metro exodus has taken it a notch above and succeeds to completely immerse you in its vast world. The world is beautifully crafted with amazing characters you end up loving and caring for, it really gives you a grounded feeling where you actually feel that the world around you changes according to your actions. You totally feel in control and have a sense of responsibility to be a true ranger. The fact that your choices have consequences makes the game even more immersive. The gameplay is smooth and super fun, the different levels of difficulty helps you to tailor your gameplay to your liking as to how realistic you want the experience to be. It's a super fun game with an exceptionally well written story with an amazing cast of characters each with their own unique personalities.

EDIT: This has reached what I only hope is peak obnoxious where a character told me to ""take a seat"" at which point I have to push a button to... you know sit in a chair.. so he can monologue at me. No skip.

EDIT 2: Steam wants me to update this so.. in the context of the above: You can't save anything intentionally except a quicksave that keeps getting overridden. Which combines with all the unskippable cut scenes to both 1. hint at a bunch of story possibilities but 2. kill re-playability because to do that you know you'll have to sit through hours of the same tedious dialog and maybe. Assuming of course you haven't accidentally put yourself fin an unwinnable corner in which case... ?",1692633746,1692724866,False,6,0,0.535374879837036133,0,True,False,False

Narratively, this game is sound, and the journey the crew leaves on will have you genuinely wondering where it goes next for a decent portion of the game, but in a good way! A lot of the cast is just sort of willed into existence as the main characters friends despite the fact they weren't in the prior games, but they have enough decent dialogue and focus that it gets a pass, similar to how Half Life 2 did this with it's cast compared to the prior game. Also, for the cast that was pre existing, gets some incredible character development. Anna is cool. Miller is one helluva father in law and commanding officer, and by the end of the game you may care for these characters a bit!
Mechanically, I cannot praise this game enough. The former games were linear shooters with a focus on stealth and basic survival mechanics, and this game expands on all of that. It keep's some of it's linear style in some levels, but introduces 2-3 open-world-ish levels, where their's a set of main ""quests"" or objectives you have to accomplish that develop as you do them, but a large space that those objectives are set in. Not large enough to feel empty though, compared to actual open world games they're all quite small, and are navigated on foot, but in between those objectives, are a plethora of well designed areas to search and loot for supplies, enemies to fight or try to avoid, safehouses to spend the night in, and tons of miscellaneous things to encounter. They're all places that feel lived in and well detailed with lots to do, not bland and devoid of life save a set of collectibles like most modern open world games. The new survival aspects also improve the game immensely. Yes, their's crafting but its very simple, their's also a ""gun smith"" that has an interesting aspect where you can only access it partially in the field, so you have to be careful with what weapons you bring for whatever you're doing. 
It's incredible, and I wish other games got their mechanics improved like this game so wonderfully did.",1692521051,1692521051,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game is a masterpiece of gaming and story telling. And love it every minute I play. I like the FPS freedom of other games but love the immersive cutscenes that blend into gameplay as well. And the characters as so good it s like watching a good TV series.

Now the graphics: 10 out of 10 and the enhanced edition looks cinematic! Unfortunately my laptop can t play it but saw comparissons on the web and can t wait for my next pc to play it again. But you do not need that to have the full experience of this piece of art.

So who would I recommend this game to: well, to anybody that wants to enjoy a good story with a fantastic journey, colorful characters, good action and exploring... lots of exploring. I played it on normal because I do not want to be killed everytime I have an encounter and this is not doom eternal. You are physically limited as any human is and you have to play with the environment, the weapons and the few bullets you find. Still is less punishing than the other Metro games (at least in normal) and you find ammo on any human enemy you defeat.

The crafting system is also fantastic and love that everything you do is animated. If I were playing a quick shooter that might bother me but to see the animations my character do when he accesses the backpack or jumps through a window makes it super immersive and doesn t cut your presence in the game.

All in all this is a 10 out of 10 unless you hate winter... if you do, this is not for you because this game environment is cold as hell. I m playing it in winter and eventhough I have heating in the room I feel cold by playing it which speaks of the immersion level this game gives you.

I like the approach of slowly introducing better and better guns and attachments to help keep the game fresh as time went on, it also allowed for earlier weapons to continue being viable while also allowing new guns to get swapped into the loadout. ammo economy was good. I do wish you could carry multiple of scopes and other attachments but otherwise pretty. decent.

My year-long anticipation, marked by the patient wait for the Epic Store exclusivity to wane, was richly rewarded the moment I acquired the game on Steam. In retrospect, I would willingly have extended my wait to relish the captivating experience that this exceptional game offers.

Though I missed out on the novel RTX technology, I was astounded by the captivating visuals and seamless performance on my trusty GTX 1070. Metro Exodus stands tall among the most visually captivating games available, exuding an unparalleled atmosphere of realism. This realism isn't confined merely to the graphical realm; it permeates the very core of the gameplay, resulting in a remarkable transformation. The weapons and combat mechanics have ascended to an unparalleled pinnacle; each firearm boasts an astonishing level of customization and intricate detailing, down to the nuanced reality of jamming due to excessive dirt accumulation.

With the introduction of fresh adversaries, a revamped crafting system, and the intriguing blend of Open World exploration and Linear Storytelling, the game beckons players to explore the desolate landscapes of post-apocalyptic Russia. The musical score seamlessly weaves into the fabric of the Metro universe, reaching a crescendo that leaves an indelible impact. In the final climactic moments of the narrative, I found myself intricately intertwined with the emotions of the characters, a symphony of goosebumps coursing through my being. What was once a solid gaming experience in the Metro series has now blossomed into an unforgettable odyssey, transcending boundaries.

The storyline, although straightforward, exudes a unique sense of style, brimming with emotion and pulse-pounding action. As for the finer intricacies of the plot, I leave those treasures for you, the intrepid reader of this review, to unearth and relish firsthand.

Nestled securely in the third spot on my personal list of favorite games, Metro Exodus has stoked a blazing anticipation within me to soon embark on the captivating journey offered by its two DLC expansions. For those in search of an extraordinary gaming series that seamlessly blends action, realism, horror, and raw emotion within a post-apocalyptic canvas, I wholeheartedly endorse the entirety of the Metro franchise. As for Metro Exodus, it stands unwaveringly at a perfect 10 out of 10, an unequivocal masterpiece that beckons you to immerse yourself in its world and savor the unparalleled experience it bestows.

Metro Exodus is the third installment of the acclaimed series, inspired to the books of Dmitry Glukhovsky, and set after the events of Metro last Light. Once again impersonating Artyom, players will soon leave the cryptic tunnels of the Moscow Metro to journey on through the entirety of Russia, ending up in a variety of places ranging from deserts to lush forests - accompanied by Colonel Miller and his elite Spartan team. What initially begins as a daring escape soon turns out to be a journey for survival, as unexpected turns of events one after another come crashing down on the squad.

🟩 Pros

Exodus' visuals are amazing, possibly the best available on PC to this day. Each environment is recreated with masterful art direction. 
A Screenshot of Metro Exodus
By: Brinda


Starting with the good points, the strongest feature of Exodus as it was with the prequels, is the atmosphere and world-building, which deliver an uncompromisingly realistic take on the nuclear post-apocalypse. This time it's not confined to the cramped Metro tunnels, but shows in full the entirety of Russia's wastelands, and does so flawlessly. Fighting any kind of enemy on the higher difficulties is a tense and unforgiving affair, where all but the weakest attacks mean certain death for both yourself and most enemies.

This realism is complemented by accurate gunplay and good variety of murder tools to use. Exploring the wastelands is not only spectacular but also worthwhile, as every map contains a bounty of secondary locations often hiding unique upgrades for Artyom's suit and weapon mods. They will make your life easier once acquired. The narrative and characters stay true to the excellent book series and do not disappoint in the slightest.

There are however a few dents to an otherwise flawless execution. The Karma system has been reworked and forces players to take on the majority of situations with complete stealth, without also killing anyone in order to get the good ending. This goes as far as penalizing you for killing someone that shot first and is openly hostile, while the consequences will influence your companions' very lives as if some ""higher power"" was there to punish you - which makes no sense.

Overall, Metro Exodus remains an excellent open-world FPS that delivers the quality already made famous from the previous chapters, at the same time enhances the gameplay in new ways bringing it to a new level that surpasses the previous ones in almost every department. It took me around 25 hours to finish the game on Ranger Hardcore, while exploring thoroughly every map and completing all side content. For the price of 40€ and excellent quality, I can recommend buying at full price.

Weapons make up the lack of variety with extensive modding possibilities. Most parts will be found while exploring secondary areas.

In-Depth Breakdown
🎮 Gameplay Analysis
Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Character Management, Quests and Combat.

Exploration
Is performed on foot most of the time, except in a particular map where there will be a truck at your disposal. Ziplines and boats are also used sparingly to traverse otherwise impossible paths. While exploring, keeping an eye out for mechanical and chemical components - both used in crafting - is one of the primary goals, as you'll need them to craft supplies. Of course you can also find already made ammo, medkits and filters, but that's a more rare occurrence.

Certain specific places hold unique modifications more or less hidden, and this is what makes exploring every corner worthwhile. A global map will display your position and all the discovered points of interest, highlighted on the map by using the Binoculars on a high place. Safehouses are sparingly set around the world and they can offer a safe refuge to wait night or day, craft at the workbench and more importantly save the game if you play Hardcore. There is no fast travel.

Character Management
Can be done on the fly with the portable workshop in your backpack, or in a more complete manner at a stationary workbench in a Safehouse. You will be able to modify any of your weapons with previously acquired mods at any time, as well craft simple ammo types such as arrows or steel balls, medkits and filters. More complex crafting requires a full bench and that includes changing your suit upgrades, crafting bullets and as well throwables like grenades, cleaning weapons to prevent malfunction.

Quests
Are not numerous in the game and usually are about retrieving a specific item for one of your travel companions or another character. They do not always award anything other than achievements or Karma, but still they are worth doing for the sake of storyline and to explore new places.

Combat
Is one of the most consistent elements of the experience and at least on the higher difficulties, is a brutal and unforgiving affair where even just one shot can instantly kill you, as well as enemies. Ammunition is fairly limited, while grenades and throwables are powerful bit very expensive to create - using all your resources, stealth as well, is key to prevail against overwhelming numbers. Nothing prevents you from going in guns blazing but on higher difficulties it's a good idea to take out at least some enemies silently before doing so.

Foes range from your average bandit with a shotgun to nine feet tall abominations with the strength of twenty men, passing from mutated shrimps and venomous giant worms. Each foe has strengths and weaknesses for you to exploit, for example most animals will be scared by fire or your vehicle. Human enemies are definitely smart and use tactics such as flaking, cover and grenades to overpower you, other than having swift reflexes and excellent aim - on Hardcore at least. Being accurate, fast and conservative are the pillars of Metro's combat.


Not only humans, but also all kinds of beasts mutated by radiation will be your enemies. Some of them will act as powerful bosses.

Metro Exodus is definitely a worthy successor that expands the prequels' gameplay, taking it to new heights, but not without some drawbacks. Fans of the series and those who like atmospheric games will not be disappointed.",1691860558,1691860558,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

The game is a bit janky which I have accepted as part of metro series but it didn't suck me into its world and people like 2033 and last light. The world had so much character in the older games, going to the surface felt scary and exciting at the same time because I knew that the scenery will look gorgeous but there are monsters ready to pounce on me, radiation that will kill me or the demons which were nigh invincible in the older games. The demons in this game are a joke, I had to get this teddy bear for the little girl, I geared up for that quest to the teeth as I knew what it would take to kill a demon. I went to its lair and there it was in its nest, it started growling and coming at me, I shot it.... then nothing, it started coming at me slowly, I emptied a clip in it while my gun was constantly jamming(as it became dirty while coming to this location because of mutant killing) but not a hit landed on and it just died like a dog, this was on hardcore difficulty. That was it, the mutants were not a problem, I regularly killed dozens of humanimals, nosalis, watchmen. In 2033 there was a fight before entering the library where around 10 watchmen attack you and I barely scraped by, started the fight having 5 med kits, full ammo on my shotgun, AK and pistol and almost all were empty. This made the world feel dangerous and dead. This is not a metro game, it is a weird blend of stalker, metro and other open world games. It is a good game but not a Metro game, don't go in expecting the atmosphere of metro(there is a bit of it near the end, but that's it.",1691851477,1691851477,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Emotional and satisfying ending for sure. Metro already has been known as a franchise that offers solid storylines. Not just the lore and story but also the way it serves that to the player is fantastic. That is definitely still here with exodus. A fantastic voyage thru this universe that Dimitri Glukhovski created. Exodus is based on and starts with Metro 2035 and adds a lot of details to it afterwards. 
10/10 

2)	COMBAT / MECHANICS: This is not your typical FPS game. Carachter movement is so slow and far from being nimble. Mobility is highly restricted. You have to watch not just your back but also everywhere because there is no escape if you do a mistake. Same story with the ammunition and resources. So in terms of mobility and resource management, Metro Exodus is stingy. I love that tho. But clearly its not refined. I don’t remember how many times i got stuck in the middle of something important because of some weird terrain and game control interaction. So its unique, fun and good enough but feels far from being perfect.
8/10

3)	ATMOSPHERE / VISUAL DESIGN: Clearly the strongest part of the game with the story. Metro Exodus is kinda a 10-15 hour ingame engine playable cutscene. Illustrations are unbelievably good. Scenes and details are well made. Enviroment of the linear parts of the game are probably the best ones i have seen. At least one of the best in the gaming industry at the moment. Lightings, music and everything is nicely done. Every single part of the game pushes you to different emotions. Sometimes you feel the disgust. Sometimes you cry. 10/10!
Unless you have arachnophobia or herpetophobia. Gonna say it from the start, if you have one of those you are definitely not gonna feel comfortable in this game in a bad way. There are so many disgusting creatures and enemies you will encounter. And some of them are really common. Game has 3 different small but highly detailed open worlds that have different bioms, side activities that will add more to the main story and different mechanics in it. You will spend around 2-3 hours in each. Also at the start, end of the game and between the open worlds there are unique linear sections that will take around 5 hours in total as well. In total this is around 10-15 hours a beast of an experience.
10/10

4)	OPTIMIZATION / PERFORMANCE:
I am not very positive here. It works fine in terms of frame rates years after its release except some specific areas. But the way it performs and the layering is kinda weird. First of all crashes are common enough to make you angry. Also freezes and program not answering problems are still going on. Rarely but still there sadly. And the problem i talked about in the mechanic section, terrain and 3D model interactions are weird for NPC’s too. I have seen someone teleported or stuck for 2-3 seconds a lot.
6/10

OVERALL: Probably one of the best and most unique FPS games we have seen lately. Not gonna say this is a must play for everyone or a classic but definitely deserves a shot if you are into something different than the other FPS game campaigns we did get last 5-6 years. A perfect storytelling sweet spot between a disgusting thriller piece that will make you uncomfortable in a good way, an emotional storyline that follows interesting areas and enviroments and a super heavy stealth based action. One of my favourites for sure!
8.5/10

Because apparently 4A and Deepsilver released a patch after Sam's story DLC and that patch messed up the base game. You'll likely to get a random crash throughout the game especially in the Caspian level (Third level). The game is already 4 years old, and a bug like is just unacceptable. No effort were made to fix the problem which means the Devs has likely given up on this game. If you think this problem is just me or I'm simply ranting, you can try to google it, lots of people have the same problem as I do. 

This is my spec:  Processor 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400H @ 2.70GHz   2.69 GHz
                            Installed RAM 8.00 GB (7.65 GB usable)
                            System type 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor, Windows 11
                            GPU Nvidia Geforce RTX 3050Ti

Apart from the issue everything else are perfect. Very immersive (what's the trilogy famous for), Story rich, Pretty graphic Ray tracing and all. Again I really can't praise the immersion of this game enough it just so good.

Summary: It's actually a really good game but was left to rot by the Devs. If you insist on buying, please, please, please wait for sales or I suggest to wait for the next game.

Having played the previous two installments in this series (Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light), this game is a huge step up in the gameplay and immersion. 

That being said, the English dialogue is pretty corny. I didn't like that at first, but it became less of a boner killer if I just straight up laughed at the dialogue. 

Also, the Ranger Hardcore difficulty is pretty easy compared to the previous games in terms of ammo supply, but the damage dealt by humans and humans' ability to see in the dark is pretty insane. The trade off here is the player also deals insane amounts of damage.

""Let's go bigger, grander, do what others are doing and failing miserably"". Metro was enjoyable when Artyom was in claustrophobic tunnels fighting against other people and/or waves of mutants and that's why it feels good to play through The Dead City. Metro's story was better when it was about the political struggles. Metro's characters were never that good, but surprisingly, one of the only improvements over the other two this game has is characters.

This story isn't bad, but there's a caveat. 2033 was Artyom's first game, and if we break it down, the whole story revolved around him wanting to save his station. It's a personal story for Artyom, but we may not share his passion for saving Exhibition as we've just been introduced to him. We've had more than enough time with Artyom by Exodus so we (or at least I) could relate to his motivations - wanting to live outside the Metro and later in the story, saving Anna. Weakest part of the story is that it breaks apart if you don't care for Anna. I think the game does a good job of making you care for the characters, since in-between missions (and during them) you'll be spending decent amount of time interacting with them.

I played Last Light for the first time when it came out. By the time Exodus came out, I had forgotten my hate for Anna and in my first playthrough of the Exodus (little over a year ago - pirated copy) I liked her a lot. Recently I went back and replayed both 2033 and Last Light and I definitely understand why people hate(d) her. This game redeems her a lot and other characters are fun to be around as well.

Metro games can be a bit janky and this one is no exception. I had crashes from time to time, which isn't that big of a deal. Here are the three major ones that took me out of the game:
1) Sometimes when I pulled out my map and put it back down again, my point of view would be higher than intended, meaning I couldn't see the road and had to exit the car and get back in again.
2) In the Caspian level, I punched someone and got stuck inside a cage.
3) I also got stuck inside a container in The Dead City level and it made me reload a checkpoint.
4) During Two Colonels mission there's a scene in the 2nd act which makes me crash every time.
There were more bugs but rest of them are very minor issues that I can tolerate.

Another improvement this game has over its predecessors is how it deals with endings. I don't like the morality system in the previous games since some moral points don't make sense at all. I haven't gotten the good ending on 2033 or Last Light, but I have gotten the good ending on this game twice, despite not trying that hard. The contextualization of gameplay in the form of your ending is very effective.

Last but not least, game redeems itself a bit with The Dead City and Two Colonels missions. Finishing The Dead City and riding towards the moon makes me feel things I can't quite put into words. A sense of accomplishment, perhaps? Two Colonels mission is a lot better than (most of) Last Light's DLCs and Faction Pack was the only worthwhile DLC in that game.",1691139257,1691139257,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Morality system yet again just feels... useless

Metro Exodus takes everything from the first two games and makes it better. It's open world like levels makes it feel way more immersive and rewards you for exploring. Each level is just gorgeous to look at and can easily spend hours in them. The morality system on the other hand is yet again very weak. There's really only one thing that can drastically change from your choices, but there's only one true ending. So majority of choices you make really doesn't do anything and makes me wonder why it's even there. This really isn't a con but I had a hard time finding any for this game and the others.

The game is marketed as an open world, but the gameplay and story is rather linear. Think of Half Life 2 and a fake sense of open worldness. Fallout series felt more open world. But it doesn't mean the game isn't well crafted. It is definitely fun to play, the morality system is BS, the way Anna portray her love feels like some kind of Japanese dating sim which irks me.

Also the developers obviously rip the basic game mechanics from Unreal Engine and it is obvious. One of the most prominent ""bugs"" is the running slide bug. If you ran toward an edge you somewhat defy the laws of gravity and get sent flying off the edge instead of rolling down the hill which result in fall damage. Anyone who dabbled with Unreal Engine will notice a bunch of jarring mechanic rip in what is deemed a triple A title. I can't blame them for streamlining with an already available kit but still, it feels bad.

One of the most frustrating experiences i've had with a video game in my life.

Bold statement to start a review with, i will explain. I played this game on a ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022), with AMD gpu and AMD cpu. Let me tell you i have lost count how many times this game has crashed and forced me to restart my laptop.

For the first 6-7 hours the game runs amazingly well and i had no crashes. Then it starts.

Randomly your game will freeze for no reason, i had like 80 fps smooth on ultra and boom, FREEZE. Lowering the graphics does not SOLVE ANYTHING, NO GUIDE ON THE INTERNET HELPS.

Ultra inconsistent game play. The only way to close the game after it freezes is to press the shut down button (turn your pc off) and then cancel it so you don't have to boot up your PC again, sometimes your mouse cursor disappears after a freeze so you can't even press the shut down button and FORCED to restart your entire PC again. Absolute pain in the ass to play through.

I loved the game when it worked, and the previous two games before this but let me tell you personally this is the most broken pc game i have played in my entire life.

I'll probably watch this on Youtube because i was very immersed in the story but holy crap does the game not FUNCTION at ALL. After almost 86 crashes, and attempting to fix every time only for it to crash twenty minutes later, i give up.

10/10 until it stopped working.",1690788958,1690997268,False,2,2,0.495855033397674561,0,True,False,False

		[*]Really pretty visuals.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]Very well put-together set pieces and cutscenes, featuring impressive facial animation and motion capture.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]The story is alright too. It kept me interested all the way through in what was going to happen to all the characters.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]The game has a varied set of characters, and they're all very likable in their own ways.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]Stealth mechanics are not super complex, but I like that they put so much emphasis on stealth in this game.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]The game has a variety of drastically different environments to explore. It really does feel like a long journey.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]Certain player actions can affect the story.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
	[list]
		[*]Lack of polish in certain areas, such as NPC pathing, movement and animation (outside of cutscenes), as well as in the overall environment.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]Lots of bugs to the point of hindering the experience.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]A lot of the time, there is very little reason to explore places infested with monsters, as you usually won't recover the ammo you spend on killing them. Additionally, the meager amount of materials you obtain from such places is almost always not worth it. At least in places with human enemies, you can eliminate them stealthily to save ammo. Despite that fact, I explored almost 100% of all the levels.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]Every time you switch levels the game takes away a huge portion of your resources and materials (for ""maintenance"" of the Aurora). I can't say if it's a fixed amount of a percentage of your materials, but I don't like it. Knowing your resources are gonna be taken away anyway disencourages exploring and scavenging for said materials.

		[*]You unholster you weapon every time you take an enemy down stealthily.

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
	[list]
		[*]The game is way longer than I had expected.
	[/list]
	[list]
		[*]The gameplay is alright too, not anything drastically different from any other shooter, at least on normal difficulty. I have played this series since 2010, and I know the higher difficulties are a big part of its appeal. However, when playing a game for the first time, I don't like trying it on the highest difficulties unless I really like the game. Not to mention that most developers usually balance higher difficulties expecting players to have finished the game at least once (as it should be). Maybe in the future, I will play this game on Ranger Hardcore.

This game was [i]almost[/i] great. I liked the art style, the sound design, and the atmosphere. I wasn't a big fan of the story (mostly because I found it hard to follow), but it was fine enough, and I could see how it would appeal to some. The level design was passable. Artyom being a silent protagonist was weird, but it wasn't too bad. And I disliked the ""morality"" system (dear GOD the good ending requirements are an exercise in masochism), but I mostly just ignored it.
But there were two things that ended up being what caused me to put this game down for good. Even after taking a year long break and coming back, I still simply could not get into it. 

[h1]Oversimplification[/h1]

I like complexity. I'm an engineer; solving practical problems is what I do. Which is why it was such a letdown when I found how little depth the game's systems had.
Crafting was very simplistic. Only two types of resources - Metals and Chemicals. Both are abundant, meaning that by the end of the second level I had more resources than I knew what to do with. Weapon cleaning was basically just a Chemicals tax - hold E on your gun at a workbench, spend a few chemicals, and boom, it's clean as a whistle again. Ammo was cheap to craft, and there was no special ammo types, at least not within the first few chapters. 
Multiple other mechanics were also oversimplified. Radiation is basically harmless, as putting on your gas mask basically negates it, from my experience. Magazines aren't tracked. You can't swim. These are just a few of the mechanics I found to be too simplistic. 
On it's own, this simplicity was annoying, but not game breaking. However, in conjunction with my next point...

[h1]Enemy AI[/h1]

I absolutely [b]despise[/b] the enemy AI in this game. Not because it was too hard, but because it was too [i]easy.[/i] 
I have played games with good enemy AI. S.T.A.L.K.E.R Anomaly had absolutely stellar enemy AI. They used cover, and used it well. They flanked. They sneaked up on you. They coordinated with their allies. They rushed you when you tried to hide or heal. They could chase you. They felt [b]real.[/b]
Hell, even in an ""unrealistic"" game like Battlefield 1, the enemies in the story mode were relatively smart. They did pretty good with using cover, investigating noises when you try to sneak around, and felt not ""real"", but still presented an interesting problem.
Metro Exodus enemies do none of that. They hide behind cover, but they expose themselves too much. They don't move positions after shooting at you. I never felt at risk when I was healing in the middle of a fight. I never felt like I had to worry about being flanked or caught off guard. 
Sneaking around was comically easy. As long as I wasn't near a light source (and you could douse most light sources), it felt like I was practically invisible. They never investigated the noises of their friends' bodies hitting the floor. Even if I got spotted, I just walked into the shadows, they lost track of me, and then I resumed backstabbing them. I never died to a human once. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you're looking to shoot stuff and walk around, then you'll probably enjoy this game. There's no complex weapon maintenance systems to engage with, and you don't have to have military training to win gunfights.
But if you're like me, and you like depth, than you might want to either wait for a big sale (like I did) or just look elsewhere.",1690480744,1690480766,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What happened to Metro? Why did the woke virus have to hit this series?
Theres no traders. NONE.
They added vehicles, stupid. This isnt far cry.
They also added unreasonable demographics, and after artyom meets up with his ranger buddies it is complete cringe.
Only person with russian accent is miller, every single other person besides NPC's sounds like they've been playing baseball and eating apple pie since forever. HORRIBLE voice acting, and the character animations look like a pixar film. NO GOOD.

you go to a swamp.
you go to a mountain.
you go to a desert.

edit: im playing it again only because i played the previous two and wanna finish the ""trilogy"" (exodus is not a metro game remember)
Time to complain, but my complaints come with logic and spoilers so watch out!
[spoiler] also, why the hell did they think adding an american who shows up out of nowhere was a good idea?
miller is always talking about spies, enemy occupation, and the war never ending.
so they decide having an american around wouldnt break operational security.
So Sam, the american, decides he want to go back to america. Miller doesnt say ""No, you might tell the american high command about the situation here and they'll have an advantage""
Nope! He says ""thanks for the help, good luck, bye my not-spy american friend."" 
THEN the american decides the best way to get back to america is to steal a nuclear submarine BY HIMSELF then navigate back to the american coast BY HIMSELF. Submarines are incredibly complex vehicles, and cannot be used properly with one man. [spoiler]

Its so stupid. Nobody reviewed the script for this and said ""wtf this makes no sense at all"" 

Yes, lets take a steam engine on a journey of thousands of kilometres across a surface thats been bombed to hell. No way the tracks will ever be damaged at some point. Thats exactly how it is too. you go aaaaaallllllll the way to baikal and not a sinlge break in the railroad.
they mention how they send a smaller railcar ahead to scout for damage, but come on.
thats inefficient for the distance traveled. 
the previous two games were believable but this is just garbage. 
i liked some new mechanics but adding open world to a metro game was a terrible idea. 
they tried to add features of other games that sold well, and tried being that those games.
what was the problem with the previous two games?

From its breathtaking graphics to its engrossing story and characters, this game is a prime example of how video games can be a form of art.

Graphics and Presentation:
One of the first things that captivated me is the game's awe-inspiring graphics and presentation. The post-apocalyptic world of Metro Exodus is beautifully rendered with stunning attention to detail. The environments are hauntingly atmospheric, from the desolate, irradiated wastelands to the claustrophobic tunnels of the underground metro. Every scene feels meticulously crafted, drawing players deeper into the gritty and immersive world.

Sound Design:
The sound design in Metro Exodus is nothing short of extraordinary. The ambient sounds, eerie echoes, and heart-pounding music blend together to create a palpable sense of tension and unease. The audio cues play a vital role in amplifying the game's atmosphere, making every encounter feel nerve-wracking and intense.

Gameplay:
Metro Exodus shines through its gameplay mechanics, offering a mix of intense action, stealth, and exploration. The game strikes the perfect balance between these elements, allowing players to approach challenges in various ways. The freedom to choose between lethal and non-lethal approaches adds depth to the gameplay, giving players a sense of agency in crafting their personal playstyle.

Story and Characters:
At the heart of Metro Exodus lies a captivating and emotionally engaging story. Artyom's journey to find a new home beyond the tunnels of the Moscow Metro is a compelling narrative that touches upon themes of survival, hope, and humanity. The game's characters are well-developed and relatable, making players genuinely care about their fates. The emotional connection with the characters elevates the overall gaming experience, making choices and interactions feel more significant.

Immersive Setting:
The game's setting plays an indispensable role in making Metro Exodus a triumph. From the moment I stepped into this post-apocalyptic world, I was immersed in an environment that is as captivating as it is treacherous. The diverse landscapes, ranging from snow-capped mountains to sweltering deserts, offer a sense of exploration and wonder rarely found in video games. The haunting beauty of the world serves as a constant reminder of the devastation humanity endured, making players ponder their role in shaping the game's outcome.

Conclusion:
This is undeniably a brilliant in every aspect. Its breathtaking graphics, compelling story, rich characters, and immersive setting combine to create an unforgettable gaming experience. This game successfully blurs the line between a thrilling interactive adventure and an artistic masterpiece. Whether you're a fan of first-person shooters or a connoisseur of storytelling, Metro Exodus delivers an unparalleled journey that will leave a lasting impression on anyone lucky enough to embark on it.

The game has a lot of bugs: Poor hit registration. Your shots sometimes won't hit where you aim, thus alarming enemies and ruining your stealthy approach.
The movement is god awful. Walking slowly will sometimes get you stuck on simple terrain geometry. Walking up the stairs will sometimes stop you whenever you step on rubble. Walking down the stairs will almost always launch you in to the air.
Sometimes voice lines do not allign with the action characters perform in certain moments, breaking the conversation. Sometimes the timing of voice lines with other voice lines don't allign, causing two people to talk simultaneously.

But apart from that, the game was enjoyable. The presentation is good. The story is intriguing and the hardcore aspect of the game, with its minimalistic HUD, low time to kill, survival-esque gameplay and the overall scarcity of resources makes the game worthwhile to play.

The highly 'unique' save system is unforgivable.  The morality system is too ambiguous (this would have been so very easy to fix).  The stealth mechanics are also nowhere near fleshed out enough for the amount the game relies on them.   Finally, and most annoyingly, the devs felt the need to add copious numbers of scripted 'cinematic' QTEs - even when you are traversing the open worlds.
Should you make the mistake of deciding to replay the game, please be sure that you have plenty, and I mean vast quantities, to scroll through on your phone.  About half the game's runtime is unskipable sequences that should really have been skipable cutscenes.

after playing up untill the first 2 chapters not including the prologue and intermittent ones, you practically cant shoot 3/4ths of the enemies in the first chapter (this is also never implied or said!!) and in the next chapter you cant shoot like roughly half of the enemies, those enemies you cant shoot look alot like the enemies youre allowed to shoot btw, also the first guy who stealth attacks you you cant kill which is also never implied!!
and the way youre meant to go about not killing enemies, is by practically being a stealthpacifist for those encounters

its a good game but it feels more like a choices matter game where the smallest mistake gives you the bad ending of a chapter than a shooter game
i know its meant to be the point, i know its a philosophical and story important focus where youre not meant to kill those enemies theyre people too etc but sometimes theyre literally shooting at me for no reason and/or i also want to have Fun without being forced to stealth to get past some enemies every 3 encounters

Sometimes it's even hard to imagine that the graphics we see were not pre-rendered video.. it's actually being rendered in real-time! It looks soo amazing, unbelievable! True to life.

Metro 2033 had been nothing but complete boredom of your guide gameplay, with barely any given freedom to explore around. The stealth mechanics are also ridiculous; enemies immediately go full alert if you did not fully kill, enemies able to spot you even on completely dark places. Until I play Metro 2033 redux, which is a remake using the same system as Metro Last Light, making the gameplay and stealth mechanics slight more bearable. I manage to give myself a try and finish the redux version rather than the original game, but overall it's decent. It's not bad on its own but it's also not good either.

Metro Last Light is supposed to be a better sequel with better gameplay and stealth system. It was originally enjoyable from start to finish, and I even played multiple times for different endings and different approach, only to be interrupted by crash that force me to manually restart my PC. Strange enough, Last Light Redux doesn't have that crash, despite the fact that there's almost no noticeable changes compare to the original Last Light. 

Now, for Metro Exodus. Regrettably, I have not finished the game, and I really wish I could. The game environment looks a lot more immersive, gameplay has a lot more variety, game gives you so much more freedom to explore around, it's everything. It's way better than I expected, and it's so good that I literally can spend so much time on the game to fully immerse myself into the game.

THAT IS...if the game does not randomly crash. My game has crashed like at least 10 times for no reason, I have searched up some forums to fix the crash, despite multiple attempts and it finally worked, only to experience another crash in different areas. I mean I could look up for another forum to fix the crash as well, but I really don't want to waste the opportunity to literally enjoy the game without experiencing another crash. Restarting the chapter to avoid the crash is already bad enough on its own.

My PC specs are high end itself, and I don't think it's my PC that can't handle it, otherwise I would have experience the graphical lags and set the settings to low and be done with it. I would have continue playing this game rather than writing this review if it wasn't for the unnecessary crash.

So, is the game worth it? Perhaps, that is if you don't experience any crashes like I do.",1689729674,1689729674,False,2,1,0.471404582262039185,0,True,False,False

Game play experience was enjoyable as well. Felt like the previous two games but with many quality-of-life features added such as running with the lighter out and being able to charge your head gear at a more rapid pace by spamming the button.

The game did however have its share of noticeable bugs throughout my playthrough. None of them were game breaking, more so just hilarious like when a prompted crawl animation never finished, allowing me to pass through walls and infinitely crawl the map in a single direction.

In some levels it was noticeable that the quirks of the map weren’t completely ironed out with odd objects having collision like the tops of some staircases having to be jumped over to get to the floor above, all the while other objects didn’t have any collision at all like the stack of shipping containers south of the port crane on the Caspian level.

With those things mentioned, my biggest complaint about this game is the boats. Slow, difficult to maneuver/ turn and required too much patience for them to be worth while. Aside from the areas that they were necessary to progress the level, I avoided them at all costs.


All in all, Exodus was a solid game and I give it an 8/10.

My first playthrough lasted for 30 hours and I would like to point out some of the things that I found most enjoyable. Firstly, the atmosphere is unique and well worked out. The story, the characters and the story are quite solid and well fleshed out. The gameplay accommodates both stealthy and guns blazing playthroughs. The decisions that you make throughout the game not only impact the end result but also motivate you to play in a certain style. If you are the type of person who would like to avoid violence, you will do your utmost for a non-lethal approach and the game will provide you with means of achieving that. 
However, it is worth pointing out that some of the mechanics are not as fluid as I had expected and that the dialogues may seem cheesy at certain parts but all in all I don't remember the last time I was so invested in playing through a single player game without the intention of finishing it.
If you are an enjoyer of games that you can play at your own pace, be emotionally invested in it and learn more about the setting you are placed in, this is a game for you.

With its engaging storyline, breathtaking visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics, Metro Exodus surpasses its predecessors and stands as a standout title in the franchise.

Visually, Metro Exodus is an absolute marvel. The game boasts stunning graphics that bring the harsh, desolate landscapes to life. From the snow-capped mountains to the decaying ruins of cities, each environment is meticulously crafted with attention to detail. The lighting effects and weather dynamics create a dynamic and atmospheric world that is both haunting and beautiful. The level of immersion is unparalleled, making every moment feel tangible and realistic.

Gameplay in Metro Exodus strikes a perfect balance between tense stealth and intense gunplay. Players have the freedom to approach situations as they see fit, whether it's stealthily taking down enemies, engaging in gunfights, or using a combination of both. The game rewards strategic thinking and resource management, forcing players to scavenge for supplies and craft weapons and equipment to survive. The addition of a day-night cycle and dynamic weather conditions adds an extra layer of challenge and variety to the gameplay.

Furthermore, Metro Exodus boasts a level of replayability seldom seen in linear story-driven games. The game's open-world structure allows for non-linear exploration and encourages players to discover hidden areas, side quests, and alternative paths. Multiple endings add further incentive to replay the game, as your choices and actions throughout the story have consequences that affect the outcome.

In terms of audio, Metro Exodus excels with its haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the desolate world. The voice acting is top-notch, immersing players in the emotional journey of the characters. The sound design, from the creaking of floorboards to the distant howls of mutant creatures, adds an extra layer of realism and tension to the overall experience.

In conclusion, Metro Exodus is a tour de force in the realm of post-apocalyptic gaming. It successfully combines a captivating narrative, stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, and a haunting atmosphere to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you are a fan of the Metro franchise or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play and undoubtedly deserves its place among the best in the genre.",1689486890,1689486890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game specifically has insanely good visuals and extremely touching story with surprisingly good animations and beautiful graphics with a somewhat decent optimization (some areas like the desert have worse optimization. I had to experience fps drops from 100 fps to 56 fps). Personally I have experienced 3 crashes from this game and that's a shame because I wanted to give a higher rating for this masterpiece of a game. The open world formula is fascinating for a metro game and I am really happy that they used it for this game.

[b]Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)[/b]

[b][url=store.steampowered.com/app/412020/Metro_Exodus/]Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition[/url][/b] takes players on an unforgettable journey through a beautifully crafted post-apocalyptic world, offering a fresh and immersive experience that captivates both newcomers and long-time fans of the series. Developed by 4A Games, this enhanced edition serves as a remarkable upgrade to the original game, showcasing stunning visuals and improved gameplay mechanics.

One of the standout features of Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition is its breathtaking graphics. The developers have painstakingly created a visually striking world that is both desolate and hauntingly beautiful. From the dark, claustrophobic tunnels to the vast, open landscapes, each environment is meticulously detailed, bringing the post-apocalyptic setting to life. The enhanced lighting and ray-tracing effects further enhance the atmosphere, making every moment a visual treat.

The story of Metro Exodus continues the narrative of the previous games, following the journey of Artyom and his companions as they seek a new home in the devastated Russian landscape. The game successfully maintains a sense of tension and desperation throughout, as players encounter various factions, mutants, and environmental hazards. The well-paced storyline keeps you engaged, with emotional moments and unexpected twists that add depth to the characters and their relationships.

Gameplay-wise, Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition introduces a more open-world approach compared to its predecessors. Players are given more freedom to explore the vast environments, complete side quests, and scavenge for resources. This change in design adds a sense of exploration and discovery, allowing players to make choices that impact the story and the world around them. The survival elements, such as managing resources and maintaining weapons, add an extra layer of challenge and immersion.

Combat in Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition has also received significant improvements. The gunplay feels more refined and responsive, making each encounter thrilling and intense. Players can choose between stealthily eliminating enemies or engaging in all-out firefights, adding variety to the gameplay. The AI has also been enhanced, making enemy encounters more dynamic and unpredictable.

While Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition offers an exceptional gaming experience, it does have a few minor drawbacks. Some players may find the pacing a bit slow, especially during the game's early stages. Additionally, occasional technical issues and glitches can detract from the overall immersion, although these are relatively rare and not game-breaking.
[hr][/hr]
In conclusion, Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone seeking an immersive post-apocalyptic adventure. Its stunning visuals, engaging storyline, and improved gameplay mechanics make for a truly unforgettable experience. Despite a few minor flaws, this enhanced edition showcases the dedication and craftsmanship of 4A Games, solidifying the Metro franchise as one of the best in the genre.",1689099817,1689099817,True,6,0,0.609331488609313965,0,True,False,False

In spite of the seemingly endless cut scenes that dominate the early part of the game. Once you get to the Volga, they taper off a bit. One of the people who reviewed this game said something like it's not like other Metro games, and more like Stalker. In a sense (very loose one) that's true, and that's not a bad thing. Problem with the first two Metro games, is that they weren't games, they were mildly interactive movies. This one, starts out that way, then turns into a game. That said, if you are looking for an ""open world"" experience, play Stalker or better yet, play Fallout 4. This game is most decidedly not open world. It's on rails, and you are dungeon crawling even if it appears to be outside. You can't just go wherever and do whatever, but you do have some control (limited as it may be) over how you approach your objectives. So yeah, for the $$$ I paid for it, it was very worth it. I would have paid 3 times that much, and felt pretty good about it. Good game, for any money under about $20 US.

Mastering the art of combat is not enough for this game. You need little bit more than FPS skills to deal with the real situations with very mature logics of game programming. Every bullet, every step counts, every checkpoint will need proper assessment of the situation and plans to go through it. If you die, plan might keep changing until you give up or come up with a plan. Running, being silent or stalking are additional skills on top of combat sometimes. You will be  instructed to use jump button when you run which will help you to run faster. Filter of gas mask will ring just at the moment of serious combat but won’t actually bother you like first two parts of the metro. Specifically, when you leave Moscow, radiation will be bit flexible in the villages. Medicare has real scarcity I would say, wound doesn't heal completely until you take the medicare . Mutants are expensive to kill sometimes. I acquired the train at Moscow in stalk mode mostly but struggled a bit to find cover from the turntable room. The whole game is designed to struggle with securing cover when you fight, expects you to be bit aggressive in some places or totally silent. any wrong entrance, wrong forwarding will cost you excessive medicare. Will face the problem with supply of ammo when you’ll be aggressive. As I said, you will need more than FPS skills of body movement, aiming and covering in the situation of combat. A world class army back-pack will be provided by Russian army, so just have to be bit active to pick up scraps on your ways. Dont forget to sleep at night and assemble supply. Remember the fact that you must learn to pick up ammo killing enemies most of the times in this game. Don't forget to scrap the guns of enemies to use them, change gun when you can't clean it, best to keep a shotgun, one rifle with monocular which is removable. KTEHER rifle doesn’t work most of the times. Puzzle is extreme in the nuclear dump and terminal in the Volga, satellite bunker in Caspian. One wrong turn, will put you in limbo of death over and over. I will recommend to check the terminal on YouTube from people who solved the puzzle, because there is no map of the place in the game. Had a key to use in the terminal appeared to be a fun probably with night vision. Removing the barricade in Volga after capturing the supply ships from the port was really tempting but not exactly hardcore until reaching the bunker of institutionalised psychos. Perfect music and perfect setup for hardcore fighting best part to enjoy. Most oddly Psychos will hold up your gun other than killing you. the last puzzle was to pick up the vaccine for Anna. lucky that it was possible to flee from gorilla size mutants. Enjoyed killing two of these earlier with fire, knife, shotgun, bow whatsoever I had. Wasn’t exactly killed them I believe. Two genuinely world-class combats I would say in Barons stronghold and in the end of Jangle. Had to kill a bunch of pirates to get a boat at the end. 

Caspian is bit relaxing but puzzled. Picked up the satellite map mostly using flashlight to kill insects. Got a car I believe the worst car you will drive in gaming history.

It took me 33 hours. Exploring is key so use you binoculars from a high vantage point to add places of interest to your map.  The Volga and The Caspian is where you should spend most of your time searching around. Surely you can rush through but you'll miss very useful additions for your weapons and gear. I found the metal detector addition to your glove useful for finding loot. Scavenge all slain enemies. And should you exchange your weapon for another one, make sure to scavenge it for parts or you will not have these anymore once you're back on the train.

The Tikhar is a great gun once it is fully upgraded. I found the single barrel silenced shotgun useful in close combat where you want to avoid alarming nearby enemies. And of course the loyal Kalash.

There's different endings to the story depending on how you'll play. I sprayed a lot of bullets so for me it was the ""sad"" ending.

With its expansive open-world, immersive storytelling, and captivating gameplay, Exodus offers a fresh and thrilling experience that surpasses its predecessors.

The storyline of Metro Exodus is a compelling continuation of Artyom's saga, as he and a group of survivors embark on a treacherous expedition across the devastated Russian landscape in search of a new home. The narrative explores themes of hope, sacrifice, and the indomitable human spirit against a backdrop of relentless danger and uncertainty. The characters you meet along the way are deeply layered and evoke a range of emotions, adding depth and humanity to the immersive storytelling.

The transition to an open-world setting in Exodus breathes new life into the Metro franchise. The game's environments are vast, diverse, and visually stunning. From the frozen landscapes of a nuclear winter to the lush and overgrown remnants of once-thriving cities, every location is teeming with detail and atmosphere. The dynamic day-night cycle and weather system further enhance the immersive experience, making the world feel alive and unpredictable.

Gameplay-wise, Exodus offers a satisfying blend of stealth, combat, and exploration. The open-world structure allows for more player agency and freedom, giving you the choice to tackle objectives in various ways. The gunplay feels solid and impactful, while the stealth mechanics provide tension-filled moments of sneaking through hostile territories. The survival aspect adds an additional layer of challenge, as you scavenge for resources and manage your equipment in the unforgiving wilderness.

A highlight of Metro Exodus is the meticulously crafted level design. Each area feels distinct and is filled with hidden nooks, side quests, and secrets waiting to be discovered. The game strikes a balance between linear storytelling and non-linear exploration, allowing for a sense of discovery and rewarding those who take the time to delve deeper into the world.

The visual and audio presentation in Metro Exodus is simply breathtaking. The graphics are stunning, showcasing realistic lighting, detailed textures, and impressive environmental effects. The haunting musical score and the atmospheric sound design further immerse you in the desolate and dangerous world, evoking a wide range of emotions as you navigate the post-apocalyptic wasteland.

In conclusion, Metro Exodus is a spectacular and ambitious installment in the Metro franchise. With its expansive open-world, immersive storytelling, and captivating gameplay mechanics, it pushes the boundaries of what the series can achieve. If you're a fan of atmospheric storytelling, dynamic open-world exploration, and challenging survival gameplay, Metro Exodus is an absolute must-play.

Enhanced version is the way to play, if you can run raytracing. While gamma correction is a bit off, causing some areas too bright or too dark, and there are occasional glitches, enhanced version has much better ambient illumination, less image noise and the ability to turn off motion blur completely and adjust FOV.

Metro Exodus not only has great stealth and excellent gunplay, but also an enjoyable amount of realism, such as the need to prioritize stealth and avoid combat as resources are scarce in a post-apocalyptic world. Weapons also start to wear out with more dirt and mud covered, causing jamming and damage and accuracy loss (the game provides a hardcore realistic difficulty as well). Additionally, the ability to customize weapon parts automatically wins a score from me. However, some design choices of the game are not to my liking (they are not bad) and some are just plain bad.

Metro Exodus has a unique approach to characterizing. The game often has five to ten minutes of just people talking to fully immerse players into the role of listener, from which you can learn valuable insights of the characters: their pasts, motives, traits, stands and thoughts, fully fleshing out the characters and forming a connection between them and players. Some of these stories are very entertaining with clever sarcasm about real-life social phenomena, and I totally respect this immersive way of characterizing. However, as a psychopath who always watches videos at 1.5x speed, I find these conversations too lengthy and I prefer something shorter and more condensed.

The moral point system dictates a good or bad ending in the Metro series. Previous games have harsher requirements such as listening to every lengthy dialogue. Fortunately, Metro Exodus does not require it, but you still need to take a non-lethal approach in many missions, which handicaps players. It is not just me being a blood thirst maniac wanting to kill everyone, it effectively strips away lots of approaches on dealing enemies taking away many gameplay features, and you have to read walkthroughs a lot. While it can be frustrating, the good ending is so beautiful and all seem worthy.

Let’s dive into the bad side. Though Metro Exodus is a good game, the pacing is far from being good, and the lack of long and consecutive levels is the root cause. With levels being relatively short, after finishing one level, the game tends to put players through long story sequences or require them to traverse a long distance in the open world, before they can have another short-lived level of action. The open world session pacing is the worst, with the much better and tighter pacing in late-game linear sessions and DLCs. It feels like the developers didn't have enough content in the middle of the game, so they stretched out what they had for far too long.

Metro Exodus changes to a semi-open-world-semi-linear structure, marking the first open world title in the series. However, the open world is the weakest part of the game. It is partially to blame for the sloppy pacing as reason mentioned, and it is vast and empty. Though the emptiness fits in the post-apocalyptic setting, it doesn’t justify the emptiness itself being lackluster in terms of gameplay. In fact, I really think the open world is unnecessary. Extra exploration for upgrades in the open world can easily be rearranged as linear levels, which not only paces the game better but also addresses the lack of long and consecutive levels to some degree. That said, it is at least better than those mundane checklist open worlds created just for the sake of making the game longer.

The story of Metro Exodus is based on a premise I find hard to believe (I didn’t read the novel), that there are people outside Moscow but was kept as a secret for years. From what I can recall, previous games did not foreshadow this, and it makes events in the last game look like a joke. The transition between knowing the truth and accepting it is also stiff and awkward, but it pales in comparison to the laughable silent protagonist.

The last two Metro games both have a silent protagonist, which was popular in the last two decades. I never found it jarring in the last two games, due to writers taking such good care of the fact that Artyom (protagonist) doesn’t talk, hence they never put him in a position being asked for a direct response. But the writers of Metro Exodus did not have such a heart. There are numerous occasions someone on the radio asks something like “Artyom, what is going on”, and Artyom responds with nothing but awkward silence, which completely breaks the immersion. This game goes the extra mile for immersion and realism in gameplay and storytelling, but somehow, they screwed up something so prominent. In stark contrast, DLC protagonists can talk, and you can immediately tell DLCs have a much more immersive presentation than the base game.

From the resource management focus combat to the bold storytelling design that might not win everyone’s favor, Metro Exodus is a slow burner compared to traditional FPS titles that are usually fast and thrilling. It suffers from poor pacing and a mediocre open world and is flawed in story and writing, but I still think it is a unique and excellent game after all. Two DLCs are also of high quality, with emotionally contagious plots, good level design and new weapons and parts (you only get the silent sniper rifle in DLC). These two DLCs are must-play as I think they even transcend the base game in many aspects.",1685364721,1688395069,True,17,1,0.706708908081054688,3,True,False,False

Graphically, the game is a 10/10. It's fantastic. There's no comparison to its already visually appealing predecessors. The story once again surpasses its predecessors and casts them into shadow. Exciting, incredibly immersive, and extremely emotional, it's one of the few games that brought tears to my eyes. It's a journey that everyone should experience at least once.

However, the gameplay differs from its predecessors and might deter some old fans. There are now small open-world or rather open maps. These are extremely well-crafted, highly detailed, and offer a lot to do. The beauty of it is that there are no unnecessary side missions; there's no simple checklist to complete, and the story unfolds beautifully within those areas. At the same time, there are still plenty of tight and horror-like passages that target the hearts of old players.

Metro Exodus is a game that shouldn't just be played through; it should be savored and experienced. There are so many beautiful dialogues and details that the game thrives on exploration and soaking up as much as possible. The replay value is also much greater than in its predecessors.

For me, the game is a 10/10 and my all-time favorite game. I can only recommend that everyone experiences the pinnacle of the Metro series for themselves. Play it, and you won't regret it.",1688376867,1688376867,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Same is for collectibles, diary pages and tapes get you much better view about Metro world and what happens before-I enjoyed reading those although some of them are really hard to find. Characters could have more facial expresions, sometimes they have their poker face and it looks weid.   Stealth approach is on very nice level, almost whole game you can kill enemies from shadows and stayed unnoticed. 
Backpack modification is amazing and very handy, there should be way how to clean gun via backpack and not only workbench and also posibility to create molotovs on the spot via backpack. About workbench-economic is extremely terrible,  if you dont have resources, you can make them by dismantling ammo but ratio is just bad-for example if you want to make handgun ammo it cost 12x materials and 6x chemicals but for dismantle you get 2xmat. and single chemical. I know that you cant get 100% for dismantling but this ratio is just bad.
Second thing that I dont like in this game is Ironmode achievment-game without saves may be nice, but when you just want to play for hour or 2 because you have other duties, its frustrating unless you go speedrun without secondary quests.
There should be more DLC or atleast short clip what happen with other crew members after final mission. Sam got its own dlc but I was curious if [spoiler]Alyosha get back to Olga and if Olga escape that valley, if Giul free all slaves etc. [/spoiler].

Exodus changes the action from the claustrophobic tunnels to the outside, taking the player through a Mad Max kind of world with bandits and monsters. And how beautiful (well, horrible) this world is. From depressing snow-ridden tunnels to infected and polluted waters, dead cities and apparently peaceful valleys.
Gameplay is awesome. There are usually several ways of doing something or proceeding through an area: kill, distract or evade. I personally like to kill everyone, but I quickly understood that that's not the correct way of doing things. Some people are not entirely bad (up to debate) and you can't kill them, or you'll get bad karma, which will affect your ending. But you can knock them out cold, so that's fun too.
There are a ton of weapons and upgrades, some that'll turn your weapons into precise killing tools. Perfect to test on the wasteland-roaming mutants.
You'll fall in love with the characters, and feel the emotional rollercoaster of their trip.
It is an amazing game.

Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light are among the top 5 best games I played in my life so far. I liked them so much, that I got every achievement in both games, just to show off, and the experience was surprisingly rewarding in the process. Anyway, this is just to say that this bad review is not just about general or unjustified hate.

I had to wait a whole year to play the game because my graphics card was bellow the minimum requirements at the time. So, if I ever tried to play it (even at bare minimum set up), I'd get 15 fps. This was the first bad sign. I knew that I would not be able to run the game at ultra or anything ""high end"" graphics wise, but I'd expect to be able to run it at least with bad graphics. Anyway, I upgraded my graphic cards and the game finally opens!

The open game world they tried to make just sucks. It is a good story (I've read the books), but it did not work so well in the game. I admit that the graphics look very good, but that's it. Everything seems so generic: the locations, omg some of the new monsters just do not make sense in the Metro world. The workbench, that can produce ammo out of anything, this also does not make sense.  In previous metro games, we had choices that would costs us very much. In this one, I can roam freely and see just a few monsters, run and reach my objective. I am at my frist playthrough, at the highest difficulty available, and I feel no challenge.

I will continue to play expecting a ""generic good"" experience, but far from the Metro experience I had in the past. Again, it pains me to write this.

Since I was not already expecting much, I decided to switch to easy to test all maps. I am currently at the sand/Mad Max one, so called Caspian. What was already too bad gets even worse: it looks literally like Mad Max map and with mad max features: scraps and etc (now I see where they got this from). Mad Max is a great game, played it until the end. But this is Metro, it did not blend in well. The story gets even shittier. When Artyom finds Anna, no emotions, nothing. When he finds a picture of the mother of the lighthouse lady, also nothing. In previous games, the story is filled with emotions. Finding the maps of D6 was very creepy in Metro 2033, even in easy. Finding the damn maps to whatever the fook, only spiders. No badass cutscenes. Previous metro games had so badass cutscenes!

Damn the last level, Dead City!!! So good. That last level is what metro actually shouldve been the whole game. The end was nice, all things considered.",1639956700,1687901055,False,6,0,0.523472189903259277,0,True,False,False

Metro 2035 is damn near my favorite Atmospheric FPS serie ever. This time they tried the ""OPEN WORLD"" formula but did they succeed ?

[b][u]Like always in Metro games[/u][/b]:

[b]• Absolute killer visual work[/b], many said this is one of the only game pulling an unreal engine 5 type of performance on Unreal 4, and they arent lying! Maxed out; the lights, particules, smoke and so on, are really, really well done. And all of that with excellent performance on a good PC. (RTX3070ti / i5 12600k 4.2ghz / pcie4 SSD / 4x8gb DDR4 3200mhz)

[b]• Unmissable look, identity[/b], Metro keeps its truely unique aesthetic with litteral tons of attention to details. Recharging the flashlight to make it brighter, pumping my tikhar rifle to send those pellets at deadly speed, wiping the gas mask, patching it with a piece of cloth in an emergency, GOD I SWEAR I LOVE THESE LITTLE QUIRKS AND FUNKY MECHANICS SO MUCH !!!

[b]• The sound design is god tier[/b], every sound is near perfect, satisfying, makes sense. Don't care much about music but the SFX ? Omg, great stuff !

[b]• Immersion, ambiance, vibe[/b] are top notch.


[b][u]But what about the transition to open world ? Well, I'd consider that a mild success only[/u][/b].

[b]• The games starts real well[/b] , the 2nd act in the sandy desert feels weird in the serie's context but that's what they were going for. The game picks back up after that, but the middle part of the game feels a bit out of place for what you'd imagine a metro game to be like.

[b]• Points of interest feel a bit too scattered and disjointed[/b], specially in the caspian sea level.

[b]• We definitely lost this anxious feeling of will I have enough gas mask filters to survive?[/b]  Even on a blind hardcore difficulty 1st playthrough!

[b]• [/b] Overall, exiting the metro to get back up to the surface was one of the best aspects we lost with this open world formula. 


[b]In the end, excellent game like fery few can muster[/b] but you're left with the impression that they missed the boat on what they could have done. An ideal open world Metro game should take place in a big moscow like city, with more explorable devastated buildings, landmarks, covered in that eternal snow, less sun, less desert. I know to make a game as visually polished as this one, you have to respect certain limitations but I just wish they'd stick more to the original look of the first 2 games.


[b][u]DLC's[/u][/b]:

• [b][u]TWO COLONELS[/u][/b] campaign : [b]7/10[/b]. 
Starts fantastic with a real moody underground clean up with your flamethrower, then a way too long narrative sequence kills the rythm, I wish the entire dlc campaign was more about burning everything in dark gloomy underground tunnels but no, they tried the typical ""learn more about the main plot through someone else POV's"" of which I don't really care much. Just let us burn more stuff next time ok ? ;p 

• [b][u]SAM's STORY[/u][/b]  campaign : [b]9/10[/b].
 Really good all throughout, less story focused, more exploration based. Perfect DLC campaign to me !

As the real world goes so disappointing, the story has become more cherish-able than ever.

It provides a reflective, but sober view on what heritage from the Soviet Union shall be kept. The ecosystem of Metro, both in Moscow and Novosibirsk, in the story, was built on fables. Many people, like two colonels, believes such fables are for goodwill, while those who benefits the most from it don't. This is a metaphor to how Soviet Union told their people about the oppression from the Western states- many people, till today, still believe those propaganda are for good.

However, another part of the Soviet Union's heritage was kept. All the rangers are dressed in Telnyashka, an iconic uniform for Soviet airborne troops. ""If not us then who"" has appeared repetitively in the character's dialogue-which is the motto of Soviet airborne troops. In the game, loyalty, bravery, resilience- those qualities on the icon of a paratrooper (or any good soldier) shall be restored, no matter what ideology it comes from. 

The Eastbound train was named ""Aurora"", which was the name of the Cruiser which fired at the Winter Palace in October revolution in 1917. This symbolizes rebelliousness against tyranny, as well as equality practiced by the Spartans in the story.

Also, each chapter is actually a metaphor towards some specific doctrines or interest groups that are active in the post-soviet age. This is different from the two former games, in which main forces stick with a broader, more general doctrine: Stalinism, Nazism, and Laissez-faire capitalism (or mercantilism). For example, the ""Baron"" in the Aral sea correspond to Oil oligarchs that are active in Russia and Central Asia. The cult group in Volga is also a metaphor of the rapid revival of religion in Russia in 1990s. The reflective, holistic view to the game is extremely interesting and inspirational.

In all, this is probably one of the best RPG games I've ever known, except some bugs in the last chapter in Novosibirsk. 10/10",1687848015,1687848015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The chapters in this game are even larger than the ones in last light, with tons more depth and exploration. The weapon augment system is even more in-depth, with you now gaining the ability to customize your flashlight and other gear. Gameplay feels more immersive and the insane graphical improvements over the previous entries helps with this feeling greatly. The story this time around is more engaging than the others, with a cast of characters that all have their own little stories going on as well. Spending time between levels in the hub area just talking and listening to your crew interact is really fun. I can genuinely say that I got invested in the story this time around rather than simply going along with it. A very enjoyable game all around.

The only one gripe I have with the game pertains to the ending, so [b]SPOILERS AHEAD![/b]

[spoiler]To sum it up plainly, the timing of the ending just feels kind of rushed. After completing Dead City and getting back to the train, I was genuinely confused when the cutscene started trailing on like it did. It felt like the entire game got cut short, like they had at least one or two missions planned before actually ending it. It just ends out of nowhere. Still a great game that I thoroughly enjoyed, but I'd be lying if I said the ending didn't leave me feeling somewhat unsatisfied.[/spoiler]

How the gameplay immersive and captivating. How the gunplay visceral, solid and ultimately satisfying. But I'd be wasting my precious time. And yours because you know this already.

No, what sets it apart is its soul. Something humanity only has ever and ever fading glimmers of, the more we venture into the dark forest that is the 21st century. Exodus is unapologetic in its sincerity in a world irrevocably poisoned by post-irony in which sincerity itself has long since become a commodity.

It's ironic then that humanity has indeed lost its humanity, and I am thoroughly convinced now that mass extinction here would be a mercy.

Yet in all this disgusting, disheartening mess there are beacons of hope such as this is. Metro Exodus despite all odds is profoundly lyrical and cautiously optimistic. Unlike the first game which is pure doomer fuel. Whilst its sequel regressing into self parody. The third game of the series grabs you by the shoulders, looks you in the eye and smiles right at you with openness that only a child is capable of. It smiles through pain, through bruises, scars and torn off flesh. In an act of mischievous rebellion conquering fate.

The essence of Metro Exodus is not in the spectacular set pieces, in the majestic vistas or in its impeccably written story. It's the moments of unmistakable humanity that permeate wholly throughout. This is what elevates an already great game into a one of a kind one. A legend.

A single song echoed by two acoustic guitars is worth a countless number of desperate assaults on a nuclear submarine. It made me cry, not just shed a tear. I often forget that I'm human and moments like these, sadly fewer and fewer and farther between, remind me of that despite all this, whatever this is supposed to be, may it all burn in the brightest of flames.

With all that being said, would I recommend it? You tell me. Do you think you're still human, or are you merely in touch?",1687383291,1687420046,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

412020,140466305,76561197969713019,262,183,11,0,11,1687386938,"So finally after getting the aurora edition when it released , sadly as epic store exclusive, never finished the game on there, because my hardware was simply not up to snuff back then. 

But now after years of backlogging the game and as a massive fan of the all three novels from Mr. Glukhovsky, especially the second one and the last light game aswell I managed to play through the entire game, the enhanced edition I might add. And because the EE doesn't have a separate steam store page I had to download another 80 gb of data and play the game for a 15 minutes so I could at least leave a review.

Where to start? I guess I'll start with the original games, The metro 2033 holds a special place in my heart, because I was in college when it released and I remember quite vividly how insanely unoptimized it was back then and how much of a power hog it was. Basically no machine could run it even at stable 30 fps. But after a year or two it was possible to play it and it was a blast. Shame that they remade the game in the last light engine along with some other major tweaks which ruined the game for me, but hey at least we can still enjoy the original, if you bought it on steam you still have it in your library. The sequel, last light is quite possibly the best metro game to date, even after i played through exodus. It's simply unbeatable in terms of raw atmoshphere, the gameplay, gunplay and I dare to say even the graphics look much better in last light that they do with exodus. But let me get back to that.

Metro exodus is a somewhat controversial game, its still a metro game, but it lost it's splendor and the atmoshpere when transitioning into a semi open world game where you have a free choice to explore the various environments and there are quite a few in metro exodus. Somehow I did not like neither of them, the best of them, the cannibal tunnels was just a short action flick where you couldn't basically explore anything. The moscow level was too short, but the other maps, like the sandmap or the taiga level were incredibly boring for me. I did like the story behind the taiga level, the three factions that were basically playing like kids, the pirates, the forest hunters and the bandits. I loved the backstory and it was interesting to listen to their conversations. That part of the game was a definite high point of the game. Unfortunately there is where the fun stops. The gameplay, tedious long boring animations, uninteresting unskippable conversations,, amateur dubbing in english, absolutely terrible...was a low point for me. The gun play still holds quite good, even though the game is much more action oriented than its both predecessors. The stealth is also and option but it's boring this time, simply because of the map and environment design. I hated the part where i had to use the car to explore the desert area. It was tedious and boring for me. I did not like the enemy and monster designs aswell. They were too generic, less detailed than in last light, especially the monsters. It seems to me like this part of the game was rushed by the developer. The change of the engine was imo not a good choice either. Even now with i9 13900k and rtx 4090 there are noticeable framedrops at everything maxed out at almost all the levels, especially the winter one and the taiga one. The game doesn't look that hot either. I even dare to say metro last light looks, plays and has much more atmosphere, it's in abundance there. In exodus it's missing.

Overall I enjoyed it, the story dlcs were surprisingly fantastic, short, but sweet. They added so much to the main story.
I liked the game, even though it's most definitely not he best metro game out there, it's a solid entry though. For me the book aswell as the game is the worst out of the entire trilogy.",1687388009,1687388009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Idk what to say...
 
+-+-+-+-+

Almost alt-f4 -> uninstall it couple of times, but not ragequit, more like boredom quit... Last mission  [spoiler] Novosibirsk [/spoiler]  was soooooooo... boring... sooo... not engaging and dissapointing, it almost blew the whole game.

It's not a shooter (well, maybe little) it's more crouching-tiger-get-to-the-other-side of location (at least it is on Hard). While being a stealthy(?) game it gives u not much of tools to espionage.

Some minor bugs
Some illogic in story

A few too many particles or certain objects in the frame and the game just crashes on a loop. One example was a terminal I had to interact with. A dozen crashes in a row until I managed to get past it after loading the game in safe mode in 720p. Many negative reviews focus on the same problem, so I know I am not alone and this should not be acceptable from a high profile developer.

Other than that, the game is a bit of a hit and miss. There's a lot of beautiful stuff, but the gameplay is kinda boring and the story predictable and dull. Developers tried to take the storytelling off the rails (pun intended) and let you explore an open world, but didn't know how to make the open world interesting. There is technically stuff to explore, but you should really just head towards the main objective. Most of the places you can visit are reserved for a future objective and feel broken and empty until it's triggered. Plan to mop up the stuff you missed as you prepare to leave for the next map, not the other way around.

I think the writing is one of the things that put me off the most. The main character doesn't speak, but constantly interacts with people who deliver forced exposition via long, cheesy and unnatural monologues. You can tell the writer is the sort of person who really likes listening to their own voice.

I think the DLCs are actually where the game was most fun. They are shorter experiences that are more linear and have much better pacing.",1686947995,1686947995,False,36,5,0.581941127777099609,2,True,False,False

The third title too sets out stemming from such curiously, which leads us to explore many more aspects such as gaining knowledge about the other side of the world, forging relationships and growing family as we go on this journey to find a safe place in a very hostile world.

Full Dive mode is straight shit and if you happened to choose it in the beginning, woe to you. It quite literally achieves nothing in terms of making the game more hardcore. 

Stealth's quite shit, not only because it is boring but also made so difficult due to controls being buggy. There will be times where you'll be behind the foe and spam E and still not hit the guy and he's going to turn away and ruin your hardwork and you'll start again to that boring ass stealth mission.

On a positive note, gunplay is good. I enjoyed killing bandits or other people who have zero impact on the ending. 

If you're an admirer of the franchise, go for it. Other than that, it's just plain boring.

Edit 1: I've played an additional 26 hours. The Caspian level is entirely garbage. The atmosphere is quite immersive, it's something UKR/RU developers do without fail. However, the gameplay, that useless vehicle and travelling around the vast desert is no fun. After the second run, you feel like you're running errands and wasting your time. Last but not least, The Caspian is a CTD-fest. I made it past there and now I'm at The Taiga. The story goes great, I wish I could say the game about the gameplay. As I have mentioned numerous times, stealth's so shit, it makes you wanna not give a single shit about the good ending because you feel like massacring anyone who stands in your way. Anyway, I kept on playing as a veteran and nearly made it. But a well placed CTD ruined it for me. What a lame game to finish the trilogy.

In the intro you crawl down into the metro once again and the claustrophobic tension immediately comes rushing back.  A distant clatter of a tin can sends you swirling around looking for what made the noise.  Every hole is suspect, every opening an avenue of attack.  It's exhilarating.

Then for some reason you leave all that behind to go ride a train around brightly lit Russia and slowly row boats around a river.  Tense underground engagements are traded in for well above ground walks in the park.  In previous games, going above ground was filled with dangerous beasties stampeding down empty streets, or swooping in from overhead to carry you away if you so much as dared to stand under the sun.   However, now you can mostly run past the odd group of two or three mutants since the levels don't force any engagements on you.  The tension of being forced to go outside your comfort zone to seek filters has been replaced with breathable air.  The changes from previous games are numerous and for the worse.

It's a shame really, 2033 and Last Light are masterpieces in the fps genre.  If you've never played a metro game, you may have fun with this one.  But if you're coming off of that last stand from Last Light and jumping straight into this then you're out of luck friendo, this ain't the continuation you were hoping for.",1686685408,1686685408,False,3,0,0.405676692724227905,0,True,False,False

Firstly, a note for capital-G gamers. Swallow your pride. Setting the difficulty higher than “Normal” in this game turns it into something of a trying slog. On difficulties where quicksave/quickload is unavailable, some sections may feel utterly trying. Play through without the handicap first, then see if you want to re-experience the gameplay loop with more unforgiving fundamental laws of gameplay-physics.

On non-masochistic difficulties, the game is a blend of stealth-action and guns-blazing-action. You shoot a lot of dudes, and a lot of mutants. There is an element of resource management in that you need to make sure that you have enough filters for your gas mask to survive whatever time you need to spend in hazardous environments, and don’t run out of ammo and healing supplies while you’re at it. 

As a side thing/progression element, you [i]will[/i] accumulate various weapon attachments and weapon variants over the course of your unceasing murderization of the aforementioned lots of dudes. These make the prospect of getting through yet another gunfight at least a little bit more interesting than the base level of fun inherent in capping heads.

Not to say that the head-capping is bad; on the contrary, it’s rather nice gunplay once you’ve got your weapons set up the way you like them. Since ammo is a precious resource, headshots are encouraged, moreso the closer you get to the NG+ Ranger Hardcore masochism singularity. The guns sound and feel good. I definitely smiled once I realized that a significant chunk of the game featured a crossbow. Once you kill or subdue a majority of the dudes in a given place, the rest will throw up their arms in surrender, which feels badass.

The main things, gameplay-wise, that ground my gears were the segments where the game threw frustrating mutants at the player character, and the segments where non-lethal stealth was presented as “the ideal option.” Most of the monster-fighting is perfectly fine, but there is, effectively, a “mini-boss” in one of the later chapters that felt like utter horse hockey to fight, each time he showed up. I was also seemingly too stupid to realize that the monster-fighting in the last chapter could be avoided, and so was likewise frustrated by it then.

As for non-lethal stealth… Okay, so, the post-apocalyptic Union of Soviet Socialist Republics isn’t exactly teeming with magic sleep darts à la Dishonoured. If a guy needs to go to sleep, but not permanently, the only way to make that happen is to sneak up to that guy and press E (for “go to sleEp.”) You are told at several points in the game that a certain group of Armed Dudes What Shoot You are not actually [i]that bad,[/i] but just misled, and that you should not kill them during some mission or another. Choosing this “high road” entails disengaging from the fun gun-shooty gameplay and becoming the Thing What Hugs Heads In The Night. This is bad, I do not like it.

Lastly, this is sort of a take-it-as-it-is thing: This game is heavy on scripted sequences and cutscenes. They’re fine. It’s the philosophy the devs took to designing the game. Some of the sequences are quite okay. Some drag on. How you feel about them depends on your opinion of the overall story.

My first playthrough was with Russian VO and Russian subtitles, so I can’t speak to the English performances or any changes made in localization. The performances are fantastic, but the story overall is almost entirely paint-by-numbers. If you can’t see the obvious twist coming… well, maybe you need a remedial education in plot. The characters didn’t feel all that interesting to me, with the Colonel and Anya especially feeling like cardboard-cutouts. That the protagonist is silent makes little sense especially in the multiple segments where it would really make sense for him to radio in to Home Base. Maybe really immersing myself in literally all of the dialogue that is on offer might have changed my opinion on these issues, but I don’t know. The moment-to-moment writing is good, but the plot and character arcs overall feel meh.

That said, the mediocre plot rides through some truly excellent settings, which might be worth seeing by themselves. The Volga chapter starts strong with the cult of the Tsar-Fish, and it only gets better from there. Exodus goes to the zagranitsa of the Moscow Metro and it’s beautiful out there, which honestly made me a little sad whenever I had to go back underground.

In any case: I don’t regret spending my time with this game, though I wish the writers were a little braver in putting together the plot, and the designers went a bit lighter on the scripted sequences. I’ve started a Ranger Hardcore NG+ playthrough and may or may not report back once I’m done with that.",1686565773,1686565773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved the first two games. 
And the third one is a bit different because its semi open world. 
Much of the time the game takes place in open spaces. 
I thought it would ruin the experience of the Metro concept because its usual linear underground dark tunnels you navigate in. 
This here was different in a good way 
,it was so much fun exploring the dangerous world of Metro, and there was also the dark tunnel exploring. 
The game looked really good and moste of the time it ran really good. 
But i had a few gamebreaking bugs :( 
like a bug at the mid part of 'The Caspian Sea' level when you exit the cave and have to reach the lighthouse by the boat. 
For some reason, crossing the boat would hard crash my game (PC) in the same spot each time 
and from what i can see its a common problem that have never been fixed. 
The only way to get past it was by looking down at the ground when exiting the cave and walking forward hugging the right side. 
I think it took 3-4 tries before I got it right but I got pass it after a lot of headache. 
Also i ran the game in DX12 but after 25 hours of gameplay 
my game started to do hard crashes again this time random but turning my game to DX11 stopped that.
Even thou i still will hold this game really high. 
The gameplay is fun and the characters are memorable

The developers spent a lot of time making the game as graphically pleasing as it can be. However, this means only users with mid to top-tier hardware can run the game and enjoy the intended graphic fidelity. Still, the game suffers from poorly implemented HDR, which results in obvious ""washed out"" colors, particularly black, which is important for an environment that is to be bleak, dreary, and dark. Four years later, the developers have not fixed this.

The graphics are perhaps the only thing to have improved compared to Exodus's predecessors. The gunplay feels weak and fake. Guns don't feel like they do any damage, except the .44 mag pistol. OG 2033 felt like guns had weight and did something against mutant and humans alike. The weapon customization is linear and boring, meaning new upgrades are simply upgrades with little to no drawbacks instead of players carefully choosing what to sacrifice and what to install. The player is forced to carry around a Tikhar the whole game (a pressurized pellet gun) which is frankly OP but boring to use.

The crafting system is also weak: the ability to make bullets, gas mask filters, and med-kits out of scrap metal and glowing mushrooms is laughable. No longer are military grade bullets a form of currency anymore, nope, its just scrap metal and mushrooms that are important. 

The combat AI from other humans is predictable and boring as well. Every human AI acts the same, no matter the enemy. This has been the case since Last Light Redux. OG 2033 human combat AI is relatively good. At least mutants are still fun to fight as bad AI is excused by animalistic behavior. 

Stealth is easily a downgrade from OG 2033, where there were varying levels of light. In 2033, full light meant you are going to be spotted, spotty light meant you are somewhat safe but need to get in cover soon, and no light at all meant you are safe from human AI. In Exodus, you can sneak past enemies in full ambient light and make all the noise in the world and no one will notice. This was carried over from Last Light Redux. Oh yeah, remember the HDR problem? Well, the white-washed darkness makes stealth really underwhelming. 

The main story and side stories are also weak and predictable with over-used cliches from modern entertainment. Unlike the first installment, 2033, the characters and factions you meet are either good or bad, and they all fit into a particular niche which makes the individuals predictable and uninteresting. For example, in the Caspian Sea area, the area is ruled by the oil barons who were around before the war. They and their cronies have enslaved the native population and indoctrinated them with a religion to make them subservient. Therefore, the player feels no empathy at all for the oil barons or any of the cronies, but must feel bad for the native population. It is terribly black and white AND boring. Contrast 2033, the player meets the Bolsheviks and the Fascist factions in the tunnels. The player is exposed to dialogue shared among the common soldiers that gives a glimpse of understanding into their worlds and how they believe what must be done to keep their families safe from radiation, mutants, and fellow humans. 

It can hardly be called a Metro game as very little of the game is spent in the Metro. In fact, only one level felt like I was playing a Metro game (Yamantau).

The player is forced into obviously moral choices, which makes stealth and refrain from killing (at least the ""neutral"" or ""good"" guys) the intended gameplay. At the end, I got so tired of trying to play in character and how the game wants me to play, I just started gunning down most NPCs. Honestly, it was the most fun I had in this game. 

They could have gone all out with the NATO/American occupation and it would have been a much better storyline. Imagine sneaking through enemy lines and outposts, trying to find the besieged Russian government. The whole game would have been suspenseful, where any of your comrades could easily die with one mistake. Instead, you run into a bunch of niche groups: cultists, enslaved natives, bandits, summer campers with their own factions (lmao what even), oil barons, and an endless horde of cannibals (seriously how many cannibals can there be if they ran out of food years ago?) all the while trying to cure your sick girlfirend. *Snore*

It´s a countdown all the time, a boring mechanism that I thought the developers had removed. Unfortunately, this franchise never evolved, like Assassin´s Creed did.

UPDATE: the mask thing is less crucial in this game, or maybe they made it easier to deal with.

I decided to give it a second go and I´m enjoying it.

One thing that annoys me is that sometimes I unknowingly  and unwillingly exchange weapons with a fallen enemy, when I just wanted to loot them. I think the option to grab weapon should be a press and hold mechanism, so that you realize what you´re doing.

But this time you get to the surface too! I didn´t like the contained, underground atmosphere of the previous games.

It´s a good shooter with a post-apocalyptic R****** vibe.

On top of that the story and writing is fantastic, you form connections to your crew in organic ways, and being responsible for the outcome of the story based on those relationships is such a stunning pay-off!

Graphics are buttery and gorgeous, with it appearing like a 2023 game!  A feast for the eyes, with the atmosphere adding to the immersion.

While some may be miffed at the idea of the BAD ends of the Metro games not being Canon to the way they played, the Good endings connect each story to one another in a good way leading up to this current chapter of the Metro Story. Between the comradery of Artyom and the fellow Soldiers of the Order and his wife Anna and her father Colonel Miller, all the way to the world the members of the group find them in and the people and stories that come with them, this game all in all is for me and i hope many other fans a 10/10 in this regard. 

As for gameplay well that does take a few points off it at times for different reasons small glitches and goofy moments, as well as the need to restart the game a few time to fix some control issues (Mostly coming from the boat sections near the end of the game) the gunplay and customization as well as crafting is smooth and easy to use. The way enemies react to light and sounds is always fun especily if you need to clear a path or draw them in, over all i would give it a nice 7/10 mines a few points cause of erlier mentioned issues.

To put the final nail in this i would recommended to anyone who is going to play this please play Metro 2033 and Metro last light and try for the good ending to get the flow of the story, as it will ease a smooth transition into the game and the world it gives you and the people.",1685853903,1685853903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Exodus does remove some of the jank associated with the original games which I do somewhat miss and does introduce some minor bugs and glitches here and there but frankly the game is one of the most polished modern games I've played in the last few years. The story is quite good and introduces new characters like atryoms smoke buddy and vehicles to traverse the varying landscapes you come across in exodus, in the desert you get the beloved hood mobile and in the multiple swamps you come across you get the dreaded boats. My only major complaints about the game apart from the aids boat is the lack of the dark ones in the main games story, keep in mind i haven't played the DLC so I don't know the story there, but the dark ones are integral to the story of the first 2 games and now they are absent from exodus? feels weird to not have them around.

You cannot skip the cut scenes, they are long and boring, really boring (with few exceptions) and no interaction. 4hr 47min of cut scenes that you cannot skip makes this game unplayable. 
Even on my first go it was tedious, sometimes you have to walk from point A to point B mid cut scene. It's horrible. 
Also, I would have liked at least two more maps. Oh and the maps are repetitive. Disappointed, especially considering the wait, and with how stuck up and greedy the creators were it makes it even worse. 

I found myself doing full clears of the maps and avoiding moving forward with the story to avoid the bad dialogue, knowing i would not be replaying it.

i want to play a game, not watch a crappy melancholic cliche that seems written for children but with horror themes.

The game does have a few issues, but only one of the ones I encountered actually effected game play/annoyed me. 
1) When you are driving a truck and hold ""w"" or ""s"" and pull the map out it pushes the camera into the ceiling when you put the map away (just repeat this to fix it). 
2) On the standard version of the game (not the enhanced edition) you have to edit the user config files to disable motion blur and normal blur. 
3) There are a few assets that have no collisions (some shipping crates in the Caspian area) and a few boxes in some places throughout the game that are floating above where they are supposed to be.

I only ever experienced one crash.

If you like to take times to enjoy the small details in games and immerse yourself in worlds then this game is a must play.

Still, Exodus is probably the most fun that post-apocalyptic Russia has ever been. 

...

On the surface, Metro is pretty -- sure. But for most of the game, that beauty hides expertly crafted open-world zones, which are a delight to explore. The game is also a surprise heavy-hitter in terms of its plot, which felt authentic when compared to the vibe of the novels. The title strays from the books' general direction, but the world feels like it has been crafted by huge Glukhovsky fans.

This also translates to a smooth gameplay experience. There are minor hiccups here and there, then some nonsensical glitches, which are fairly easy to step in to, but nothing game-breaking. The core of the loop remains fun and enjoyable almost until the very end. 

But this entry in the franchise has one big issue: the morality system. I'll provide a quick example: throughout my playthrough, I enjoyed all the outcomes that I witnessed. The events felt truthful to the characters they featured and impactful to the plot. Moreover, they felt world-changing, which is typically the mark of a solid plot. Yet, in the end, I was punished with a bad ending that did not feel deserved. 

The morality system in this series has always been its biggest flaw, but in Exodus it hits a pinnacle so high that it almost ruins the entire experience. The choices the player is expected to make in order to receive the good ending are extremely subjective and way too political in nature for it to make any sort of narrative sense. 

But it is hard to lie -- the game was a blast to play. If you can close your eyes for the morality system and just accept the game as a fun and emotional ride, you'll likely enjoy your third visit to Artyom's world. Then, just watch the Good Ending on YouTube and craft a proper headcanon.",1685555612,1685555612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Game play is so much fun, exciting and looking for upgrades can feel rewarding. in a way it can feel semi-realistic since you get them off NPCs out in the world. The way they casually hint at trying out non-lethal interactions in a certain part of the game felt real. NPCs asking you not to attack. The game reminding you the not all situations are worth starting a fight. Especially with anything other than NPCs the creatures can be ammo dumps since they contribute zero drops and that makes sense, they shouldn't have ammo to drop.

Cons:
GLITCHES and BUGS! for a game that came out in 2019 this is astonishing AF. Constant soft locks, game just fully mutes. even tho very minor visual glitches appear, the little stuff adds up quick here. The story is also nothing to crazy and out of this world.

It's a [b]first-person-shooter of the 'tactical' FPS type[/b]. Meaning: It doesn't take a lot of bullets to take you down, so every fight is risky and intense (and sometimes frustrating, admittedly).

However, the Metro series has always stood out amongst shooters by [b]taking this (relatively) believable approach to gunfights and applying it to lots of other aspects[/b] of the game as well: Fight with your gas mask on and it might take damage, leaving you to suffocate. Fail to clean your weapons after exposing them to grime and water and they will end up becoming less reliable. Taking out your map or looking at your inventory will cause you to put away your gun but it won't stop time, leaving you highly vulnerable. Take out your zippo lighter and you'll only be able to shoot using one arm, decreasing accuracy dramatically. And so on and so forth...

All of these little details create an [b]underlying layer of game mechanics that serve to immerse you deeply into the game world[/b]. Metro Exodus thus becomes a highly detailed tactical shooter without ever losing itself in survival game elements – or evolving into a full-fledged immersive sim for that matter. Unfortunately, Metro Exodus also retains some of the more annoying aspects of the series, such as [b]long scripted sequences in the middle of gameplay[/b]. If you're looking for a fast-paced arena FPS, this clearly is not the game for you.

At this point, returning Metro players might wonder: How exactly does Metro Exodus differ from the other games in the series, then? Well, Metro Exodus is the series' first foray into [b]open-world-ish game design[/b]. I'm calling this 'open-world-ISH' because this game is actually a linear sequence of multiple medium-sized open-world maps and some straight-forward corridor shooting interspersed between them. Most importantly, though, the design of the open-world areas is [b]far beyond what people have come to expect from 'open-world' games[/b] made by the likes of Ubisoft: Metro Exodus' maps are detailed and intricate, with lots of unique areas to explore. So instead of working through repetitive side-missions along the lines of ""take out this enemy base... and this one as well"", you'll find yourself immersed in the world, plotting out your path through an area, making sure to avoid known dangers. And you'll do it simply because you'll be thinking: ""I wonder what's over there...""

Finally, a few (spoiler-free) words about the plot: I feel that in recent years (or maybe decades), there has been a distinct lack of games that make you feel like you're actually on an adventure – a journey into the unknown, never knowing what might happen along the way. Metro Exodus does not follow this trend and [b]I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the 'road trip' adventure story[/b] the game offers. Yes, even the [b]often drawn-out and sometimes kinda clunky dialogue sequences[/b]. And I enjoyed the cast, which [b]lends the plot an amount of humanity which you'll not find in many other shooters[/b]. I found myself rooting for these characters, worrying for their well-being and even genuinely getting close to tears at one point. And that's more than most recent shooters have managed to get out of me.",1581450590,1685387007,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The side quests turned out to be boring and repetitive.

[h1]Cutscene can be up to half an hour long, and all cutscenes are unskippable[/h1]
Even after finishing the game the cutscenes remain unskippable, even after dying you have to watch the same half an hour cutscenes again with no option to skip any of it.
In hardcore ranger mode, savepoints can be up to +2 hours away from each other.

[h1]If you alt+tab to browse internet while the half an hour cutscenes are rolling, it will pause the cutscene![/h1]
So you are FORCED to leave computer running the cutscene for the whole duration. Game could of been little better if A4 Games would of at least added savepoints right after the obscurely long cutscenes.

Good example of this problem: 
You die in ranger hardcoremode right after watching half an hour long cutscene? 
That means you have to go back and watch the half an hour long cutscene again, again and again until you survive alive to the next autosaving safehouse literally hours away.

The story for Metro Exodus overall was beautifully done. Everything you did felt like it had weight to it. I felt super connected to the characters, especially Anna. I won't go into details about it because of spoilers but I will say that this game made me feel things towards its characters that I have never felt in a video game, a true connection.

Overall it's clunky, they removed the health regen entirely and enemies have weird phases where at one point they aim like snipers and another they aim like stormtroopers so here is all I can say.

Pros:
- Beautiful game
- Interesting enviornments
- Enjoyable story

Cons:
- No health regen makes the game feel grindy because you need to constantly craft syringes
- Obnoxious ""blood splatter"" effect on the corners of your screen even if you're lightly hurt
- The smallest drops causes you to take damage
- Enemy AI is just upsetting when it comes to humans

I would only recommend buying this game when it goes on sale and even then expect a lot of nuisances and clunkiness that you wouldn't otherwise see in the other metro games.

Sorry for this provocative title but I think it adequately describes my impressions. I am a starter and have to throw some can to distract a guard. I press C and nothing happens. Press C endlessly and ultimately get killed when the flashlight hits me. This is compete garbage because:

1 Anybody can throw a can but apparently it is not possible in this game.
2 I play on easy and things should be easy.
3 If it is impossible for a person with a limited time budget (as most people have) to master the most basic actions then it is an unusable game.
4 To sell or advertise such a game without telling the customer that the game does not work looks according to my humble opinion very much like fraud.

- Excellent graphics.

- Excellent atmosphere.
- Excellent music and sounds.

HOWEVER

- Didn't think I would write it ever in a review but TOO MUCH TALKING. The dialogues are good, the actors do their job very fine but there is just this annoying thing where a dialogue could be at least one third shorter but keeps on and on and on, which is becoming tiresome quickly and makes you dread the next one.
- The game crashes often.
- The game sometimes cannot update the saves and when you start it again it turns out you have to re-do a part of the level. It is maybe not a huge issue but still can be annoying.

The first step: Make a cool, informative steam guide like the one your reading right now.

【S】【t】【e】【p】   【2】

The 2nd step: Once you've made a cool guide, hopefully someone will like it which will lead them to giving you an award. Once you receive said reward after about 14 days you'll receive some steam points (yay!)

A lot of people HATE being forced into stealth, however when building a horror game you want the feeling that you're always the prey, so use a higher difficulty trust me.

A higher difficulty allows you to use force, but simply limits the ammo you get. This may sound small, but most engagements will be running away from the enemy or trying to conserve ammo by hitting head shots in an place where you want to spam bullets so you don't die. It works SO well to remind you that you're really not invincible even though you can still pack a punch. It sounds like an annoying mechanic, but it simply isn't.

So instead of being forced into stealth, you get to choose to be stealthy (at least until you get discovered). This only helps you in the long run and it can actually be nice motivation to do stealth which really helps in the horror aspect.

*Spoilers*
1 negative. There is this device which allows you to track surrounding enemies, I used it, but it kind of ruins the game. I know when any jumpscare or ambush is going to take place. So I can look around the eerie world and be like ""Is a dragon going to kill me?"", but look on my scanner and see there's nothing there so it boosts my confidence. In my opinion, this needs to be nerfed or removed, but it won't be since this game was made eons ago. Also a few bugs, but being stuck inside a shelf with giant gorillas running around or a leach clipping inside your boat until you're at the bottom of the lake only adds to horror so fair play.

I was expecting an open-world version of the first Metro, which I liked. I was hoping for something closer to the Stalker series. Instead, I ended up with too much of a cinematic experience? I think that's the best way to put it. I've only played the first few hours, but it feels like I don't really have a lot of control over the experience, like I'm a passenger. Control is taken away from the character too often and it leaves me just sitting there watching something happen through someone else's eyes. This even happens in combat. It ruins the immersion. It actually happens so frequently it started giving me motion sickness.

The ""open world"" part of it actually just feels like a reeeeally wide hallway where there is no reason to wander and with a world that does not change in response to your actions. There's no decisions to be made, and no way to feel like you're actually interacting with a living world. It just feels like a big pile of set pieces. Even the monsters feel fake, like they're all just popping up out of the ground because it's ""time to fight an enemy"".

I can clearly see how the developers wanted to incorporate the structure of 2033 and last light while doing something new... but the failure to commit to either has produced a lesser game. I think the best example is the continuation of Artyom as a silent protagonist with Metro Exodus (an unpopular opinion I imagine). It worked well in the previous games because you largely met people in passing, but it's just forced in a much more noticeable way with the story of Metro Exodus. Groups are much more diverse and the story feels like there should be a lot more choice involved, instead your two options are to slaughter everyone or sneak past. Your crew too, feel more like NPC's without any method of two-way communication which undermines the genuinely awesome work put into humanizing the characters in between areas. Other minor decisions with location, combat (the AI is noticeably bad for a 2019 release), and the story itself just strips away what makes a Metro game a Metro game for me.

Pros:
*Graphics look great
*Atmospheric
*Great levels/locations
*Good gunplay
*Likeable Characters

Cons:
*There are semi open world areas which you could explore but annoying enemies and your resource management make it someties unrewarding sometimes even punshing you since you waste your materials.
*Some scripts in the open areas can hinder you from advancing in a certain area because it's story related which sucks and kinda breaks the open world aspect.

So basically you got an open world that is not that rewarding to you if you explore it.

*Random requirements for good ending. Without a guide getting a good ending is pure luck.....
*Bad Voice acting/character animations at some parts.
*Ending didnt have a impact on me and the last level was even streched to much imo and overstayed it's welcome.
*Annoying enemy types

All in all still a great fps with some wasted potential.

Honestly I do like the the hub areas, that let you exlore a bit, while still getting the true Metro experience when you go underground.
Gunplay is fun, graphics is great.
New location are really well done, and it helps with the worldbuilding of Metro.

Minor issues like new game plus, occasional glitches, initial launch on epic only.

The story and plot and characters are subpar, and I really wish they did more with that. I would argue that it begged to be a typoe of asembling a new team around the old one, with exploring.

On the other hand it still fits very nicely into the whole Metro Lore with this being a sort of continuation after Metro 2035.",1587557220,1684785752,True,0,0,0.491743564605712891,0,True,False,False

1: the game crashes a lot in random places and makes you lose 10 minutes of progress sometimes

2 : The stealth in this game is legit impossible to play around, Enemies spot you from 10 km and they all have ultra instinct, I never have succeed a single base without being noticed, The game lacks a lot of things just to make the stealth aspect of the game playable. every time you try to kill enemies with a silencer they know your exact location for some reason.

3 : enemies are buggy af, they teleport, go through walls, being bipolar for no reasons  and because of that i lost so many healthpack or ammo in the wind. A lot of enemies have rigged hitbox it's insane how bad it is. They also autolock so easily and never miss their shoots it's insane. they shoot a lot of times through bushes and shit.

4 : The story is very mid at best and in order to get the good ending you must play in a way that's literally not fun to do and is to punch everyone and avoid enemies. you miss out on resources by a lot by doing that. It makes literally no sense why i need to be a good boi in a post apocalypse world when we all fight for our survival. I think also a lot of the characters don't have insane personality like anna and they are just annoying to hear. To say i died for saving that bitch and she's not even grateful about it.

5 : There's a part of the game where i lost all my stuff for no reason and gotta deal with it. cool

6 : the game does have a lot of bugs like that one time where i was on the rail car mission which i had to the restart the game to fix it because the rail car was stuck

7 : the fact you can only clean your weapons at crafting benches is so stupid, why cant artyom bring his own cleaning tools in the bag ? and because of that i had to deal with weapons that hit like a wet noodle in some fights 

8 Filters in this game are almost irrelevant, you almost scrap them all of the time. 

9 : enemies that teleport on you so they trigger their QTE is so fucking annoying too. 

10 : Artyom is floaty af in this game for reason, I feel like a walking soap in some areas and it's annoying to do just basic maneuvers and he decides to fly away or fall to his death.

11 : voice acting is teenage show bad, i just can't take it seriously sometimes. 

12 : who thought it was a good idea to put the knife execute button on the healing button

13 : bosses are not even that hard, Feels like im just wasting my resource so i can move on. 

14 : i had to remap a lot of buttons because they are just too far away of my hand to be comfortable 

15 : The monsters that attack your boat or block your access to it for a couple of minutes is so irritable 

16 : Jam mechanics is fun for realism but gets annoying real quick when you need to deal with huge waves of mobs or bosses, like my shotgun jams after firing 10 shells just wtf??

17 : Trowing knifes are so inconsistent even at close range, there's not even a aim animation for it and you pray it hits 


The only thing that carried the game is the ambience that's like a 10 out of 10 and the art team did a pretty good job.",1684693694,1684735287,False,8,2,0.544362962245941162,4,True,False,False

I'm not a big fan of horror elements but I loved them in this game. Overall, buy it, play it and enjoy it. The pros and cons will explore some spoiler territory, so continue with caution. I have added a lot to my cons, because I'm good at complaining. 

Pros:
-Super immersive, one of the few games where I felt connected with the world and wanted to explore all elements of the map. At a certain point your knowledge of the map can come into play and use it against the enemies, especially if you understand patrol patterns and mutant behaviors. 
-Shooting. Its a lot fun to shoot shit.
-Sound design, the element that sold the immersive experience of the game.
-As someone who played the original 2033 and Last Light, I think this would be fitting ending for Artyom's story in my opinion especially with my ending. 

Cons:
-The maps feel like when you are writing on a white board and after a while your text is smaller than it was at the start. The game is broken into several sections that have a dedicated map to each of them. The issue comes from the fact that the first 2 maps (there was another section between those maps but it was a short section) are open and free to explore. The first map is amazing to explore and learn about. Perhaps the most immersive experience in the entire game. The second map is as detailed but spread out from each other a bit more. The first 2 maps are great fun but it's the last 2 that feel like it became a more linear experience much more reminiscent of the other metro games. I don't like that, it messes up the cohesiveness of the gameplay and it feels like they could have been more than what they are. Especially the last map has us returning to a metro system, which I wish we could have explored more of. The hospital section was also sort of dreadful, but that made some narrative sense because it's one building. 2/3 of the game is great but I think the last part was not as great or memorable.
-Story, there were several moments where you are not surprised that this event occurred. Especially, when you encountered the trap in the mountains like it was so obvious! The story has moments of frustration and also moments where I wish we could have explored more of. 
We had Damir, Duke, Alyoshka (I don't know how to spell his name) and Katya who played some role in each of the maps. I wished we had a side-quest with them pretaining to their character in each map or a companion section similar to the communist friend we made in Last Light. I wished we could have more of them. 
I wished we had a section where we explored our new home near Baikal.
-New game plus is a buggy mess especially if you want to play with your weapons you had in the previous playthrough. Really frustrating trying to get it to work. Plus, I started a NG+ and I lost all of my gear now so no going back.",1684712638,1684712770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because I'm afraid that I will miss something if I don't do it. In this game, there are many places like monster lairs, building ruins. Almost of these places are empty, and we can only find a little amount of materials here. The thing is players travel from here to there, wasting time, bullets, and maybe some medkits too. In return, the rewards are only some materials to craft. And even more, almost everything I collected just gone to the void. So what the point of hoarding resources if you can't keep it anyway?

Exodus is a really fun game. I was a bit skeptical of an open world Metro game, but it was pulled off very well. The environments are very detailed and there are lots of areas to explore.

Gameplay:
Very similar to the previous games. Your gameplay massively depends on what difficulty you play on. Lower difficulties have a lot more shooting, higher difficulties have a lot less shooting and more stealth. 

Story and Atmosphere:
Very immersive world. The characters have dialogue that add to the world, and explain their backstories. I found I actually cared about the characters and what happens to them. The environments are very detailed, and well made.

Performance:
I have about the minimum system specs. The game runs poorly, but is still playable if you don't mind playing on the lowest settings and getting occasional FPS dips <30 FPS. 

Length and Replay Value:
Like the other games, Exodus has [spoiler]2[/spoiler] different endings based on your actions. I'd say most people would probably play the game about twice. For me, it took about 20 hours to beat the game. I listened to all the dialogue, and explored most of the locations on the map. I feel like on average, the game length is about 20-30 hours, not including the DLC content.",1581827975,1684675774,True,1,0,0.508816123008728027,0,True,False,False

Pros
- You scavenge most upgrades from your fallen enemies. If you have the upgrade already, you get resources instead. This was a welcome change than having an inventory just fill up with the same guns just having different mods attached. 
- The story. A lot of the story was interactive rather than just cut scenes. Whilst concise, it can be somewhat tedious at times (some scenes go on to long) some can be skipped. I found it to be a nice change from the usual pushing-you-to-become-the-next-god/boss
- The levels. Whilst large enough that you can go off track and explore, they are small enough to push the game along so you don't get bogged down looking through the same building all the time.

Cons
- As mentioned before, you scavenge most of your upgrades from fallen foes. Problem is, if you miss an upgrade on any one particular map, chances are you missed it for good. ***spoilers*** At one point you can lose some of your coveted upgrades (permanently) due to the story if you aren't aware (and if only found in one area, for good). 
- Gameplay feels a little too linear at times. Some Mods and Gear can be hard to find if they aren't made unmissable. Replayability doesn't feel particularly high on the list. You may get 2 rounds (first time through, then on new game+) before you shelve it.

I would recommend Metro Exodus to fans of Metro games and FPS games in general. 

The good:

The Metro series has always been about crafting an excellent atmosphere. They do a great job of selling the world and up until Exodus, have stuck mostly to the same settings of Moscow, its metros, and a few locations in-between. Exodus brings the world building to a wide variety of new locations, really breaking the mold of the previous two games and manages to keep the same high quality world building and sells you on the continuity of its setting. 

Crafting and equipment management is really good and drives the experience. Inventory management has been important in Metro games, and the ability to craft really opens up the inventory management to a new level. Unprecedented weapon and gear customization options drive the feeling to satisfying management. 

The cast of characters are well voice acted and the graphics are great. Sound design it top quality. 

Missions are generally interesting and well written. I was never bored, and the relaxing breaks in-between major chapters were nice and welcome. I enjoyed the characters. 

The bad:

There is almost no incentive to fight any of the monsters, because they don’t drop crafting materials or loot and you generally use more resources than are returned. It makes coming across them a pain in the open world sequences, and you mostly just sneak around them. 

Without spoiling anything, the “good” and “bad” ending situation is lame. You get the “good” ending by not killing any “innocent” people (even though they try and kill you and the game labels them as enemies). This is never explained to you, and the endings literally have nothing to do with the innocent people you have spared. According to some research, getting the “good ending” requires you to follow some strict guidelines and is hard. I find this to be annoying. I feel like I was robbed of a more satisfying ending because I didn’t read spoilers ahead of time and just played the game how I wanted. 

As I mentioned before, having Artyom remain a silent protagonist is excruciating. He meets many characters during his journey, and they have whole one-sided conversations with him. Spilling their guts and most intimate details of their lives to someone who just says nothing and will randomly leave. The supposed love of your life, Anna, talks to you for long stretches of time without a response. Your comrades will be desperately trying to hail you on the radio, but you never answer. It is just awkward at this point.

With its outstanding dialogue and unique combat mechanics, this game stands as a testament to immersive storytelling, making it an absolute must-play for gamers seeking a memorable experience.

Set in a world devastated by nuclear war, Metro Exodus follows the compelling journey of Artyom, a protagonist on a quest for a new home beyond the confines of the Moscow Metro. The game's storyline is a masterpiece, blending suspense, mystery, and a profound exploration of the human spirit. It immerses players in a harrowing and desolate landscape, yet manages to evoke a range of emotions, from hope to despair, as you accompany Artyom through his trials and triumphs.

What sets Metro Exodus apart is its ability to touch players on a deeply emotional level. The game's characters are vividly brought to life, each with their own struggles, dreams, and flaws. You'll form genuine connections with these individuals, sharing in their joys and sorrows. The game's remarkable visuals and haunting soundtrack work in harmony to enhance the emotional impact, creating a truly immersive and cinematic experience.

The dialogue in Metro Exodus is nothing short of outstanding. It is meticulously crafted, breathing life into the game's world and its inhabitants. The writing is rich and nuanced, capturing the essence of each character and the unique perspectives they bring. Engaging in conversations with companions or encountering strangers in the wasteland feels organic and meaningful, adding depth and complexity to the overall narrative.

While the combat mechanics in Metro Exodus may differ from traditional shooters, they offer a refreshing and challenging experience. Survival and resource management play a crucial role, as stealth and strategic thinking become essential for success. Adapting to these mechanics might pose a slight difficulty curve, but the payoff is immense. Engaging in intense firefights and facing off against hostile creatures and factions becomes deeply rewarding and exhilarating.

In conclusion, Metro Exodus delivers a captivating and unforgettable journey through its fantastic story, touching moments, outstanding dialogue, and unique combat mechanics. Despite the initial learning curve for combat, this game is a must-play for anyone seeking an immersive and thought-provoking gaming experience. Prepare to be swept away by the haunting beauty and emotional depth of Metro Exodus.",1684445969,1684445969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think about 1/4th of my playtime was troubleshooting the issues I ran into which had some of the most maddening and odd fixes to them. I encountered: 

A bug at the mid part of The Caspian Sea when you exit the cave and have to reach the lighthouse by the boat. For some reason, crossing the boat would lock up my game. The only way I fixed it was by forcing the game into ""Safe Mode"", looking down at the ground when exiting the cave and walking forward hugging the right side. The hitrate isn't 100% (I think it took 3-4 tries before I got it right) but I got pass it after a lot of headache.

A bug at the end of The Caspian Sea where the level transition would crash my game. I noticed some missing dialogue at the final cutscene for that part and knew my most recent auto saves were corrupted by [spoiler] enemies not spawning in to the kill room and my ally just being gone [/spoiler] so I had to go back to my most recent auto save [i] 3 hours back [/i] Also... One manual save slot!? Really?! I honestly expected better. But, I somehow fixed it, which I think I did by [spoiler] entering the temporary hideout after the train ambush in the level [/spoiler] which gave me the final dialogue and made the load trigger not crash my game

And the final bug being in The Two Colonels after the first level where it trying to load the cutscene for the next level would softlock the game. For some insane reason, turning V-Sync on fixed it for me.

Like, don't get me wrong, when the game works, it's fun. The combat is fun (albeit the stealth is the same dumb shit as always), the gun customisation is fun, the story is good and the graphics look as peak as always and run stable in that regard. But I can't recommend it with all these issues. I don't know if I got really unlucky, but still, beware because I doubt too many people have the patience I did troubleshooting all this.

Just completed for the 2nd time a few moments ago... what an absolute masterpiece!!!
One of the best story driven FPS ever made!!!
Other game developers could learn a thing or ten about game design and depth of lore from this game!!!!!!!
Brilliantly crafted characters, deep emotional story and dialogue, beautiful and dramatic landscapes, a huge, exciting and emotional rollercoaster of a journey, I would recommend to anyone that loves gritty post-apocalyptic adventures!!!

So much detail everywhere, everything feels logical, real life, organic and decayed, wild and desolate, with isolated moments of beauty and tranquillity, so many different biomes the graphics can be outstanding if you catch the sunlight in the right way while crawling out of a dark hole into the world above...
A decent mix of linear and semi-open exploring with scripted action and random encounters, but its the story and world itself here that really excels, the shear amount of detail and lore in this game is incredible, you can sometimes spend hours just exploring the world see what you stumble across, or relax just listening to the stories of the various survivors in your group between each mission, go smoke a cigarette with your friend at the front of the train as it chugs across the land, or discuss the plan with another, it really helps set the stage as your group slowly grows in size!! 
Missions involving team mates actually feel worthwhile, the team plays a genuine part in the mission, covering you, or assisting you with enemy scouting or info on your objectives, You can customise and service you weapon loadout in a ton of different ways to suit your playstyle, stealthy or guns blazing, long range or close quarters,
Choose to kill anything that moves and suffer the judgement and dislike of your group, or go the humanitarian route and try to avoid unnecessary bloodshed...its a really cool game!!!!

A few negatives...
 I got a bit of stuttering as the game autosaves and sometime loads areas, which is a little annoying, I've had two crashes on but who knows whether its the game or my PC..haha
Also some of the initial loading times are inhumane!!!!

Overall a fantastic, in-depth, gritty post-apocalyptic experience with some very minor forgivable quirks, well worth it!!!!

1) Enemy AI straight dog sh#t. I would often crunch/stand and just watch enemy NPCs switch weapons right in front of me and then do a several turns before trying to bum rush me. They seem to be stuck on some ‘if’ loops when facing the player in direct combat 

2) stealth mechanics hit & miss - seems to be proximity based and if you have flashlight etc. will trigger. But the game generally presents NO stealth challenge to impossible due NPC density spawn. There’s no middle ground or balance.

3) game design highly pushes player to explore said open world for attachment unlocks etc. but the world is mostly uninteresting, sparse and there’s some issues with player climb detection and ledges/invisible walls like climbing ruins in 2nd map after moscow

4) frustrating game design choices like stripping player of their gear and forcing players to use crossbow towards late game when most of the game had been building your inventory and weapon upgrades seems very counterintuitive, unnecessarily punishing and jarring. This is compounded by fact the crossbow chapter of late game highly de-incentivise player from killing most NPCs so you’re stripped of your weapons and forced to default back to stealth type gameplay in a semi-open world late game (morality/karma system).

5) expect lots of backtracking and retracing your old steps in-game which in modern games is generally mitigated by intuitive level design to minimise loop backs. Not metro exodus though, The devs here says fu & would love for you to backtrack between your shelters and PoIs where you are encouraged to explore but punished by forcing to go back to explored locations.

6) the game takes a overall dull artistic tone fit in-game asset designs. This means there’s often no intuitive way markers or indicators to the player on where to go. This adds to unnecessary backtracking to point above.

Recommend save your hard earned money and play better games in this genre like stalker (older series but better designed game in soviet FPS/stealth/RPG open world type genre) or Wolfenstein series (if run and gun is more your style).",1684210780,1684210780,False,12,0,0.575179934501647949,0,True,False,False

THE BEST STORY SINCE DEUS EX 1!!! I am so lost in awe. The big and not on your nose turn of the future for Moscow. 

Game has no alert system that works. Sometimes even at night, it will not ding-sound for being seen. Open world aspect makes the AI break or something. Enemy movement on sounds like Zombies and animals come, works badly and is random.

The game HATES violence and will not play a negative Karma sound but instead YOUR people will tell you, YOU SU C K. It is utterly stupid. 

[spoiler]The church is rather fine. On PS5 I first tried it. On PC one day after to avoid bad texture quality or bad LOD with bad flickering.... , my luck ran out and auto-detected by millimetre gaps made me get altered but AI went back to semi alert making it all difficult. Additionally the last 3 or 2 AI will surrender for no good reason but GOD talking to them - they lost most followers. [/spoiler] 

[spoiler] Next one is the Boat. THE BOAT. No common sense. Jump of the roof. Knock down one dude and then JUMP ON THE ROOF AKA SPEEDRUN GLITCH? This is bad. You can not knock out most or any but instead RNG it by jumping on the roof and then sneak plus Anna telling me just to skip enemies and then shooting starts which makes no sense to me. Wooosh all are dead when you get the leader to surrender.[/spoiler]

Players assume the role of Artyom, who leads a group of survivors as they embark on a journey to find a new home beyond the metro tunnels.

The game offers a compelling storyline that immerses players in a harsh and unforgiving world filled with danger and despair. The graphics and visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail in creating the world is remarkable. The game's sound design and atmospheric music also add to the overall experience, making it feel more intense and immersive.

The gameplay is a mix of exploration, stealth, and combat, giving players the freedom to choose their approach. The game's open-world design allows players to explore different environments and encounter various hostile factions and mutants, making the game more challenging and engaging. The game's crafting system is also well-implemented, allowing players to scavenge for resources and upgrade their weapons and gear.

One of the game's most significant strengths is its level design, with each area feeling unique and offering different challenges and opportunities. The game's narrative is also well-written, and the voice acting is top-notch, making the characters feel more relatable and adding depth to the story.

In summary, Metro Exodus is a fantastic game that offers a gripping narrative, stunning visuals, immersive sound design, and challenging gameplay. Its open-world design and attention to detail make it a standout title in the post-apocalyptic genre, and its combination of exploration, stealth, and combat make it an engaging and memorable experience.

Enjoyed every moment of them, replaying them multiple times for all achievements. Playing Metro Exodus felt pretty weird.  Really loved the beginning and the Volga level, that semi open world thing felt so good. Yamantau was great. Being used to snowy surface and underground railways, entering desert felt uncomfortable. Didn't feel like Metro, more like bad Mad Max game. Of course, this is very subjective. Taiga level felt like they ran out of budget, presenting it as an open world level, but it was extremely linear. Last level felt good, like the old Metro games I was used to. Story is alright, choices for morality are okay. I'm glad you do not have to listen to convos to earn morale. Overall, the game is okay, but there's a big problem. 

The game has a lot of bugs. The hitboxes are one of the worst I have ever seen. Prompts for stealth takedowns sometimes just don't pop up. Colliding with stuff while sprinting throws you so far into the air, it feels like your character has no weight. On the second playthrough on the hardest difficulty ""ranger hardcore"" I got locked from proceeding with the game. The ""lighthouse"" crash, how community calls it (I'm not the only one that has this problem) stopped me from continuing the game. In first playthrough I abused manual save, so I passed every crash I encountered (had 4 or 5 of them). But on this difficulty, you can't manual save, you only have autosaves provided by the game. Tried every fix that community presented, did not work. Three years later, the problem wasn't officially fixed.

And of the three Exodus is by far my favorite. So this game is a definite recommendation. I would recommend all three games but this one is the best. 

Here is my lists of positives, negatives, and in-betweens:
+ S tier story with compelling resolution to conflict
+ Both DLCs are good
+ Satisfying gameplay and gunplay
+ Good upgrading mechanic
+ Interesting characters and good character focus
+ Great music
+ Open world/linear levels implemented well
+ Great graphics

-/+ Atmosphere much different than last two games
-/+ Gear upgrades could have been done better

- Being forced to use a special weapon instead of using whatever
- ""Losing your gear"" mechanic isnt fun

One of the best parts of this game is the story. It manages to be very subtle until it sneaks up on you and show how big the stakes are. It has one of the best endings that I have ever played in a video game that even manages to get emotional. It was unexpected but very welcome to see a shooter with such a heavy emphasis on story. Tied with that are the characters. The game does a good job of getting you invested in the characters which further supports the story. I also appreciated how most of the levels were focused on one of the other rangers in your group, which fleshed people out more. 

The gameplay is also good. I liked the upgrading mechanics and making ammo and materials out of scrap, which was implemented well. On the other hand, I wished the gear upgrades could have been building capability over time not having to pick and choose. The guns are satisfying to use although in most of the levels you are forced to use a certain type of weapon or another which restricts you in what weapons you carry. The sniper rifle was also a really fun weapon but unfortunately there werent too many opportunities to use it well. 

The game is a mixture of open world levels filled in with linear levels. I consider it a bold move but I think it worked well, although there should have been at least one more open world level. It feels short despite it being a well-contained story and game. Being above ground and having an open world made it a lot different than the last two games. I dont have a problem with that but I can understand if that put people off. The graphics and models looked so much nicer than the last two games, even if things like cobwebs looked like a downgrade from the others. Lastly, the game features a point where you lose all your gear and are forced to start over, which is a gaming pet peeve of mine. It was tied to the level unique weapons and it could have been fine without it. 

Overall i'd give this game a 9/10 and strongly suggest you play it if you think this might be for you. You will not regret it.",1683440069,1683440069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You know, I've played the Metro games quite a few times. Metro: Last Light is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I loved it so much the first time I played it I played through it 3 times back to back. But this game. I have some issues with.

First off I have to say I do love story, the ending between Artyom dying (or nearly dying) and sadly having to say goodbye to the stubborn badass that is Colonel Miller was truly heartbreaking. Getting the good ending felt good. Finally being able to find a safe place for the people of the Metro to live and live out Anna's dream of finally being able to raise their kids in a safe and clean place. It felt great, personally was very choked up seeing all of Artyom's friends standing by the Resting Place of Miller and realizing that after all of the Metro games and all of the hard work and truly hard times that Artyom has been through, he finally made it. The man has cheated death. At the end of the day, the story felt great. I loved it and personally felt like it was worth the play through.

But with every great game comes with issues. I am not a fan of the ""open world"" type levels. Yes, I do understand there intention and they do make sense for the story, but I truly don't like it. I always like having levels that were more of Point A to Point B but with actions that provide consequences. It was especially frustrating because they aren't even technically open world. The collectibles prove that. On the winter map Volga I missed a Postcard at the beginning. Which was an area I couldn't go back to because I needed a boat, and the game removed the boat from the area so you can't even go back. So really, it wasn't even ""open world"" but the idea is good. Just the lack of being able to go back to the areas you were previously was not great, and honestly frustrating. Now I feel obligated to replay these levels to get the postcards I missed. So in summary, I liked the other games level structures better but that doesn't mean that the levels suck. Because I would be a damn liar if I didn't say they weren't beautiful looking. Even in an apocalyptic wasteland, there were a lot of times that I said to myself... wow.

Now, the most frustrating part of this game was combat, the shootouts were fun. The ending to the DLC ""Sam's Story"" I just ran through and shot everyone but actually liked it and enjoyed the heat of the intense moment. But the thing that always drove me to the Metro games and especially as to why I LOVED Metro: Last Light was the stealth. I don't know why, but stealth is not very good in this game. Some parts it is very difficult because it is outside and day time and you can't find a waiting place. But you make do, and you adapt... but where my main frustration with stealth comes in is this: The Caspian... there is a section where you can infiltrate a Bandit ruled area and eliminate the guards and free the Bandits. You can find a breaker to kill the lights so I did, then I saved. Now it is dark and you can kill the guards stealthily without causing a ruckus. But if I got detected, I would reload my save. But then... the lights are back on. Now I'm already on the other side of the facility and can't go back and turn the lights back off. At one points I tried and when I got over there all the lights on the breaker were Red. Which means they should've been off. That was by far the most frustrating but I have ever seen in a game. I'm also not very supportive of them changing the Stealth Kill button from V to Q which is the same button as the Medkit. Couldn't tell you how many times I ended up healing myself and getting detected then performing an execution. I also don't understand the point of Silencers when I head shot a bloke and the people on the other side of the facility start looking for me when no one even found the body.

I do love the idea with the backpack and the crafting. i like that the gas mask gets damaged and you have to repair. I do like that you have to clean your weapons. But you really shouldn't have to do it nearly as much as you actually do. I'm weapons expert but it seems a little too much. But the system and the idea is good.

Well, I don't really have anything else to say. Metro Exodus was a great game, has a lot of issues to be sure but I would give it a 87/100. The story was amazing good DLC's an okay combat system, poor stealth mechanics and the environment in all of the levels are truly breathtaking.

A good way to leave off the Metro Series.",1643922144,1683402074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright so it is not a bad game. But there are some things that I couldn't get over.
- Like total disregard for the previous games' story or lore. Right from the start the game ditches everything established by the franchise so far and does it so abruptly, unceremoniously, so in haste and with such a bad writing it is ridiculous and a bit embarassing.
-  It is just another needlessly open world turned franchise. The world is sometimes pretty sometimes not. The forest and swamp levels are nice and unique. The desert level is empty, dull and totally unoriginal. The story is dumb for the most part but the dialogues between the missions get better, to the point where you start caring for the characters. Which is something the previous games rarely achieved.

- My main problem however, was that while this is a game with an optional stealth approach to missions, the devs screwed up night lighting really bad this time. In some parts of the game is so bright during the night that it is hard to pretend the enemies do not see you. Which breaks immersion a lot.",1669110480,1683193302,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

They won't stop talking either. An issue shared with your allies: Artyom! Artyom! Artyom! If you forget what the name of your character is, well, you won't forget for long. It's ridiculous: your commander starts talking, and the next sentence, he says your name again, and again, and again, and again.

When I purchased this I was expecting a truly next gen experience with amazing storytelling. With exception as to what the art department was able to accomplish with textures, modeling and environmental lighting; The rest of the game itself is sub par. The animations, interaction and gameplay overall is a last gen experience. The AI even on the hardest difficulty are braindead, the written dialogue is painful and the voice acting... Well, let's just say the voice acting is BEYOND terrible. 
All these things come together to ruin an otherwise pleasant visual experience and brutally batter any ability to become immersed in this title. This of course all comes before the fact almost immediately the game shoehorns you into your typical fedora tipping anti-Christian narrative by forcing you to take on a ""Crazed"" Christian religious sect, for no apparent reason than to just waste your time and shove it down your throat (Gee, where have we seen this before?). Shortly after that the game froze mid soup can toss and locked up my computer, forcing me to have to hard reset. Upon restart I fired up Steam again and then realized I just couldn't care anymore.

From its immersive storytelling to its breathtaking visuals, Metro Exodus is a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

One of the standout features of Metro Exodus is its world-building. The game's post-apocalyptic setting is expertly crafted, with each location feeling unique and alive. And the game's attention to detail is unmatched, creating a sense of immersion that is truly impressive.

But what really sets Metro Exodus apart is its storytelling. The game's plot is expertly woven into the gameplay, with each mission revealing more about the world and its characters. And the game's themes of survival, hope, and humanity are explored in a way that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.

Of course, no review of Metro Exodus would be complete without mentioning its incredible visuals. The game's graphics are some of the best in the industry, with each location feeling like a work of art. And the game's use of lighting and weather effects creates an atmosphere that is both beautiful and haunting.

edit : I finally got the game working I had to literally delete all the intro and cutscene files and some other dlc files in the games files to get the game to even run. 
got the game fired up and its such lazily made. you cant even adjust the aiming sensitivity. the menus are so poorly ported over to PC/mac, super awkward to use. they have litearly like 3 graphics settings. this game is a total cash grab. how this game has 89% positive reviews blows my mind. its literal garbage.",1682423301,1682429180,False,1,0,0.437355607748031616,0,True,False,False

Some scenes can be leanthy and boaring but they can provide you with  some crutial info.

This is not the marker infested garbage of Ubisoft or Witcher 3, but an actual map that you hold on your hand in real time which has nothing marked on it unless you have actually explored the map. The gameplay changes like weapon modding, ammo crafting on the go at workbenches scattered throughout the world are welcome changes. Weapon jamming and degradation are fun additions which I personally haven't seen in any fps I've played since Far Cry 2 and Stalker. The story hits hard especially if you have been following the previous games. My personal complaint was that there weren't many claustrophobic sequences like the older games, but the ones that were there were nothing less than phenomenal, specifically the final level which was scarier than most horror games. However, this is the perfect direction for the next Metro games.

I for one am completely in love with the Metro series, finished all the games, and also read all the books. There really is something about the claustrophobic world of Metro that really pulls you in. Whether you are struggling to survive the merciless radiation filled wasteland, the tug-o-war between the different factions hungry for power, or the mutated creatures that want you dead for all intents and purposes, you won't be finding yourself out of things to do or adventures to partake in. Metro Exodus really upped the ante by throwing you outside the dangerous, yet familiar and weirdly comforting claustrophobic metro tunnels into the unknown. The world opens up and begs you to explore its each and every cranny. The story follows Artyom and his crew in their search for answers. Are there still people out there? Is the war still ongoing? Or was it all just a big fabrication? You are taken through a whole year, through all the seasons, each section of the game containing a different mini open world with different enemies and weather conditions to explore and conquer. From start to finish, your journey is a perilous one and twists and turns happen at every corner. You'll find yourself get invested in your crew, start getting worried when they are worried, confused when they are confused and desperate when everybody begins losing hope. This is the kind of game that you need to really take in by having a few days off and really take your time and immerse yourself in this masterfully crafted world.

On a serious note: thanks to the fact I fell in love with this game almost immediately, I pushed through a lot of crashing, even breaking the game at one point. Let's just say that it's not wise to run over enemies with your car if you have no bullets and leave it at that so it stays spoiler free.

What I would recommend for everyone is to update their GPU driver, if need be - reinstall the game and if some corrupt save files happen - load a previous save. And remember - it's not so bad to (re)load the same chapter, even if you were at the end of it if non of the saves help.

The thing I absolutely love the most about this game is that is so incredibly intuitive that you just know what you should do and where to go, without even checking the map or using the compass widget, without being told what to do next every damn second, like a lot of today's games.

[h1] The good stuff [/h1]

The game is really greatly optimized. I mean, I was on Mid / High details the entire time, and only rarely did my game dip under 60 fps. And my PC is obsolete by today's standards.

The open world is great. There are only two real open world sections, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. But, at the same time, these two sections, Volga and Caspian, are crafted with great care, and attention was paid even to the smallest details. They did go wild with ideas of what to put in them, and their creativity has paid off. At the same time, the linear sections were amazing as well. 

The gunplay is great. The weapons feel good to use both in stealth and loud approaches to various situations, and they really feel like they have the power they should hae.

I am so glad that the devs had finally managed to nail down stealth. Usually in the first two games, if I wanted to get the good ending, I had to go with stealth approach most of the time. However, let's be frank here, 2033 and Last Light had obnoxious and atrocious stealth sections that were a sheer punishment to get through. However, in this game, I chose to do most missions in stealth just because how fun it was. 

One thing they nailed down perfectly was the difficulty balancing. What makes the stealth so great is that in certain areas, the devs anticipated both loud and stealth approaches, and made them both equally viable. In loud approach, you will go in guns blazing and will most likely shoot stuff up really quick, with the downside being that you are just as vulnerable as your enemies are, and you will be having more trouble getting resources for that. In stealth, you will spend much more time waiting around for the perfect opportunity, but the payout of saving your resources for the scripted loud sections is sure worth it. 

The monsters are so great. There's more of them now, some of them are even just good old snakes lurking in the grass. I love how with enough time spent in the open world, you can spot actual behavioral patterns of monsters, be it solitary monsters, entire packs, how monsters behave when they meet monsters of other kinds, or how they behave when they are in their hives / burrows. I also love how Demons are now an actual threat that always looms over you from the distance. If you are in the open world, there will always be at least two demons flying around the map, and you will be praying the entire time, hoping that the demon didn't notice you and isn't flying in your direction right now. I also love Blind Ones, they are actually terrifying, and I haven't been scared in the last five years by a monster in a game as much as I was scared by them.

The DLCs. Yeah, yeah, many people say that 4A can't really do DLCs. And I see where they are coming from, Last Light's DLCs were bad. But this time around, the DLCs actually give us a good story, along with good gameplay. Two Colonels was a tad bit short, but great and well paced with a story that manages to make me feel sad for Khlebnikov's fate. Sam's Story was a bit longer, but an interesting conclusion to Sam's Story (and it was clearly open ended for the sole purpose of letting them create another DLC or even a full game based on Sam in the future). Many people complained about the DLCs, but for me personally, I loved them. 

The english dubbing is finally good, and dare I say, even better than the russian dubbing. In the past games, it was the exact opposite way for me, but not this time.

[h1] The bad stuff [/h1]

The russian dubbing is atrocious. The voice actors were overacting the entire time, and they sometimes sounded like they were applying to become North Korean TV presenters. 

There are many visual bugs. Floating objects all around. Nothing game breaking, but dear Lord, they did not polish the small visual details at all. I understand some very minor visual bugs, but every few minutes there is a random object just floating in the air. That's fine, it's a big game. But what really bothers me is the object displacement in cutscenes. You know, the one thing they should have actually paid attention to. When one character gives something to the other, it just straight up floats through their hands. Because they filled the world with content, and it's a great content tuned to the smallest details, but when it comes to actual fluff that is supposed to fill up the empty spaces in the environment, then they treated it as an afterthought.

The whole sewer section with the big worms in Novosibirsk. I loved the entire game and every part of it, but I outright DESPISE this section, and I absolutely hate it. They shouldn't have included this sh*t stain in the game at all. First off, it's a buggy mess. This was the one section where it took me about four f*cking hours just to get through, because I kept dying to random stuff. My mask would just start breaking for no reason while I was driving the boat, and even when I was shooting the worms on the wall and nothing was shooting vomit at me, THE GAS MASK KEPT BREAKING FOR NO REASON. Then, for some reason, when I got to the second boat in that section, whenever I got hit by vomit, and the projectile managed to hit me and the boat with splash damage, I JUST OUTRIGHT FELL THROUGH THE FUCKING MAP. This one part literally took me an hour to finish just because I had to keep restarting and positioning myself in a way that would let me get a few shots in first before the worms even had a chance to hit me. Sometimes, after the first part of the bossfight with the worms was over, the steering on the boat would break for no reason. 

Dead City was too long. Yeah, I get it, 4A had all of these great set pieces planned out, but this part of the game felt like it was just time padding. The game already felt long enough, but it took me to finish Dead City in just about 10 hours. The entire section could have been reduced down to about 4 hours at best.

Artyom has no dubbing. The DLC characters have dubbing, but NOT ARTYOM. WHY? It makes no sense, as the diary entries in the loading screen are narrated. 

[h1] The unfinished stuff [/h1]

Well, all of the random floating objects in the world. There is too many of them.

The audio balancing. I don't get why the audio in this game is so unbalanced. In one second, the stealth section has great sounds, your stealth goes wrong, you have to start shooting, and all of a sudden, your head is getting blown up by the sheer volume coming into your ears, but then you enter a shootout somewhere else, and you can barely hear anything, because the shooting is now quiet and the sounds are cancelling out each other.

They should have made the boats in Volga a lot faster. They are about as fast as walking, and since having any vehicle in this part of the game isn't possible due to the map design, it is really obnoxious to use the boats. Especially since they are prone to have their handling break at random, which can be only fixed by saving and then reloading. 

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]

Well, here we have it. Exodus has it's dark spots, but the greatness of this game still manages to make me forget that there are parts that I hate. While they paid attention to details, they forgot to pay attention to decorative stuff. The stealth is finally good, the english dub is finally doesn't induce sheer cringe, and the DLCs are finally good as well. 4A managed to overcome their weaknesses in programming, and finally created a product that is not fatally flawed.

[h1] Who do I recommend this game for? [/h1]

Of course, fans of the old Metro games, story-based FPS fans, and post-apocalypse genre fans. Casual gamers might feel overwhelmed by the amount of content tho.

[h1] Final verdict [/h1]

I think devs found more or less a perfect balance between linearity and open world design (at least when it comes to Metro series).
The strongest aspect of the series was always the atmosphere and the sense of claustrophobia and the move to more open areas surprisingly doesnt lose that, for the most part at least. Like the previous games, visually Exodus is a feast for the eyes. Attention to detail is incredible and you do get a sense of being in a real place, it is one of the most immersive gaming worlds there is.
Gameplay wise, Exodus feels mostly great to play. Gunplay feels good and each weapon makes a solid impact making combat feel satisfying. Stealth is, like in most games, a bit broken in the player's favor. Enemy AI is..questionable and it's the most obvious during stealth when you can stare enemy in the face from a meter away (Skyrim style) and as long as there is no light directly above you he will remain oblivious to your presence. Still, it is fun. Another big part of the games is the crafting system. Crafting is simple, fast and unobtrusive. It feels natural to the game world and not like a pointless time sink.
And now, the story. Story in Exodus kicks off incredibly weak thanks to some ""coincidences"" in the narrative and a very ""questionable"" voice acting and writing. It took me a while to get into the story but thankfully the further the story progresses the better it gets. It all leads to a fantastic finale which is genuinely emotional and meaningful which was a huge surprise for me. Metro's unique morality system is back, although this time it's less punishing and nicely implemented. But both the game's biggest narrative strenght and it's biggest weakness are it's inbetween chapters sections which you spend on a train with your group of comrades. Again, this started incredibly weak but as I got to spend more time with these characters these sections somehow turned into my favorite moments. I began to care for these characters, engaged in singing and drinking with them and the moments Artyom (player character) spends with his wife Anna are incredibly sweet. Despite some characters having terrible voice acting, after a while I got used to it and they started feeling real. It reminded me of Red Dead Redemption 2 and taking care of your camp mates, although it's not nowhere near that level of commitment. 
One big downside to the train sections and the story in general is actually Artyom. Artyom being mute was always a bizzare choice especially since he ACTUALLY TALKS during loading screens between chapters. I usually have no problems with silent protagonists especially in RPGs and FPS games but only when it's a game that is trying to make you the player character. Artyom, however, is not an avatar. He is a written character. You are not roleplaying as Artyom, you are playing as Artyom. This leads to A LOT of really ackward moments and turns every single dialogue (and they can be really long) into a long winded, mindnumbing monologue. Exodus is quite dialogue heavy and the characters are actually asking Artyom questions and talk with him (not to him) and when all of that turns into a monologue it's noticeable, it's weird and it's bad. It is the game's biggest flaw.
Another huge flaw is the atrocious save system. While you can quicksave (sometimes), the game mostly depends on autosaves that can leave you hanging in some terrible situations and, while I haven't personally experience this, has led players to have to restart entire chapters. Not to mention, there's a big chance your save file can get corrupted or you may just get random messages about it being corrupted for some reason. 
On the technical side, Exodus runs fine for the most time. It is a demanding game on the hardware but it's one of the best looking games out there. I did experience a few crashes in certain spots (that required restarting my PC) which is not that big of a deal until you realize these exact crashes have been present for years now and devs never bothered to fix them.
Despite this, Exodus' strengts far outweight it's weaknesses. When Exodus fires on all cyllinders it is a phenomenal experience, an 11/10. When it faulters, however, you notice it. It is at the same time both the best and the worst Metro game. It is definitely worth a try though.

The background setting is nice and the game does deliver a good gameplay experience out of it. The plot is not really perfect but it is not bad at all. I recommend you play the first two game of the series first before this one.

Try the game in the hardest difficulty to get the full dive experience, even though it will turn out to be the MOST FRUSTRATING gameplay experience in your whole live because when you die you can only restart at the last autosave but the autosave system is garbage and you can't save manually. 

The greatest joy in this game is to search for different materials, guns, and sneaking in a heavily guarded place. Therefore, with the highest difficulty, beating a level gives you great happiness.

This game has an amazing story.
The graphics are really good. 
The soundtrack is so good and the gameplay as well. 
This game was worth every penny that i had. It has 2 endings and a game+. 
The DLCs are worth as well.
It's a horror adventure game in my opinion. The atmosphere is great.
It was an great experience.

I won't know why, but I put off playing this game for ages even though I loved the previous games and the STALKER franchise. It's Metro, but with so much more added to it. 

Gun-play is the same as the previous entries, so still great. Customisation of gear by exploring points of interest and exploring the world is a very welcome addition. In the same vein, the open world sections of the game really makes me wish for a fully open world in this universe. 

Graphics are amazing just like the first two games. Loads of animations for lots of different situation, you can just tell the animators had a great time with this game. The scenery is awesome as well, one of the few games where I was constantly taking screenshots because of how great it looked.

The best part of this game for me however, was the story. I really enjoyed the whole thing as there aren't any parts that feel like they don't matter or that they aren't important. Some parts are cliche, but I just loved the story. Spending the sections where you hang out with the crew and getting to get to know them was really rewarding in enjoying the narrative all the more. 

I also played the DLCs as well. If you get them in a bundle, I would say they're worth playing for sure as I did really enjoy them. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to play them though, if they hadn't come with the version of the game I got.

Even though this game is fantastic it does have a few bugs and some annoying parts. There were a few times I had to reload as the game completely bugged out where characters wouldn't talk to me or I was stuck floating in a triggered animation. Gravity and platforming is super floaty as well. Found myself sliding up and down ladders or inclines to my death quite a few times. Fall damage is super high as well, so you'll find yourself dying more to falls than anything else.

Another note is that the devs recently released the SDK for this game. For those who don't know, that means mod support has officially been added and the community can make a load of wild stuff with the game and all its assets. I think it should be celebrated every time this happens as its a huge gift to the fans. 

So, THANK YOU 4A Games!

All in all though, this game is amazing and you should definitely play it. All the more if you're a fan of story based shooter games in general, you should not miss this one.

On one hand it gives you a badass arsenal of guns that look good, sound good, and are real fun to shoot…but it gives you so little ammo for those guns that you never want to shoot them.  Then it gives you a relatively big, carefully crafted and good looking open world that seems fun to explore…until you realize that there isn’t enough loot or ammo hidden in that open world to justify its exploration.  You see, the irradiated animals you meet in this open world are aggressive.  They can take a lot of punishment, and they can give it out too.  Oh yeah, and they don’t drop ammunition when they die, so one intense firefight could theoretically drain all the ammo that you spent the last hour carefully collecting.  And even if you do spend that ammo to kill them, they’ll just respawn a few minutes later anyway.  From a resource perspective, exploration in Metro Exodus doesn’t make sense unless you’re killing enemies that drop ammo.  And so, which enemies drop ammo in this game?  Humans.  And how can you find humans in this game?  By mainlining the story.  And here’s my main complaint: if the developers had wanted to give us a linear and curated experience, then they should have just designed and marketed their game that way.  Instead, they’ve made free exploration in their ‘open world game’ so attritting that the player is forced to follow the story in a linear fashion.  And oh man the story.  Now, I don’t need my action games to have good plots; Fallout 4 had a dumb story too.  But Bethesda at least had the good sense to let you decide how you wanted to play the darn game, and didn’t use weird negative reinforcement to corral you into the main story.  Like I said, this game is seriously strange.  Oh yeah, and the save system is literally broken, so there’s that too.  

Now, the curious reader might be wondering “hmm, if you shouldn’t fire your guns, and mobs are aggressive and everywhere, how is the player supposed to move around in the world?”  Well I’m glad you asked.  The answer is: press down the control key with your left pinky, and keep it down until you get carpal tunnel syndrome.  At its heart, Metro Exodus is a stealth game.  The mobs in the world respawn but your ammunition does not – you therefore have no choice but to avoid conflict whenever and however possible.  Yes, you may have just picked up that 8-cylinder semi-automatic shotgun with a reflex sight, extended mag, long barrel, and laser point that you’ve been dying to try out…but don’t you dare press that left mouse button!  Instead, you should hold down CTR, move agonizingly slowly from bush to bush, and hope for the best.  It doesn’t feel heroic, and I don’t personally find it fun.  I do, however, find it funny to imagine my character slinking through the tall grasses while carrying: an empty pneumatic rifle; an empty AK47; and a freaking Gatling gun, which also is empty.  My God, why is there a Gatling gun in this stealth game?  It doesn’t make sense.

Anyway, is this game good?  Uh, actually yeah certain parts are pretty good, and that’s what’s so frustrating.  I feel like there’s an A tier game hiding inside this C tier confusion, and I’ve had a few moments running from cover to cover out on the Russian steppe that were genuinely tense and exciting.  But for every one of those great moments there have been at least ten that were really, really annoying.  And so after 26 hours I am done with Metro Exodus – the gun game where you shouldn’t shoot guns, in an open world that you shouldn’t explore.

If you like shooters with deep stories and strong characters, survival elements, and RPG-style upgrading, this should be on your must-play list. The post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the game is visceral and absorbing and has so much variety. And not only are the settings diverse, but so is the gameplay. The shooting feels good and ranges from stealthy save-your-last-bullet-for-as-long-as-you-can to blow everyone out of the water without thinking twice, and all of it's fun. If you played STALKER back in the day and felt like, despite its bugs, there was nothing out there like it, you might find that this game gets you closer to that feeling than you've had in a while. It's a lot more polished than STALKER (though not bug free) and the worlds aren't as sprawling, but it succeeds in fully transporting you to an intriguing and fleshed-out world. The game's not perfect; aside from some bugs, the various stages of the game are not all equally strong (some feel more closed off and repetitive than others)... but this is a game with many high points and even the lows are still pretty good.",1681102281,1681102281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The exploration part of the game was great, but i missed the cold metro vibes sometimes.

Your choices actually impact the story somehow, by dialogs or just characters appearing sometimes. The game really makes you feel that killing someone isnt a gentle task, and that you have to think before pulling the trigger.

It’s exactly what you want from a story driven survival horror game. The game is genuinely pretty scary at times as the threats that you encounter at any point in the game are still forces to be reckoned with. Scavenging is very important and without proper preparation it is very easy to be overwhelmed in a situation but the game offers clever players ways out of tough situations. For example if you run out of ammo, you can hide from the enemy and carefully pick them off, sometimes the last guy will even surrender. The story is incredibly immersive as you encounter real problems you would expect to see in a post nuclear wasteland for example radiation, drought, and lack of supplies. The game also offers you a sort of morality code in the game by giving you choices to help people or reserve from hurting people even though it might not be to your immediate benefit. This goes on the macro scale and the micro scale. A larger example might be that you free some slaves from captivity from bandits. But it can also be something as simple as approaching unfriendly locals with your weapon holstered, the locals will then start talking about you in a way that shows even though they still don’t like you, your not as terrible as they expected. the game doesn’t necessarily reward you for these actions but it’s those little conversations that really make the game immersive because you don’t get rewarded for everything you do in real life. The smallest example Would be that in stealth you have the option to kill your opponent or knock them out. They both achieve the same function and one does not ensure success more than the other leaving it completely up to the player to decide whether the enemy is worth killing or simply knocking out. Anyway very good game would definitely recommend it to fans of fallout, horror games, survival games, and story driven games.",1681054027,1681054027,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

[h1]New World, New Level Design, New Problem[/h1]

The biggest change in Exodus is that the setting is not strictly set in the underground metro anymore, but has a more varied location to explore. In search of the ideal living place, the characters will explore places from winter wasteland to desert. The level design also changed, previously Metro was a linear game with some small variations on how to progress, but Exodus levels are now semi-open levels (similar to Far Cry 1, Crysis 1, or STALKER). I think it's a nice change but 4A Games implementation does have its problem. Being semi-open feels nice because it gives the player some agency on how to tackle the objectives, but there are not a lot of things to do on the level, so it still feels a bit too linear. The environment is very nice to look at, graphic is incredible. But what missing is that nothing is going on in the world. Let's compare it with STALKER which IMO is the most similar to Exodus. Walking in that game feels like living in an evolving world because of the A-Life AI System. There are people doing patrols, mutants roaming around, and they even interact with each other. In Exodus, it's all static. NPC and monsters will always stay in their pre-determined places and won't go anywhere, it makes the world doesn't feel ""alive"". This is a problem that I think even the developer is aware of because in the later chapters, it becomes more and more linear. Still, I commend 4A Games to experiment with new stuff, though.

[h1]Meet the New (and Old) Mutants[/h1]

Old mutants are back, with some new friends joining. It's kinda disappointing though, being outside of Moscow, I was expecting some more varied mutants will show up, but there are not a lot of variations (shrimps, fuglies (something like the ghoul from Fallout), and fishes (?)). The new ones also don't have a lot of interesting gimmicks, so yeah not a lot to say about this.

[h1]Craft and Shoot[/h1]

Metro has always had a unique feel to its shooting mechanic, and it remains mostly the same. There's still the funny gun that still needs to be pumped and players will still need to scavenge stuff before they can start blasting stuff. There's a new addition to the system, crafting. Crafting is introduced to give the player a bit more freedom on what the player wants to use. You can create more medkit if you get hurt as often, or if you play more of a long-ranged sniper, you can stock up rifle ammo more. The thing is, I don't like this system, it feels tacked on and half-assed.  First, scavenging becomes more of a slog because now you are looting for ""ingredients"" items, not the finished product (like ammos, filter). The game also doesn't incentivize you to craft stuff if you play for the ""good"" ending (you will have enough items just looting unconscious bandits), so I don't find any point for this system. Oh yeah, there's also an upgrade weapon system. You can add parts for your weapon (new stock, new sights, etc.). I like this one, it gives you more choices to approach a combat or stealth situation.

[h1]Sound[/h1]

Sound Effects for guns are still good and mostly the same. Environment sounds are okay. I do find that on cutscenes it's inconsistent, though. Like stabbing sound in the gameplay can feel crunchy and loud, but in cutscenes, it's so quiet. What's unfortunate is Metro was a game that is set underground and previous games excelled in creating this harrowing and spooky atmosphere of the place, which sound effects highly contribute to achieving this. Now, because the game is set outside of the Metro, there are not a lot of situations that need to use those sounds. Enviroment sound outside of the corridor stuff is at worst, passable.

[h1]The Story of the Exodus of Spartan[/h1]

NOTE: I played this in English subtitle + Russian Voice
NOTE AGAIN: There's no spoiler in this review

The Metro station setting in a post-apoc world is always the strong point of Metro. So it's a bit worrying when I was told that the devs will explore more outside of the metro setting, and sadly I don't think they succeed in creating an interesting world on this. Gone are the histories of the settler of Metro, Gone are the conflicts of the Nazis and The Reds on the world, now it's replaced with a ""journey in a post-apoc world"" stuff. There are not a lot of unique spins that you can find on the previous metro game. Religious zealot is the same zealot in other story, bandits are bandits, and such on.

The story, well, has a good base for an interesting story, but damn the execution is so rushed and clunky. Everything happens so fast, there's almost no build-up in every climax scene. This is also coupled with bad dialogue and performance by ALL OF THE CHARACTERS (the Russian voice remedies this by a little bit, but the performance is still just awful). Not to mention this is the game with the most cutscenes in the series. Trying to learn more about the characters is also a slog. 

It basically goes like this: Wait for the cutscene to finish -> stare awkwardly at the character you like to ""talk"" to -> wait for them to tell you an essay about something boring -> Done, move to other characters -> Oh wait, they're still talking actually -> Wait a bit, while still awkwardly staring at them -> Okay, finished, move on to other characters -> repeat.

Added that Artyom is a ""silent protagonist"", it feels very, VERY clunky and not engaging. 

Still, this game is based on a Novel. So maybe some stuff needs to be cut down. Metro 2033 and Last Light also had this problem. But [b]SIKE![/b] Metro Exodus is a totally new story that's not from any Novel, so there's nothing that is ""cut down"" or ""trimmed"". Then why the hell the story execution is so bad!? orz


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

There are a lot of things that 4A Games try in this game. The basis of the game is still good, but the new stuff just doesn't work well. It's kinda hard to recommend this game.

Newcomer to Metro Series, do please play the first game first at least and see if you like the gunplay, if yes, then may be worth a try at a sale

They tried to innovate and expand the gameplay loop but ultimately made it way worse. Not to mention the constant game freezing and crashes on specifically The Caspian level. This game has been out for 4 years at the point and they have not fixed these issues. However, yes I still recommend it.

First off, the game looks phenomenal. I honestly think this is the best looking game I have ever played. Gunplay feels amazing as it has in both of the other games. (I should mention I only played the redux versions) The story is there and I'm happy it continued after Last Light but I just generally don't like the relationship you have with Anna. It's probably just because Artyom is a voiceless protagonist but I feel 0 connection between the two of them. Regardless, I think the story is still enjoyable and the Yamantau level was exactly what I wanted from this game. 

This game runs terribly for a game that released in 2019. Constant freezing in every level when you're in the open map. As I mentioned the Caspian level is noticeably worse causing my fps to drop as well as lag. On top of that the game crashes a ton in that specific mission. For a game that is supposed to be immersive it feels terrible to constantly be taken out of it because the game was not optimized after 4 years of release. 

I want to preface this next point by saying I don't play on ranger mode so it could be different but I really dislike how it feels like I am playing a video game. I hate that there are side missions and materials that you can pick up off the ground. The side missions are not interesting either, they're just fetch quests. I didn't play in ranger mode in either 2033 or Last Light but I was able to immerse myself in this world but here it's so difficult to do so. The backpack conceptually is interesting but it's just another thing that takes me out of it. I also hate the decision to ""hold e"" for every action. Not only is it tedious but it is the most immersion breaking mechanic in the game. I could be wrong and feel free to correct me if I am but in both Last Light and 2033 if you just walked up to a ladder or tight space it would just automatically put you through it! I would be fine if you just had to press e, but no you have to hold it. There is no option to turn this off which I find ridiculous. 

A small point I also wanted to mention is that the enemies can be extremely cartoonish at times. As great as I thought the Yamantau level was, the cannibals were silly. I can understand if it was meant to be that way but I could not take the threat seriously. It felt like I was playing a borderlands game blasting some psychos. I will say though I do find it really cool that they will call out where you are and this is a huge plus to immersion. 

I'm so sad that this game did not live up to the amazing games that are Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light. This game is just a complete and utter disappoint to me. I really hope that the next game in the series is closer to those two games than this one. That's most likely not going to happen but I can hope. If you are a big fan of metro I still think this game is worth buying just don't expect it to be as good as the others.

Final thoughts after finishing the story - Honestly the final sequence of the game was amazing. It finally felt like I was playing a metro game again and it was magnificent. The Taiga level was also by far my favorite level and the most fun. I think that Volga and Caspian were interesting ideas but I don't really want to see content like that in another metro game. I had a significantly more enjoyable time in the linear levels than any of the open world levels. Overall, everything else I said in this review still remains true but this game is definitely less of a disappointment. I really wish there was a mixed option because I think this game is still worth playing no matter what; despite it still being a let down compared to the other games in the series.",1680662428,1680781111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Flaws and Nitpicks[/h1]
However, there are still some things I disliked or downright despised.

The stealth is still half-baked. You still cant move bodies, a staple in all *real* stealth games. And then the game cant make up its mind if they want you to use stealth because sometimes enemies will just be alerted because ""story"". And they also do the thing where every enemy knows where you are when one enemy sees you. And enemies will go from being almost blind in the dark to better than 20/20 vision the second you enter alert state. Overall the stealth is barely passable.

The game also cant make up its mind if it is a survival game, a regular shooter, or a stealth game. The game will just disable stealth and throw tons of items at you when you're in a ""shooter"" section. But then the story decides you're in a stealth section and demands you not kill anyone. And then you get to explore the world and the survival elements actually matter a little. I guess it's not really a huge issue, but it just feels weird.

My last gripe is the over-reliance on quick time events and cutscene actions. It's so frustrating to be playing the game and the game decides to lock you in a poorly named ""quicktime event"" that makes you mash a button, as the exact same cookie-cutter animation plays for way too long. It's the exact opposite of a doom glory kill. And sometimes the game grabs control to force you to make stupid decisions so the ""story"" can play out. I have a message for the developers: In as much as you are able, DO NOT DO THIS NEXT GAME. See Callisto Protocol if you need another example of why this crap is unacceptable.

One of the strongest aspects of the Metro franchise was its atmosphere, as for post apocalyptic games there is nothing that comes close. In the transition to an open-world game I did not feel as the quality of the atmosphere dropped, but rather improved upon it. The hand-crafted environments give the appropriate emotion for each setting. From crazed swamp hicks to cannibals the game made each with respect to how it would be in post-Russia. 

Story: 8/10, That story is straight forward but its grounded connection to the relationships between characters is what creates the immersive atmosphere. For a silent protagonist (besides journals) I think they did a great job of putting you into the character, with an emphasis on dialogue and everyday actions. Compared to the previous games this one strays away from the ""Dark ones"" and focuses more on the dreams and aspirations of Artyom and Miller, which for better or worst, makes the world closer to reality.

Gameplay: 8.5/10, Another one of the strongest aspects of the game is its first-person survival horror elements. For someone like myself I love the small touches of cleaning your gun, gas mask, and charging your batteries. Playing this game on Spartan hardcore (the one that gives some HUD), contributed greatly to the immersion of the game, and while I see only around 3% of people finished the game with this setting. I would recommend at any skill level to play on this difficulty. While you die in a couple of shots the AI is rather easy to manipulate and gives you a sense of urgency and avoid bullet sponge tropes. Gathering and collecting resources to craft ammo and survival equipment also added the sense of scarcity, this conservative mindset changes the dynamic of interactions, should I stealth past? Or risk some of my ammo to take this fight. My only downside to some of the combat was the boss battles which took away from some the creative ways to solve problems from the game and changed it to a simple firefight. 

Music and Sounds: 9.5/10, another must have in the franchise, I'm very happy with the soundscape considering the differences with environments in previous games. The music added to the setting and worked in conjuction with the ambience. Having to work with such a diverse set of environments was a challenge and I believed they did a great job transitioning out of the ""metro"". No complaints from me.

Graphics 9.5/10, I have a 2070 Super which at the time of release was one of the top cards, I didn't play the enhanced edition considering it would reset my progress, but with how good the base game looked. I am very happy even without RTX mode on. This makes me want to save up for a 4080 when the budget allowed me! Also, depending on what monitor you have will greatly affect how the game looks. I have a nice 1440p LG monitor for around $500 however, this monitor sucks with dark environments which was a total bummer since it gives a ""bleached"" look. Regardless, the game still looked good with this defect.

Overall 9/10: I'm happy to see that even after two games of similar nature, they still managed to make a refreshing post-apocalyptic title.

The first few hours were unremarkable, but enjoyable enough. The opening felt like a good return to classic metro, with familiar claustrophobia-inducing metro tunnels, mutants and some decent set pieces. Acquiring the train was fun, and the first “real” chapter by the Volga river is not bad. The shooting and the stealth mechanics haven't worn out their welcome yet, and there are some engaging side quests involving a teddy bear and a guitar. Plus, the exploration felt rewarding. For me though, there was a distinct lack of atmosphere, since it mostly took place in wide open areas in the daytime. I also didn't care much for the paper thin characters and story. The voice acting is not great (I made the correct choice by switching the language to Russian halfway through), and characters constantly talk over eachother, resulting in very stilted and awkward exchanges. I longed for an option to skip these conversations on the train. 

However, the following chapter, Yamantau, is bad. There’s no other way to go about it. On the story end it’s the most predictable turn of events imaginable (you get tricked by a group pretending to be the remaining members of the government. Surprise surprise, they’re actually cannibals) and it turns into a shooting gallery set to russian heavy metal music? You’re shooting hordes of goons in tight corridors for 30+ minutes. In another game like F.E.A.R., that would be great, since the combat in that game is strong enough to carry it entirely. On the other hand, I would call Metro combat functional, but not good.

- Most weapons feel floaty and underpowered.

- Enemies hardly react to getting shot, leading to very little in terms of satisfying player feedback. This is worsened when you take into account that many enemies, especially mutants, are bullet sponges.

- The AI is rarely good enough to make for engaging foes. Enemies constantly hide behind non-existent cover, and very rarely surprise you. 

- World bullet collision is often inconsistent with what you actually see. Get used to bullets not hitting your target, even though your line of sight is completely unobstructed. 

With this in mind, I don’t think it was a good idea to lean so heavily on the combat in this area. You're throwing away any immersion and atmosphere for mid-tier shooting. I get that this area was probably meant as a change of pace. I do like variety, but I don’t like when the new pace just sucks, frankly.

It was at this point the game turned into a slog, especially during the Caspian desert. Just hours and hours of filler walking or driving through barren locations trying to get to the mission area. There is less interesting content than Volga, stretched over a much bigger map. Some missions are decent, and are a clear callback to the style of the earlier games. Though, these areas cannot compare in the slightest to the highlights from 2033. The worst missions are the ones where you’re forced to follow an uninteresting companion with the walking speed of an old, confused tortoise. I know this happened sometimes in 2033 too, but it was less of a problem in that case since it didn’t feel like that game was actively trying to waste my time outside of these moments. There are also some bugs here which range from annoying (if you check your map while driving, your FOV will double and your camera will be placed in the roof of your car) to gamebreaking (some areas can apparently ruin save files). The boss fights in Caspian and Taiga are legitimately atrocious, too. Dumping 40 crossbow bolts into a bear, twice, while circle-strafing sure is fun! Again, the combat is not very good – why put so much emphasis on it?

I did find some enjoyment in the very last level of the game, thanks to some good tension-building and the welcome return of the librarians, but it was too little, too late.

I wouldn't say this is a terrible game by any means, but it did not appeal to me. The open world undermines the atmosphere which made the earlier titles so engrossing for me, and the game doesn't improve on other fronts like the combat or storytelling to make up for this loss.",1680035642,1680035642,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been a fan of the Metro Trilogy for a very long time, and I have to say Metro Exodus is quite a different style than 2033 and Last Light. It is an open world phenomenon and I'm still taking my very time to enjoy as much as I can of the game. The graphics, even on my shitbox of a laptop, is gorgeous, and I'm not even playing on the PC Enhanced edition. 
I may be slightly biased, but if you are a fan of FPS games, you will love this game. 
Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Alexey Omelchuk's musical composition is amazing. I love each and every piece in the Exodus soundtrack, as well as the songs in the 2033 and Last Light soundtrack's. 
The story of the Metro Trilogy is based off of Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro 2033, Metro 2034, and Metro 2035. I highly recommend reading them, they are great books.

Too many unskippable Cut-scenes and everything moves too slow. Good Grief. Even changing game options takes forever to load. You make any Graphical Changes and you hit apply, there's a % loading screen to apply changes. You move for 1 - 5 minutes and there's a new Cut-scene you can't you can't skip. It's not like the actual gameplay is worth it either. Rules of interacting in the environment around you don't make sense. The Actions is short lived and everything feels sluggish and awkward.

Even though, unintentionally, I beat the game on the bad ending. Guess it's still kind of a plus considering the few characters of past games come to haunt Artyom and you get to see them again, however briefly and with a bit of dark solemn eternal damnation aboard a train thrown in.
This Metro trilogy is one of the best video game franchises of all time. Dark, brooding enclosed spaces of the first two and then opening itself to a world that was never really totally dead in the third one. A chance for a new future. Haha but I got the bad ending.

Stealth is complete crap. Plain and simple. Sometimes specific enemies will see you..sometimes they won't, under the same circumstances. Highly irritating because you have no idea what you can get away with. On top of that, the knockdown/stealth kill prompt is completely bugged. It will simply not appear a lot of the time leaving you to panic kill. It sucks making through 90% of a Volga checkpoint only to have this bug ruin it. Also, trying to go down stairs? not possible in Metro unless you walk backwards or tap the forward button. Otherwise you'll jump straight off the stairs and get injured or die because the fall damage starts at Artyoms height. Again completely irritating. Had more than 10 solid freezes where I had to reset my PC and tons of CTDs.

I have so much bad stuff to say about this game it's unreal. Low res PS 3 grade textures, awful large maps where your forced to use a buggy POS beater van. I'll add; The van is not only crap, but also buggy. I've had to get out and come back into it numerous times because of a FoV bug that would happen every time I was driving it. 

Like WTF...an iron man mode where dying can set you back 4+ hours? how cocky can you be about this buggy PoS. Its now years after release and the fact they've left it like this says a lot about these guys. This game rode on the coattails of the other Metro's and if wasn't for the great story behind it, it would've been a complete bomber. 4A can make a corridor shooter fine. But when it come's to more open worlds, they prove to not give games the attention they need in order to be a fun experience. 

Fallout 4 has WAY less bugs than this PoS

I'll finish it...but it's gunna be painful.

I've revised my review...the stories worth playing through 100% and the last level rebuttled the bugs from the last 2. I would say to entire levels in this game were an absolute nightmare dealing with the bugs...I'm sure on lower difficulties and more saves in The Caspian it would be more tolerable. But again..this game requires tons of working around bugs and trial and error to beat Hardcore ranger mode. I've lost 2-3 hours of gameplay because I couldn't find a save zone in The Caspian. The Taiga's a different kind've buggy...I lost Damir because I unknowingly killed one slave after freeing them all....didn't find out what that meant until later. I still got the good ending(which was quite good) and am actually happy a developer finished a game properly. I'm sure most of the positives about this game are due to Dmitry Glukovsky's work.

Metro Exodus (ME) is a first-person shooter game with survival horror and stealth elements. It has been developed by the company 4A Games and published by the company Deep Silver.

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ Journey across the post-apocalyptic Russia on a train with your heavily armed friends. Revisit the claustrophobic tunnels of Moscow, shake hands with cultists on Volga's frozen tundra, liberate slaves in the desert of the Caspian, play hide and seek with the tribes in Taiga's lush forests, and sneak around blind gorillas within the irradiated ruins of a dead city.

+ I like most of the characters because they are well written, and the game gives you enough opportunities to support them. My favourites are Stepan and little Nastya; I could not refuse her plea for the heroic rescue of a teddy bear.   

+ Solid addons. Both of them illuminate the events around side characters that you will encounter during the main storyline. 

- The depiction of Colonel Miller, a hardened veteran and military leader, as a naive and irrational commander lacks credibility. And believe me, thoughts of mutiny crossed my mind several times.

- Occasional FPS drops, irregular crashes, and corrupted save games. I have experienced all of it, and it boils down to... *switches to a Russian accent* completely normal phenomenons.

-- Taking the game out of the Steam store, two weeks before its release, is referred to as a d*ck move in the gamer scene.

[i] Summary: [/i]

I consider ME to be a great continuation of the series, and the strongest part of the franchise. It has surprised me with its open world aspects and gripping storyline. 
Alas, the overall impression is tarnished by technical issues, and the rushed cooperation with the EPIC Games Store for temporary exclusivity. You can do better 4A Games and Deep Silver.

Recommended for fans of the post-apocalypse and gas mask fetishists.

☑ You forget what reality is (the best graphics I've seen besides RDR2. only RDR2 can beat this graphics really.)
☐ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good (absolutely amazing. Metro's gameplay is so unique overall and I love it!)
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good (the soundtracks are awesome as always in the metro series. the voice actors know what they're doing and really gave kind of life to characters, a lot better than the previous Metro games.)
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☑ Fast (still, I can't believe how such game with this graphics can be so optimized. probably the most optimized game I've seen.)
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master (if you really want to play the game in a (in my opinion) good, realistic and challenging way, it takes more than just shooting people and mutants. you can finish each part of the game with many different ways and of course some missions and parts of the game can be hard and tricky, still it's easier than the first two games and is a lot more optimized for people who want to play the game easier and mostly just experience the story.)
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

---{ Grind }---
☑ Nothing to grind (you might want to look for some really powerful weapons and upgrades in the game, but that's not really grind and it's not necessary either. in fact, even when trying to get those upgrades, you'll have so much fun. I mean it's not like you need to get those upgrades and suffer to get them, not at all. so there's basically nothing to grind.)
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☑ It'll replace your life (so so amazing and emotional. loved it and really felt it. everything about it is just so good. an easy 11/10 for the story.)

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long (took me about 16 hours to finish the main game with almost all the side missions and challenges. you could do it for shorter time if not minding the side missions, and not trying to get the good ending so bad like me lol.)
☐ To infinity and beyond

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price (I got it in a pretty good sale, preferably get it in a sale like I did, but this game is indeed worth the main price.)
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs 
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

here's some really important tip that I experienced myself after having my second playthrough on the main game, and not the enhanced edition: I played Metro Exodus probably a year ago for the first time *without* playing Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light. I didn't really understand the game, characters, story and everything much. I thought the other two games might be too old to play, and in result, I didn't enjoy Metro Exodus much. please whatever you do, play Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light before playing this game. those two games are absolutely amazing too and they can really affect your experience when playing Metro Exodus. I did this on my second playthrough, and now I love this whole series so much that I would gladly play it all over again right now, even though it's been only 2 hours since I finished the game in my second playthrough lol.

Combines experiences of a balanced open-world through a linear format effectively. Balances a weapon/equipment upgrade system with just enough [i] enough [/i] complexity. Hitting targets provides nice satisfaction. Bolt rack on the  Kalash is 🤤. Movement can feel clunky at times. Visual environment is very nice to look at, colors are well balanced. Areas that are dungeon-like are composed well. Very much a plus runs above 40 fps on my m1 14"" macbook pro, stutters once in a while but overall very nice to have AAA game on this platform.

Worst episode of the series. Poor optimization. The authors haven't fixed any bugs since version 1.0. Limited freedom of movement too. It's a purely linear shooter. And the Colonel is still yelling.
 
This game very slow and boring. I absolutely hate the character of anna, she adds nothing except a way to make the game about a female instead of artyom. You could remove her from the game and the score will rise by 3 points.. 

I rate positively only because of the next game in the METRO series. A big disappointment. I prefer the books and the first two episodes.

Really enjoyed most of the chapters with the exception of the desert level as it felt underdeveloped and a mediocre knock off of border lands.  My biggest gripe was that we lost access to almost all of the cool weapons added in Last Light (Saiga, claymores, VSV, Kalash 2012, revolver, etc). Said weapons were replaced with cartoonish pipe guns. The jerry rigging was ridiculous given the fact pre-war weapons don't decay that bad over 20 years to the point of pipe guns being standard issue. Devs missed the chance to add real life weapons such as the SVD, PKM and other AK variants that include civilian models.

If you are a fan of the metro series, red the books or have played the previous games and want to know where the story goes; then sure, go ahead by all means.

But I can't recommend this to anyone who is not already familiar to the genre as the game play is either too unforgiving or too repetitive.

Also the game is not actually an open world, don't fall for the cheap marketing, its just bigger maps where its harder to reach to the restrictions. Games like Dishonored did this better, and that game is only 7 gb. Not sure what to say about that.

EDIT 4.3.2023. I have bought a new AMD gpu and this problem is still present. It's a much better GPU. 

There is a broken level mid game, at the desert level. I don't know why it occurs yet, but it may be connected to Nvidia GPUs, essentially during the lighthouse section- as you exit a cave, the game freezes and crashes. It's incredibly frustrating to pass this section as you have to apparently lower the video settings as much as possible, not let nvidia mess with the Metro Exodus settings in the Nvidia control panel, and the entire time look at the floor as you exit the cave and get onto a old rusty boat and go up while looking at the floor. For some people this works, for others it does not and game still crashes at random spots on the boat.

AT THIS POINT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REFUND THE GAME EVEN IF YOU GIVE A GOOD REASON, STEAM ONLY WILL LOOK AT HOURS PLAYED AND DATE OF PURCHASE, AND YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH A BROKEN GAME.

Game lost all the uniqueness going for a more generic post apocalyptic wasteland. Levels are huge open world full of nothingness with respawns of generic beasts, Fallout ghouls or generic Mad Max wasteland barbarians. There is some salvageable stuff in the first two chapters but the rest is just boring and stuff you have already seen a thousand times. Generic enemies, generic Fallout ghouls, an entire Mad Max themed level with slaves, people going around eating each other dressed with kitchen pans.
The idea of a mobile base on a train was cool, I love trains, but guess what you see it once for level, for the rest you have the usual Ubisoft's ""free the outpost, gain a safehouse"" where you can craft stuff. This is just an example of how much generic this game has become.
The only saving grace of this game are the first and the last level which, to no surprises, are a callback to the original games with the metro, mutants, hallucinations and an extremely better narrative. The open world levels are useless, reaching the last level it's a kick in the nuts, you scream at the monitor ""where have you been the last twenty hours? Why have you wasted time to give me absolutely nothing?"". It's like the middle part of the game has been done by different people and only the beginning and the end are done by the real devs.
The Two Colonels dlc is adding insult to injury, you have a full fledged metro adventure like the old times and you see the devs till can do their job. Why isn't the game like this?
Sam's story has a semi-open world hub which could have been a way better level in the main game than the wastelands or the taiga. It also has way better characters.

Artyom and his companions take a train on a journey to find out if there is any other life out there, also to find a possibly more livable place than the Metro.

Two of the four levels are very open and expansive, one could almost call it an open world, one is very linear and one is something in between. This is one of the biggest innovations compared to the predecessors, which both consisted of fairly linear levels. There are quite a few outposts and smaller tasks to do.

You now also have resources and a kind of crafting system to keep your equipment in good shape and produce ammunition/medicines, and you can attach various modifications to your weapons in the different slots.

The two story expansions aren't bad either, The Two Colonels is a rather small about 2-hour DLC that is relatively ""adventure""-heavy with little shooting, and Sam's Story is more or less another open level that offers another few hours of gameplay.

The modding system for the guns is awesome, I loved the feeling of customizing and changing your weapon. One of the best gun modding systems in any game I've played.
Some of the map design is really good, you can tell they put a lot of thought and effort into creating a path or two that you can sneak around with if you find them. They aren't so obvious that it makes stealth unnecessary but they aren't so hard to find that you get frustrated.
The backgrounds of some of the cities were stunning, there was clearly lots of effort put into the dilapidated buildings and the streets of the ruined cities that the train rolls through.
I liked how even on hard difficulty one headshot was generally enough to put down an enemy. It made skill feel more necessary than other games.
The way the characters talk to each other and interact is really cool, they feel real when they are communicating with each other and the main character is not involved.

Now onto why I cannot recommend this game.
Your character never talks, which makes every conversation feel incredibly odd and stilted. They did a good job writing the conversations in a way that makes it so that your character never has to talk, at the cost of losing a level of immersion you get when your character interacts with others. 
A lot of the story was predictable. Most of the characters were cliche, and had no story arc or very cliche arcs. 
The world building didn't seem real. How is it that so many people survived, but they all turned out to be psychopath nutjobs? Where are all the normal people? Throughout the entire game you meet like 4 that aren't already part of your group. 
And wow the colors are really bad in parts. I may have just messed up my settings, but there just so many shades of gray that eventually it felt like the game was in black and white. The forest level was like looking at the game through dirty toilet water. A lot of the time the enemies are the same color as the background as well, so they are incredibly hard to see. This was probably just me though so I could look past it. 
The worst part of the game, and why I can never play it again, was the unskippable dialogue and cutscenes. They were so obnoxious and brought the game to a complete stop so many times. Completely negates replayability, I'm not gonna sit through 6 more hours of mediocre cliche dialogue in order to get to the good parts of the game. So, while I think there is a solid game in here, the tedium is too much for me to recommend anyone try to find it.",1677692486,1677692486,False,0,0,0.430463552474975586,0,True,False,False

The graphics look great (when the game's not having an aneurysm at 15 fps; turns out this was usually caused by having the xbox controller connected with bluetooth, for some reason; other games are just fine), the sound design is nothing special, but fine.  My main complaint is that I just don't think the people who made this game really understood the world they were supposed to be portraying.  If this were a stand-alone game, not about Artyom or the Metro, the story and environments would have made more sense, but the writers just destroyed the lore to fit ""open-world.""  Open-world doesn't mean I have to be able to walk around a fricken field and be able to walk in any of the 360 degrees at any given time.  It means I'm free to choose my objective and my path to that objective, without having to pause to load a new area, neither of which this game actually does.  The ""open world"" is split into several levels, each with miles and miles of walking to the next semi-interesting thing.  While I am able to (for the most part) choose what direction I want to approach from, the objectives are extremely linear.  You do this set of objectives now. 
 If you do the main objective first, you missed the others; too bad, start the chapter over.  They could have made an open-world game underground in the metro.  Let me try to find my own routes between stations or whatever.  That would've fit and sounds really fun to me.

The developers tried to add a crafting system to the game.  Sounds cool until you realize that it makes the whole game a collect-a-thon gathering only TWO resources.  They're always just scattered around feeling more random than ""level design"" and they're annoying and hard to spot.  If you don't bother with them, you'll run out of ammo, because every enemy has a fricken angel on his shoulder that dissolves his ammo upon death, just so you can't pick it up.  There are no military-grade rounds anymore and they didn't replace them as a currency with anything else, so there's no bartering in the game.  If you want bullets, you make bullets.  I have been playing on normal, taking my time and getting headshots for most kills and I am still struggling with ammo.  Most of my play time has been going back to old spots hoping to find more stuff to make ammo with and hoping the stupid enemies won't respawn, which, just in case anybody hasn't figured it out yet, IS TEDIOUS AND BORING AS ALL HELL.

Also, escaping Moscow on a steam train?  Are you daft?  Game says it went 3906 kilometers on ONE FRICKEN HOPPER OF COAL and ONE TANK OF WATER.  Fired up the dormant steam train at the beginning of the game in two minutes (It takes several hours to fire up a steam train, especially if it's dead cold.  It has to be done slowly so the thermal expansion doesn't cause pressure leaks, plus you're heating up a WHOLE LOCOMOTIVE; it takes time.), then had Miller have to explain that he was keeping shit from you but for some reason chose to bring the whole squad that also didn't know what he was talking about?  The writing is just so unbelievably lazy that every time I start to get invested, someone says or does something so dense or out of place, that I just lose interest again.  I got to the desert, where the new sniper rifle I found does less damage than my silenced revolver and gave up.  The sandstorm was kind of cool, but my comrades were warning me that it was coming for about ten times longer than the actual storm lasted.  One other point; if making your game open world necessitates adding a fricken car to drive past all the empty, boring nothingness, maybe your game shouldn't have been open world.

Oh, also there's a point where they tell you that you're only able to swap your weapons at the workbench on the train, so when I got the crap sniper rifle in the desert and wanted to swap it back for the Kalash, I drove back to the train and wasted five minutes trying to figure out how to get inside, only to realize that the game had lied to me before and the special ""weapon collection"" workbench had been moved out of the train and into a local building.  That seems like what you would do when a warring tribe of bandits is angry at you and you might need to leave immediately.  Good thinking, especially after telling me ""it will always be here.""  Really though, who wrote this garbage?  Maybe it wouldn't bug me in something sillier like the Fallout franchise, but in a story world that used to pride itself on the gravity of the situations playing out, the lack of thought put into making this game really gets under my skin.",1676235352,1677455444,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I encountered far too many technical difficulties during my time, which made the experience very painful. I'll go through a few of them below.

For those who want a short answer, I would say not to get this game unless you are confident that you can figure out how to fix or get around any issues you encounter, as I had far too many technical issues during my time that made the experience very painful.


To start off, this game is the sequel to Last Light and is a continuation of the ""Good Ending"" of that game. The game, like the previous two, places a strong emphasis on its narrative and shares many features with its predecessors. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that the setting is very different from the previous two games. The story is well written and, in my opinion, holds its own against the other entries in the series. Still, it takes a different course than the other two.

The game's core mechanics are excellent, and the ability to modify weapons in-mission and craft resources on the fly is a welcome addition. which I think plays amazingly well with the entire feel of this game.

NOTE: This is my experience and may differ from those others have had.

This game is great, and I had no problems with it at all during my first playthrough. However, after that point, I started having problems one after another. The first thing I had an issue with was NG+ with ""My Weapons"" not actually carrying over to the new game, so I had to collect everything again. This wasn't a game-breaking issue, but it was inconvenient and clearly not the intention of the feature. I did manage to get it working for my third playthrough, though.

Next was ""Crashes."" I had crash after crash, and this started during my second playthrough when I was doing the Iron Mode achievement, which meant only saving between missions. and every single mission I did right at the end, the game would crash, making me run through the entire mission all over again from the start. Because of this, the experience was excruciatingly unpleasant, and my runs took twice as long as they would have otherwise. and I sometimes crashed twice during a single mission.

Lastly, I had some trouble getting past a black screen during a cutscene in the DLC Two Colonels. which took me a while to figure out how to get around. without getting around this made the dlc uncompletable. 

This game would have my full recommendation if it weren't for all the technical issues I ran into while playing it. Again, this is just what happened to me; some players have had a trouble-free experience with the game. So if you're feeling brave, by all means, buy the game. And as always, hold off until a discount comes along.",1677273013,1677273013,False,1,0,0.477277457714080811,0,True,False,False

I don't get it. How is this game rated ""Very Positive"" when it's so bad? Here comes the spoilers but you probably spoiled yourself when you played the first level and had to look at the wiki anyway.

So in order to get the better ending, you have to knock out/ avoid certain npcs. Sounds doable, doesn't it? Except that most of the time you have to stealth areas in order to be able to avoid killing/knock out npcs.

Oh and also, you can only have 4 savefiles at the same time. The game will occasionally save at really awful spots and if you have been spotted in one savefile, it carries over to the others and now the enemies are constantly on alert. 
Let me give you an example: You saved on 01:00 PM, you play for 5 minutes and save again. Now you get spotted and stealthy time is over.. That's bad! Just load the save from 5 minutes ago, stealth was still active and nobody spotted you then. Except the game is too dumb to reset the enemies properly and now you are also in combat when loading that early save.

The game also feels as if it still uses the exact engine as Metro 2033, with enhanced graphics. That engine is fucking dated. If COD or BF used the same engine as they did 9 years ago for their newest game, you'd have mouthbreathing youtubers make vids crying about it. For Metro you have people praising it. Also, does it not feel as if they did the whole ""Open World levels"" thing to make the game appear fresh and different than its predecessors? No? Because it fucking does. It's Metro Last Light pretending to be something new but doing an awful job at it. This is a downgrade and I still don't understand why it gets so much praise.

If you are going to make a playstyle important for a better ending, than at the very fucking least make it possible for the playstyle to be fun, fair and bug free. I got spotted through solid blocks of concrete, bridges etc. I had 5 enemies go nuts at an empty can I threw 20 meters away from them. I started from the hardest difficulty (Ranger Hardcore if I recall correctly) and went all the way down to the easiest (Reader?) at one point, just to see that it's the same thing on all difficulties. You must play at night if you want to stealth, no other way.

Now to the story. I only went as far as Volga where I had the problem with none of my saves staying in stealth, even though I only got spotted in the most recent one. The story seemed okay? I got it spoiled early on and I don't want to lose my sanity for the better ending. Artyom still can't open his fucking mouth and lorewise isn't mute. Fuck off with that ""YOU are Artyom!1!111!!"" shit. I'm not buying it. If I said the shit I did to Artyoms father in law, I would have been shot on the spot. So no, I'm not Artyom.

Last few things before the short version. Artyom is a special forces soldier etc. but moves like a brick. Can't climb low walls without moaning (See? he has a voice!) and the whole game feels artificially inflated to get more playtime out of it. Why can't a special forces soldier row a boat faster? Don't come at me with weight shit. Dude carries a whole weapon arsenal and can turn an AK into a sniper with a workbench. 

If you are a Metro fan and hate yourself, buy it. Don't ever stealth at night and do all the side objectives. Talk to everyone nicely, no bad words! Because [u]YOU[/u] are Artyom! 

If you love yourself, just look at the story, enough stuff on yt and save your money for something better.


[u] SHORT VERSION: [/u] Artificially inflated cash grab with an outdated engine. Gameplay doesn't make any sense. Story actually good cuz it had a book to look at. Don't buy if you love your sanity, just watch vids on yt. Buy if you are crazy and try to get good ending.",1677206256,1677206293,False,0,0,0.400000005960464478,0,True,False,False

First you get locked from progressing because of one particular (and unavoidable) part of the map that freezes your PC. If you manage to be (and pray to god you are) in a lucky group of people who manage to get the game working after that, you're not out of the woods...

The game will continue to freeze, refuse to load (forcing you to boot in safe mode), have map mission markers stuck and not updating, and if all of that is just a tip of the iceberg. 

Literally the only game, aside from CP2077 where you'll hear me complain over the bugs (I'm used to buggy games and glitchy messes, but this is just awful)

There's new mechanics such as crafting, weapon cleaning and morality for what enemies you kill instead of just specific actions. There's also weather events and side missions. Stealth and combat is still really good in this game. Battles are tense and stealth has been improved with the game telling you whether enemies will be able to see you. You also play through many areas solo, but you have allies fight alongside you a few times which is nice and makes sense since you don't travel alone. I also like how some anomalies from the first game return and are more of a threat that don't happen at one scripted point. Crafting is a big part of Exodus so exploring is even more important than previous games and also more rewarding. Instead of finding ammo for a gun you aren't using and getting stuck with low ammo for a gun you are using, you'll find crafting pieces. These are much more common but ammo is scarce. This works a lot better since you have more control over what ammo you have instead of being at the mercy of what ammo the game gives you.

In my opinion the game is a waste of time. I read all the reviews and thought it might be ok to try and play.
The start for me of the game was dropping you in a room with werewolf’s or something. Until you find a door out, you die many times.
Then you find people and all they do is talk and talk and talk some more. You walk past them and a conversation starts up again. And the girl calling my name so much. Problebly just me but  I got so bored with this aspect of the game. Its not a standard Loot game you get a backpack with limited space using icons on the desk top.  For me you get three usable guns. My problem was only two would work. I tried everything to make the 3rd weapon work. When I got the pump gun to work my shot gun would not fire. I tired of looking stuff up. Seemed a few people had the same problems.. For me upgrading was sloppy. I would click my flash light a get my gigercounter and light. I like Shooters and looter, Survival, RPG games.

But I cannot for the love of GOD understand WHY the devs just won't warn players about things that you will permanently lose if you play the game normally, and it's ALL IN THE F***ING CASPIAN SEA LEVEL!
1. You should never attempt to go back to the cave of ghouls level cause if you ever happen to slip under the slope, your save is gone. You literally lose all progress you made for the last 7 hours because the slope is ""designed"" be the devs to be un-climbable no matter what you do. That's the first time I stopped playing this f***ing game.
2. You should detatch all your weapon attachments before going out of CASPIAN SEA LEVEL because if you get to the next map, Taiga, you will lose ALL your UNIQUE weapon mods without even warning. LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL F***? I don't know that the devs have against us, but they sure wants to smack us in the head right after we are happily smiling over our unique weapon mods. Oh and also if you don't find new Night Vision goggles in the Taiga, which is hidden behind interactive door under the basement of some random building on the side of the road, you will lose them permanently. Just another way of F***ING over players.
F*** YOU ( -_-)ㅗ
Oh and if you play Enhanced Edition after you even once played the normal edition, your video settings will take 5 minutes to NOT APPLY. You have to manually delete your user.cfg file for the normal edition because somehow they share the same video config file.

The world of Metro Exodus is both immersive and beautifully rendered, with each location offering a unique and detailed environment to explore. The gameplay mechanics are seamless, blending action, stealth, and survival elements to create an engaging and challenging experience.

The weapon customization and crafting system is a fantastic addition that provides players with an incredible level of control over their equipment, making it both satisfying and empowering. But what really sets Metro Exodus apart is its cast of characters.

Artyom, the game's protagonist, is a well-realized hero that players will become deeply invested in. The supporting cast is equally well-written and expertly voiced, creating a level of emotional depth and complexity that is rare in video games.

In summary, Metro Exodus is an exceptional video game that should not be missed. Its outstanding storytelling, gameplay, and design make it a true masterpiece of its genre. If you're looking for a gaming experience that is both immersive and engaging, Metro Exodus is an excellent choice.

Despite this hurdle, Metro Exodus tell an incredibly thoughtful story respecting the characters and the player as well. However I feel the Metro Exodus storyline, perhaps makes too many excuses to get you Artyom to go somewhere or do something, rather than making a well-told or more interesting story. To me, I don't mind that, because it does have a lot of heart, and personality in some aspects which I realized later on.

The gameplay is largely basic shooting, and enhanced by modification, which fits really well, allowing more options to kill enemies or tackle objectives. Often you are suggested to avoid combat in this game because there are human beings and you are meant to stealth or subdue. Similar to the other metro games, however I felt I often did not use my weapons or felt like I shouldn't, which is sad because they are so cool and fun to use.

This is probably the most graphically beautiful post-apocalyptic game I've ever played, from the art design, the graphics, to animation, and weapon designs. All of it is so well done.

I played about an hour of it and as soon as I was left out in the open world, I hated it so much, I uninstalled it. In fact, I also tried playing Metro 2033 TWICE back in the day, but for one reason or another one, I uninstalled them as well. I'm pretty sure I didn't even try Last Light. So yeah, I could say I was never a big fan.

Fast forward 5 years, I wanted to give the game a second chance, with the enhanced edition and all. And boy did I feel the same way about the open world sections. However, I did stick with the game and I focused solely on the main missions. That's where the game shined. 

Regarding the open world, I feel like the designers of the game wanted it to feel more innovative and modern with these new areas; however it gave me the complete opposite feeling. I found them unnecessary, tedious and not cohesive enough with the rest of the game. Luckily there were only two of these sections, and I said before, I skipped them completely, going straight for the main missions.

The story is simple but well executed. By the end I was completely absorbed by its depressing atmosphere and I didn't want anything bad to happen to anyone anymore. I loved the gameplay, mixing action and survival and making every bullet count. The crafting system was very well done as well, giving you plenty of upgrades for your weapons and equipment.

The levels themselves were very nice, never feeling repetitive or tedious and I greatly enjoyed them, but if there's one thing I will complain about is the good/bad endings. Again, another thing the game wanted to be ""modern"" about and it ended up being a stupid gimmick. You kill at least one murderer begging for their life? You get the bad ending. Otherwise, you get the good one. That was so cheap in my opinion and didn't add anything either.

Content wise, I feel like the game had just the right length. Not to short, not too long either. I also have the two DLC, and although I've read that they are quite good, I've had enough. I'm very happy with what I've achieved and I don't want to go back to this world anymore. At least until they announce the sequel.

But make sure you prepare for these explorations it is because they could either disaster or virtue.

The story in this one is better than the first two. But the production value is lower. When I first played the game(a year after it's release because epic games) it was in a poor state. The guns were unresponsive, the character acceleration was awful, and it was incredibly buggy a YEAR after release mind you. I returned to it near three years later and found that mostly the game was more enjoyable now(though the character controller is still ridiculous). The game would be better with these issues fixed than it's predecessors, however, the production value is still not what you'd expect from a triple A title. Audio lines play over each other, some models are lacking faces, and the environments are at times hard to navigate with the awful character controller. The first two free roam maps are mediocre, but everything after that, especially the forest and final level, is peak Metro.

i have a few nitpicks about this game:
yamantau is a pretty short and boring level that couldve been replaced by anything else
taiga is too linear, wouldve LOVED if taiga was open just like the 2017 E3 trailer! 
the good ending is hard to get unless you actually know what to do, happened to me but i guess that makes it more immersive
the dead city is SUPER big but SUPER linear which is a BUMMER, exploring around in that lead lined van around novisibirsk wouldve been like HEAVEN! but it made sense since the radiation is through the roof
from what ive seen, the bad ending is more of a ""labor of love"" for the fans rather than the good ending, which is a bummer since it wouldve been cool to see bourbon or eugene or khan in the good ending as something is artyom's head

Although at one point in the game they temporarily take a certain ability away from you and let a particular enemy attack you in an underground location that made me almost shit my pants. But all in all the devs chose not to terrorize me non-stop which is appreciated, I just can't handle these kinds of shockers after work. So, well done by the devs, it was exciting and an appropriate amount of terrifying.
The atmosphere and graphics are excellent. The lighting in particular (without ray tracing). Some of the animation work (weapon handling, interactions with your backpack, using any of your gear like lighters, using a workbench etc.) are probably some of the best you will ever see in a game. Especially pulling out your backpack or the map (which is a physical object) is just stunning and must have taken hours upon hours to animate and perfect. Details like these add so much to the authenticity of the world. Amazing job there.
You absolutely must pick up as much resources as you can to craft the gear and ammo that you need to survive. The developers managed to make you feel unease if you haven't crafted and looted enough, you will run out of ammo and will try to conserve it, even on normal difficulty. I avoided some encounters, because I knew I didn't have the resources, always shot to kill and spent bullets conservatively. Which is okay, this is a core gameplay principle, it fits the setting, and I wasn't as annoyed by this as I thought I would, because the economy was hard but well balanced. So this is well done by the developers.
The story line is good / okay. Personally I wasn't blown away by it, but this will work just fine for most people. A huge mistake not to give the character of the player a voice. He literally says nothing the entire game (except for intros to areas/missions) which is a huge mistake. 
The shooting, the weapon customization and the light/stealth mechanics are fun and very well done. Sniping scary monsters in the frontal lobe with a pimped out cross bow with an IV scope and night vision googles on while hiding in the pitch black metro is a personal highlight for me.  
Performance on Linux with Proton/Wine is generally great and everything works perfectly out of the box.

THE STORY,  DIALOGUE AND CHARACTERS: (9/10) I really like the characters is in this game and the dialogue and voice acting play a major role in making them interesting to listen too. The story is simple but done really well and flows nicely with a few plot twists here and there which spice it up a bit. I liked the story in all Metro games but this one is just a bit better. Your character and a group of spartan soldiers along with Anna and her father are simply going from area to area to find a place that is safe from radiation and trouble to settle down.   

The next thing which is improved is CRAFTING, EQUIPMENT and WEAPON and UPGRADES(9/10). It is done a lot better. No more selling ammunition or guns to get currency to buy other guns or equipment or to upgrade. Now you actually gather resources during exploring areas to craft ammo and equipment and do various other things like clean your guns and repair your gear. You can even craft filters now! Gunplay is good and there is more upgrades for all the guns and they are all useful. And on top of that you actually find gear upgrades like for your mask and helmet and armor. 

The ENVIRONMENTS and LEVEL DESIGN (8/10) is decent. Metro Exodus has some different environments to keep you interested like snow areas, a desert area level and a jungle area level. Some areas are more open than others and take longer to complete and allow you to explore more which is a good thing. The only thing is there isn't a lot of levels in the game which is a shame.

VISUALS and SOUND(10/10): Great! No issues with these.

Now on to the not so good things. Luckily there isn't much. The biggest thing being PERFORMANCE(8/10): This game struggles on my system when I enable RTX mode and I have a decent RTX video card. The game almost crashed in one area. Stayed at 1 frame per second and froze for a good minute. Without RTX on it runs better but still has the occasional frame drop. It is just a shame I can't get RTX to run smoothly no matter  how I fiddle with the settings. The other issue is this game still manages to have bugs and glitches in it like enemies freezing in mid air once they die or decorations just floating in mid air no really sitting on top of  anything.

Other minor issues I have with the game.
-Can't switch out a pheumatic weapon like the Tikkar for any other gun besides the crossbow. Don't ask me why they thought this was a good idea in a short game like this.
-lack of crafting tables in some levels and some don't allow you to change weapons only upgrade them. I don't know why  they thought it was a good  idea.
-the game overall is a bit short. You don't get a lot of time to fiddle around with the last two weapons you get late in the game a lot.

Overall I still recommend this game. It is still good your are just probably better  of playing it without RTX on and the glitches aren't a game breaker. It is still an improvement in most ways compared to the other Metros.

Changing the parts on your weapon in the level is a nice idea which i missed in the previouse games.
But it does not have this awesome creepy feelings which you get in 2033 or Last Light.
The Level jamantau has actually alot of potential but like i said its not as good as its predecessor.
The only parts in the game i like are those in the closed areas. Like the Bunker in the desert or yamantau.
When you explore the word you dont feel satisfied when you loot all those materials or even the weapon mods.

That's downright Capcom level. Capcom does better graphics optimization, than A4. But compared to Cyberpunk 2077, Metro Exodus has excellent optimization.

There are also cons. Due to the bunch of textures, it is sometimes impossible to hit the worms. Gorillas punch MC through walls. At the end, the reappearance of gorillas is already beginning to annoy.

Developers are moralists wannabe. They split thugs into good and bad. I advise them to watch the movie ""The Green Inferno"" to understand what this leads to.

Finished the game. This is my first full review of a game. First off, this game is marvelous! Thanks 4A team for delivering this masterpiece.

( - ) Let me talk about the negative things of this game first:
Metro Exodus is a great story-driven game. Graphic is top notch. However, there are few minor problems with character animations and audio bugs. People talk over each other sometimes and if you're going to play without subtitles, it's kind of hard to follow the dialogue. Facial animation was not that great, some of the cutscenes were a bit off for me but most of the time they were good. I guess it's not originally for the English version, playing this game in Russian version could be better but I would never know for sure. Still, these are some minor issues that didn't really affect too much of my experience playing this game.

( + ) Let's get to the good part:
This is definitely the best single player first person shooter with a great story for me! It's been so long since I really enjoyed a game like this. The character development is one of my favorite things about this game. The game does a great job of making you feel connected with the NPCs. Everyone in your Aurora squad has their unique personality and you can easily tell the difference.

The new crafting and modding system is interesting. I love how you can change the mods on your guns while you're doing quests because it affects the gameplay a lot. You have options to choose your loadout before and during the missions. However, if you decide to play this game on Ranger Hardcore mode, the resources are pretty scarce which forces you to play this game on stealth most of the time.  Cleaning your guns is very important because the dirtiness affects your weapon's stats (accuracy and fire rate). Your guns could be jammed many times if they are too dirty.

New quest-finding system is great too. The game doesn't show you where the quests are, you'll have to discover those points of interest on your own using your binocular. Those high grounds are the goldmines of intelligence if you take your time and look for places. It will be shown as a question mark on your map after you stared at a specific location for about 3 seconds.

I love the day-night cycle in this game. The game gives you options to select day or night time. There are many safe houses around the map and you can use them to heal yourself, use the workbenches or sleep. It changes the whole game of how you choose to approach your next mission. Day time means less monsters and the human AIs are quite harder. They can easily see you from afar and alert the other guards so for example, if you want to take down a bandit camp, night time is much more effective. However, night time in this game is horrifying (more monsters to deal with). There are also anomalies in this game and it gives me S.T.A.L.K.E.R vibes. It only happens at night and will hurt you if you get too close.

The atmosphere is one of the best about this game. It's breathtaking with 4 different seasons and environments that the game offers you to explore. Different biome has its unique feeling into it. Just take your time to explore every corner you go through, there are many surprises that won't let you down.

Just like the old Metro games, your playstyle and your decisions dictates the outcome of the game. In my opinion, the karma system in this game is one of the best I've seen so far in all of the games I've ever played. You will see the consequence of your decisions during mid game and at the end as well.

There's no need to say about the soundtracks. They're insanely good and fits the theme well.

I got the bad ending even though I tried hard to get the good one. There are things that the game won't tell you but you have to think carefully before you act. Therefore, I'm still working on my second playthough because I missed so many things on my first playthrough and I'm trying to get the good ending this time.

Thank you 4A! Solid 9/10.

but its good

yeah its a strong game, a semi-survival, semi-open world, semi-audio log collector which is fine, as it does those things well.

what it isn't, is Metro.
at the very start and at the very end you are actually in the metro and its amazing, truly great atmosphere. Showing its pedigree with the first two games, a truly sublime streamlined experience with modern graphics and engines, shame its like..15 minutes of the game because it really went reminded me what i loved about metro before getting us into the rest of Russia where its nothing like that.
all i thought was ""this is fine...but i really miss metro""
weirdly enough for an open world game, its just as linear as it was in metro, you cannot really go anywhere or do anything other then what is suggested to you, very little to explore with the most bizarre  good/bad ending that depends on the amount of audio logs/secrets you found and not choices you made in the game.

honestly though, its a good game, handles well, stealth is on point..it just feels like the devs had run out of ideas or passion for the metro world and decided to make an openworld game instead. 

The trailers were transparent with this, so no miss-marketing
you'll enjoy it if you like survival games and think games like ""dead space"" constitute a horror

Don't buy it expecting a metro game though, the metro parts of the game are far to o short and only serve to see the game that could have been and you wished it was. 



-------------------------------

Edit : I've changing my review as my original was more of a review of Epic, but its the same overall point, i'll leave it in because i stand by it lol





Waited an additional year for this game because Epic store thinks the way to beat a monopoly is to make its own monopoly  and pretending by offering a bigger cut to game developers that will somehow mean cheaper games. Which I thought was bullshit when i heard it and turned out I was right. IT was done to temp Dev's for exclusivity purposes and if it tempted a dumbass customer that honestly thought all games would be cheaper on Epic doubly hillarious as the game is Cheaper on steam and comes with the DLC.

game itself isn't really metro  but its still fun. Plus top tier russian wifu is always nice. 
A bit too many QTE style cut a ways and a few of them are straight up lifted from other games. which was distracting but not a deal breaker. The voice acting was good but the sync seemed off at times, again distracting, not deal breaking. 

Looks great. Story is interesting enough to not have a totally obvious twists and turns and as ever you're voiceless, which is very annoying when people are talking directly at you and is referenced several times.

12 hours playing, and I decided i've had enough and it was time to vent online, as if that's going to fix anything. 12 hours, and I've sick and tired of stopping my gaming session to google ""how to fix intro crash"" or ""how to fix mask bug"" or ""yeah turn off steam cloud saves, because those corrupt your saves, and you'll have to restart the chapter.""
Jesus christ. I'll never replay this mess, that's for sure.

Edit:
Update to my review after more hours at troubleshooting.
Turns out, it was DX12 mode ruining everything! Well, mostly everything. I still have the issue with the cloud saves (Basically, turn them off before gaming... You risk getting your auto save corrupted.). But the frequent crashes have been resolved by switching from DX 12 to DX 11 mode. Which sucks... I can understand that this shouldn't make much difference, from a user perspective, but it is still something I would expect to have in working order, but alas, it is not.

But coming back to a review on the game, the storyline is solid, the characters are great, the voice actors (EN) are great, if i tad cliched at times. I'm now waiting before moving on to the DLCs, but the way the story is closed is satisfactory. The limited replayability is a factor, but this is a story based FPS, so it's to be expected.

All in all, after addressing the constant crashes, I'm now quite satisfied with the experience, and I recommend this game (as long as you don't suffer the same excruciating experience with the constant crashes as I did.)",1672274280,1675628859,True,0,0,0.598024129867553711,5,True,False,False

It compines open world gameplay with two large maps and linear levels. The Story was fascinating. Very impressive environments and graphics especially for gamers playing at ultra/extreme quality with latest graphics cards. Unfortunately my gtx 1080ti didnt make this game at ultra settings, too low FPS, so I had to play at High Settings in order to get some fluent 100+ FPS. The gameplay is pretty good, weapon arsenal with many modifications for weapons and equipment. Motions and movements of AI enemies and player are well made. Shooter feeling was pretty realistic, although there were some tricky situations with the motions when guns stuck or reload some weapons. There are many documents and post cards to collect and once played through, the game offers the possibility to play new game+ with several modificators. Big Contra: Bugs! Although its the best part of Metro, it has also the most bugs, even fatal bugs, where you cant move forward (e.g. Boat control bug). Really sad, developers didnt manage to fix those. The soundtrack is very inspiring therefore a bonus point for it. So in overall this is a great game for shooter fans and a MUST have for Metro fans. I purchased the gold edition on discount for nearly 9,00€ and I strongly recommend to buy it. The ""The Two Colonels"" add-on and ""Sam's Story"" small campaign are really worth it, however I wouldn't pay the full price.

Making a new part of the Metro is a difficult task. Making a new part such that it was more successful than the previous two is an almost impossible task. In this part of the trilogy, players will leave the dark world of the Moscow metro and get to the surface in order to board the Aurora train and explore the regions of the nuclear post-apocalypse of Russia, and together complete the adventure of Artyom, Anya and his friends.

Graphics and sound have improved significantly compared to the previous two parts. The linear level design is mixed with a small open world, and a more advanced weapon and equipment modification system has been introduced.

The story is short, but it makes you think about life. Namely, about the horrors of nuclear war and all the consequences that follow from it. When every day survivors worry about how to live on. People go crazy not knowing where to find water, food, medicine and even some temporary habitat. When there is almost no living place left in the world and everything is covered with some creatures, and radiation exceeding the norm several times on the surface.

I also recommend you to take DLC Two Colonels. It tells the whole ins and outs of the history of Novosibirsk in a concise manner. The turning point is very exciting, and the ending will not leave you indifferent either.",1675578213,1675578268,True,19,0,0.671799361705780029,0,True,False,False

That  being said this game is the most interesting out of the bunch. The open world of Metro exodus is cool and the story is somewhat compelling. Bizarre how Artyom only talks in the loading screen but not in the games while the other characters have a one way conversation with you. Still I feel the biggest issue with these games is the gun play (besides the constant crashing I have gotten with this game towards the end of the volga area). The guns do not have any real weight to them in terms of damage everything feels like a paintball gun vs the enemies that will down insanely fast. The stealth in this game fucking sucks because the AI will sometimes see you hidden far away just because you shot over an enemies head. Other times they wont see you out in the open in the middle of the day. Its really inconsistent. Last big complaint for me is how quickly guns get dirty..its ridiculously quick. Like i get that its the apocalypse but to the degree they jam up and get dirty should be much more drawn out. feel like half the time i am just cleaning my damn guns. It's also ridiculous how quickly Artyom gets out of breath. He's a freaking Ranger for god's sake he shouldn't be out of breath like a fat ass in Mcdonald's after one sprint. The fall damage is utterly ridiculous as well..fall like 5 feet you get the red bloody screen and are close to death.,1675506919,1675507030,False,1,0,0.471698135137557983,0,True,False,False

The characters let the story unveil itself at a smooth pace, all with unique personalities and connections to yours and the rest of the crew. The pacing of the game feels like it is properly fast, given your in-game circumstances, while also not removing from the game play, creating an intensely immersive adventure that I truly think is the best presented in the last half-decade.

Just to name a few bugs, I clipped through game platforms and died to fall damage, had NPCs bug out and duplicate themselves in cutscenes, world geometry breaking leaving grass and objects floating midair, Stealth being a nightmare due to NPCs being able spot you through walls and worst of all, several crashes that not only corrupted my auto-saves but somehow corrupted my game settings and control layout just to name a few. I am genuinely surprised that the game is in such a state even nearly four years after its launch with the developers/publishers seemingly prioritizing adding Ray-Tracing instead of fixing critical bugs. The story is nothing special and only occasionally comes close to that of Metro: 2033 and Metro Last Light but it undermines the impact of those games. Gameplay can't seem to figure itself out since numerous game features just get tossed in only to get removed in the following chapters. My final opinion is to play the previous games of the series and leave this watered down, buggy, sandbox cash grab game behind.",1675303987,1675304215,False,3,0,0.495247811079025269,0,True,False,False

characters are well written and everyone fills its part. the levels do swap from more linear (one path) to a sort of far cry like explorations in some level and a mix of both make it feels much more engaging(sort of choose your own path) .
the combat for the most part is your choice to go stealthy or try to take on a lot of enemies at once.
the ai does cheat like insta shot and kill when you are 1 milimeter on their screen (i found that frustrating at times) but for the most part both the combat and boss fights are fun.

A very interesting game and a well realised departure from the Metro tunnels of Moscow. It doesn't have the polish of some of the bigger studios out there but get past that and it's an excellent journey told from an interesting perspective.

Short but excellent. I don't normally like flashback story telling but it works really well here. And flamethrowers are always fun.

Finally got around to picking it up and playing it on a machine that could manage it, I played through Metro 2033 and Last Light on Ranger Hardcore with as little hud as possible and enjoyed them greatly.

So my approach to Exodus was the same, ranger hardcore no hud - on paper a good idea until I discovered they added a slew of new interaction keys , I was like on the third level before I figured out how to pass time. With that in mind that is the place I am coming from with this review.

At its core, Exodus is amazing - it builds on the world of Metro continuing the story and it is a good story at that (I shed a itty bitty spartan tear near the end there), the gunplay is essentially about the same with some improvements on sound design while making some maligned weapons central to gameplay while others are instantly all but forgotten.  Unfortunately it is held back from being a over all amazing game by crippling issues that the previous games laugh at.

The worst was getting to the end of the third level (Caspian) died and all three autosaves were tied to that tower, and each and every one would load into a fatal error on load and crash the game. This meant I had to start the chapter over and do the entire thing from scratch.

Now having the game on the hardest difficulty is intended to create a challenge, but in Exodus this only leads to frustration as enemies headshot you from across the map with a sub machinegun or shotgun (instant death), have xray vision and regularly and reliably see you through walls - sometimes even shooting you through solid objects too. Once they discover you they will probably never lose track of you again, that xray+night vision eyeballs means no matter how well you are hidden they will probably shoot at you. This is particularly frustrating on the Caspian level, you also encounter heavily armored gatlin wielding enemies near the very end of the previous level and a couple times in the caspian level (though you can catch one unaware and disable him) these guys can instantly spin up their gatlin gun (unlike you) and track your forehead at all times.  Stealthing around knocking guys out has always been my metro go-to approach, in Exodus you can randomly have enemies you cant knock out which is super frustrating especially on levels where no-kill is the best way to make your crew happy.

Coming out of Last Light and into Exodus the change in personalities of Anna and Miller is startling, with Anna losing her cold sniper vibe for a  house wife constantly worrying and that occasionally shoots at things approach. Miller went from a commanding presence to Mister Magoo, and somehow falling into many of the 'russian career soldier' trope that is universally made fun of in movies.

------

Overall I did enjoy my time in Exodus, and would recommend it - but there are no excuses for a game that has been out this long to have such crippling (gameplay) issues.",1675033158,1675033158,True,15,0,0.666472911834716797,0,True,False,False

After completing on ranger hardcore w/ full dive it was a great experience except for some problems/oversights that come with playing on FD hud. Some of these problems would be not being able to check ammo and other resources out in the field. Only being able to see them at crafting stations. Or QTEs (but this one is my fault since first play through was full dive) and dying during at many of these sequences that were avoidable. and various other bug outs during game play.
But I'm able to over look these since I could have played with what I should have been. 

Note for all those who want to play on ranger hardcore dear God the autosave points during game play are the worst, sometimes losing 12-15 minutes of progress because you got ass hammered by a lucky shotgun, getting penetrated by a sniper, and or getting absolutely railed by a gatling gun 5-6 times when you have no utility.

For example, a massive storm can heighten the fear factor of traversing the landscapes and waters. Enemies (normal mode) aren't sponges and can go down as expected using the right ammo, guns, and aim.  Most importantly, there are no overwhelming side quests. (There are extra things to do) but they don't expect you to go out of you way to do them as they can be done organically . Extremely fun game that keeps you coming back for more.

The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the pacing of the game encourages exploration outside of your main goals, without punishing the player for taking long moments to take in the landscape. You will fight various monsters and armed humans, and you have the option of going non-lethal stealth towards human enemies. The gunplay is solid, combat and utility items felt satisfying to use (as in throwing knives, finding a night vision upgrade etc) and the game was largely bug-free for me.

If you liked the original stalker games, this is as close as it gets. It's my understanding some of the devs with 4a even worked on the original stalker games with gsc. Exodus feels like a lived-in world, although unlike stalker there is a lot more plot, central hub w/ npc type stuff. Rather than the more isolating feel of stalker, where you might come upon a group of cheeki breekis around a campfire, but are otherwise alone in the zone. Nonetheless, the writing and voice acting are well done, so the plot and cutscene sections still feel pretty cool. 

In an unfathomably cool move, the devs have recently released extremely powerful modding tools for this game, which will allow modders to create new amazing content for this game. Part of the reason the original stalker games are my favorite games ever is that the modding community has kept them alive, with graphical and gameplay overhauls as well as total conversions and various kinds of new content. I could say the same about other popular moddable games, like bethesda hits Skyrim and Fallout 4. 

Have you ever finished an rpg, and felt a kind of nostalgia for that experience? Wished you could wipe your memory and start again? Mods bring back that magical immersion, that sense of wonder that makes games feel really worth your time. 

Opening the door for modders means that this game is now all but guaranteed to age like fine wine, and any problems one might have with the base game will become moddable as well- for example, an ""arachnophobe"" mod could be made that removes the spooky spiders from your playthrough. Just a basic, small example. 

It's also currently on sale for 7.50$ which is nuts. I'd say it's worth full price of 30 bucks, and any sale is just icing on the cake. The game is pretty accessible, so even if you've never played stalker or the original games I would recommend it. Just keep in mind you will want to explore every nook and cranny, play it safe and pick off enemies rather than rush in.

That said, the game did give me some serious headaches. Got soft-locked on Volga and almost had to restart the entire game because of a subtle bug, and in the end I haven't even finished it because it constantly crashes on the loading screen of one of the latest chapters (Enhanced Edition). I'm still leaving a positive review because it's just that good, all my bug-less playtime has been really fun.

Word of advice: just play the regular edition, specially if you're playing with a Radeon graphics card.

Pacing can feel a bit off compared to the other Metro games with the change to an open world. Didn't bother me but YMMV. Exodus looks fantastic especially with the Enhanced Edition if you have the hardware to run it. Game-play still feels great and there's a good amount of content for repeat play-throughs.

Some time after the events at D6, Artyum becomes emboldened to prove if anything has survived outside the Metro. He eventually gets his answer from some early story reveals that I won't spoil and the Spartans special forces team fleeing the Metro on a functional train. This has both story and game-play ramifications that makes this a fairly different experience compared to the prior entries.

The Metro series has never looked better with a good amount of environmental variety with each train stop. A4 Games did a really good job of keeping each map feeling fresh and not the same broken concrete look each time. Enemy types are also helped by this which was a welcomed detail to find out. Animations continue to be well done and textures, shadows, lighting all look great. Music, voice acting & motion capture also keep that high bar of quality and you can always switch to Russian for that extra level of immersion.

Levels aren't linear anymore but instead are now open maps to navigate, however to be clear this isn't S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout 4, this has clear points of interest to head to with the occasional side objectives to check. There's little benefit to explore if you don't have a clear plan and would likely be a waste of limited resources that could jeopardize the rest of your play-through. 

Speaking of resources, you no longer have to care about using your ammo as currency. That's been totally scrapped and now everything revolves around crafting ammo with resources you find in each level. Make sure you check corpses and any abandoned containers laying around. You can sometimes find gear upgrades as well but most of those will be through side quests. Be sure to approach to all NPCs at any story change to trigger dialogue in order to potentially get more quests.

I can't recall if Last Light had this but Exodus has in essence a morality/choice system. Making certain story choices and performing specific combat actions will determine who sticks around on your team as you progress in the story. This will affect some cut-scenes, endings & achievements. Without spelling everything out, you need to choose of either killing everyone or trying to spare\save everyone. Even outside of that, you might miss a few things because of specific quest conditions so maybe be a bad guy 1st and save the guide for your paragon run. 

I will also forewarn you that there is no manual save system with only 1 quick save slot available for the whole game. The game will periodically save as well as usually saving before a major scripted cut-scene. This will be something to keep in mind during a hardcore run or a save everyone run where a few mistakes can ruin everything.

If you've waited this long to play this, you may want to hold off until Thursday for the additional Ray-traced only version with DLSS 2.1 provided for free on whatever digital storefront you own the original release on. Digital Foundry has exclusive footage on this version on YouTube [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbpZCSf4_Yk] here[/url], just prepare for some possible spoilers.

Whether you approach this game as Solid Snake or Rambo, you'll likely have a good time with Exodus but I would suggest to play the prior games first. 2033 & Last Light are still great games and will help expand the story, Exodus presumes you know and keeps moving forward with its own narrative for better or worse. I recommend getting the Gold Edition of Exodus if you can, I enjoyed both DLCs for different reasons and you find my review of the Season Pass below. Metro Exodus takes the series in a new and exciting direction with positive results so it's pretty clear that it gets a thumbs up.

3 years past since Metro Exodus has been released, half years later has been released first DLC “The Two Colonels”, and six months later has been released second DLC “Sam’s Story”.
I really like the Metro saga and have played 2033 for 3 times and Last Light twice.
The game went wide, game mechanics have increased, but the beginning of the story is weak. Picture is same good as in Redux versions, but not wonderful. If you play Enhanced Edition you may see better performance in graphics.

[h1] Main plot [/h1]

From the very beginning something went wrong, Colonel Menikov is one of the main characters in the game, senior in rank and puts spokes in the wheels from the very beginning. Although logically he should, on the contrary, solve problems, and not create them. This character is written disgustingly in this game, and [spoiler] his death at the end of the game did not touch me, there was only a question - why it was not possible to write him in this game much better, to make more drama at the end [/spoiler]. Another thing in the very beginning, which has no explanation is - [spoiler] point-blank shot in Artem [/spoiler] , we just need to accept it. Another question - why other characters stopped to introduce our opponents? In the first game 2033 each big opponent was introduced, and I had a real scare to see a Librarian. In this game we see [spoiler] a flock of King-Kongs at the end in Novosibirsk, place where they shouldn’t be at all [/spoiler] , and nobody told us about them.

Everything else is good - new locations, we finally may see something more then Moscow’s Metro. Metro’s world expansion did really good. The construction of the plot and the alignment of locations looks very harmonious - the first half of the game is dark, we are smoothly brought to an end with the history of the Moscow metro in the middle of the game. Straight after it we have desert with brightness overexposure, and it looks harmonious as we have a new mission.

As in previous games we have two game endings: good and bad. Despite not a very good beginning of the game, the final looks really well done.

[h1] Open world and Mechanics [/h1]

In Metro Exodus we have different locations, which do not restrict the player's movements. So you may explore the world, and then complete quest tasks. Buy the way we have additional tasks, which are marked on the map with question marks. But we still not able to explore fully the destroyed Moscow. In fact, we get an imitation of an open world, we don’t have the opportunity in returning to previous locations and complete additional tasks. But nevertheless it is very good that we have the opportunity to explore the universe more.

Gaming mechanics have really increased, now we don’t have gun shops and bullet currency, in Metro Exodus all weapon improvements may be found only during battles, or after doing additional quests.

[b] Extra Information [/b]
At the time I was writing the review, have learned some additional information about the game. During main company we may have other ways in gameplay, if you rush and kill everybody on your way, then NPCs would be aggressive, and you will have all time shooter. But in other way, if you use stealth and don’t kill opponents, then some NPCs wouldn’t be aggressive, and may help in few questions. I personally used rush options mostly, but it looks as a good bonus for those, who use stealth.

[h1] The Dark side of the Exodus [/h1]

So what’s wrong with Metro Exodus?
[i] Open World [/i]
An Open World for the Metro game is a good step forward, but in my opinion one thing is missing - mini map. I do understand, that game wants to go more in realism, and it’s really good, but if you make a bullet counter in bottom right corner, it’s not a big problem to put a map in to right corner. Yes, developers gave us an ability to have a compass (but you need to find it, first of all), which always shows you the way to main missions - so if you are lost in the corridor this compass will show you “move straight, then turn left into exactly this door”. But it doesn’t work like this. 

If you want to visit an additional mission - you need to stop and open a map, but the game doesn’t pause, opponents still may hit you. And at the same time - game makes an ammunition deficit, very similar to Resident Evil. So it’s really easily accessible situation - small amount of ammo, a pack of monsters is chasing you, and you are lost in the forest.

[i] Technical problems [/i]
During my passage - bugs and crashes became synonymous to Metro Exodus. Although my computer meets the recommended requirements, each hour during large-scale shooters - game has crashed. In the middle of the game I have saved my progress, while the main character was in the car, and later when I launched the game it crashed straight after loading. When I was driving the car and stopped to check the map - the camera moved to an incomprehensible angle, and there was something like a third-person view. In the last chapter - boat didn’t want to turn, and only from third loading I had a chance to turn left. And this is a small fraction of those bugs that occurred during the game. At the middle of gameplay I caught myself thinking that I have to adapt to the game - to the way she behaves. So I can’t relax and play for my own pleasure, because I have to watch my every step so that the game doesn’t crash or break.

And the biggest questions had raised by the inscription - “ [u] Autosave data has been corrupted. Use the Chapters section to select available episodes.  Some saved levels cannot be loaded. The saved game information appears to be corrupted. Do you want to burn the game by replacing corrupted data? [/u] ”. I started the game on one computer, and wanted to continue on another one via Steam Cloud saves, but Metro Exodus didn’t give me such ability. Whose problem is it - Metro’s or Steam’s, have no idea, but it was the first and only error for all time while I was using Steam Cloud. By searching additional information about this problem I have seen that error with savings is a very common problem in case of Metro Exodus, mentioned by many users, not only for PC gamers but as well for console users.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
In general - main plot is good even taking into account some inconsistencies and enraging characters. The world is built very well, locations are memorable, and the feeling of innovation does not fade away until the very end.
Biggest problems are with bugs and crashes - 3 years past since Metro Exodus has been released and game developers haven’t fixed all this issues. For example 2 years past since Cyberpunk has been and today it’s wonderful game without all those problems, that have been at the release. In return, we were given two DLCs by 4A Games. In my understanding, DLCs and bug-fixes with optimization are not interchangeable, taking into account that DLCs must be purchased in addition. If there is no such technical problems in Enhanced Edition version, then why regular Metro Exodus is still available to purchase?
In general, the attitude of developers to the game and their customers after the release is very frustrating.

 [h1] One more thing - Sam and Colonel [/h1]

The first DLC is “The Two Colonels”, we are revealed the history of underground life in Novosibirsk, which has touched upon in the last location of main Company. The duration of this DLC is 2 hours. I really enjoyed this DLC. In such small duration developers created a beautiful story that surpassed the main game in terms of plot, emotions and richness.

Sam’s Story - is the second DLC, which takes 5 hours to beat (main game is 10 hours to compare). Not a bad story came into plus extra location and several endings. Need to know - this DLC has same technical issues, as were in the main company.",1674507622,1674507622,False,3,1,0.492887526750564575,0,True,False,False

PROS:
-Amazing music
-The last level of the game (which was similar to the previous two games). 
-Metro 2033 (redux) was good, go play that instead.
-Metro Last Light (redux) was good, go play that instead.

NEUTRAL:
-Voice acting is hit or miss. Katya and her daughter are particularly bad, but several characters have problems with awkward forced (and inconsistent) accents. However, there is a ton of voice acting and some are well done.
-The ""Enhanced Edition"" supposedly has great graphics (if you can get it to run).  I have an RTX 2070 but could not get playable FPS in enhanced edition even with all settings on low/off. 

CONS:
-The plot. Metro Exodus completely abandons every plot point that was built up in the first 2 games. 
-Weak map design: the majority of the game takes place outside in bright, large, and open areas - exactly the opposite of the atmosphere that made the first two games great. 
-""Open world"" elements are contrived and pointless. There is literally no reason to explore the world. The only thing you might find are some weapon ""upgrades"" (ie larger magazine, better stability barrel, etc) or generic collectables. 
-You can only use 1 of each type of equipment. You will never use any of the other gear, so why bother to look for it?  
-Generic meaningless collectibles:  I found ""audio tapes"" and ""postcards"" - neither appears to give you anything for finding them. The postcards have no lore and I have not seen anywhere to find the list of the ones you've already collected.
-Nothing to do in the open world. There are some fuseboxes in human sections that turn out the lights...yay...
-Extremely verbose NPCs. The idea behind having lots of voice acting to give life and background to the world is wonderful - but this is a textbook example of failed execution. Various NPCs throughout the game will talk.....and talk.......and talk....... but not say anything of value. Neither adding to the lore of the game world nor to the gameplay as a player. They just say endlessly gibberish. 
-No fast travel
-1 vehicle that stays where you left it (only on the Caspian level).  
-BUGGY BUGGY BUGGY
--Corruption bugs: half the time when I load the game, it tells me that my file has been corrupted. This would normally worry me, but it doesn't seem to actually do anything as my save game still loads with no changes. 
--AI bugs: enemies will see you through the ground/walls; being in the ""dark"" will make you totally invisible at times, and have absolutely no effect at other times; going the exact same route will result in different AI behavior (e.g. sometimes they see you, sometimes they dont). 
--Map bugs: after spotting camps (""?"" on the map) and going to one, even after looting the area, the map would not update (and continued to show a ""?"")
--Crashing bugs: one particular sequence on the Caspian level constantly crashed the game. I had to crouch and look directly at the ground while navigating the area to get past it.
--Car/Journal bugs:  if you open your journal while in a vehicle, your head will go through the roof and you can't see out the windshield correctly anymore",1672312238,1674449976,False,8,0,0.448130518198013306,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER
The game crashes way too often, and it's one of those crashes that forces you to reboot your entire pc because you can't alt tab to task manager to force shutdown. Happens like every 2 hours and it's especially annoying when going for 100% achievement which requires you to complete the game in iron man mode.
Iron man mode does not allow you to make saves so once you start a level you have to complete it in one go, with these common crashes it's impossible to complete a level because once you get to the end of a level it crashes, you lose all your progress on that level and you have to start over.
TLDR
buy the game if you don't care about achievements and having to force reboot your system every so often.",1674403915,1674403915,False,1,0,0.493723869323730469,0,True,False,False

Oh wait guys! I got tears. Not the ending I thought was gonna happen. I totally thought it was gonna die.. I was ready for that and I wasn't ready for miller our team to die I wasn't ready for Miller to die. I didn't realize they liked Miller so much until he died um... I can't even talk guys, got me shocked.. um.. he died which I know is the way he would want to go but just thinks that we finally got to the place that he had been dreaming of his whole life and now he's dead but he's buried to the place that he was looking for his whole life so now he'll be there forever and he gets to know that his family is safe and his family has a place to start over which is good. 

The game grew on me a lot I wasn't sure how I was feeling at certain points, you know he saw my frustration but it really was a great story I got really attached to the characters they did a good job of making you feel like they were your family and wanting to fight for them and, big upset when they died and so on.

one problem with it is also how you don't really know what you're supposed to do most of the time aside from your main objective, like should you waste most of your time looking for useless upgrades to get a meaningless achievement?

maybe this game really is meant for normies that never played 2033 or last light and love the idea of 'russian fallout'

i encountered more bugs in this game than i have in both 2033 and last light (more bugs that are open to see)

the atmosphere is there but what atmosphere is it when you're on an open field like the caspian desert that's very bright and not much of a scary place like the moscow metro was

what i also noticed was that when you play the volga level and you kill 'too many' cultists you are punished for the entire game and get your chance to get the good ending lowered significantly
in the originals it was pretty straight forward with a couple of twists that make it more difficult but it wasn't that hard to figure out

i got the bad ending because i killed too many cultists with the game ignoring my attempts at completing optional things like getting the guitar for stepan or the teddy bear for nastya
maybe it was my fault for not getting too immersed and trying to spare HOSTILE enemies

if i didn't listen to the tribe people in the taiga level i wouldn't have thought about not killing the tribespeople, still without proper combat and no remorse it doesn't feel like a military man fighting for his crew but a pussy who will do anything to not kill anyone attacking him

this was a very lazy attempt at making people think of their kills, just because you didn't kill a particular group off or saved it, means your friends are going to die altering the ending (???)

do not treat this game like religion and don't think of it as the best game ever because that isn't true, if anything 2033 and last light are closer to the best games ever than this piece of crap",1673981660,1673981660,False,4,1,0.407106399536132813,0,True,False,False

One of the first things to hit you is the horrible graphics. The art direction is off-putting. It doesn’t help that the character models are also terribly made.
The environments are bland and plain. Even without the terrible graphic design, Metro Exodus looks like a cheap-looking indie game.

The Metro Exodus audio design is terrible as well.
The game’s atmosphere is ruined with the sounds of music playing like some awful soundtrack in a porn movie.

The bosses and especially the bosses with multiple enemies makes the bosses hard to fight. I know because I’ve fought several.
There is also a terrible checkpoints system.
The game gets confusing when it comes to the world building. It’s difficult to understand the geography and the characters.

Speaking of characters, you have to put up with some annoying voice acting. You’ll have to let it go.
The voice acting isn’t bad, but it’s not great either. One character comes across as un-fun, annoying, and bland. You’ll have to decide whether that character’s voice is funny or annoying.

The most annoying is Metro Exodus’s protagonist Artyom. Artyom is like a wannabe John Wick. He has an attitude and won’t stop.
The end result is that Artyom is not fun to play.
He is all over the place, as if he were daydreaming. I don’t know how it’s possible to build a game around a wannabe character that acts like a maniac.
With all the issues that were built into Metro Exodus, it’s a little too much to take.

Even with all the issues, I can see the potential. The world is visually stunning. It’s dark and scary at times, and it’s dark and scary in almost every frame.

I also forgot to tell you, it's a first person shooter game. I know, i know, i'm shocked as well.

Ehhh... Please, can i finish my review here? I think i've said enough about this terrible piece of junk that you probably figured out.

Should You Buy It? I wouldn’t recommend buying this game.

Must play!
The best part!
Graphics isn`t such bad. but I can`t say it`s awesome.
Nothing special in game mechanics. just fps shooter with craft.
Story is exceptionally good, characters memorable and good written, culmination gives strong feelings, and I love it.
Locations are pretty average, there`s no anything special, empty world and maybe few intresting spots, but it`s still very atmospheric and beautiful.
Overall:
Pros;
-story
-characters
-atmosphere
Cons:
-little amount of mechanics
-a lot of bags with animations

My first playthrough of the standard edition at release suffered from a couple of hard crashes that required patches to fix, but I was able to complete the game and enjoyed doing so. This edition seems to be significantly more buggy. I've had 7 or 8 hard crashes, needed to load historic saves to get around buttons not working, alt-tabbing seems to break the game at seemingly random times, and a number of the animations are still broken, for example reading a map whilst in a vehicle causes the camera to be stuck in the roof. 

The game itself is pretty fun though it suffers from being 'open world'. Part of the suspense and charm of the original games was the the feeling of being confined within the metro. Where searching for upgrades and sneaking around enemies left you with baited breath in the original, here you spend most of the time crossing expansive areas with nothing to do but look at the pretty landscape. Then it crashes and you have to do it all over again.

There is also no suspense in this game unless you play on the hardest difficulty and even then it's more frustration than suspense. You'll probably spend a good 20 hours playing this game and you'll enjoy it, though I doubt very many people ever play it a second time.

I played the first two and enjoyed them overall, and this one has been okay, but now that I can't even play it because of some bug that has existed for years and never been patched, I can't recommend it.

-----------------------------------

I'm leaving my original review up so people who had the same issue can learn from it. I got past the bug by simply restarting the level. I'm now well beyond where I had the crashing issue and haven't experienced another since. I still haven't completed the game but other than the crashing issue It's been okay. 

Overall it isn't a bad game, but metro has weird movement and the AI look weird and unnatural. Jumping is very floaty and if you aren't careful, if you are sprinting, you will run off steps and fall to your death.  When ever you aren't on flat ground you'll feel like you are in a world with less gravity. I played and have beaten the first two Metro games but I don't remember if they were like this as it has been many years since I played them.

The game has been good enough to keep playing but usually it's in short sessions of 2 or 3 hours and then I need a break.

Back in 2019., my PC was too weak to run it, but after an upgrade I finally bought it and let me tell you, it's beautiful.
First few games had this grim, dark gameplay focused on atmosphere, with rare moments to relax. I loved it, to be honest. There was something special about the fact Moscow felt so alien and scary, you *couldn't wait* to return to Metro's safety. Even Metro tunnels, as dangerous and scary as they were, still felt like home. Now, in Exodus, you embark on an entirely different journey. You leave Moscow.
Without going into spoilers too much, I'll just say you visit different areas, explore different places, bond with your crew A LOT and find adventure along the way. But fear not, because it still retains what made it a horror game first place. A lot of quest areas are still creepy (arachnophobes, be ware), there are few scattered jumpcares, and the stealth is an important part of the gameplay just as before. Game retains ""good/bad"" ending, and it mostly depends on whether you've managed to sneak past enemies, since murdering  NPC' s the game considers innocent counts towards the bad ending. Still, it does not take away from enjoyment. You can freely kill bandits, thugs, basically anyone who wields gun (only very specific areas require you to spare everyone). I'm halfway through the game, and so far only two areas were like this, so it's not really a big deal. 
There are, also, some very calming, relaxing moments. Taking your time on Aurora feels like being home. You can sit down, have a drink, take a smoke and talk with your friends and your love, Anna. You can listen to them, see their own stories unfold in front of your eyes and it's just as great as it sounds. Games like this truly give me hope developers can still make a game that's both inspiring, tells a great story and a game that's fun for one thing a game should be: a escape from a harsh reality, an exodus.",1673560493,1673560493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A beautiful and very touching storyline, one of the few cases where you really feel for the main character and his friends, in this game each character is very well described, in the course of the game each of them reveals its own character, each shows its own character. Also this is the most atmospheric game I have ever played, when playing on good settings and with headphones the immersion in the game is unbelievable. I also liked the humor of the developers, many locations have hidden jokes, my favorite is the inscription on the ceiling ""why the fuck did you raise your head"". And the music, it's great too, at least during the game we'll hear KINO songs a few times.

-Incredibly immersive. Little touches like having to duct tape a broken gas mask or wipe the spores from your visor really help make the game feel alive.
-Weapons have to be maintained and cleaned, inventory screen doesn't pause time making it incredibly tense. In a fun way!
-Ai is surprisingly good. If you encounter enemies alone, they'll be more cautious, and they'll be more aggressive in packs. Humans will react to your performance, they'll lose confidence as you reduce their numbers and can ultimately surrender.
-Compelling narrative that embraces a human element lacking in most games. For a post apocalyptic action shooter, this game is about loving life and humanity, having hope for the future, and being willing to fight for it.
-I really love these segments between chapters where they're just riding the train until you proceed with the story. You can walk about, take in the sights and sounds, rest and socialize with your companions, even play guitar or pull the horn on the train. Truly a wonderful touch and one of my favorite parts of the game.

Cons:
-A game about survival immersion should really have food/water management, at least.
-Slippery controls, sometimes feels like piloting a hovercraft over ice rather than a human being with solid footing. You will slide off platforms and bounce off small bumps until you get accustomed to these physics & stop trying to do cool things.
-Cinematic priority, sometimes your actions don't matter because the game has a pre-scripted scene prepared. 
-Buggy. Really kills the mood when the games trying to be all cinematic and cool while objects are flying around and you're being attacked while casually locked in a cutscene animation.
-Ledge detection is terrible. Expect to stand in front of ledges jumping over and over until the game finally recognizes what you're trying to do and climbs you up.
-This is NOT an open world game, they're just large, linear levels with multiple pathways. It's not open world in philosophy either, expect plenty of invisible walls and action restrictions.",1673129167,1673449126,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I now play on a Mac.

Like STALKER, it's ""Eastern European"" so...
1. It's plot is obtuse which sometimes feels like high art and other times like gibberish.
2. It has the bare minimal ""train/learn"" level.  You get the keyboard command once for a second or so and then the game assumes that A. you saw it, and B. you'll remember it under pressure that comes almost immediately.  You'll be making a different plan fairly often during the load screen.  Fairly steep and Darwinian.  Even more so than what I remember of STALKER or the original Metro (which, IMO had some legendarily difficult ambush moments).

So that all makes it different than the typical ""Western"" AAA title.  Which can be refreshing and maddening at the same time.  

Now what's worse.  This feels like a console port.  Or coded on a common-platform for the reduced control set of a console.  So many buttons are ""triple overloaded"" meaning every button does one thing if merely pressed, another thing if pressed-and-held, and yet a third thing if double-pressed.  Given that the game is ""Eastern European"" and designers from that ""school-of-thought"" love their everything manual with this button to reload, that button pressed once to fire, that button held to charge the weapon, etc., etc., you will find yourself accidentally pressing-and-holding when you intended a double-press (or vice versa).  And dying because of it.

So I tended to give-up and wait for the reload screen when getting ambushed+mauled by melee baddies.  I am a pretty ""set-in-my ways"" stand-off + pie the corner FPS gamer.  IMO, you need to be excellent at stand-off cover-based shooting and clever about tip-toeing into the ""baddie alert radius"" very carefully.

Would I buy it again?  Probably not a full price.  But it was on sale.  Still, it's not COD.

Post-finish edit:  Okay I finished.  Got the bad ending.  And now I sit wondering whether to play to strive for the good ending and play the DLC.  Truthfully, I am probably not going to bother.  FWIW.",1673074104,1673408644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first time wen is saw they will move the gameplay outside the metro lines/stations i say ti will fail  really hard, but man i was wrong , really wrong. Is extraordinarily well thought out and put in place, with hubs areas wer you can search  and lose time. Grate mix of clause combat and open freedom , really good balance between this two gameplay.stile.
The atmosphere is post.apocalyptic perfection ( similar to s.t.a.l.k.e.r. ) and the gun play is feeling so have and good.

Here, you continue playing as Artyom, as he and his crew left Moscow behind in search of a better place to live, free of radiation. They traveled to several locations across Eastern Europe and Central Asia, encountering different types of people and a variety of landscapes, such as slavers on a dried sea and grown-up summer camp kids in a lush valley. It's a welcome change of setting from the previous Metro games, which has very little differences in people you meet and locations you visit.

While promoted as an open-world game, its kinda hard to consider it as one. The maps are bigger and less linear compared to the previous games, but not a ""true"" open-world, like lets say, Borderlands. Some maps are linear, but bigger and there can be alternate paths. Some other maps you can free roam, but most of these areas are visited anyway since the missions are like round-trips along the map, making free-roam kinda pointless, and there's no fast travel and you cannot return to previous levels. There are no secret sidequests or unique, powerful weapons in hidden corners of the map. The most you'll get is probably extra loot or collectibles, which usually aren't that far off from the main path.

What I think is a major improvement is the portrayal of characters. Due to the ""road trip"" nature of the game, most of the characters you meet either stays with you, and those who don't usually plays a major part in the chapter they're in. It makes them more memorable, unlike the previous games where sometimes I am left wondering if I have met this character before because they appeared once, and disappears until we meet them again in later levels. You can also hang around them in levels or in the train where they keep talking with you or with each other, sometimes telling important info about themselves, or the place you're in.

A new feature in this game is the crafting and customization system, which replaces the military ammo currency. There are no merchants in this game, but you can craft ammo and consumables by yourself. And for weapon modifications, they are found on dropped weapons, which you can keep and install yourself. You can change your weapon with any other you picked up while on the train. Makes it easier to make powerful guns, without worrying about the currency or hoping an enemy drops a good one.

For me, there is only one problem with this game, the ""saves corrupt"" notice. Despite that, it seems like an empty warning, since if you choose not to overwrite your saves you can continue your playthrough without any problem. But I really wish there were more open-world maps, since most chapters are linear ones, and some more sidequests would be nice. And maybe a more detailed journal entry regarding those, since some additional objectives are mentioned in dialogue only and you could probably forget.

Metro Exodus is a pretty major improvement over the previous titles, in graphics, atmosphere, level variation, and character portrayal.  If you enjoy the previous Metro games, get this one and finish Artyom's journey. If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic games or the STALKER franchise, give the Metro games a try, but do not start with this one as this is the end. It comes bundled with an Enhanced Edition version, but that one requires a strong PC and doesn't have cloud saves.",1673337255,1673337255,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game but only if you haven't played another Metro game before. It gives the full 'Metro' experience and it has all of the new things this game has to offer. If you have played another Metro I don't think this game adds anything new or special.

[h1] Review [/h1]

I will try to summarize it in different parts: Combat, Story and Mechanics. Last part I think is necessary to mention because it's a part which I personally don't like.

[h2] Combat [/h2]
The combat is pretty interesting in this game, not really too challenging but just enough for casual single player experience.

[h3] Weapon gunsmith [/h3]
Very good combat and very interesting gun mechanics. I don't remember how it was done in Last Light (that was too long ago for me) but I guess this was a bit different. The guns were interesting to tweak and they didn't  go the route whatever you find new is automatically better. There are some downsides to some attachments, but not too much. They could've done more in this department.

[h2] Story [/h2]
Story wise I don't really liked it that much. I played it at English and I really got irritated by the Russian accent while talking English (with occasionally a Russian word in it). 

[h3] Characters [/h3]
Anna's constant hugging and asking if you're OKAY got very annoying at one point. I know it's probably if you're more immersed you get attached to the character but I kinda lost that because of the annoying voice acting. 
The characters are OKAY-ish, I don't feel there's anything to write home about. I don't really feel like the characters stand out that much. I don't feel Duke, or Danish or whatever they're called have any unique personalities. Just NPC's that are at a certain point in the game.

[h3] Cutscenes [/h3]
There are A LOT of cutscenes in this game and they get really annoying because you can't skip them at all. They're all set in the in game world and the game developers didn't find a way to skip these apparantly. Very annoying if you're doing another walkthrough (which is needed for some achievements). If you've seen it once you don't really need to see them again. 

[h2] Mechanics [/h2]
The constant 'E' holding and 'R' holding (for weapons) is extremely annoying after a while. Some things can really be improved upon. It almost feels the game has some kind of limitations in it (game engine perhaps?) so a lot of animations need to be forced into place (crawling, going through tight areas etc).

[h3] Quick Time Events [/h3]
If you like them, cool, you'll have fun, but in this game there are so many of them, and they're all so predictable. I can't count how many times Arythom fell of something and get saved or have to stab a creature. After a while it gets frustating.

[h3] Movement [/h3]
The movement of your character is like floating into the air. While running you sometimes just float in the air and you get some airtime and it's very easy to get fall damage. Sometimes even from very low altitude. Your character forgots what gravity is at times and he just goes all over the place. Sometimes it feels like you're stuck at very weird areas. This is not something I personally like and it's very, very annoying. 

Overall the movement and the way the character just runs or walks needs improvement in a further installment. It's not 'clunky'per say, but too 'floaty' if you catch my drift.",1673302639,1673302781,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Game can be pretty easy on anything but the highest difficulties (I've basically only died to fall damage) but gunfights feel invigorating regardless so much so that I try to forgo stealth as much as I can for the challenge. Your character's movement is a bit too fast considering the spaces you move around in, I constantly run on top of things or glitch into spots. Great looking regardless of the inproperly animated mouths of some of the characters, though this is probably because they're synced to Russian and not English. Can't wait for a sequel, hopefully they follow the same crew.

Mechanics like having to clean your weapons, craft filters, fixing your gas mask, and charging your flashlight may be realistic, but I feel like they just hold the gameplay back. Luckily, you don't have to do these often, so they are just a minor annoyance. The level design also isn't always perfect. Most levels consist of you pulling a lever somewhere to move on (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but often times levels are so dark with so little clarity it can be hard to even find the lever. Additionally, sometimes the game makes you do a bunch of running around to fetch stuff just to open a door, which isn't very fun.

The pros:
- top tier atmosphere
- beautiful graphics
- good sound design
- good crafting system
- deep immersion (backpack/crafting animations, minimap design)
- solid gunplay
- Two Colonels DLC is prime Metro content

The cons:
- The only real negative thing in this game for me is that they opted for Artyom being silent (besides the loading screen text). This aspect broke the dynamic of most of the cutscenes' and ingame experience aswell. 
This got changed in the 2 DLCs, and it really highlighted the lack of voice acting for Artyom.

Metro Exodus is a post-apocalyptic survival shooter developed by 4A Games and released in 2019. I've been a fan of the Metro series for a while now, so I was excited to jump into the third installment and see how it stacked up against the previous games.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Metro Exodus builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors, with a focus on stealth, survival, and resource management. The controls are smooth and responsive, and the gameplay mechanics, such as the crafting and weapon customization systems, are well-implemented and add depth to the experience.
One of the standout features of Metro Exodus is its open-world environments, which offer a refreshing change of pace from the linear levels of the previous games. These environments are detailed and immersive, and there are a plethora of side missions and activities to discover. However, I did encounter some bugs and glitches during my playthrough, such as NPC characters getting stuck in the environment or weapons disappearing from my inventory. These issues weren't game-breaking, but they did detract from the overall experience.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
Metro Exodus follows the story of Artyom, a young man who embarks on a journey across the post-apocalyptic Russian wasteland in search of a new life. Along the way, he meets a diverse cast of characters and encounters various factions, each with their own motivations and agendas. The story is well-written and engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is well-balanced, with a mix of action and slower, more reflective moments.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
Metro Exodus boasts impressive graphics that are a step up from the previous games in the series. The environments are visually stunning, with detailed textures and realistic lighting effects. The character models and animations are also top-notch. The sound design is equally impressive, with a haunting soundtrack and realistic sound effects that really immerse you in the world. The voice acting is solid, with strong performances from the main cast.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
Metro Exodus has a decent amount of replay value, with multiple endings depending on the choices you make throughout the game. There are also various difficulty levels to challenge yourself with, as well as a New Game+ mode where you can carry over your upgrades from a previous playthrough. The open-world environments also encourage exploration, with hidden secrets and collectibles scattered throughout the world.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, Metro Exodus is a solid addition to the Metro series and a great example of a survival shooter done right. The gameplay is engaging, the story is well-written, and the graphics and sound are top-notch. While there were a few bugs and glitches that detracted from the experience, they were few and far between and didn't ruin the game for me. If you're a fan of the Metro series or survival shooters in general, I would definitely recommend giving Metro Exodus a try.",1672787720,1672787720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Exodus improves on everything good about the previous two games and adds to it. The narrative has a much more cinematic flair and has much more compelling characters compared to the previous games. The linearity is also stripped back as half of the levels take a semi-open-world approach, allowing for further exploration and side quests. This aspect is particularly balanced well since it doesn't double down on side quests and markers like a lot of AAA titles do. While it might seem that the grittiness of the previous games is stripped back, it doesn't shy away from creating an unforgiving environment and an engaging survival horror experience. This game is one of the best post-apocalyptic shooters yet and is a must-play for those who like the Half-Life and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.",1672780385,1672780385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They are all great games and it was fun to the systems progress from then to now. It feels like the developers really put care into making this games and you can see it in the little details.

I will say that I usually am not big into horror games, but this one struck a nice balance and doesn't rely on jump scares or cheap tactics. It's more about the settings and environment, which is really a key character throughout.

These games are often discounted way past what they are worth, so I'd recommend playing through the series if you have the time. If you don't just play through this one as it has the modern and polished.

The story like the other games is rich and immersive. The world space and design is very impressive and I do admire that they went for a less linear experience for the main story.

BUT

Although I enjoyed this game and it's DLCs I do find myself at times yearning for the more scripted and linear formula that made Metro so enjoyable. This game has a mix of both open world sections and closed linear section. Both are great, but for me what makes Metro so enjoyable was the journey you experienced in the heavily scripted sections where the story telling is most pushed. I do feel that the characters and the relationships were an integral part of the game but I do also think that interactions were forced far more than they should be however It doesn't detract from the overall story experience.

Overall this game in my opinion is a great addition and it offers a lot to be enjoyed. If you want a story rich game then it worth a look at. My recommendation is the play all three games in order to see the development of the story.


Performance:

Out of the the time I've played this I've never crashed or had issues. I've logged a few bugs but it has been lovely and smooth experience even on my ageing hardware that lacks the RTX cores.

Should you buy it: 

YES. 

My rating:

9/10 - shooting mechanics

9/10 - story and lore

9/10 level design and environment

- I got this one dirt cheap (6USD).
- The overall quality is OK.
Bad:
- Artyom is married, so no romance options for you. Had to stick with a bunch of men till the end. I don't hate Anna but she's not my type.
- No ""Skip conversation"" option, gotta sit through every same convo/cutscene over and over.
- Not much hint on where to go next, could make you stuck in the first run for hours. Or waste lot of time checking every nook and cranny in each room.
- It seems like open-world but it's more like a linear stage-by-stage, not much options to choose, either ""go loud"" or ""go silent"", but sometimes it has only one option ""shoot the head or you die"".

It's not challenging nor fun at all, it's just punishing. The RH mode hates you! I recommend the game, because the story in general is good, and worth a playthrough or two.
As for the two DLCs: 
I loved the Two Colonels DLC! The story is perfect, the protagonist is enjoyable, and the whole atmosphere is soo good and tragic. The way we get to know what happened with the father and how Miller goes through the whole story is heartbreaking, very well written and fantastic.
Sam's story was a bit underwhelming for me. I enjoyed it, but I don't know... it was ok.

The crafting is unnecessary, boring, and only there because crafting is 'in.' 

Metro's never had great cover mechanics or been a great FPS but in the Metro it was less of an issue. Being suddenly swarmed by zombies (yeah there's zombies now) and watchmen in an open field, it'd be nice to be able to actually take cover. 

And of course the open world adds nothing to the game. In fact it detracts from the charm that the first two had. The open world is pretty, but empty except for a few packs of animals, the occasional surprise demon, and the areas that are populated with people. It may as well have been a metro system with a few branching lines. 

Overall 6/10. There's better horror games, better fps games, and better open world post apocalypse games. Metro Exodus falls short in every category and lost the charm of the originals.

Update: Beat the game. Got the 'good' ending. The last mission is the only mission I enjoyed and was the only one which stayed true to the originals. No change in rating, 6/10.",1672175704,1672328713,False,12,3,0.590278208255767822,0,True,False,False

We follow Artyom yet again, obsessed with discovering a world beyond the frozen lands of the radiated Moscow surface and the metro-system he calls home, it's a fruitless journey. He continuously comes home injured, clinging onto life, unfairly wasting the dwindling metro medical supplies to fuel himself for his next expedition. Until one day, he learns through a quite literal trial of fire, of the state of the rest of Russia. And through that discovery, the truth behind his wife's father, who is pulled on a journey with Artyom. And a handful of Spartans, the metro-systems guardians, who willingly explore unknown lands for a chance at a better life. 

Metro Exodus is an incredible, emotional, send-off to the world we've learned to love over the course of the last ten years. The visuals of the game are incredible, with beautiful view's of the Post-Apocalyptic world that we spend the entirety of the series in. With a vast range of levels, we see a wide range of scorching sand dunes, to cramped, dank swamps. Frozen over cities and breath-taking river look-out points. This may be one of the most detailed and awe-inspiring open-world games I've ever played. And for the cherry on-top, for the most part. Metro Exodus ran incredibly well, with great optimisation for all PC's. Granted you can't run it on a twenty year old laptop, but if you have a solid setup. The game will run incredibly well with minimal hiccups and not even losing out on too much at lower settings.

Game-play is similar to the first two games, although with some welcome additions and reworks to fit this one's new open-world style level system. With the introduction of an on-the-fly weapon modification system in the form of a tactical backpack. And while the idea of having to scavenge a barren wasteland for materials to upgrade and maintain weapons may sound annoying, the world is anything but barren. It is chock full of bandit camps, mini-adventures and dangerous zones to scavenge. I've played this game a few-times, and every time my journeys have been different to the last. In the form of random events and the changing day/night cycle and dynamic weather system. All-ways keeping you on your toes.

The story is just as quality as the first two, and even better, the relationship between Artyom and Anna is explored more than it was in Last Light. There are at times where the writing can be seen as clunky, weird, out of place, or other vague descriptors I can use. It's less objective driven than the first two, and more emotionally driven. Straying from the hopeless feel of 2033's campaign, and the Call-Of-Duty aesthetic of Last-Light's.

Audio is good, that's all I can really say. It has kept it's original style of music, with the grim orchestra's that are audible in every track. Con's? Bugs, there were quite a few in the twenty-one hours I've played, crashes, visual bugs, broken shaders, and an ominous black void that consumed my screen once. Boss fights are not at the same level of quality that is the rest of the game, simple shoot at it until it dies design. Not what I had expected from the Metro franchise, but with the context of it's trying development, it's understandable. 

In short, it's a emotionally charged send off to Artyom's story, and can stand as one of the very few successful video-game Trilogy's. My final rating is a strong 8.5/10.",1672184551,1672310292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another noteworthy bug is the fact that sometimes the hitboxes of the enemies when it comes to mele engagements cannot be reached when standing nearby leading to some frustrating moments where I was unable to engage the enemy despite being close enough.

If you're looking for a single player game I'd recommend skipping this one. The cutscenes are way to long and don't add much to the story, the same things can be said in a quarter of the time. The voice acting for English is uninspired and bland. From the first moment Anna started to speak I could tell it was gonna be that type of game. 

Exploring in this game is near useless because most of the time you get only metal and chemicals. If you see an area of interest you will soon realize it's either inaccessible, a maze, or just an empty area the devs decided to add to make the game more interesting. 

The game is also extremely buggy, I can't even walk without getting caught on some geometry and jumping around it is just as hard. The game feels like fallout new vegas but extremely stripped down. The boat mechanics are terrible, the field of view inside the car always glitches when pulling out the map, you can clip through some shipping containers sometimes, there's just random debris that is frozen in the air. There are so many more bugs in this game but these were just a few.

This game is also visually unimpressive, it looks like a game made in 2013 even with the ""extreme"" video settings.

It is the third installment in the Metro video game trilogy based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novels, following the events of Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light. It released in 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia and in 2020 for Amazon Luna. A Linux and macOS conversion was released in 2021. An enhanced version of the game released for Microsoft Windows on 6 May 2021, and was later released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 18 June 2021. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics and sold 6 million units by February 2022

Metro Exodus is set in the year 2035, one year after the events of Metro: Last Light, on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been devastated by a nuclear war. The game continues the story from Metro: Last Light's ""Redemption"" ending. Similar to the previous two entries, the player assumes the role of Artyom, who flees the Moscow Metro and sets off on a continent-spanning journey with his allies to the far east, on a locomotive called the ""Aurora"". The story takes place over the course of one year, starting with a harsh nuclear winter in the Metro. Another major character, returning from the previous game and the book Metro 2035, is Anna - who is now Artyom's wife. Miller, Anna's father and leader of the Spartan Order, also returns from previous games and novels.

After the attack on D6, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the constant infighting and corruption within the Metro and leaves the Spartan Order. He soon becomes obsessed with proving that other human survivors exist outside of Moscow and makes numerous dangerous expeditions to the surface, much to Anna's concern and Miller's frustration. However, on one such expedition with Anna, they witness a working train running on the surface. Before they can follow it, they are captured by Hansa soldiers, along with a group of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow. The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners, and Artyom is shot and left for dead, taking Anna to their base. Surviving the gunshot, Artyom follows the soldiers to rescue Anna, and in the process inadvertently destroys a signal jammer that was blocking all communications going in and out of Moscow. Radio transmissions from all over the world begin to be picked up, and Artyom and Anna realise humanity has not gone extinct. They escape by stealing one of Hansa's locomotives, the Aurora, with the aid of a defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak.

As the train leaves, the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Anna's presence. Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth, Miller concludes that the Spartans' best chance of survival is to flee Moscow. Once outside the city, he reveals to the others that while many of Russia's cities were bombed, the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation. To prevent NATO from attacking Moscow, the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived. They then receive a radio broadcast from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the ""Ark"", located at Mount Yamantau. Miller decides to head there, believing that the Ark is where the Russian government has rebuilt itself.

After crossing the cult-controlled Volga River, the Spartans reach the Yamantau base. They discover the base's service and construction crew have devolved into cannibals who lure survivors in with the false promise of safety. Artyom and the Spartans manage to fight their way out and escape, but Miller's faith in Russia is shattered when he discovers that the government never took refuge in Yamantau, nor survived the war, and thus the Spartans are left wondering what to do next. Using a map they recovered from Yamantau, they decide to travel to a satellite communication center near the Caspian Sea in the hopes of gaining access to a satellite to find habitable land to settle. At the dried up remains of the Caspian Sea, the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map.

As the Spartans continue on their journey, Anna begins to cough up blood, fearing the cause was accidentally breathing poison gas during the journey. They decide to scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see if it is suitable to settle. While scouting the forest, Artyom is caught between two rival survivor factions, and he discovers that the dam protecting the valley from radiation is on the verge of failing, making the area uninhabitable. Artyom returns to the train to learn Anna's condition has worsened. The Spartans detour to the heavily-irradiated city of Novosibirsk, the closest location where an antidote may be found.

Miller and Artyom decide to head into the city alone to search for the antidote despite the risk. They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kirill, one of the last of the Novosibirsk survivors, who explains that his father left on a mission to obtain a map marking the location of a clean, habitable area. Miller and Artyom split up, with Miller going to find the map and Artyom searching for the antidote. He manages to recover the antidote, but is gravely wounded by a mutant and absorbs a heavy dose of radiation. Artyom, Miller, and Kirill return to the train with the map and the antidote, but Miller dies of radiation poisoning on the way back after using a dose of anti-radiation serum meant for himself to save Artyom. The rest of the Spartans donate their own blood to give Artyom a critical blood transfusion. Anna is cured with the antidote and with the map, the Spartans settle on the shores of Lake Baikal, which is completely free from radiation.

Artyom's ultimate fate depends on the choices the player made during the journey; In the bad ending, Artyom dies from the radiation poisoning, and the Spartans and a grieving Anna hold a funeral for him and Miller while Artyom's and Miller's spirits awaken on a dilapidated version of the Aurora, remaining in the ghostly purgatory for eternity. In the good ending, Artyom survives. Miller is buried and Artyom is selected to take his place as leader of the Spartan Order. Now with a home free from radiation, Artyom decides to return to Moscow and reveal the truth of the world to the survivors of the Metro.

The Two Colonels
While Artyom goes to find the cure for Anna's illness in Novosibirsk, Miller begins retracing the steps of Kirill's father Colonel Vyacheslav (Slava) Khlebnikov to find the satellite map. One year prior, Khlebnikov works as a soldier protecting the Novosibirsk Metro while raising Kirill. Meanwhile, the Novosibirsk Metro government, OSKOM, makes plans to evacuate the Metro but there isn't enough anti-radiation serum to protect the entire population. As a result, OSKOM begins forcibly confiscating serum from the populace, causing civil unrest. Civil war soon breaks out in the Metro, forcing Khlebnikov to defend OSKOM headquarters from the rebels. However, General Anatoliy Vinogradov (Tolya) deploys poison gas during the battle, killing almost everybody in the station. When Khlebnikov confronts him, Vinogradov (Tolya) reveals that OSKOM leadership has already taken what serum is left and fled, deciding to flood the Metro with poison gas to mercy kill the rest of the population. However, bitter that he was left behind, Vinogradov (Tolya) orders his men to destroy the OSKOM evacuation train before committing suicide. With no other choice, Khlebnikov descends into a mutant-infested bunker to retrieve the map leading to Lake Baikal. He finds the map, but succumbs to radiation poisoning after losing his serum dose. In the present, Miller enters the bunker and finds Khlebnikov's body and the map.",1672110329,1672110329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:Atmosphere and sound are there , graphics are immersive and as an avid fan of post apocalyptic and survival style games  there is nothing else out there to hold a candle to Metro. Gun play is solid., sounds are robust and there are no magic levelling xp boosters and the like in this game.Your patience and skill and scavenging will make you better.The story line : Decent adaptation of an excellent book.Sadly, the English voice acting is quite bad since they are forced out of their element.All of this could be ignored since some of the dialogues on the train are  good and the last chapter it is very engaging.Could have used some more patching towards quality of life improvements and iron out the bugs?  Yes. Dolby Atmos if you have it, cuts the sound in the middle the game.;as a workaround, go to settings, sounds, disabling and enabling it again  will make it work until it doesn't, personally, I end it up playing without to avoid the grief. .Ironically I never had any problems with Metro Last Light, smooth sailing all the way.New game + is another one that has a mind of it's own and it works or it doesn't. 
All in all: is not a bad game:For the competitive gaming market , few patches to address these plagued bugs would put this game at the very top.
My two cents: wait for a SALE.

pros:
- beautiful graphics
- a decently sized arsenal of weapons with tons of customisations

- a lot of exploration 
- resources everywhere
- pretty fun DLCs

cons:
- open world
- sluggish movements
- riddled with bugs (thankfully it isn't game breaking)
- relatively useless silencer attachment
- super slow loading screens

it has been years since i last played the first 2 metro games so there isnt really much for me to compare this release to. the freedom of customisation really made this game shine for me and players no longer need to purchase ammo and upgrades like the first 2 games, instead it is all obtained via crafting and things like medkits and filters can be crafted at any time even without a crafting bench. 

the biggest issue i had with the game was it being open world. true, many people love the fact that certain stages/chapters were open world allowing players to explore the area however with the really sluggish movements, it made exploring an open world stage tedious, even when im sprinting it still feels so slow.

all and all, still a really good game and a must play for those we enjoyed the first 2 games. 8.5/10",1671526072,1671774066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A bit more world freedom, a tad less innovation, and a huge chunk of Russian 'survivalist' male power fantasy (which resembles Mad Max quite a lot, only you get a lot of tinkering with weapons and tools). And a lot, really a lot of modern Russian scenery. You could think it is postapocaliptyc, but no, it is not, it is very realistic in fact.

Anyway, it is a good oldschool single-player story-rich shooter game. Fun to play as soon as you get through the Prologue to chapter one.

At the end of the game I say that writing is 10 out of 10. Full pass-through took me roughly 20 hours

Runs like shit on modern hardware, takes 5-10 minutes to boot up, go through the intro, and load the game. You want to change your options? It takes 5 minutes to load your CHANGES for some reason. You can skip a few minutes of boot up if  you just delete the web.m files of the credits + introcinematic files.

Now, the actual game itself seems alright. It's.. i mean, it's metro. Complete with ""My sight was on that dude's head, but I feel like I missed somehow?"", the ""Ah yes, throwing knives are my best combat weapon against most animals,"" and the likes.
I thin kthe combat is good, actually. But I regret not playing it on Ranger Hardcore. Not that it would have mattered, because I stopped at the Desert open world area.
Why did I stop there?
Because the game takes so goddamn LONG to launch or do ANYTHING. And when you *do* get in game, you get random, semi-frequent stutters, random crashes, and the physics is kinda fucked. You knock a dude out and he gets sent into the stratosphere and I'm left wondering ""When is the game going to deduct arbitrary morale points for me killing a man by sending him into orbit at escape velocity speed?""
Also, Koch media? Man, come on. I hate capitalism.

In short, I don't know if it's just a shit port or terribly optimised. Or maybe it's just made to push the absolute LIMITS of hardware in general, in which case who in the goddamn has the money for top-tier hardware in *this* economy?
And before you say, ""But Pride Lizard, you complete moron, why didn't you just skip the intro cinematic instead of waiting for the minutes of playing it to end?"" BECAUSE YOU CANT. The people who made this decided to replicate the bold choice of Dark SOuls 2 credits, which is ""We want you to watch this 5 minute unskippable cutscene we made."" But at least Dark Souls 2 credits you could skip by alt+f4ing at the end, or being on NG+.

Also! The game has a narrow field of view by default, it has motion blur on enabled by default and you cannot disable that in game, you need to fuck around in the files. now, the ENHANCED edition has this. However, the ENHANCED edition also needs a 3080 or better to run and, just generally, top of the line specs. 
There's a fun game in this, but it just feels ruined by the lack of.. literally any polish that would make it run better, not crash, and not take years to get back into the game.",1671658410,1671658410,False,8,3,0.402350574731826782,0,True,False,False

The game's introductory sequence feels par for the course for Metro, but it is not long after that you begin to take on some of the big changes made this time around. Gone are the deep, dark crawls through Metro tunnels; instead, welcome in some open-world and above ground environments. No longer wishing to stay in Moscow, Artyom and the remaining rangers board a train, taking them well across Russia. 

There are three major 'hub' locations to explore, with some shorter, linear missions sprinkled between. I will say that these larger environments are very beautiful to both look at and pillage through. They are a far cry from the same train tunnels of 2033 and Last Light. However, at least a first, this feels like a detriment to the overall experience. Having grown used to the charm and almost cozy feel of the dimly lit underground, these new sprawling areas feel somewhat overwhelming. It often becomes difficult or even tedious to navigate, and while they look great, they simultaneously feel empty. 

I would spend much of my time exploring every nook and cranny that I could, only to find buildings devoid of any loot or anything of notable interest. Key locations, typically involving main missions or the handful of side quests generally bring more detailed areas, but you will find that there ultimately isn't much to do in the open-world beyond looking at some pretty scenery (which isn't entirely a bad thing) or fighting off the occasional mutant. 

Side quests are one of the places this game falls short. You are only provided a few per section, mainly being a quick fetch quest or clearing out a bandit camp. Going for this approach, I would have hoped they added more to do in these big expanses. Realistically, you could probably clear each main area in under an hour if are quick about it. 

The main reason to explore is to find supplies for the new crafting system. You can now locate various resources in the environment to craft items like medkits or ammo, as well as find new modifications for your weapons. Basic crafting can now be accomplish at any point using Arytoms backpack, with more advanced stuff needing to be done at workbenches scattered throughout the levels. While I appreciate this added element, it eventually starts to feel thin; like it needed more available options to work with. It wasn't long before I found certain weapons and attachments that I exclusively used the rest of the game, as there was not much else to mix and match. That said, it does still at least offer more customization than the first two.

Stealth is still a large part of the gameplay, and in fact heavily encouraged if you want to see the 'good' ending of the game. You can take out lights, hide in the darkness and choose to peacefully knock out enemies or stab them in the back. There are some more repercussion this time around for going in guns blazing any time you come up to an enemy encampment, but that option is still there for those with that preferred playstyle. Certain sections thankfully offer a few different approaches for variety, such as sneaking your way directly through a hostile camp, or scanning the environment for a side passage that bypasses it entirely. 

As far as enemy AI, it still feels roughly the same with only marginal improvements. It seems this time around, enemies are more prone to movement in efforts to dodge your shots. There were still some moments though where it could use some work. There were many times where I was hidden in darkness and absolutely sure I was out of enemy sight, only to immediately be discovered and alarms raised. General movement around the environment could have also used some work. Artyom now quickly becomes tired after sprinting and must slow to catch his breath if prolonged for too long. While this might help with realism, it quickly becomes an annoyance when you have such a large map to traverse. Additionally, some of the jumping and vaulting mechanics were quite finicky. At times, carried momentum from a jump would send me falling into water, or I would randomly get stuck against a rock and slow to walking speak for no reason.

Story of Exodus is more substantial, with greater stakes and more emotional moments. There is also a lot more detail and liveliness to the characters, helping the game to feel much less static than its predecessors. I won't spoil any of it here, but if there was one thing for sure worth playing the game for, it would be to see the final hurrah of our former subterranean dwellers. At its core, many of the key components that make of the series still work well and are fun on their own. It is with the drastic changes made that I wished they spent a little more time fleshing out, providing more for the playing to do and see. While maybe not the send-off that Metro needed from a mechanical perspective, the storytelling and visuals certainly do it justice.",1671652731,1671652731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I paused my playthrough about halfway through and played the first two games...that's how quickly I fell in love with the setting. The story of Artyom doesn't continue where Last Light left off though...which I actually appreciate because the ending of Last Light was super lame. For the first time in the series, Artyom sets his sights on the idea of freedom and life outside the Metro (hence Metro ""Exodus""). 

The narrative is phenomenal and I would absolutely call it a hidden gem in the current cesspool of AAA games. The characters are interesting, and you'll find yourself picking up great bits to the story if you stand around and listen to them talk. Of course, this is a little awkward since Artyom is a silent protagonist, but its cool nonetheless. The impacts of your decisions dictate some major occurrences in the game, and you'll pick up on Artyom's moral status from NPC dialog. 

Its similar to the morality mechanic in Red Dead Redemption 2. How good or bad you are dictates how the story unfolds. Unsurprisingly, this makes for outstanding immersion. This cheeky buzzword is overused by critics to describe games these days (which ends up being false), but there is no way left to describe it. 

Played at a moderate pace with exploration included, the game is about 21 hours long. Just like in the first two Metro games, taking side routes is rewarded with precious resources. The shift from the claustrophobic metro to the wide open wastes of a post apocalyptic Russia really enhances this element. Metro Exodus is one of the few games I can recommend at full price. You get away with robbery if purchased on sale. I've already purchased and played Two Colonels.
