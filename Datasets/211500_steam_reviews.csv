and you should aim for a quality wheel but an xbox one controller will do just fine to start with 

though you will always (when you get a new wheel or controller) need to spend some time fidling with sentivity etc 

there is some post here and there about how to config the controller 
Edit : 
R3E/KW Studios have made a lot of changes regarding config controllers / wheels so no need to spend hours to config your wheel or controller now its basicly plug and play !!

pretty good graphics though some say it aint that good but hey either they play on a potato or demanding triple A 2016 graphics of a 3-4 year old game or even older 

lots of cool cars some is free most of them cost money though but i find the carpacks worth it im guessing its how you look at it

After a few minutes I actually get a headache from it.
No triple screen support for non Nvidia Surround players.  I have an AMD Radeon 7900 XTX and this game displays all three screen on the center monitor with no fix as the max resolution can only be set to 2560 x 1440 when 7680 x 1440 is what is needed.  Fiddling in the graphics config file is also no help.
Too much tire squeal for my tastes but thankfully you can dial the volume down.
Maybe it is how I drive but the cars suffer from a lot of understeer (RWD, FWD, AWD doesn't matter).  Tuning menu is limited also - can't even do simple things like adjust tire pressure.

Coming from a few years of iRacing I like to play ranked racing and I think this offers a good experience and it has a better/cheaper buy in model than iRacings offerings. free to download so you can get to know the game, then when you are ready for ranked racing you can buy a starter pack for like $10 USD. this gets you into ranked Rookies with a bunch of other cars and tracks. 

Graphically its dated but not to dissimilar to iRacings dated graphics. Apparently this could be the next big change coming to RaceRoom soon so that will be interesting.

Downside is the lack of players to fill in sessions (depends on time of day). Its a shame because the cars feel great on my Direct drive and all my fancy equipment works perfectly. The cars feel lively and fun to drive with good detail when pushing to the limit.

I own rFactor 2, Project Cars, Stock Car Extreme and Assetto Corsa and this game feels as good to drive as any of the others. Maybe not quite as good, physics wise, as rFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa, but it looks wonderful, as nice as Project Cars.
I feel that this Racing Sim is a little underrated and doesn't get the credit it deserves.

Plus points:

Runs at well over 100 ( nearer 200 ) fps on my system! ( i5 4670k, 16gb ram, Nvidia Geforce 970 gtx, Acer 144mhz monitor. )
Wonderful force feedback with my Logitech G27 wheel.
Looks lovely, tracks, sky, cars, reflections, very nice indeed.
Great leaderboard challenge mode.
If you alter car settings you can feel the difference.
Online races can be very good, with less ""console racers"" than on Project Cars.


Minus points.

DLC can be expensive.
Game is threadbare unless you're willing to purchase some DLC.
Online games are hard to find without DLC.
Plenty of online servers are empty.

Overall, this game is great fun.
I would recommend downloading the barebones version to start with, if you enjoy the couple of free cars and tracks then it's well worth considering buying some DLC.

This may lack Hollywood graphics but the 2D work is one of the best around. You feel there and not in a plastic environment. I wish games that aims towards photo realistic aesthetic would care more about the 2D work instead of filling the scene with dozens of lighting shaders to hide flat textures. A balance is nice.

The sound is the BEST around. Race Room Experience has been for years famous about its sounds and it is beautiful. You'll hear a TON of sounds related to the environment, tire contacts on gravel, curbs. Lots and lots of sound enrichment everywhere. The engines, the turbos, the gearboxes sounds, magnificent really.

When it lacks a full day-night cycle, as you're limited from dawn to dusk, the games makes up for functionalities such as custom championship, strooong AI, multiclass races, support for more than 40 AI cars as I can't remember where the maximum is.

DTM packs like the 2014 up to 2016 are state of the art fun!

Old monsters such as group 5 cars are very rewarding to drive.

The roster for cars is excellent. Pick a favorite class or two and grow from there with track packs that discounts a lot from picking single tracks.

Once you're set on a certain race setting you'll be set to have loads of fun with minimal nuisances like other tittles. No murky graphics. Still easy on old GPUs on maximum graphics.

What a jewel. It really is.

I thoroughly recommend this game for Racing Sims and Games enthusiasts, especially for those who look for single player.",1437833314,1662605874,True,3,0,0.516369163990020752,0,True,False,False

Came from the Race07-XX series seemed like the best fit. I enjoy it its nice to practice on. FFB has much to be desired, what ever happened to the wheel going loose when you loose grip in a corner or spin the rear wheels? i struggle to find the edge of grip like i did on the older series. seems to randomly vibrate when going in a straight line, IDK, i've tried many guides and i cant get it how i like. i want the wheel to have a good drop off of force when it does but its marginal . its just more interested in giving me random vibrations from everything else.

I want it to be good but its not a patch on the older race series, if they had not pulled the plug on the older servers i would still be playing it. Yet to try any of the other titles/options yet so i cant compare to others.

You almost need to do a three point turn to get through a 90 degree corner. It really is astoundingly bad, and I'm dumbfounded at the fact that they thought this was good enough. I don't know how to get rid of the understeer through tuning, and I suspect that it's not even possible to get those bad cars handling properly with how much understeer they have.

Die unten beschriebenen Probleme haben sich mittlerweile fast alle in Luft aufgelöst und ich spiele R3E sehr regelmäßig und häufig. Insbesondere der Mehrspielermodus in Kombination mit eigenen (kostenlosen) R3E Servern ist wirklich zu empfehlen!

Wenn es läuft, macht es Spaß. WENN...

Im Vergleich zu iRacing, ACC, AC, Project Cars 2 ist die Handhabung der Software von R3E ein absoluter Graus! 64 Bit läuft auf meinem PC (Win10-64, i5-9600k, RX5700, 16GB) gar nicht, weder mit noch ohne VR. Die 32 Bit Version hatte ich mal ans Laufen gekriegt, mit und ohne VR, aber seit heute verschwindet der Mauszeiger im VR-Modus.

I play all the major sims (rfactor, AMS2, iRacing, ACC, AC) and find RaceRoom a solid addition to all of those. I think that the negative feedback seems to come from people who were expecting more of an arcade racer, whereas this is definitely a sim.

FFB on my G920 is really nice and detailed - you just need to adjust the FFB strength on each car (assign a key on your keyboard) using the FFB meter to avoid clipping. The sound is fantastic, with loads of squeals, clunks and shakes, non of which feel canned. The graphics are solid - on a par with iRacing/rFactor/AC content, though more consistent than any of those.

The starter pack price is usually <£10 and as long as you look out for sales you can buy the whole content pack for about £30. I find the AI fine - they are a bit bumpy with each other, but generally fair with me and they are certainly fast enough.

VR is a solid experience. It just works. The older graphics mean that it is easy on your hardware, albeit annoyingly it is CPU limited because it is (I think) single threaded.

The only thing it lacks is numbers of players in multiplayer and (this is a tiny thing) a better way to see/find cars without clicking into submenus on each class. That said, I can usually find a 10-20 car grid at any time.

Very good physics, driving feels very good, if a bit easier. That also allows you to push your car to the limits even better, which is also a plus for me. Very good netcode, that deals with lag generally well, and does not turn simple car contacts into physics-and-race-destroying sends into the shadow realm. Hard racing is definitely possible.

Expansive breadth of content, constantly updated, and most importantly high quality and less expensive to obtain than it's main competitors, rFactor2 and iRacing. This, coupled with the initial free-to-play model, also makes this title more accessible to people who are dipping their toes into simracing.

Force feedback is very good and detailed, feels very *weighty* but still very informative. You can feel the car grip throughout corners and adjust accordingly. Of course, that means that yes, a sim racing wheel is required. Don't try to play online with a controller or keyboard.

1; It's free (at least to start off). The content they give you is no slouch either. You get some pretty potent hillclimb cars, a Le Mans-esque prototype and a few others, a decent selection of tracks, and the option for single/multiplayer. I mostly enjoy single player so this is more than enough for me.

2; The paid content isn't overpriced. I recent bought the Nurburgring pack, as well as the 2015 DTM pack, which together got me something like 10 new cars and 5-6 new courses, all of which feel incredibly high quality and well worth the cash. Considering I've now dropped about as much money into this game as I would on any other average full game, I consider that a pretty good deal.

3; The physics and force feedback are downright phenomenal. I can't say I've ever driven a racecar, but I've driven some pretty quick rear wheel drive rides with stiff suspension and grippy tires, so I know the general feeling they have. This sim honestly has some of the most true to life sense of grip and acceleration, and the FFB is excellent out of the box with no tweaking, even on my modest G29 wheel. I always felt like I knew what my car was doing, and if I spun out or understeered I usually knew exactly why (usually my own fault).

4; The AI is pretty darn competent. As I said, I mostly prefer single player, and a lot of the time, I find AI in racing games/sims to either be 15 seconds ahead of me, or I'm 15 seconds ahead of them. There's rarely an in between. In RaceRoom, I'm often going 3 wide with the AI for entire laps, trading places and just barely keeping a lead if I do manage to get it. Very refreshing to have some real challenge in a single player racing sim. It's also fairly customizable so you can easily start small and work your way up to brutal difficulty. I set mine to 96 (out of a max of something like 120) and felt that there was a great mix of challenge and reasonable pace.

I'd especially recommend this sim to those who are new to the genre. There's a lot of fun and learning to be found here literally without spending a dime. The paid content will also add a lot to the longevity if you find yourself liking it.",1620950371,1624212510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Incredibly unimpressive. I am compelled to write this review as I've just requested a refund for the 1992 DTM car pack, which I bought because I love the idea of racing old, manual DTMs. I also have the DTM 2013 experience which I got, completely by accident, out of a random lootcrate on one of those grey market things. What I thought I was getting is a spiritual successor to the rather phenomenal Race 07, still one of my favourite racing sims (it runs really well, has decent AI, and drives very well). What I got instead is...well, keep reading.

[h1]A Wheely Bad Time[/h1]

This will come as a surprise to most of you, probably, but this racing simulator, for driving cars, has really horrid wheel support. My G29 was recognised only once out of the four times I launched the sim, and it seemed to insist that I had no H-shifter even thought I did. When I finally did get it to co-operate, I found the force feedback to be mistifying. Entirely too heavy, poorly aliased, and with arseloads of clipping. The shifting is also really strange because sometimes, it didn't quite get the memo that, when shifting out of a gear, it should shift to neutral. Instead, it hung in gear for a good bit. The clutch feels spongy and I've managed to clutch-kick the 1992 DTM BMW into more corners than I hadn't, and trust me, whilst I am not a good driver, I know how to drive a manual car. 

[h1]Artificial Stupidity[/h1]

I have absolutely no idea how they have managed this, but the AI in this game is worse than it is in Race 07. Not only will they routinely linger on the racing line, the marshal AI will call a blue flag whenever there is someone behind you. It is irrelevant how fast you are going or if you're on a fast lap, and they're slower than you, you [b]will[/b] get a blue flag. I ended up having to turn full flag rules off for my one and only attempt at an event because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have been able to complete a warmup session. To say that the AI overtakes would be a significant overstatement because they don't. They've all gone to the Lance Stroll school of driving, meaning that if there are two cars in a corner, and you're one of them, taking the inside line, the third guy behind you is about to send it so hard he'd make Charles Leclerc convert to e-mail. 

[h1]Physics, graphics, sound, and the goodies.[/h1]

This sim has no weather. [b]This sim has no weather.[/b] You cannot set it to rain. There is no rain in it. In a touring car game. No rain. I want to repeat this because it took me six or seven passes in my own head to parse it: [b]there is no rain or weather simulation of any kind [i]in the officially licensed WTCC/WTCR touring car game[/i][/b]. I thought I was dreaming. I am not. I need to remind everyone here that Race 07, a game made by this studio's predecessor FOURTEEN years ago contains semi-dynamic weather and dynamic traction simulation. It's not great, but it's [b]there[/b].

The graphics themselves are mediocre at best for a contemporary driving sim. Not much to say there. It didn't cook my PC the way Assetto Corsa Competizione tends to, so I guess that's a plus? It looks measurably worse in every other way. The cars all feel the same, but honestly, I couldn't even comment on that because setting up the FFB is a bit like an exercise in ritual suicide. You're guessing for the most part, and when you're not, you're probably wondering why your pedals suddenly don't quite work anymore. 

[h1]The verdict[/h1]

I'm a firm believer in perference. I mean, for God's sake, I prefer Race 07 to ACC purely because I can have a 20 car grid without boiling my CPU. We all like simulators for different reasons. But the execution of this is so slapdash and lacklustre that words fail me. Perhaps the most shocking thing to me is the fact that this, much like Dirt 2.0, is a DLC simulator. For 100 USD, one HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARYDOOS, you can get the entire sim. And not even any future content, but what they specify on their site: any content [b]currently available[/b]. So, 100 USD, and then however much you'll need for every other thing they put out. Perhaps someday they'll charge us for rain.

First of all, it pricey.
Second, you do not get a change to test a car or a track before buy it. This is ridiculous. Give us a chance to test it before buy it or at least possibility to return it back.

------- original post dated by 2013
------- updated in 2021

There were number of changes since I wrote my review. There was definitely great additions such as test drive before buy, price wise it is way cheaper than others, new cars and tracks. I like that.
But, unfortunately, I hit couple of major problems (at least for me):
 - being in North America it is hard to find any server with more then 5 racers in the evening (very often there is only one or two);
 - ranking races has an unfortunate schedule for North America, when on rookie servers available through the day and you most likely would be killed there on the first lap;
 - and major problem are endurance or big event race - it is almost impossible to get to any server that day and most of the time you will face ""Server error 13"". I feel that it is a bad idea to block game and force to restart if player was not able to connect to the server.

You get 3 cars or so and a couple of tracks, then you HAVE to spend MONEY.

OK get past that... IS it a sim, Well you CAN adjust the seats,mirrors etc.
You also have a HUGE choice of sound options, but how do you adjust the ""CAR"" setup?
Short answer is you can't. Not suspention, Not brakes or tyres. Infact playing ""Single player"" I
could find NO meaningful car adjustments at all.. So it is NOT really a sim...
SO what the hell is it? It is a fairly good raceing game, Do i enjoy playing it?
Yes i do, to the point of spending some cash to get the DTM ""classic"" pack & the 2013 DTM season.
The cars are good, drive well but still no ability to customize car setup for your own driveing style..

SO in summary :
1  It is NOT free to play, Be prepared to spend a lot of $ if you want ALL the content...

2  It is NOT a SIM. If you are looking for a cool game this might be it. If you are looking
for a HARDCORE ""racing sim"" Keep looking, this isn't it..

[b]The Cons[/b]
-R3E is a free ""content sold separately""-type of game, which almost inevitably means [b]ALWAYS ONLINE DRM[/b]. Occasionally the server is under a heavy enough load for even the main menu to barely work, which is really frustrating as you might imagine.

[strike]-The collision physics - at least against the AI - are complete BS. Just tapping an AI driver with your car tends to send you into an unrecoverable, Mario Kart style spin for no apparent reason. It's far from undriveable in singleplayer, but I can't understand why such an obvious issue has persisted for years.[/strike] Seems to have been fixed at some point.

[strike]-While you can turn off all the camera shake to alleviate potential motion sickness issues, it leaves you with a camera that is completely rigid relative to the chassis. With lower cars like formulas and prototype cars it can result in really intense shaking that makes it hard to see where you're even going. I've never gotten motion sick but I had to just stop after a race with the formula 2 cars at Zolder and do something smooth because the constant shaking made me feel a bit queasy. GT cars are much more manageable. [/strike] I've not had camera problems in recent times.

-Raceroom is not at all moddable, and the rigid nature of what you need to own to race with cars from a series can be a turnoff for some people.

-The FOV setting is a multiplier, but there's no mention anywhere of how wide the default field of view is. (Note: No idea if this is still so in 2020)

-While I have a lot of good to say about the AI, it's also quite annoying sometimes, how they feel very slow in slow corners (turn 1 at Salzburgring is one example where I struggle to not rear-end them mid-corner) and almost seem to be cheating in sustained corners (like turn 2 at Slovakiaring), so there's still a lot of work to do on that front.

I think that's most of them. I'll update later (2020: I did!) if I remember anything else that I'm not too happy about. On to the pros!

[b]Pros[/b]
-It's a decent enough racing sim, but of all the sims I do own (iRacing, AC, Rfactor 2, AMS, AMS2), this is the one where I sometimes just put the difficulty to amateur and race with all the magic stability assists and stuff, because the driving remains fun. [strike]This is also the only of the aforementioned sims with an inbuilt Championship mode. [/strike]

-The variety of cars and tracks is good. Now, the complete package is ridiculously expensive, but Raceroom offers roughly videogame-priced packages that gives you a series of cars and some tracks to race around on. It's also very easy to be picky after you have tracks. For example to race a series, let's say GRT3 since it's the GT3 class with the highest variety of cars, you only need to buy one of the cars and a livery from that class. That's roughly 3€ total. The AI is free to drive even the cars you don't own. The tracks are the expensive part, at around 5€ each. Still a better deal than iRacing I suppose.

-The AI races you hard. It probably only loses to Rfactor 2 in the competition for the best racing AI. [strike]The abovementioned collision issues are there,[/strike] and the AI likes to stick its nose wherever there's a gap for even a second, but largely they leave you just enough room to fight for position without being punted out.

-R3E is the best sounding racing sim by far. All the chassis squeaking and stuff really adds to immersion.

-My experience is that the game runs really well for how it looks. Not sure how it is with higher performance machines.

-Force Feedback might not be the objectively best one, but it sure is extremely customizable.",1486503488,1603302857,True,5,0,0.547073960304260254,0,True,False,False

I'm so glad that Sector3 has created and refined so many of the aspects of this title that make it special among the Sim-racing titles.

When they added drive-train physics, it immediately drew my attention and I was eager to add more content to my RaceRoom experience. With every physics or sound update, I want to add even more content.  I'm happy to continue support of the developers by doing so as they continue to reward me back with more updates and further improvements.

The VR and audio support is excellent. In fact, my recent VR experiences in RaceRoom have been second to none, largely due to the incredible audio effects. I can think of no more immersive aural experience in any racing title to date. When combined with VR and motion, it's just more exciting and immersive.

Attention to detail and choice of settings also make this title outstanding. Having individual audio settings for effects such as the Transmission or Backfires, enable us to make the audio experience truly next level stuff.

The variety of content covers a lot of classes, so there should be something to suit any preference.  What one purchases is about as flexible as can be and the pricing is more than fair, especially when taking advantage of  special pricing offers. I much prefer this pay-model over the service-based model iRacing uses.

This was supposed to give improved force feedback and replaced the old one. Sadly this FFB didnt work out well for all users/steering wheels.
After this patch i have never been able to play the game since the FFB is absolutely 100% off for me.
There is 2 main problems:
1: I have no feeling of when i oversteer from throttle on  exits of corners. The FFB curve does not move at all while i end up oversteering out of the track. This makes it iommpossible for me to drive without traction control.
2: The FFB spikes up and down inconsistnely when turning. I have no idead whats going on and no way to fix this. The FFB gives big spikes that clips my wheel with no information that i can use. Only way to rmeove this is to lowe reverything down to 1% or turn off FFB. Both gives me no FFB at all.

After every major patch i launch the game and test the FFB, and it never gets any better so far. I have tried different setups and reset FFB with no better results. All tested on Fanatec CSL Elite.
This is for me very depressing since i have bought bascially everything in the game, but can't use any of the content anymore.

This game is the only i have FFB problems with. Its fine for Dirt rally 1 and 2. Project cars 2, Assetto corsa, iracing.

Old review:
This game gets way to many undeserved bad reviews. This game isn't supposed to be played on keyboard and its not a casual arcade game. The game is great if you have a FFB wheel. It has decent graphics, amazing sound and alright physics. It does seem like the free2play cars isn't that well made, but the wtcc and gt3 are great. This game also gets hate for being superexpensive (it is if bought a single car or track at a time), but buying in bigger packs makes it a lot cheaper. Also, on their webpage you can buy enough vRP's to buy every car in the game for 65euro (still somewhat expensive, but not nearly as expensive as ppl write in steamreviews) Link: https://www.raceroomstore.com/shop_en/10-000-virtual-racepoints.html

Also note that the steam carpacks are very overpriced if they are not bought on sale.

The way the car handles is just awesome & have the latest cars like WTCR 2019,DTM car from thr 80s to the latest. the tracks all laser scanned. But this game can cost a lot if you buy all cars & tracks so it easiers to just buy the cars you need most of the time you get GREAT deals on the raceroom exp site direct http://game.raceroom.com/store/ . They have so much off packs of cars & tracks like up to 88% off & you get like the DTM cars & like 10 or more tracks. But you do get a few tracks with the game to start with & cars. The only thing about this game is the MP trying to set-up a sever is a nightmare out of 4 of us 1 has it working we all done the same ports but for some reason dont connect to sever, Even when you get the dedicated server from STEAM it no help... GOOD LUCK WITH MP its a pity because if ther could get MP easier i think more people would play it. Overall it a stunning game with great graphics & the FFB on the streering wheel is awesome. A lot of setting you can do with your wheel set up & lot easier to catch the car from spinning out than on PC2. So ENJOY the game & i might just catch ya online if i get MP working.

Mainly for the way there was only 12 cars and 2 tracks to race on and the rest as DLC. But after enjoying DCS which also a free to play that charges for DLC I thought it would be very hypocritcal of me if I didn't give Raceroom another chance. So I re-installed and played some more of Raceroom and my opinion sort of changed about this game. I thought ""You know what, maybe raceroom isn't so bad after all"". 

Personally I didn't like the AI because they tend to race far apart from eachother but the rest of the sim is enjoyable. Hopefully Sector 3 studios will improve the AI in the future.

EDIT: (FEBRUARY 2020)

Just gone back to playing Raceroom and after a few months of absence I decided to play it again. There's defenity bean an improvment in the AI since the last time I played it. I also found out that Sector 3 studios just recently started up ranked lobbies hence why I took that opportunity to go racing online. The racing online can get a bit rough here and there and you might find the odd shittalker or rager, it can get a little bit rough online in terms of racing but apart from all that its generally the cleanest racing that I have seen in a while and a good cheaper alternative to Iracing for those who can't/don't want to pay for a monthly subscription.",1462980991,1581289200,True,0,1,0.492682933807373047,0,True,False,False

What that means is that the game gives you a variety of race cars and race tracks to choose from with a focus on simulating real racing. If you're looking for city driving or an open world experience you're barking up the wrong tree, period -- this game is just not for you. With that out of the way, here are some reasons why you might (or might not) be interested in RaceRoom:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- [u]Sounds[/u]: Easily the best sounds of any sim. From what I've noticed, given the sims I've played, pretty much all of the sounds for every car are fantastic: internal and external alike. This isn't like other games where sound quality varies wildly per car.
- [u]Free to play[/u]: The game is free to play and you can also try out any car and track in the store for a limited period of time (I believe this was recently changed to a full day trial, up from the 5 minutes or so that it used to be). You don't need to dump money into this game if you don't believe it's worth it.
- [u]Adjustable physics[/u]: If you haven't fully caught on to the whole ""sim"" thing you're welcome to adjust the physics to your liking, from ""Amateur"" with various driver aids to ""Get Real"" which focuses entirely on emulating the driving experience one would get in real life.
- [u]Force Feedback[/u]: Over the years Sector 3 has really made strides in improving the force feedback of this game and as such I can definitely say that, in my personal opinion, R3E has some of the best FFB of any sim available today. Recently, Sector3 pushed out a major updated vastly changing the FFB feel for all of the cars, allowing for a wider variety of different sensations while driving. What was already among the best has only gotten better, especially among the GT3 cars which received the biggest update.
- [u]Controller support[/u]: Sector 3 has outdone themselves with the controller support in this game. Driving with a controller yields a lot of feedback and really gives you a feel for what the car is doing at any given time. If you don't have a wheel for whatever reason but do have an applicable gamepad and are looking for a sim to play this sim is definitely for you. Consider checking out [url=https://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?threads/a-beginners-guide-to-gamepads.9250/]this guide[/url] to setup your gamepad. 
- [u]VR and Triple Screen support[/u]: If the lack of or improper support for these things put you off before, just know that they're available now and the game might be worth picking up again if you dropped it specifically because of one of these things. 
- [u]GT3 cars[/u]: Ever since Sector 3 redid the physics of the GT3 class cars, this game has quickly become [i]the[/i] go-to GT3 simulator for me. If GT3 cars are your preferred car class (and if you're like most people, they probably are), you need to check this out. Sector 3 updated GT3 car physics yet again since I last posted this review and these cars have only become better. The cars are a little bit slower but much more realistic in handling.
- [u]FWD Cars[/u]: R3E does FWD cars better than any other sim, IMO. If you're into that, look no further. 
- [u]Damage modelling/physics[/u]: The damage model used to be a con without any way to punish miscreant players, but now it's definitely a pro. The damage modelling in this game has come a long way now with suspension damage, tyre flat-spotting and more ways of breaking the car finally arriving. I would say the damage model is up to par with iRacing now (if not better) and the days of people ruining others' races knowing that their cars won't be significantly damaged if they decide to hard punt someone seem to be a thing of the past now. The damage model is still not perfect, of course, but I imagine it can only improve over time. If people aren't careful, they will ruin their own race as well as that of others! 
- [u]AI[/u]: The AI in this title is absolutely fantastic. They're very aggressive/racey without being overly ""punty."" The AI isn't perfect but the quality is definitely up there. 
- [u]More to Come[/u]: Dynamic daylight progression is a good sight and a great omen for things to come. The game also features many new tracks that rarely (if ever) appear in other sims, which is definitely a huge plus. It also looks like Raceroom is starting to make its first push towards proper ranked multiplayer, so it seems as though the coming year(s) will have a lot to look forward to.  

[h1]Cons and other potential negatives[/h1]
- [u]Career[/u]: This is more of a soft con (i.e. not really a con if you don't care) than anything. This game has no ""career"" mode (the closest you'll get to that are custom championships) so if that's what you're looking for you're not going to get it from R3E.
- [u]Multiplayer[/u]: This also isn't exactly a con since this game [i]does[/i] indeed have multiplayer, but if you're interested in the kind of structured pick-up-and-play nature that iRacing has you will not get this here. Sector3 has been looking to make improvements in this area though, so keep your eyes open. For the time being, though, [url=http://www.simracingsystem.com/]Sim Racing System[/url] and [url=https://www.justrace.net/]JustRace[/url] offer RaceRoom support, providing 3rd party alternatives to iRacing's matchmaking system. If that tickles your fancy, consider checking them out. 
- [u]Pricing Structure[/u]: Pricing structure is a bit weird. You have to buy every car and every track, which I don't necessarily see as a problem, but if you buy a car pack once and Sector3 releases several new cars for the class of cars you bought, you cannot buy the car pack again. I don't personally care about this but this is something that seems to put people off so it's worth considering.

Overall a great sim, and definitely worth giving a shot despite the (unfairly given) mixed reviews. Easily up there with Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, rfactor 1/2, iRacing, AMS, PC2, etc. You don't necessarily [i]need[/i] a wheel to enjoy it but like every other sim I would strongly advise you to get one in order to get the most out of the gameplay. Pricing structure could definitely be better but I can definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a proper racing sim.

Third admission - I only restarted this in December 2019 and am really glad I did - it really is a gem. I kept seeing the updates for it and thought I would have a go at it - really pleased that I did.
I have read the comments about the cost of buying into all the cars and tracks, but you don't NEED to buy them all - I just bought the current F1 tracks and some cars and away I went. To put it into perspective I also have iRacing - now that is expensive and it's a recurring cost - this isn't. And have you looked at the cost of updates and new content for any good flight sim !!!!!!!  I find the car physics very good, the FFB through my Fanatec set up is brilliant, as it is through my Thrustmaster kit so it's not just working on the upper tier stuff.
The tracks are accurate and the MP is very reasonable. 
I can honestly say that as a 70 year old that NO-ONE is going to let me drive very expensive machinery around a track at top speed, but with this I can indulge myself all day if I want to and never get tired of it.

Initially I bought all DLC packs from Steam page on sale, then something more with VRP in 2018. After the big  update in December 2019 I bought Premium pack for 49 euros. Totally satisfied, there is now so much content I can't find time to try it all, especially the tracks I have never driven in other sims.

PROS:
* Overall most diverse sim content wise - historic Group C cars, 1992 DTM, 2003 DTM, Group 5, Formula 1990s, GT1, GT2. GT3, GT4, modern DTM, WTCC...
* Latest physics update made cars much more believable to drive. Before that I had abandoned RR because driving felt too easy and forgiving.
* FFB is just as good as before, at least for me. No need for playing with settings on my TS-PC Racer, except increasing FFB multiplier for some cars.
* Interesting selection of tracks. Apart from classics, like Spa, Monza, Zandvoort etc., there are many locations that I can't even find mods of in AC.
* Online racing is functional and quite fun.
* Since this is older title, it runs very well with 30+ cars, and environments still look good. GTX1060 all maxed out on 2560x1080, no problems getting 140fps.
* Sounds are good.
* If you use dash plugin, you get all the HUD info you need - delta, tyres, radar, motec...

CONS:
* Online connection required play? WHY? In the night after update their servers were busy, so each menu screen took like a minute to load. WTF?
* Menu system is badly optimized. It takes too many mouse clicks to get to playing. Click to continue to main menu> Single player > Race > Select Car > Select Class > Select Car > Select Skin > Select AI > Select Class > Select Car > Select Car > Select Car > Autofit > - - - -  if you want less cars than full grid > Accept > Select Track > Select track > Select Layout > RACE > loading..... > Click to continue... > Continue > Continue > Continue > RACE...
* Other menus are clunky too, with lists that have scroll buttons on side to get to bottom options.
* AI likes to ram you when returning from off-track.
* There is some artificial punishment system if you hit AI from behind. Sometimes AI likes to brake in apex when it should be already accelerating, and when you hit them from behind your car turns 90 degrees or more, so your race is basically over. Never happens to AI cars if they do that though.

Pretty expensive. If you want to buy, go directly on the raceroom website and get the combo.

And by the way, in december of 2019, it has received a major update with so much more features, go and check
improved tire model, time transition, improve damages, punctures...

Weather would be a nice add on for the game, really hope we can get some rain in this game. The team behind the game are still designing new tracks and cars so the game is slowly expanding. Really hope they just keep adding to this game for the next few years, I personally will buy new cars and circuits if they keep making them.  Great game, and great fun.

The developers did a tremendous job in keeping the game up-to-date and releasing new content that I didn't know of. 

The game is amazing, the physics and graphics are great and the sound is the best of the market. However, it's not FREE... If you wanna know what the game can offer, download the  game and buy yourself one of the packages from inside the game (packages sold on steam are expensive and definitively not worthy).  you don't have to buy the whole series to race at it - just buy the car you want - you'll race against all other cars, even the ones you didn't buy. Buying packages is the best way to get more content for less money. 

I'm in love with RaceRoom. it has something I always asked for: I can create my own championship, with the tracks I selected, with a various amount of rules. No more racing on tracks I don't want to, on series that I don't like, with rules that I disagree. RaceRoom freed me from those problems.

Mind you, do not buy any DLC from steam without a discount. The full game content can be had for cheaper using vRP and for the price of a AAA game, you can get all the content in game right now. All of it. For much less than that you can get the starter pack which will allow you to get your feet wet in a bunch of amazing series (including DTM which is my favourite sim racing series right now) and you support the devs. Sure, this game is not F2P to get the full content but the constant delivery by the devs makes the investment worth it. 

The Good:
Variety of series - This title offers some unique racing series not found elsewhere which are amazing!

FFB - Once set up properly, it is really good in my CSW v2.5 Mind you, you will need to tweak it a bit but there are plenty of sources online for inspiration.

Sounds - Best in the industry imho. Like seriously good.

Adaptative AI - Ensures you always have a challenge and you will have great racing in single player.

Custom Championships - You can create your own custom championships where you can select series, tracks and rules which coupled with the adaptative AI makes for some of the best Single player experience in sim racing!

Consistency between content - All cars and tracks feel really well made and are consistently good in feel if not sometimes in detail.

The not so good:
No time transition making endurance series a bit of a non starter.

Graphics can look pretty dated especially in VR where you can look into every nook and crany.

Requires some setup to get the most out of it -  FFB is good but it needs to be tuned properly to get the most out of it. Some of the default settings make no sense.

Shop is awkward to use. In order to get the most out of it you have to jump a couple of hoops. In game shop is cheaper than steam and getting vRP is the cheaper way to get content.

Inability to win vRP in game - An option to add some vRP per race if you race clean and do well would go a long way to boost this game imho.

Lack of a structured online racing system - SRS (free iracing) has 3 series using R3E but some form of safety and skill rating in multiplayer using the game launcher would not go amiss.


All in all, a very solid title that could use a couple of changes. Day to night transitions and an organized online racing system (more than hotlap challenges I mean) where people could get quality racing on the hour every hour would be excellent. SRS covers a bit of this need but it is not perfect as not everyone knows about it.

Is it worth the asking price for the full content? Yes. Is the game going to continue to improve? Yes.

Personally I prefer to support independent developers so avoid both, a few quid here and there for a car or track isn't a lot, although in my case it adds up to about £180 so far, but again that's my choice, you really don't need to spend that much.

As for the game, it has excellent VR support and once fine tuned it's on a par with Assetto Corsa for clarity, definitely blows away ACC in that regard.

The AI is also one of the best, always tight races, with cars moving around the track looking for overtakes and occasionally making mistakes, unlike a lot of conga line AI in other games. The races always seem to be more exciting and incident filled compared to Assetto Corsa or ACC.

Force Feedback is also very good, although it requires a fair bit of tuning to get the feel you want.

The game is still well supported by Sector 3 with regular updates and new cars and tracks.

There are one or two little issues I have with the game, however.

Firstly, you can't edit custom championships, you setup the cars, AI and select all the tracks, then start the first event to save the championship, but if you want to change the AI strength or change cars, you have to redo everything, including picking all the tracks again, it's a major pain.

There is also no editing of AI driver names, which is the one thing drawing me back to AC, the ability to choose your own names for the AI adds so much to the personality of the racing, but sadly it's not going to happen in Raceroom due to license agreements.

That's it really, everything else about the game is top notch and considering it's free to try, you really should do your a favor and give it a go.

This is not to mention the massive discounts on products in the sim available via bundles and the option to test drive cars both in competitions and in the store to guarantee satisfaction with a purchase before it is made.
If you want the most out of this sim in my opinion, buy track packs first and cars second. Some of the packs which give you a spectrum of vehicles and tracks at a massive discount are also a good start. Just make sure that when you buy cars, buy the historic models such as the 1992 DTM cars, the BMW M1 and the FR90 because they are legitimately some of the best, most polished cars in all of sim racing. I say to buy the tracks first and the cars second because the depth of the car models on offer, especially the historic ones, will keep you interested for hours on end.
This is a good simulation for competition, not only for the experienced, but also as a learning point for the inexperienced. It is also one of the funnest, most complete sim racing experiences on the market right now and it can also be quite cheap if you stick to bundles.

Now, I don't understand why a lot of people would say any game is broken, when the problem, is their hardware. The only reason I could see fit to complain, would be if the devs, make changes to the game's system requirements, that make it so you can no longer play the game, without spending more money, on new hardware (This is made Worse, if the game is an upfront paid for game to begin with)[Demos are excluded].
If the game stops working on my system, I know that as long as I have all the files, downloaded (no missing or corrupted files), that something within my system has changed. NOT THE GAME. LOL Especially, if others are able to still run the game. Really come on now!!! Why would you even fix you thoughts, to blame the game, if you yourself, have it running on another system within your own home? Not to mention that your friends are ""NOT"" having any of your issues. Why are you so unlucky, so the game is just bad for everyone else also!? 

I'm thumbing up for this game. Oh yeah, wait,... Pay to win. Its free now with 11 cars and 4 tracks. It was like that from what I remember. I just recently found this out a few days ago myself. Double thumbing now. Pay to win with a game that's free to Start playing, I've looked around the game and found the Platinum Pack deal,... (while it could be better priced),... Ok and do-able, though I haven't bought it yet [Everything is included in the Pack]. Now your Free to Start Playing / so-called Pay to 2 Win game can be Just a paid for game, with full content.  So, yes! I'm wanting to ""BUY"" the game. I'm just saying all this imo. I think that what makes a p2w game is when getting certain paid content delivers a big advantage over f2p players, and when that certain paid content is unreasonably expensive. 

Someone wrote in their review;  ""free to play racing game with 0 I MEAN ZERO content if you don't buy the DLC. Without the DLC there is nothing you can play. 

Someone else wrote in their review; ""I don't recommend this game since there's almost no one playing it aswell, save your cash.""

I don't understand how the free content, was so thoroughly missed. Also, if we check the leader boards and competitions,... Again, I don't understand how anyone could say;  ""I don't recommend this game since there's almost no one playing it aswell, save your cash.""

Negative review for this!?;  ""This would be a great game... IF IT GAVE YOU A F###ING TUTORIAL ON THE CONTROLS AND HOW TO DRIVE!!!

Man it`s just crazy good...gonna buy me some trucks and some gt3 & dtm cars old and new and maybe some Nurburgring, and Spa :D

Priceing ? DONT buy what you will not use and you will pay less money

basic content is great, hill climb BMW is great :D and not so deadly as I suspected, It can be done !

I`v paid for Bathurst(wich is the best track in the world, no doubt about it) and dtm 92, gunna buy come gt3 cars, nurb legends, maybe 3-4 tracks, in all I think I`l spend no more then 30 euro on everything I want.

In that time, I've progressed from playing Gran Turismo on a PlayStation through to playing all of the latest and greatest sims on a PC. I invested in a good racing seat and peripherals early on. For me, nothing comes close to what RaceRoom offers in terms of force feedback and physics, at least for their GT3 cars, which comprise the largest class in the sim. Unlike iRacing, which is also insanely expensive, RaceRoom lets you feel the curbs, and the sense of tire slip as you push the car to the limit is like no other sim. Then add on sounds that no other sim comes close to achieving and it's truly a joy to use... I have literally giggled with delight at times when pushing something like a 650S around a circuit. Also, the AI is truly fantastic, and I've had the best wheel-to-wheel racing I've ever experienced when playing by myself. Note that the inclusion of real world liveries from actual drivers in current series is a nice touch too, particularly if you're a fan of motorsports and know names like Rast, Gougnon, Balfe, and van der Linde.

That said, there is no career mode, so you're left to create chamionships yourself or engage in single races, and the online play lacks any structure such as rankings like many of the other sims do / are starting to do (this is the one way in which iRacing is undoutedly better).

Get yourself a set of wheel and try how RaceRoom Racing Experience is one of the best racing sims available on the market.

Base game is Free-to-Play with other contents locked behind a paywall, but that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing, since by only purchasing one car + one livery of a discipline you don't have to download additional assets, thus able to fully race said discipline. You don't have to buy all contents available as it's quite priced to some, just the one you desire the most.

About paid contents.. they all are worth the money! Considering most cars were made with advices from actual racing drivers (DTM, WTCC, etc.), it's no wonder they're quite pricey. They supposedly handle like the real thing. They're fun, they take time to master, they're somewhat challenging.

I'm using Logitech Momo Force Feedback so I can't really talk about proper FFB, but it's there. I can feel the wheel struggling when cornering so I think it should be enough for mid to high-end wheels. One of the best available.

Graphic wise it looks good enough for a game based on isiMotor2 engine that had powered SimBin's and other racing sims of the past e.g. GTR2, GT Legends, Race07, rFactor&rFactor2, Automobilista,  and many others I can't think of at the moment.

Moving on to sounds: whoever behind this is an absolute genius and perfectionist! RaceRoom Racing Experience's developer Sector3 Studios was built from the ashes of now-defunct SimBin Studios, so sound quality is their A-game. Engine, transmission whine, turbo spools; you name 'em. They all sound how they're supposed to without any miss.

Do not let Steam negative reviews fool you. It's such a thrilling EXPERIENCE to have! (pun intended)

The game is not free 2 play. It's more like a demo. You can race a few cars and tracks. But if you want to dive in a little deeper and drive GT3 (or as they call it: GTR3) cars, you have to pay. Pricing is okay for what you get. Cars are around ~4€ per car if you only choose one skin you like or like 8€ with all skins (depends on the car and how many skins are available). There are also various packs available at a discount. You can only use skins you bought. It's not possible to upload and use custom skins. But you can race against AI cars that you don't own. 

For a DX9 game RaceRoom looks pretty good and the performance is good, too. In the future they will make the move to the Unreal Engine, but there is no ETA when the change will happen. We will also get day/night cycles and rain with the engine change.

The only complaint I have at the moment is the simulation aspect of the game. Tire temps are odd (never drop below 75°C), tire pressure is not even adjustable. After some time you will notice that RaceRoom never gets into much detail when simulating a car. The simulation aspect feels a little dumbed down compared to other sims like rFactor or Assetto Corsa. Some of the cars feel WAY too stable for 500+PS racecars from hell, while FWD cars just don't feel right and very unstable. Speaking of feeling: The FFB is one of the best of all sims. There is just so much detail, but not in an overwhelming way.

I think that, for me, all features taken into account, R3E is the best all round sim.

Racing is exciting and the adaptive AI is brilliant.

The FFB needs only some simple easy to understand tweaking and testing to be very good and realistic.

The UI takes a little getting used to but is the most useful UI in that you can alter options while practicing without too much exiting the program and starting it again.

The clincher for me is the fps. I have just purchased a 4K monitor to go with my i7, Nvidia 1060, G920 setup and R3E is the only one of my racing sims that is worth running above 1920x1080 with fully maxed video settings. I can run 2560x1600 60Hz 16:10 with 30 cars at around 50fps while racing and 60+fps on replay and it looks gorgeous to me.

What I like about this game:
+ RRRE has really good sounds
+ The graphics look pretty good.
+ The handling is good.
+ Car selection. A nice, diverse amount of cars (I really like the GT cars, Group 5 cars, DTM 1992, IMSA GTO cars, etc).
+ Nice track selection. While it includes tracks found in every other game, I really like how it Includes less common tracks (examples: Hungaroring, Sepang, Salzburgring, Paul Ricard, Moscow, Chang, etc). I (a resident of 'Murica) was previously not familiar with these gems. I purchased some of these tracks in order to keep the tracks selection diverse from the other games I mentioned above.
+ Works with a G29 wheel
+ Good FFB
+ Nice UI (better than those mentioned above)
+ Has music in the menus. Simple pleasures for simple minds.
+ They keep adding more content.
+ Worked right out of the box with an xbox360 controller (didn't have to adjust the settings like I did with other games mentioned above). Not a huge deal now that I finally got a wheel, but it was nice at the time.
+ Being able to test drive the cars before purchasing them is nice.
+ I like the leaderboard challenges are handy for hot lapping.
+ The integration between the raceroom store and steams seems pretty good; makes purchases easy.

A few negatives:
- It can get expensive (especially if you like to hoard cars/tracks). After spending about $54 USD,  I own 22 tracks and 37 cars (including a handful of free ones). That now feels like a good amount of content for the amount of $$ I've spent. The quality of everything I've bought is great. No regrets. Now if I can just avoid the temptation to buy more...

This game keeps better and better. The developer is really making a great effort in making this game better with every patch released. Really cool that there are always new packs. 

No idea why the mixed review this game got. After the last update (march 16'), this game has to be one of the best sim racing games out there. FFB is just epic and the sound is really top notch. Have GTX 980 ti 6GB so the graphics are really good when maxed out and with fps ranging from 150-160 fps there is nothing to complain about. Also with a huge muticlass grid (99 cars i think) and bmw M6 GT3 (coming very soon), R3E is a must buy for any simracers out there. GTO and formula junior were just released and bmw m6 gt3 coming soon what else would one ask for. And yeah any car can be test driven before buying. Is there any other game that offers this?

Here are some videos to help you make up your mind

https://youtu.be/56Jw636XWDk


Update 2:

The game has been getting huge amount of tracks , updates and cars. I have never imagined, it would become even better than before but it sure is. and yeah, the developer announced that there are more stuff coming our way. Mind blowing if you ask me.
I have purchased everything in the game so far and it is totally worth it. Yes there are some stuff missing from the game like weather cycle but who cares when you are pushing yourself to the limit trying to be the best on the leaderboards or racing online. 
If you want to buy everything in the game wait for a sale like i did and grab the premium pack.

Before I talk about the positives of the game, I would like to address some of the negative aspects of the game (remember this is my opinion and yours may differ). 

CONS:
1. The F2P model. The F2P model is more that the game has free base content but you will have to buy the rest of the content unless you are a fast enough racer to consistently win Competitions (more on this later). I have yet to earn vRP (the currency used to purchase content) because I am not fast enough to win Competitions and you earn 0 by actually playing the game whether it is offline or online.

2. The ""simulation"". The realism in this game definitely is there (more on this later) but some bugs/design choices make me feel like it isn't a complete sim. Wearing down the tires takes too long even through prolonged abuse and the damage model being too forgiving, are two of the most notable issues I have with the simulation aspect of this game. 

3. Online. This game allows people from all over the world to participate in online race events and that is great but it does create laggy races. I personally have joined race servers where even though my ping is 90ms, it feels like my ping is signifacntly higher than that because the cars with lower ping don't look as smooth on the track. Nothing is wrong with those cars but my ping makes other cars look weird which sometimes leads to phantom contact (two carboxes collide even though the car models do not touch).

PROS:
1. The ""simulation"". The cars handle realistic pattern and some of that I attribute to the real world racers that give feedback to the developers who then turn that feedback to make the cars handle that much better. 

2. The sound. The audio in this game is the best out of any racing game that I have ever played. The engine audio sounds great with a great capture of low, mid, and high sounds. Tire sounds give you fantastic audio feedback. My favorite sound is when your car drives into the gravel and you can hear what sounds like small pieces of gravel hitting different parts of the car. It makes the Forza series, which has always been applauded for its audio, look a bit behind. 

3. The Competitions. I used to dislike leaderboard hot-lapping but that all changed with this game. Competitions is a game mode where the developers have preset challenges of who can run the fastest time with a certain car and track combo. Some of these ""competitions"" use new cars and tracks (a way to drive new cars and tracks without owning the content) and challenges the community to see who can adapt and be the quickest. Some of the other ""competitions"" are sponsored by actual companies and over a several week competition that also goes to different tracks every week, the winner gets a prize. For example, there is currently a WTCC competition, where the top 30 or so drivers at the end of the competition compete in a final race. The prizes include cash and tickets to WTCC race(s). 

4. The AI. After an update to the AI (a couple of months back from the time of this review), the offline experience got a signifcant increase. The AI are aggressive, use slightly different lines, and have a much larger difficulty adjustment for players of most skill levels being able to enjoy a nice race against computers. It reminds me of rFactor 2 AI which is another racing game with fantastic AI (probably the best but that is for another review).

I didn't like the way the game played or the way it made you purchase cars and tracks seperately. From what I can remember I also found it very difficult to play. Now fast forward to today and I now have a completely new perspective on the game. I don't know if its just because the game has been updated and made better or wether I just got better at driving (mind you I put about 600 hours into Assetto in the mean time so its more than likely I just couldn't drive it well to begin with). Now I actually really like the idea that you are able to purchase only the cars and tracks that you want to race, which means you only pay for what you use. I still think the price is a little too steep, compared to other titles, if you want to purchase all the cars and tracks.

I have only played a small amount of single player but as far as I can tell the AI behave themselves for the most part. Has all the usual singleplayer options like hotlap and being able to create a custom event.

The multiplayer communty is like most others. I have come accross players that just want to cause havoc and ruin it for everyone else and also players that are there to race and be competitive and have fun. For the most part I have come accross people who are keen to race. One big downfall of the multiplayer game is there is no way to kick or vote to kick nuisance players however I think its something that is being worked on.

I would say R3E is a must have for those who are serious about thier racing and also for those who are willing to put in the hours it takes to master.

It's FFB even though not revolutionary is something that you can tweak to suit your preferences and it's fantastic when you do.

Its problem is its annoying ""race2play"" (a play on ""free 2 play"") UI and it also only has a very few free cars and even fewer free tracks. I bought its GT Masters and DTM 2014 experiences and, man, those are fantastic. They should make separate games for those (but give it free to us who bought them here in RRE). Or at least let us configure the game to select a default ""experience"" during startup.

AI in this game seems good. They don't display the ""blind AI"" or ""AI without the I for intelligence"" of other racing games and simulations.

Currently this game is still missing some polish on the HUD elements. Like the sector split times really huge and distracting when we only need to know if we're going faster or slower for the current lap. The position bar's fonts look horrible. Those things are really well done on their older games (Race series) so I hope they could really improve this area of the game. Currently those look ugly in comparison to the rest of the game that I turn them off at the expense of feedback since the game does not have a race engineer to tell you what's going on.

Update: It's been years that this game has been in ""beta"" and it feels like the developers are using it as an excuse for the game's shortcomings. The major thing I dislike about this game is its absolutely terrible long loading times. Even if I mostly just use it for single player racing it seems to be getting data from its servers and that takes long. Sometimes the load times are OK, most of the time it's like the game has crashed and you'll be left staring at a load screen.

Once it has loaded it's got great AI though. This is still my favorite racing sim.",1436698253,1496953309,True,2,0,0.503019392490386963,0,True,False,False

Compared to rFactor 2: RaceRoom blows it away with graphics, but I think the physics in rFactor is a small knotch more realistic.

Compared to Automobilista:  more modern feeling, can't exactly explain why, but RaceRoom just feels more nuanced.

Compared to Project Cars:  Project Cars graphics are better, but the physics are a bit ""simcade"" for my taste.

Compared to Assetto Corsa:  These two games are tied for my favorite sim racers.  I would consider them very similar sims.

Compared to iRacing: don't know, I'm not a fan of the subscription pricing model because the cost is astronomical in the long run.  How much would I have paid for my Atari games by now if they were subscription pricing?  I'm not a big fan of DLC or DRM at all, for that matter, but the subscription pricing is the worst, in my opinion.

Compared to everything: the audio for this game is the gold standard.  If you are a hardcore sim racer, and own all the others, get this for the audio experience, if nothing else.

I love this game and my system with only a 750ti can max out most graphics , so those with bigger cards have 4k,VR and silly amounts of A.I at thier disposal. 
The free to play base game comes with enough tracks and cats to hook you into making some dlc purchases and factoring in costs of buying a game and/or content/season pass, Purchasing starter pack or even the pro pack gives good value.
There are some bugs and some key elements missing, but there is a very good community and a good dev support via the Raceroom forum.
Single player is great fun with the improving A.I, and some close races can be both fun and rewarding. Car physics and force feedback, especially the dtm/gt3, is some of the best I have experienced, AMS may just nudge ahead but but then loses out on the visual and immersion. Sounds too are amazing and really pull you in with surround sound and cockpit view.
I've only played a few multiplayer races and can't really say much about that, usual w reckers on free content servers,not all, but there are some good community leagues and the game itself a host competitions, some of which have prizes to be won.

- has single player & training modes (altough not offline)

Yet, the developers have put in a lot of work to fix bugs and improve so many critical aspects. Today, I can say I am impressed with the result. The laserscanned Nordschleife is in my opinion the best version available, the force feedback has undergone massive improvements and beats every sim I have tried so far, including rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa. While other racing games like Project Cars have prettier graphics, I personally really like the look and feel of Raceroom and it is absolutely sufficient for a simulation. Where it shines, is the sound. It is immersive and powerful. After years of updates, the physics are great as well. I can honestly say, the game has reached a point where the available content has the high quality, SimBin (now Sector 3 Studios) is known for.

Of course, as always there are a few negative things as well. At the time of this review, there is no implementation of weather conditions. If you get off the track, the effects of losing grip due to dirt on the tires aren't really perceivable, compared to Assetto Corsa for example. While there already is a lot you can change in the car setup, a few things other sims do offer aren't available yet. For example, different types of tires or tire pressure. You can select the time of day for the race, but as far as I know, it will be static. Would be cool to have a real daytime simulation and dynamic weather.

One big contra is the pricing and payment model. I perceive it as intransparent and unconfortable, as they use a virtual currency and the payment system has multiple steps, as it includes their webshop, Steam and its payment methods like PayPal. Not all the bundles they offer on their website are available directly through Steam. Prices are somewhat hefty, but still well below iRacing.

All in all, it is a racing sim with great quality tracks, cars, physics and force feedback. The multiplayer features are solid as well. It deserves more attention, and I recommend trying it, even if you've invested into other sims. The Nordschleife DLC alone is well worth the price and the best starting point.

The constant micro-transactions start to get annoying.  Even with sales on content packs and moderate discounts for purchasing vRP (virtual money) to buy content, the game ends up costing you quite a bit more than what you get at the stage of development it is in.  People can deny or challenge all they want but this thing has been in a perpetual state of Beta for 4 years.  It's actually unfortunate Steam 'GreenLights' products in this state.  They really should be 'buyer beware'.

All the content including topping up everytime something new is released whether it's a car, pack or tracks can end up costing in the neighborhood of $200.00.  Many will argue that but I have the receipts to prove it and unless you figure out the system or have someone explain, many players have inevitably made errors as to how they purchased and paid more than they could have.

The drivng itself feels quite good.  Since it is a closed system, there is no easy way to inspect what is being done to see how accurate the physics, vehicle dynamic modeling or tire modeling is done.  While there are moments it feels slightly weird, certain cars lifeless or canned, it certainly is not as obvious or bad as some other well known racing games.

Visually, for a DX9 based engine, they have produced a great result.  It is missing any kind of rubber build up or active track at least visually.  There is some debris modeling if going off road but no visuals.

There is no proper flag system.  There is no daytime, nightime transitions or full 24 hour system.  Damage modeling is non-existent which lends to very pushy, bumping and careless driving in multiplayer sessions. There is some mild engine and gearbox damage with specific vehicles.

Pits and setups are limited.  No tire pressure adjustment at the moment and limited chassis setup.  The ability to 'Save' a setup only recently became available and oddly was news as though this was a breakthrough of epic proportions.
http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/setup-saving-coming-to-r3e.118058

The game models chassis flex.

The options allow for tweaking the visuals, controllers, sound and force feedback to the Nth degree.  There are some interesting concepts to the steering and force feedback settings to simulate the rack and pinion steering as well as the feel of the contact of the tire to the road.  How much of that truly can be felt in the game or whether it's placebo is difficult to tell though it does feel generally good in most cars.

The sounds are really well done.  Every other game could learn from this.

Multiplayer is okay when it works but often there are visual glitches with cars overlapping or stationary images (ghost images) just kind of being left behind around the track.  It needs work.

It requires an internet connetion and there is no offline mode which is fine except the authentication servers or whatever they are frequently blow up and and one cannot play.

The dedicated forums away from the Steam discussions have unfortunately become progressively toxic only rivaled by iracing.  I find it to be a deterrent since it is somewhat the 'go to' for info but weeding through the frequent snarky responses to everything and the jerks gets old really quick.

Compared to turn key options such as AMS though dated in some ways, at least can be dropped into a league and work and rF2 which is also league capable, this still has a long way to go.  If one tries it solely on the free content, I suppose it's okay but it will get repetitive very quickly.  Even with all the content, hot lapping against AI gets old and other than the built in public Multiplayer Lobby which leaves much to be desired and you won't find much that's worth the time.

As much as I enjoy driving the game and I'll say it again, it has potential, in the current state along with past issues as Simbin, restructuring and the advent of Sector3 and another restructuring along with the rebirth of Simbin, I cannot recommend it.  They have missed the mark, there seems to be no direction to what should be the logical and that is a massive multiplayer environment and the reality of it being at 'Beta' levels after 4 years with no end in sight is enough to at least be cautious with this before diving in head first and spending a lot of money.",1481364660,1481490633,False,26,2,0.693791329860687256,0,True,False,False

- SOUND!!! Best in a racing game ever
- the feeling of driving a car... unbelievable. Tons of fun. You have to feel it for yourself. I wish EVERY racing game had so realistic and pleasant physics and driving model as this game!
- supports keyboard, mouse, gamepad, wheel... very satisfying gameplay on any of those.
- Force Feedback. I mostly hate force-feedback in games and always turn it off (at least on a gamepad), because it's bloody annoying. Here... here it's a pure masterpiece.
- camera controls
- replays, saving replays, playing replays (really not common thing these days)
- you can test any car and track for free unlimited amount of times
- well - it's free (but for a price)
- highly configurable in every aspect
- runs blazingly fast even on low-end hardware
- real-world drivers play it for fun too (they are uniquely indicated)

- no story mode/campaign/objectives/modes etc. - something which would certainly make it more interesting

You can't possibly have everything you wish; a game where all content is included and games where you have to pay to get things. This game is really the most realistic driving simulator out there and I don't think anything will beat it. The choices of real cars and classes and also a wide variety of tracks, not just the same old boring tracks you find in Forza for example... The details and physics are great and the car sounds are phenominal ! Really awsome. Its really a different racing game and unique. Yes with the new update there are problems and sometimes the loading screen may freeze occasionally, but they will fix it for sure. Some people complain about the lack of multiplayer but to be honest I've never played multi in this game, theres no point. The only downside of this is that this game requires internet to play, you dont have an ""offline"" mode... Yes you need money to purchase cars and tracks, but let's face it, what game now a days don't require money ? None really, just very few of them.

Had this on steam years ago but didn't actually play much and never bought any content that seems at the time rather highly priced.
Sometime or another an update wrecked my FFB and I uninstalled and forgot about it.

Now about 2 years later I try it again.  
It really is very nice and very immersive.
Buying 1 pack from stream and then later much cheaper now when I buy ingame store. I guess a big part of that is content I now already own from buying that first pack, so in the end prices are really not too bad.

I am enjoying driving at Nordschleife with this sim much more than I ever did with either AC or Pcars.
The combination of great sound, graphics, forcefeedback and overall feel really puts you in the driving mood.

This game is more like a racesim constructor. u will get all u need to drive a few rounds for free. but if u want more u have to pay. its totaly legit and fair since u just pay what u want.

sure the prices are a bit high but its okay for me. i spended 26€ so far. now i got 7 additional car with 3-7 paintjobs per car. a lot of new tracks and two different race classes.

if u dont want to pay. u will get a few cars (should be 5) from different classements and u can drive a 3 courses. this courses have variants so its not getting bored so soon.

my thoughts about this game? its realy awesome. the forcefeedback feels realy good. the racetracks looking realy good (okay the race audience could be look better). the cars performing realy good.

There is just something about night racing. Granted the casual player would not even bother with these features, this is for the more dedicated hard core player. Seems when it comes to racing games there is a trade off that needs to be made between fun and seriousness, in my opinion this is a pure racing simulator and it doesn't try to be anything else. All cars are race spec, there are no road cars, no parts to buy for the car, no livery editor, etc. You get real life counter parts from real series mimicked ala iRacing.

The sound is fantastic, the feel of the cars is much improved over the early beta days, the visiual presentation is fantastic albeit a bit dated (DirectX 9). Overall it gives a fantastic race experience that with hopeful VR support be extremely immersive. The studio has a lot of talent and great foundation to make a next generation simulator in the future. Hopefully they realize their vision in the next iteration, I can only hope that the backend gets replaced while the game stays the same title, no need for a RRRE2, just keep it RRRE and keep improving what is already there.

I highly recommend it, if you do try this out, hop in the sillhoutte series cars at the raceroom raceway track (both awesome car and track!) and be sure to use a while, you loose a lot of immersion and feel of the game using a game pad or keyboard, its not gonna give you a poor experience. A G25 works perfect here.

I have bought nearly all the content for the game and I am not even upset, you can get vRP from the raceroom store, which is cheaper than buying the cars and tracks within the game, first get the vRP reedem it in the game then buy the packs it will save you a lot of money. I recommend buying the packs that have cars and tracks in them, then the track packs then car packs as you wish. It will maximize the content and getting the 10K vRP for 60$ yields you nearly 90% of the content.

Most of the cars feels ""easy"" to drive at high speeds, and i mean it like they seem to be smooth just like the real ones, Ive seen too many racing games where you reach the top speed and the car starts to wobble like its made of jelly! Seriously!? these cars are built to be stable aS fuck at top speeds! and in overall the handling feels solid and you can adjust these cars endlessly. One of the few CON´s i can think is that it still sometimes feels kinda un-polished (dont mean the cars alone) and there could be more players in multiplayer... and speaking of multiplayer, most of the drivers there seems to drive clean. Sure there are some rammers but they are the ones who generally get bored of the game very early.

It also has the finest track ever made! 

You can complain about the pricing of the cars but atleast you can just buy one car from each group (and test it before buying)

So overall i think this is the best racing game at the moment. AND the sound effects leave any other car game light years behind!

I own automobilista, iracing, assetto corsa, project cars, rfactor 2, stock car extreme and race07. Each has their good points and bad points but fort me the best 2 are automobilista and raceroom. Why? because they have plenty of options, championship mode, multiplayer, leaderboard challenges and lots of cars and circuits. I also feel that these 2 are most realistic to driving a real car , sometimes in the other games theres always a lot of oversteer and sliding around. However for me automobilista and raceroom are the best at time of writing this review! it's realisitic, has championship modes, multiplayer modes, loads of circuits loads of cars!

I've got 200 hours on Assetto Corsa. That was the sim that first got me hooked on the scene. Since then I've tried every sim out there. Nowadays I find myself only enjoying R3E. Why? Because of the quality of everything. I think it's probably the FFB that I'm most impressed with. It's the most predictable and sensitive I've seen yet. I instantly see and understand why I mess up my laps. I know that if I were more attentive to the wheel I could've driven better.

And so, when I return to other sims after driving around R3E I feel frustrated. The FFB feels so inaccurate I almost feel like deleting every other sim but R3E from Steam. Probably the only other one that comes close is Automobilista. But it's weird that even in that game what feels like a punishment appears as a learning opportunity in R3E, as it should in real life.

I think I'm beginning to sound a little crazy, but I actually feel guilty for not playing R3E more. I feel like this game deserves thousands of hours of enjoyment, which I'm unable to provide since my life situation. Other people complain about Sector3 milking cash. I, on the other hand, think that I'm not appreciating the work they have put in this game enough. I feel like the money I've given them isn't enough to show my appreciation for this game.

On a whim, I decided to fire it up again last week, and I've been blown away by just how much it's changed for the better. If you are a fan of motorsport or racing games, I highly recommend this game. The pricing model is a little cumbersome at first, but if you buy a pack such as DTM 2015, you'll find yourself with a fair amount of content for a reasonable price, and you can add more packs gradually if you feel like something different. The inclusion of licensed motorsport series is a plus, and the track list features some interesting European tracks that I haven't seen in many other racing games. The car handling and sounds are outstanding, and the graphics are quite decent too. The actual racing is some of the best I've personally experienced, depending on the AI settings, races can be quite close and the game does a good job of replicating the aggressive doorhandle to doorhandle nature of touring car racing. Perhaps the neatest thing about the game is that you can try it out before commmiting to buy anything, so don't take my word for it, try it out!

Though this sim is listed as a Free 2 Play title and comes with several cars and a few track for nothing - you will need to spend a little cash in order to get the cars and tracks you want. The pricing on these addons is quite minimal and you only need to buy what you actually want and when you want it. Oh and you can test drive every car as many times as you like before deciding if you want to buy it.

Here's the rundown:

Graphics 8/10 - they are by no means bad - in fact the sim looks very natural and life like

Sound 10/10 - You can't get any more real than this without getting in the actual cars. Every detail from transmission whine and chassis squeaks to wind, transmission flex, gravel and reverb etc.. have been taken into account. The sound alone give this sim more immersion than the competition. 

Physics 9/10 This score was a few points lower a couple months back, but with recent and ongoing enhancements to several group cars and more being fixed currently, R3e is more than deserving of this rating. If they get all the cars to the level they are achieving with the ones they already edited - I see a glorious 10 out of 10 coming in the near future.

FFB 10/10 - for me it was GSCE that held the title for FFB with AC and RF2 following slighly behind, but R3e has taken that title by leaps and bounds. I know this sounds exagerated, but you have to feel it to believe it - and I've never felt this good behind the wheel in my 15+ years of racecraft.

Car Content Variety 8/10 There are tons of cars available - though the list is still a bit on the short side. This is not to say that I don't have enough cars. The fact is I own more than I've had time to drive, but still wish there were a few Group C cars in the mix as those are my absolute favorites. Did I mention that you can test drive every car without buying.

Car Quality 10/10 - This title is on par with AC when it comes to detail. The exterior/interior along with suspension and tires are all done with upmost attention to even the small details.

Track Content Variety 8/10 Again the amount of tracks are quite limited compared to other titles, but not lacking. Several of my favorite tracks are included (Bathurst, Spa, Nurburgring, RedBull Ring, Suzuka, Nords, etc..) They have also included a lazer scanned Nordschleife into the mix with more lazer scanned tracks to come.

Track Quality 10/10 Right up there with AC and iRacing when it comes to track surface and detail. The sky boxes are absolutely believable and the environmental details are more than real enough to enjoy. 

Multiplayer 8/10 Much better racing experience than most sims I've played, but it still has it's issues. The netcode has been updated recently and seems to be working great, but I have not had enough time with it to give it a better score.

Singleplayer 10/10 The AI have been improved greatly and  their difficulty can be set to adaptive which takes some patience for them to settle in, but when they do they are a joy to race with. Also the ""Experiences"" make this title a dream when it comes to playing championships.

Community 10/10 This is probably the least toxic sim community out there. Most everyone is friendly and helpful. The devs are also very active within the forums and listen to the players.

I'm not sure what all I left out, but I'll be sure to update this in the future. 
Also: I know this review appears to be written by a fanboy due to the high scores given. I assure you this is not the case. I play many Sims more than I have this. Infact there was a long time which I felt this title was a waste of drive space, but as stated above - it has come a long way.

My Name Is Luke and i am not the best at typeing up reviews so please dont hate on me i will start with good things about this sim and bad things id just like to say thank you to all the clean racing fellows, 

So first of in the base game you get 5 FREE CARS in wich some are Aquila CR1 Sports GT, 134 Judd V8, Saleen S7R, DMD P20, and a Canhard R52 There is many diffrent skins that are free that you can use in game, You can Buy additional Cars Trought there online store or trought steam i buy from the store its cheap has sales like crazy anyway back to this review you Get 3 Race Tracks 
Lake View HillClimb has 2 Layouts 
Portimao Circuit Has 4 Layouts
RaceRoom Raceway has 5 Layouts
Those Tracks are fun to race on and you can buy more tracks such as Spa-Francorchamps and many more, There is also Weekly compettion where you can try out cars and maps and set a good time you can also win VR Points which you can spend on cars or tracks which is really cool Ah Damm i forgot to mention that after this new update there is more FREE cars such as Cougar C14-2, Mistral M531, and some other cars but its fun,

I brought DTM 2013 and i got 3 Cars and Many Tracks i recommend you buy The Whole Pagacke rather than one car since you will safe so much money

I Race with an Xbox360 Pad since my steering wheel got fked but It is really fun even tho im racing with an Xbox360 pad i still can get a good time The Game is For Casual players and hardcore simmers

(Expand the page for the more positive stuff)

At first i posted a negative review because  of its STUPID FREE TO PLAY mecanic and how they charge crasy amounts of money to play more than the bad cars (that i have not tuched since i bought DTM Experience) on Raceroom Raceway and Portimao to be able to really enjoy the game. just take a track for example, a less known and popular track costs 3€ and a legendary track like SPA and Monza costs 5€. And the cars, just to buy 1 car (with all paintjobs for it) it costs 3€. To not pay as much i recomend buying one of the EXPERIENCE packs like DTM and ADAC to get some good cars and tracks.

Apart from that stupid pay system the game is good. they update the game regulary and are adding new things now and then. The physics are good but not perfict. The sound is great. The visuals are amazing. The adaptive AI should mark a milestone in racing sims and are the greatest feature.

It is a tad expensive to get all the content compared to other racing titles but if you wait for one of their big sales it's possible to get it all for around 120 dollars (and it's probably worth it for how great the driving is). It still beats the incredible expense of buying content and yearly memberships for iracing though. Crazy amount of money to play that game.

Just want to add that the best way to get content for the game (as others have said) is to buy VRP packages directly from the Raceroom store site (not the game site) then use the VRP when the game has one of their huge sales on. The way I bought content was to buy a couple of the packs when Steam had a really good  sale on first. I then bought a VRP pack and used it on the Raceroom site when they had a 90% sale (they have these great sales a few times a year from what I've seen). Because I owned two of the larger packs already, I also got additional discounts. I managed to get all the packs on the site (except a couple of the single car packs), around 75% of the cars and all the tracks except 5 for around 85 dollars Canadian total. Keep in mind that Raceroom uses US dollars and my dollar was only worth about 72 cents and you see how cheap Raceroom can be if you live in the US.

The phyics in this game and how they are constantly improving on them is what some other titles should also try to do. The AI is the best in any game I own ATM and that includes Assetto Corsa and Project Cars. There is a large amount of content to purchase-which is not the best way to go about it, but, if you wait for the sales that Steam runs and Sector3 runs-it's not too bad for the authentic recreations of the tracks and cars. They have been improving on this title for some time now and there just a few more ""wish-list"" things that I would like to see in the title. Night racing, and weather are not included as of yet, and to be honest the weather doesn't really bother me too much. Would like to see night racing and it is supposed to be in-coming soon. There are a few tracks that are not available that I would like to see, and maybe in time they will make their way in. Most of the tracks included are well known and very well recreated. There are several different types of racing from WTCC to DTM and GT3 ADAC series as well as GT2 cars and classic cars from those disciplines as well. All in all the game is very solid except for the dreaded 503 error that has popped up more than I would like, and I do not play online, so, can't really give an opinion on that aspect of the game.

Back when the game launched it belonged to a different company and was a pile of garbage, as a result the reviews were mostly negative. Since then a lot has happened, and the most important thing is Sector 3. They took over RaceRoom and since then have been updating it on a monthly basis. New content, new features and fixes - basically all you'd ever want from a racing game is slowly coming to RaceRoom.

RaceRoom used to be very DTM / GT3 focused but nowadays there are a lot of different vehicle classes available. Prototypes, touring cars, open wheel, GT3 and even some older ones. The game has pitstops, a good selection of tracks and very competitive AI. The driving feels great and the force feedback is fantastic. Graphics are solid but more importantly it runs with high framerate.

There are still some things missing I'd like to see. So this is my wishlist:

- Weather
- Day / night cycle for endurance races
- Pit strategies
- A racing line that rubbers in over the race
- Better damage model

- Menus are clunky but semingly much better than previous iterations
- Load and reload takes time, feels like single races are very isolated, no post race breakdown apart from basic. (No fastest lap etc.)

As a customer i would say NO : i'm seriously disappointed about many obvious lacks in the simulation, keeping in mind the money you need to spend to own decent car and tracks choices to practice and challenge. 

But i could say same thing about our IRL cars: webcams, USB, SDcard etc are cheap and already old stuff from around 2000... so why aren't they supplied by default on every car in the market by then ?

edit
updated 10/15/2015 after ~7 additional months...
This game is still in beta after 30 months from release date of February 2013!!


I am currently run the ADC pack, DTM 2014 pack and WTCC 2014 pack in RaceRoom beta.

Many improvements have been made in the past few months.  However, I still cannot give it a ""thumbs up"" recommendation at this time.

On the positive side the FWD cars in the WTCC 2014 pack are simply lovely to drive.  Good handling and excellent FFB make for a plenty of enjoyment taking these cars around any track.  The awful GUI is gone!  


Items that need to be addressed by Sector3
Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI is decent and quite clean by having good player detection coding.  
AI aggressiveness needs to be added to game.  
AI are ""on the rails"" when it comes to collisions - your car is not on the rails so if there is a collision between you and AI then you will likely spin out and the AI will continue running.
AI needs more options and settings to make them more realistic and less automated.

Business model - Having items and picks split between S3 store and STEAM is simply awful.  S3 needs to have all of the items available for sale grouped together.  S3 needs to dump the VRP and only list currency.

S3 servers - Having two sets of authentication (steam and S3 servers) is redundant and causes more issues for end user.  S3, dump your servers so players can still play RRRE if your servers are down, steam is down, or if players internet is down.

There appears to be no option to calibrate wheels and pedals in game.  My gear was recognized and works well.  However, I want to calibrate my pedals (set a small deadzone at start and set the travel of when I hit 100% of throttle or brake) and the game will not allow the user to do it.  S3 needs to add in a calibration function like the one used in iracing or rf2.


Overall, it appears to me as if S3 has been working on building out the available cars and tracks and only recently are starting to focus on adding in features and updating features already in the game.

Ouch!  As of today the game only has a 53% approval rating!

After now playing most of the other games / sim AC ,RF2  & the older Simbin game's I have had time to see some major forwards step since Simbin changed to  Sector 3 racing .

Al this years updates have changed this game & set new levals across the board.
Better sounds , yes Better than what already the best sound engine out there .

The FFB is also 2nd to none even with older wheel like the G27 it shines .

The whole package as been improved , now including online that is still only alpha or early Beta that knocks most other racing game into touch.

Yes still the big moaning isssue for most is the odd why they sell DLC . but once you understand that buying two packs that contain lots of the same items track wise , is not doubling up on the payments , that in fact Sector 3 will credit you for doubled up content so there should me no risks of paying for the same tracks twice over.

The money you save can be then used to buy extra cars or packs should you choose to.
Yes there is quite a bit of lame content add's in the cut screens & loading screens for DLC.

That is bit off putting so is the fact that only fraction of their content is been sold via steam , so the content you buy via staem is only covered by your Steam account & not directly through Sector 3 . I have no idea what the on- going deal with  Sector § & Steam is but its is a little messy .

I like buying my items via the Steam Card service I find this a lot safer than having to have my credit card details stuck on a Steam server waiting the next big hacking accounts scandle.

So I hope Sector 3 decide to push more stuff onto steam as that is the only way I will be buying more content from them in the long term.

The overal cost could be high should you want every car & track , But most have a pick & mix approch & stick with their favorite cars .

You only need one car from ever race series along with the tracks & bingo you can race in any event held online.

If you are realy good & can race realy fast then you should try the challanges that offer a wide range of prizes both in game credits or even hardware.

So I see this now as better value than the year in year out serial fest of the likes of F1 games.

Or the over hyped & money making Project Cars the former out part of Simbin now SMS.

For the most part you can not fault the game engine ,
The sounds are the best
The cars drive & handle well.
AI has improve by a large margin form this time last year.
The menus could still do with some work.
FFB is some of the best out there with lot tweaking to be had in the setting screen.
Online is very advanced for what is still Alpha standards.

Every update this year as improved the game.

Its not perfect they still need to make batter sales platform, but you get a lot for what you pay for it & you only need to add the content you want to & you can still race online.",1428094232,1442075515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.

Now for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down. 

Handling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.

Now for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,

The bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.

All in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here.

1. you better have a wheel or a Xbox remote, as the mouse and keyboard configurations are frustrating and useless, which brings us to point 2...

2. You don’t have ABS/assisted steering options, so even of you did have an Xbox remote you would still be spinning out all over the place, the system in the game that prevents you from spinning the tires makes the engine sputter and surge and it sounds GOD AWFUL! Ruins the experience!

3. 99 percent of the games content needs to be purchased, which is fine. For one the game is perfectly playable with the content they give you and two you wont want to buy any of the content anyway... because the game would be uninstalling by then.

Good points
Most of the cars are beautifully modelled, looking and (importantly) sounding great.
Handling is mostly top-notch 
Tracks are well modelled (tho Bathurst lacks the bumps it has in reality and Brands is Indy only)

Bad Points
The AI isn't the best - it's not keen to overtake, seems to have MUCH better brakes/grip and hitting/being hit by an AI car tends to result in it carrying-on and you being thrown into the scenery.
The pricing model means the odds are your mates won't have the cars/tracks you do which limits online fun a bit

I don't really mind the 'free game - pay for cars and tracks' model overall - it encourages them to keep developing the game by keeping the money coming in.

Tips:
Cars are cheaper on their own rather that in packs UNLESS you want all the LIVERIES (which make-up most of the cost)
Just because you don't own a car/livery doesn't mean the AI/other players can't use it in races (you won't be racing all-the-same cars even if you only own 1 car/livery in a class)
Adaptive AI doesn't really work (for me at least) - just dial-in your level and you'll have more fun

The interface now makes sense, and is one of the best you'll find out there. The game is F2P with purchases for content (but the ability to enter certain events without purchasing the content and the option to try before you buy). There are frequent sales so you don't have to spend a fortune.

Cars are very impressive with the physics being better than iRacing, Project Cars and Assetto Corsa but not quite as good as RFactor 2. Tracks, while not laser scanned, are not too far off the quality of RF2's non-laser-scanned tracks. The geometry is generally accurate, but of course you don't get the exact bumps, but laser scans quickly become out of date so this isn't as big an issue as one might expect. Sounds are the best you'll find anywhere, really expressing the clunky rattling shaking madness of a real race car.

Netcode needs a bit of work [cars behave strangely with high pings and disconnects happen], but multiplayer is in alpha I believe, so hopefully that'll improve in time. The usual issues of only 30% finishing and loads of wrecks apply in public servers but plenty of leagues exist to cater to the more serious racer.

This game has the best sounding cars I have ever heard in a video game. Period. Nothing else even comes close.
It also has outstanding forcefeedback, a big community, and accurate simulation. The AI is pretty good, it's very agressive though. It seems to be a bit dynamic.

I can't get enough of it. There's also a lot of real racing drivers that play this game which is pretty cool. It was, and wasn't, surprising to see Mike Rockenfeller at the top of the leaderboards for a few tracks.

Quite nice and smooth graphics (little bit old but for mid-to-high spec PCs it's fair enough to race online maxed out without major stuttering, try it, it's free :P), interesting choices of licenses (WTCC and DTM are some of my favourites). Decent FFB though i have to admit I didn't take the time to set it up as maniacally as I did in Assetto Corsa or other titles (and I have no RL track racing experience, judging it only on the amount of info to help you get the most out of the car). Good sounds and effects even if sometimes quite ""artificial"".

I'm not a big fan of the payment model (Want everything? You have to pay TOO much. And I don't like overlapping content that you have to buy more than once if you want it available for single/multy, even if at a very high discount rate if already owned in a form or another). Prices for individual pieces of content are reasonable though, if you consider it's a sim. Can pay for a track/car pack and race in a series or just cherry pick what is of your interest and run it (with a good saving early on, but less content in the long run).

Big problem: very few people playing it online (monitored different times during the free weekend and had an average of 200-250 players online at the same time scattered on different servers/series/tracks, only a handful of fields worth a try, less if you own only partial content or like only some series).

To conclude, as a general rule of thumb, take care when you choose to buy experiences (complete series packs) if you want to race online. Almost desert servers in 2 out of 3 that I own and tried. They're good only for discounts on multiplayer content of same class/series if you're into buying much stuff of that pack (mainly tracks if you stick to a single car of that category). They're still nice and fun for single player against AI if you like complete series/championships with accurate liveries and so on (did I mention the discount on multiplayer part?) but didn't investigate this possibility too much. If some of you has any further insight on this I will update the review.

I also have the ""other two"" contemporary racing games, AC and pC and I must say that I find R3E most fun of these three. For example, I think BMW M1 Procar is even more fun to drive in R3E than it is in pC which I find a blast in pC also. R3E is not perfect, at least yet, but it surely has its strengths. Sounds are just awesome and with the recent 9GB ""patch"" they got even better. FFB is also best of the three games and it deliveres the road feel really well and doesn't even require hours of tinkering with settings to get it right. AI is also the most competent of the three by a big margin, so R3E is perhaps the best choice for the single players at least until AC and pC improve their AI algorithms. Graphics are also quite good, although not on par with pCars, but on the other hand, R3E runs also very well on my three monitor setup.

But hey, physics are the most important thing, no? Here R3E fares also well. Physics aren't perhaps the most accurate on the planet, but still very believable and with awesome FFB I like the driving feel a lot. I say it again, I think R3E delivers the most fun experience of the three. Still, R3E is by no means arcade racer and leans heavily towards simming side of the genre.

As said and at the time of writing, R3E is still in beta and a work in progress. It is still quite polished and offers pretty much full experience already. It has no weather or full night, but it is otherwise pretty much a full deal IMO. Things I dislike the most are annoying load times, which surely improved with the latest patch, but are still on the annoying side especially on the menus. Micropayment system is completely a matter of opionion and it really doesn't bother me. You can have just one experience set and that gives you several tracks and a class of cars and that's basically all you need. If you wan't more, different packs give good value for money and you get discounts for the packs of the items you already may own.

I sincerely hope SInBin/Sector3 change this game to a flat pricing fee if they truely want to entice more players to the game. The game content is always on sale at least 50% on their website (cheaper than steam prices) so I wouldn't worry about missing out on sales. I've never seen any of the packs at full price. For example the regular price for the DTM 2014 pack is 8318 vRP or about $85 US without a discount on their site! Who would pay that much!? The permanent discount price is there to get you to buy stuff and is a classic marketing trick!

If you're looking to get into Raceroom Experience with minimal cost I recommend the DTM 2013 pack and the American track pack. It only costs about $20 USD and gets you a great race series along with 13 tracks...

Circuit Park Zandvoort
Red Bull Ring Spielberg
EuroSpeedway Lausitz
Moscow Raceway
Hockenheimring
Nürburgring
Norisring
Motorsport Arena Oschersleben
Brands Hatch
Mazda Laguna Seca
Mid Ohio
Indianapolis
Sonoma Raceway

After that things ramp up in price very quickly! It'll cost you $102 USD for all tracks, three different race series and a big variety of vehicles (but not all of them). Detailed below. Keep in mind this still isn't all of the content available, probably around 75% of it!

WTCC 2013

If you want every vehicle in the game expect to pay well over $150 USD for all content. 

My advice is to just buy the $20 package I listed above and be happy with that. It's the 'best deal/bang for the buck' and still gets you a lot of racing action and tracks for that price.

Raceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called ""Experiences"". These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.

I haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing ""experience"" to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.

There are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.

Now the bad news...

Many people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.

Think of it this way, the ""free to play"" game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are ""Experiences"" - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an ""Experience"".

Here's where the problems begin...

The three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.

To confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.

I created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445609150
Whoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!

Fortunately, there is some good news...

While experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!

So, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.

Even more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%

To give you an idea of cost, I spent less than £30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around £70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.

CONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the ""demo"" first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!",1432407910,1433319512,True,457,26,0.888995528221130371,25,True,False,False

Since Sector 3 Studios was born, RaceRoom has received new force feedback, which is acclaimed to be amongst the best. New content has received new physics for cars and new more detailed track surfaces. Also, they are going through all of the old content and updating the cars to the new physics model. Most tracks have now been updated aswell, however they may have finished by the time you read this.

Combine these 3 things with genre leading sounds and you have one of the best experiences available in sim racing today.

Multiplayer has a unique style of netcode where your ping to each other racer seems to be p2p rather than via the server you are racing on, which is great. Racing standards in most lobbies I have been in is of a good standard.

Along side the DLC listed in steam, RaceRoom also has a store in game.

The price for cars and tracks beyond the given free ones are very reasonable compared to other sims that charge on a per car/track basis, this also enables the devs to keep adding new content consistently. Content is now available in packs for a discount as well. The neat thing is the way you get a scaling discount based upon how much of said pack you already own. Because I had already bought the DTM packs (DTM 2013 I picked up for a nice $7.50 on sale through steam dlc) and ADAC 2013 pack, when I went to buy the European track pack the remaining 3 or 4 tracks I didn't already own ended up costing me about 20% of what they would have if I bought them individually.

One really big thing for me being an Aussie is BATHURST! 
It's probably the best most accurate version of the track ever made outside of laser scanning.

RRRE is worth your time.

RRRE is a absolute hidden treasure of a racing sim buried under a unattractive business model and hidden behind terrible loading menus. (i believe soon to be fixed)
Dig beyond, and you will be rewarded, handling, dynamics, visuals, sound. It has it all. Its also beautifully optimized and can run well (and still look great) on older rigs, but when you have the horsepower crank it up for amazing visuals.
This game has continually gotten better and better as the SIMBIN team from the great Race07 continue to work and improve this absolute driving masterpiece.

Do yourself a favour pic up Hockenheim in sunset with some gt3's and just sit back and enjoy.

CARS:The cars are all well done and balanced so that there isnt always a dominate car but at the same time true to the real life behaviors. A great variety of racing cars, from power heavy turbo cars of the 70's and 80's to modern GT3 cars to Leman prototypes. Official series are represented, DTM, GT Masters, WTCC and more coming... feel free to test drive them all, buy what you like.

TRACKS:The tracks are well created from scratch to the point you dont care about laser scanned tracks, even though they are just beginning to utilize laser scan technology into there future tracks. The Sim doesnt allow modding, which from my opinion is a bit redundent since the other sims out there allow it but quality wise dont represent well, leaving you wanting more official quality tracks from the developer. With each track released the detail and quality is maintained, not some hack job addon. 

MULTIPLAYER: One the best online racing experiences and just getting warmed up. Netcode is very good, even when racing some from the US all the way in Germany, they use a p2p connection, so close racing is possible, being able to squeeze between two cars or riding the back bumper of your opponent is amazing. Currently right now its open servers with rotating tracks, hosting a practice, qualifying and then a short sprint race. In a matter of weeks they will release dedicated servers, allowing any choice of car and track along with many of the standard features.

SINGLEPLAYER: Each official series supports the real life formats. If thats not your thing you can create your own championship, picking your own format and track calendar. 

AI: Rated among the best, making a good training tool of racing hard and bumper to bumper, but be aware, be on your A game, otherwise they will punish you. There will be times they run into the back of you but thats usually because you braked too early or took the wrong racing line, so awareness isnt always there top attribute. You can choose a set pace for the AI or choose the adaptive AI and watch there speed grow with you. It isnt perfect but as they move through development, it improves.

SOUNDS: The best, you can ask anyone, even those who race in other sims, all agree RaceRoom has the most immersive detailed sounds currently. They are constantly improving them as well, adding more detail to the car and track ambient. If you dont believe me, check on Youtube and turn up the volume.

GRAPHICS: A very clean and colorful look, with motion blur that actually makes it seem like your going fast. Its improved over the past year and as usual constantly being optimized. The cars definitely fit the tracks in detail, unlike some games where the car or track look better than the other. Partnered with the sounds, its quite the visual experience. Runs well on medium range PC's but does not support SLI or crossfire yet. The game supports different times of day, sunrise to sunset, which looks beatiful across the track.

HARDWARE: They support just about every wheel out there or wheel pedal combinations.
FORCE FEEDBACK: At a glance the ffb features are overwhelming to tune, but there are many guides and user profiles to build off of. Once you have it tuned its quite a unique feeling, driving the heavy turbo cars is a handful and the modern GT3's handle with weight but finesse. They are always working towards improving the ffb and experience. My advice is patience and try out the various tweaks out there.

Final thoughts: This is a great hidden Sim that doesnt get the recognition it deserves. Most people dont believe in the free to play aspect and thats understandable, push that asside and you got something great in your hands. I advise to download and test drive the cars your interested in. Price range isnt too expensive, cheaper than iRacing but like I said its worth the price if you were to buy assetto corsa or Project cars. One thing many people miss is the fact once you buy a official series pack, you own the tracks, you no longer have to purchase them in the other packs, your only paying for the cars. My motto is build the game you want, buy the cars and tracks you like and go from there, once you try them you will want them all. Give it a fair try and enjoy the experience.

With whats ahead content and feature wise, the future is bright, so dont miss out.

Overall I would not recommend this game for a few reasons such as the cost modelling, undeveloped multiplayer and very poor customer support. Such a shame because this game had such promise only to fall flat on its' face.

Pros' - Decent, not great, selection of cars especially packs like DTM and ADAC GT Masters.
         - Industry benchmark for sounds which intensifies the immersion.
         - Very few flaws visually, but not quite to Assetto Corsa / Project Cars standards.
         - Decent selection of tracks with more content on the way.
         -Very few issues I had with wheel connectivity and settings right out of the gate.

Cons' - Cost modelling system similar to IRacing , much cheaper than IRacing but also none of the benefits.
          - Multiplayer leaves something to be desired and they say as much upfront so think of it as early access.
          - Online game only so don't expect to play the game if their servers are down.
          - My biggest con = terrible customer support when things go wrong. To elaborate, approx. 2 weeks ago their main server and content server crashed, the game was unplayable and many like myself had paid content disappear for which i was not reimbursed with the content or given a refund. In fact, as of this writing I have yet to receive a reply to 2 support  / ticket claims and one e-mail.

The physics seem good while providing a challenging driving experience. Although it did take me another day to get my FFB sorted. There really is no explanation for what some of the settings do. (or a short rather canned one)

Once I got my FFB dialed in, the game/sim really started to shine. I use the Logitech G27 with pedals and H-shifter. A wheel really is the preferred way to get the best experience, though I'm sure there are a handful of controller users out there who can rip it up pretty good.

The sounds really are pretty amazing. Especially when you start to drive different cars. Considering I've got 12 hours and 128 laps under my belt in one weekend, its safe to say I'm hooked. 

If the devs can continue in the right direction with development, R3E has a lot of potential to be great! And don't be turned off by paid content until you at least try the free stuff. Other racing sim organizations (not mentioning any names) do the same thing.

=====Update 02/13/2015======

After 1100+ laps and over 2 days of total in game time I can say I'm still hooked. The most recent update Feb 2015 improved the AI and optimized the graphics. Dedicated servers are coming soon. I believe this year which will open up online racing leagues.

I own almost all the cars. All tracks and all packs but the hill climb. Yes a little pricey, but worth it IMO. The devs stay in constant contact with the community which is more than I can say for other games/sims. New tracks and cars are still in the works, the most recent upcoming new track, Sonoma and the Cadillac CTS VR coupe to be released soon as paid content.

I really hope they move into some rally cars and tracks, but what they have so far will keep me busy for months.
Another plus is being able to see the results of real world racers and see how close (or not) you are to their times.

If you don't have the cars/track then you cant race, so your never at an disavantage. 

There is 50+ cars to get, but a pack are better value as you can get tracks and cars. 

PROS:
Other than race using you own purchased tracks and cars, RaceRoom has these two great features;

* Practice in any car.  Seen a car you like, give it spin for free.  Same track each time, so you can get a really good feel for the car.

* Race Room Competitions.   These are free and you don't need to have purchased the tracks and cars. You compete time trails against other players and your ghost car and you are ranked in a league.  

CONS:  

* Mainly a single player experience at the moment . Muliplayer is good but still in alpha.

* DO NOT BUY ANY DLC FROM STEAM. 
Instead buy content from the game portal, which is connected to your steam account.
They have sales and at the moment you can get DTM 13 for £6.20.  It will also give you a small volume discount and if you buy a pack which has tracks and cars that you already own, then you get a futher discount.  For example I have DTM 13, so DTM 14 is £9.20.  

I'm making the jump from from arcade to sim racing and this is much more user friendly and cheper than iracing and even Assetto Corsa.

I am rather surprised to say that it is genuinely superb and I always come away from Raceroom satified and my racing thirst quenched.

Genre-defining sounds (Really, they are the best sounds on any sim, anywhere), Genre-defining AI (again, really. Blows Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 AI out of the water), Pleasant visuals, Intuitive handling, cracking FFB. Can't fault any of that.

I see some complain about the pricing of the addons. It's pretty reasonable, especially when compared to the liked of iRacing. Yesterday evening I purchased the DTM 1992 pack of cars and the European track pack. That's 5 very high quality, different vehicles with different strengths and 14 european circuits. I paid under £15 for this (admittedly with some discounts from prior purchases). This little lot would set you back right around the £100 mark, if not more on iRacing. Just throwing that out there.

Added to that you can try any car for free before you buy......

I think its problem is it gets lost in a sea of racing titles but this really is up there with the best.

You can download the base content for free which again is fantastic and there are add-ons which are sometimes on sale. Another great feature is leaderboard challenges where they give away prizes for the fastest times. A great addition to this is a lot of the time you dont need to have purchased the content to take part so you can try these before you buy.

Where this game is let down is by a few minor bugs but mainly its so unpopulated online its really a shame and can be tough to get decent races but i think that comes down to the lack of publicity it has had.

The multiplayer is shaping up to be great, but in its current Alpha state it's not quite there yet. If you're on the fence, try the free content first and if you're looking to spend a few bucks, consider either DTM '92, ADAC GT Masters 2013 or 14, or the WTCC '13 pack. Money well spent.
Look below the review for a comprehensive list of Pro's and Con's after the verdict.

[b]Visually[/b] R3E is a competitive title, on par with Assetto Corsa. Track textures and detail are what you expect them to be in a 2014 racing sim. Everything looks quite sharp and well detailed. Car interiors are nicely modelled as well, leaving only very few wishes to be desired. A few upcoming titles might look a bit better, but we'll see to those as they get released. 
Ligthing, color and saturation in R3E seem very life-like and real. Lighting conditions can be selected from one of 5 presets: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Evening and Sunset, with full real-time transitions coming later down the road.

In the [b]Sound[/b] department, R3E really starts to shine. Or roar.
Compared to other simulation titles like Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor2, the cars and engines in R3E sound like they have the punch they claim to have. The sound has just the right amount of reverb to immerse you and make you think you are sitting in fact inside of the car you are pretending to be driving at your PC.

On the [b]driving[/b] side of thins, there is a lot of good to report as well: The physics feel similiar to other hardcore racing sims like rF2 or GSCE. It becomes immediately apparent whenever you push the car too hard, resulting in oversteer and overshooting a corner or massive oversteer and spinning out - or if you are lucky - just a major slide of the ideal racing line. 
The game does communicate what is going on under your car really well through the [b]Force Feedback[/b]. With a little practice you can judge pretty well just by feel if you are about to lose the rear of the car, or whether your rear tyres have just locked up. This is really important in a racing sim, and in this regard R3E is comparable to Assetto Corsa and Game StockCar Extreme, but still a little off from rFactor2. To be fair, the FFB in rF2 is unmatched by any other sim.

If you're not up for racing against other people over the internet, R3E's AI will give you a good challenge. They can be either set to a fixed difficulty level (from 80 to 120%) or alternatively to Adaptive AI, which will ramp up or soften the difficulty depending on how well you do against the AI. In general, Adaptive AI is pretty good at giving you just the right challenge. You have to work really hard for a Victory, but at the same time the AI don't leave you in the dust and you always have some other cars to race against.
In their general behaviour the AI race hard against you, but fair. They don't bump you out of the way, but they will use gaps to overtake. They will defend their position with defensive lines and not just stick to a single racing line. (I'm looking at you there, Gran Turismo.) In comparision to Assetto Corsa, the AI in R3E is more aggressive, but still fair. 
Unfortunately the game is missing an AI agression control, like rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme have. I'd like to tweak the AI not just in skill, but also in agression.

Now, some time for [b]Multiplayer![/b] There are no dedicated servers available yet, so you have to hope that your favorite track/car combination is currently running on a server hosted by Sector3 studios. The servers are ""jump in and drive"", meaning that if you don't pay attention you might end on a server that has just finished Qualifying and you start a race from the back of the grid. Netcode in Multiplayer is really solid. No cars warping around, no bullshit contacts and bumps between cars that are 2 meters apart on screen. The community is okay, you get the occasional idiot who wrecks half the field and other people rage quit whenever they lose too many positions for their tastes, but additional features like ranking systems and wrecker bans are on the horizon for the Multiplayer, as well as Dedicated Servers for everyone.

Now for the most controversial part about this simulator: [b]The Store & The Pricing[/b]: Out of the box you have access to two circuit tracks, a hillclimb track and a bunch of cars from different classes. In my opinion that's decent content for a free portion of a game. Some people might disagree, but everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess.

Tracks and Cars can be bought with [i]Virtual Race Points[/i] or [i]vRP[/i], and after the latest update with hard earned cash directly. This alleviates my previous criticism about having to essentially give Sector3 free money in exchange for virtual currency.
Prices are not that cheap, but they are reasonable. A new car or track will generally set you back 2€ to 4€. You can get bigger discounts if you buy more stuff in bulk, or if you get stuff in packs: The DTM '92 pack with it's 5 cars and a ton of liveries is  ~10€ compared to ~18€ when you buy them all individually.
Additional discounts are granted to everyone who owns cars and tracks of a new pack: For example, I get a huge discount on ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack, because I already own most of the tracks and cars in R3E already. I think that's a fair system.

There is an option to [b]Test Drive[/b] all the cars on the RaceRoom Raceway that is included in the game. You can also take part in the free competitions that are changing regularly. Those competitions feature a rotating set of cars and tracks. You don't have to own them to drive them, and if you're fast you might even win a prize!

Recommendations for your first purchase(s): 
* DTM '92 pack (5 cars with a lot of liveries)
* DTM Experience 2013 (3 cars, ton of liveries, 9 tracks)
* WTCC 2013 pack (5 cars, ton of liveries, 3 tracks)
* ADAC GT Masters 2013 (7 cars, ton of liveries, 6 tracks)

[b]Verdict[/b]: If you have tried this sim half a year ago, please do come back and try it again! The driving physics and Force Feedback have been vastly improved, along with the new and fairer store pricing & discount system. R3E drives just as well as Assetto Corsa, rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme. It has the best single player AI on the market, apart from GSCE and the largest selection of content (sans Modding) of the currently availlable sims.

[b]Pro's[/b]

* Good driving physics and FFB

Get off the Free 2 Play Train and create another Retail Title, which offers a Complete Package and does not force the Player to be always Online and registered on your Website... it kind of ruined the Immersion for me.

This game has one of the best netcodes I have ever seen in a racing game. Racing online feels almost like racing offline against real people, no lag, no warping and no strange collision clipping... with 24 drivers.  Of course this is only true if everybody has a decent internet connection. Even the best netcodes can't fix slow/broken internet :p

Even with only the free content it's a lot of fun but the game encourages you to buy more. The price of the content is okay, not too expensive but not cheap too. Tracks and cars are on sale from time to time and now with the addition of content packs you could get some bargains.

RR > RACE 07 - graphics is better, but that wasn't hard to achieve after 5 years.

RACE 07 > RR  - everything else. 

I won't write why F2P model sucks. No. There are other things which completely ruin experience, too.

Menu design is super ugly, terrible, broken and confusing. Big wheel design is super idiotic console  thing. What this s.it is doing in pure PC game is beyond reason. It's one of the worst menu designs I ever saw! And my eyes are hurt every time I have to navigate in menu because of terrible font rendering. And then, game doesn't see my gamepad. Really? It works perfectly fine in RACE 07. Contoller setup is poorer from 07, too. I can't drive properly because of lack of many options from 07.

Game has ALWAYS ONLINE DRM!!!  

NOT RECOMMENDED!!!

Update
I tried it first time after February because of sale. Gamepad now works. Still super ugly and confusing menus. Auto-shifting is broken - it goes up auto, but you have to manually shift down. Still only time trials.

Update II 5th July, 2014.
Sound is the best among racing simulations! It's just oustanding.

They introduced Competitions which is great way to experience content you don't own and if you are excellent driver, you can win various things. Kudos for that.

I installed game again because there is 50% summer sale, and Simbin sent month ago some free vRPs (I got 800) mostly for people who don't play it anymore. 

Now some bad things. You need to drive PERFECTLY in time trials! You read it right. Even if you slightly hit off road and I mean you didn't cut curve, your lap time is invalid! Ha ha ha, NO! Solution - drive as amateur in Leaderboard Challenge, then it's like old RACE 07.

And then, there is a bug (reported by others) which put my PC into hibernation and then just restart it. WTF?!",1359712820,1404565840,False,8,0,0.515677809715270996,0,True,False,False

Update

I bought the DTM Experience DLC and i love it, best touring car game i have played since TOCA days. Racing is competitive and challengine, tracks are great and physics are good.

The sounds are great too, and the physics are great, but it's missing the most essential element: Multiplayer.

On this basis alone I cannot recommend this game, you can only do time trials so many times and for so long. Another big reason why I won't recommend this game is because, although this game is free to play, the micro transaction system is too expensive. I have done the math and nothing is worth paying that amount of money for, you even have to pay for the realism mode, I mean, who does that on a supposed racing sim?

The free stuff is not enough to keep you going for more than a few hours, there just isn't enough free content to even make this a viable free to play option.

Also, the big attraction to Race 07 and other titles are all the mods you can get, this game does not support modding, so it seems, and you have to pay for everything you want, this I'm sure has detered many previous Sim Bin fans.

If Sim Bin are prepared to drop the prices on all their tracks and cars, and introduce multiplayer, or at least bot cars, then I will consider reviewing my recommendation.

Edit: Even on 50% Easter sale on all cars and tracks, I decided it wasn't worth it. Perhaps if Sim Bin put a 50% discount on the DTM experience, then I may just buy that, as the DTM Experience opens the Beta multiplayer  mode.",1392826809,1397658672,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
